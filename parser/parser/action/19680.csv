												hi! this review mainly serves to inform buyers about the differences between the PC version of this game, and the console version which it is a port version of.i have played both PC and console (PS3) versions of the game. i played the PS3 version at launch and PC version this year.PC Pros:+ ALICE supports graphics enhancing injectors such as SweetFX, so if you are comfortable using this type of program and have the specs for it, you can have a higher graphical quality experience than is at all possibly attainable on the PS3 (and despite the slightly outdated graphics, this is still an awesome game from an aesthetic perspective!)+ if your hobby is sceenshotting games, or even recording gameplay videos, it's probably a no-brainer due to this that you would want a PC copy of ALICE simply because it's a lot more convenient and doesn't rely on the preset specs of a clunky console.+ if you don't mind adding some quick lines of code (see comments for how) to the config files of the game (which you can do with any txt-type word processor) this will also unlock many preset outfits for Alice to wear as alternates to her story-mode outfits, and these come with interesting buffs and debuffs (for harder and easier mode play)+ in general: the emotiveness, clever dialogue and creativity of the entire game is ever-present, and both the combat and noncombat scenarios are often blissfully relaxing as they are at other times a trifle vexing.PC Cons:- the game was supposed to come with a ""bonus"" hidden file containing the original American McGee's Alice game in addition to ALICE MADNESS... unfortunately, most copies of the game don't, and this apparently includes both origin & steam digital versions. a physical copy of the game called ""complete collection"" is the only way to get the 1st game bundled with this one (thanks @groen90)- unfortunately this game is licensed to Electronic Arts, which means it comes with a ton of awkward and invasive DRM, including the requirement to make an EA/ Origin account. i had no problem registering for this but nobody likes DRM, and nobody likes EA.- there is an UNPATCHED and potentially GAMEBREAKING bug relating to the 'Umbrella' weapon that some, but not all, players will encounter with the PC version. this bug is usually caused by remapping the keybindings from default to *anything else* but if you are prepared to deal with it, you CAN fix the bug and play with custom binds (which i do)this bug has been around for 4+ years and never fixed by EA, so if you plan to buy this game then *PLEASE* be prepared to deal with it as it may occur around the 20~60 minutes of play mark depending on how fast you go through the game world.there are many fixes for this bug, but it will require you to rewrite some lines of code in the .cfg files and do a bit of gametesting (it happened to me, but with help from the internet it was self-fixed and i have been playing with no errors ever since)i don't remember this bug being existent on the PS3 version of Alice. i do love this game, but hopefully these things will help you make your mind up. review may be addended later to be more concise~			"

												I like how the developers took a more ""animated"" style for this (though some may not). The colors in the backgrounds and scenery can range from absolutely breath-taking, to horrifically morbid (in a good way). The character and level design is also very unique and while somewhat cartoonish, this only helps serve the purpose of resulting in a very creative and imaginative piece of art.Now, despite it's beauty, the game is also filled to the brim with what we all want: violence! It pretty much is a ""hack-n-slash,"" type game, however there are also plenty of power-ups and abilities that can be used to ""spice things up"" a bit.Platforming feels solid. Double jumping not only looks beautiful with a cool graphical flourish but the ""float"" ability that allows you to glide and string multiple double jumps together is useful and cool to look at. The fighting is also done really well. I like dedicated melee and ranged buttons that allow the combat to flow seamlessly instead of constantly switching weapons back & forth as the situation and enemies demand a major improvement over the first. Theres also a dodge/dash ability that's both very useful and is awesome to look at. Locking on to enemies to and being able to change to another target during battle is very useful.The environments were stunning, from a beautiful forest, to menacing castle, and even the streets of London! Most games stick to one theme, such as being dark and scary to the end, or bright and happy, etc. Alice: MR had instances of gorgeous and serene, contrasting to the dark and ominous. They were the things of a beautiful, daydreaming nightmare!If your idea of a good game is one that involves stultifying realism, empty action, and hollywood cliches then odds are that you will not like this game. If your tastes go beyond that to the appreciation of literature, art, and above all imagination then this game should prove to be quite satisfactory.			"

												Short Version:Pros:+ Beautiful art design+ Interesting story+Controlling Alice feels great+Combat stays fresh for most of the game+ Enemies' design is amazing+ Voice acting is mostly good throughout the game+ Tons of collectibles+ Cool weapons+ Great soundtrack+ Weapon upgradesCons:- Repetitive puzzles- Stale platforming- Annoying camera- Level design is as linear as linear gets- Tons of invisible walls- Some game breaking bugs - Getting stuck, getting knocked down and never getting up again (which means you will not die and have to restart)- Impressively boring if played for more than 20/30 minutes (longer periods of play)- The absence of the original's weapons still haunts me (Deck of Cards, Jacks, Demon Dice, etc.)""Long"" Version:When you start playing ""Alice Madness Returns"", it is quite evident that its art design is unique and downright beautiful. Personally, I think this game is already worth checking out at least once just for its art direction. It starts out with beautiful, calm and bright landscapes - which are really colorful and highly detailed; once ♥♥♥♥ starts hitting the fan, that beautiful Wonderland turns into something ghastly, corrupted and quite disturbing - the catch is, it's equally appealing. As stated, eye-candy is abundant from start to finish and you will have many opportunities to catch your breath and take some beautiful screenshots.Platforming is a big part of ""Alice Madness Returns"" and it seems it gets worse as the game goes on. The problem is that one can only pull so many levers before getting bored. The level design plays a vital role here; it is extremely linear and you are pretty much getting from point A to point B with little to no side objectives - collectibles alleviate this by making you go off your main path; unfortunately, by the end of the game, you will most likely find yourself ignoring some (if not most) of them, since they required YET another lever and a couple more jumps and floats.Story-wise, this game shines. The story is nothing to write home about but it does a decent enough job of making you wanting to keep playing - I guess it ends quite abruptly but still, it's good in my opinion. It manages to keep you invested in Alice's ""quest"" and the use of ""Alice in Wonderland""'s characters was refreshing (even though the first game did it better).Voice acting is, as said, really good. You meet your fair share of looney characters with high pitched voices and your dark enemies have intimidating voices and sound effects. The soundtrack is great. I think it is the kind of soundtrack I would buy if it was available. Weapon sounds also feels great as you cut enemies in halt and fill their ♥♥♥♥'s with (peppered) lead.Combat stays fresh for most of the game. Enemies require different strategies to be defeated and later on there are multiple types of enemies at the same time which requires you to adapt accordingly to the enemies weaknesses.You have 4 weapons (or 5 if you count the umbrella) at your disposal and, even though I wanted more weapons, including some from the original game, they are enough to keep the combat engaging. Being able to upgrade them with Teeth (in-game currency) is also a bonus since you can turn your fluffy looking Hobby Horse into a full-fledged fire breathing stallion of punishment and death or your traditional Pepper Grinder into a.... full-fledged fire breathing... cooking..... tool.... ..... of punishment and death.However, the camera tends to flip out during combat and changing targets is a shore, usually costing you a chunk of your health.Invisible walls are everywhere, some small holes and gaps where Alice could easily fit in are regarded as impossible to cross and, considering the game is ""quite"" recent, it is something I found both annoying and disappointing. They are everywhere.I made a mistake while playing this game. I thought ""I am going to play this for 2 or 3 hours"" and let me tell you that it is something I sincerely do not recommend you to do.Most levels go like this: Jump, jump, jump and float; pull a lever/switch; more platforms show up; you can jump some more just to pull yet another lever; once you reach a bigger platform, you will have a battle; once you finish off all the enemies, more platforms show up. You then put a Bomb on a pressure pad so the platforms don't disappear and make your way to the other side well before the bomb detonates; then you will jump some more and pull some more levers... Sounds repetitive? That's because it is! I believe, after the first 2 hours or, let's say, 2/3 levels, this game gets on your nerves fairly quickly. I recommend it in short bursts.But still, this may sound bad and all but Alice moves so effortlessly that the platforming sections feel graceful. It feels great even though it eventually gets boring.Some other bugs break the experience a little bit. One example is when you jump on a mushroom (it acts like a trampoline), you can only move again once Alice reaches the top of her ascension and starts falling down again; if you were pressing forward when you were going up, you will need to press it again after Alice starts descending so she moves forward - have fun dying because of it, since you will find yourself wasting extra jumps in the air while standing still.For me, ""Alice Madness Returns"" is a big disappointment, yet, I can't bring myself to hate it.Here's the thing: I wanted to like this game. Unfortunately, I found myself getting frustrated and bored for a big chunk of its 14 or so hours of story.Is it worth buying? Not for 10 €. I would suggest 75% off, considering the game's age. But still, if you like engaging stories and value art design in video games, 5 € should be ok as well. It is a game everyone should experience at least once!As far as replay value goes... I think you will only be playing this once.This game had so much potential. It could have been something as epic as ""Batman: Arkham City"". That's what makes me sad.Score: 6.5 out of 10.			"

												When American McGee's Alice[en.wikipedia.org] came out in 2000, it was one of many shots in the arm that gaming received back then (the original Half-Life and Deus Ex to name a couple), showcasing the idea that videogames could aim for higher and higher levels of creativity and ambition. The mythology of Alice, Lewis Carroll's inquisitive young heroine thrust into a psychedelic kaleidoscope of strange yet unsettlingly familiar characters, has changed hands and changed costumes many, many times since Carroll penned Alice's Adventures In Wonderland[en.wikipedia.org] and Through The Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There[en.wikipedia.org] at the end of the 19th century. I personally love the original story and that's pretty much where my head first goes when Alice is mentioned. I don't think the gentle whimsy of Carroll's writing can ever be matched when it comes to the denizens and riddles of Wonderland. But even the malevolent nonsense of the poem ""Jabberwocky""[www.jabberwocky.com], for example, never saw anything like American McGee's vision of Wonderland. The original game took many of the story's elements and twisted them up in fantastically demented ways and delivered the New and Improved Alice to us with flashy, blistering combat and a dark tone that was most certainly a product and an extension of the 1990s with their Hot Topic meets The Crow meets The Matrix mélange of gothy, trendy edginess. I'm not knocking that (okay, I am a little) because God knows I was cheerfully invested in it myself back then, but it is what it is. So, with that out of the way, enter Alice: Madness Returns.I can't really talk about the story too much without spoiling anything, but this isn't really a spoiler if you happened to notice the actual title of the game, so let's just say our gal Alice is, in fact, nuts. Insane in the membrane. Mad, you could say. And as she winds her way alternately through a dirty, dark London skid-row and a troubled, hurriedly collapsing Wonderland on a quest to solve a mystery and save her sanity, it becomes obvious, like in the first game, that as bonkers as she is, there are crazier -- and scarier -- things about, oh yes. Which is of course the main draw of a game like this. How bizarre can we get? Well, let's see. There's steampunk taxidermy gone horribly wrong, various ill-thought ways to use baby dollheads, an impressively grotesque and bloody take on The Walrus and The Carpenter, an entire level that feels like the drug-addled fever dream of M.C. Escher and Wes Craven locked in some padded cell together, and I think you even walk through a giant mouth at one point. And not in a Disneyland kind of way. Concerning the neverending search for weird ♥♥♥♥, Alice delivers whole-heartedly. (Imagine me saying that while holding a pink, veiny, pulsing heart while twitching and grinning insanely.)As spectacle, it satisfies. I loved the originality of the levels and the many, many weirdnesses it serves up. I won't say anything about the story because, no real way around it, it does take a second place to the gameworld, the atmosphere, and the characters, but it doesn't help that it's really not all that great to begin with. It doesn't do anything necessarily wrong, and the voice acting is pretty good (especially Alice's), but it doesn't really do anything amazingly right, either. It's pretty much what you'd expect if you've played the previous installment. Disappointing, a bit, but whatever. Again, the story can be excused for taking a backseat to the visuals just because of the game that it is.Combat and gameplay... oh boy. Good points: melee feels GREAT. I want a Vorpal Blade in real life. I never got tired of dancing and blitzing that blade through the air. It's great fun. Other weapons are good too, in varying degrees, but sending Alice dodging through enemy attacks to be able to slash viciously back at them and then dodging away, in a beautifully animated burst of indigo butterflies, never ever gets old. Ranged combat? Not... so... great. Irritating controls requiring quick-switching targeting modes that also partially disable your camera make for some very frustrating battles, especially ones involving tons of airborne and ground enemies at once. No, sir, I do not like it.But then again, the Vorpal Blade is really, really sweet. So it's a mixed bag. And that honestly sums up my overall feelings on the game because while, like I already said, the levels are visually fantastic and new, the levels are also INCREDIBLY long and drawn-out. I mean, I like getting a lot of game for my money, but there's a point where you can almost hear the devs running out of ideas for a certain level or world and sad to say the game just sails right past that point into exasperated tedium. But that's me. Your mileage may vary, and very possibly will.In the end, this has everything you'd expect from a concerted effort to take your childhood and turn it inside-out and sideways and then tell you to kill it and smash it and blow it to shreds. As Alice herself might say, ""Curiouser and curiouser! And completely covered in blood."" "

												HOW TO FIX GAME CODE:Pretty simple install the game and when it pops up the code you need copy it, go to ea.comClick on my account and sign into it (this would be your origin login or whatever, or if you need create an account.)Click on the tab redeem code, and paste the code you copied from steam. Should activate.Then go back to steam launch the game log into your EA account and your off to playI've had this game on xbox 360 but picked it up during a sale, super fun 3rd person game, love the art style and the gameplay, overwall recommend the game. Also the game has a 30 fps cap, but with a quick INI file change you can unlock the framerate. Hope I helped!			"

												A beautiful game. I truly mean every word when I say: Every environment is stylized, enchanting, made of peculiar objects born within Alice's mind. It makes truly amazing and unique landscapes. The enemies too are very well done.The music is amazing too, many songs I will remember.It has flaws, the combat, while fairly fun, is simple, there are few combos, you can change between your melee weapons while hitting, so it's nothing disastrous, it's fairly solid, but it does get repetitive. The game is also plagued with random minigame segments. Thanks to EA pushing the studio for early release.Still, the game is amazing, the story is one of the most ballsy a game could have. It is one of my favorites. Get this small masterpiece.			"

												The overall quality of Alice: Madness Returns is high, despite it feeling rushed. The qualities that made American McGee's Alice so enjoyable-the gory hack-'n'-slash combat, the gorgeous design, the rich dialogue, the menacing mood-are present and abundant.Alice: Madness Returns is a dream come true for fans of American McGee's Alice. It's a worthy heir and at the same time a fully modern game that can vie with the best contemporary representatives of this genre. It's long, it's difficult, it's rewarding and enchanting.Alice: Madness Returns is a wolf in sheep's clothing. This game may look honest and cute, but it's cruel and bloody.Alice: Madness Returns may not win awards for genre innovation, but it's the most darkly fun and gloriously batty game I've played.It's not perfect, but it's as close to the definition of masterpiece as it could be. A thrilling and exciting adventure to the dark corners of Wonderland.			"

												A frantic third person action game featuring a darker version of Lewis Carrol's Alice. Or maybe it was already dark enough until disney molested the ♥♥♥♥ out of it because you know, for kids. The sequel picks up years after the original where Alice is a grown woman now, having defeated the madness that plagued her mind. Or so it seems. Wherever it lacks in variety and innovation, it makes up with numerous gorgeous places to explore, bizzare characters and enemies to meet, and a captivating story that unfolds itself through Alice's madness in the most beautiful and sinister way at the same time. American McGee did it again just like he did with the original game over a decade ago. A must for the fans of the original; newcomers, tread carefully.7/8			"

I found an interesting little forced login screen, well thankfully I already had an EA login so I logged in it asked for a product code I put in a product code, the same one I have always had since I purchased this game, to my wonderous surprise the code was rejected.Its a splendidly Mad World when companies like EA can steal products you owned for years out from under you. Don't buy this game stay away from EA get refunds if you canedit-I was able to get it working by signing on to my origin and activating the code there.that besing said others are nto so fortunate, and the fact of the matter is I should not have to jump through this many hoops to play a game I have owned for a long while and have not had to do this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on.For those that can get it working yes I would recommend this game its a fun and beautiful game dripping with artistic style, but for those unfortunate to be stuck up a creek without a paddle refund it			"

Alice: Madness Returns ReviewGame DetailsPublished by: Electronic ArtsDeveloped by: Spicy HorseGenre: Action/AdventureRelease Date: 17 Jun, 2011Metacritic Score: 75 (Link[www.metacritic.com])Game Review""I'm not insane! I didn't kill my family. I am fine. I'm not mad, I'm innocent - I mean, not guilty!"" - AliceWhat a little gem this is. In Alice: Madness Returns you control Alice Liddell, a girl who suffers from an emotional trauma caused by the death of her parents. To get rid of the trauma and learn the truth of her past, she once falls again into Wonderland, where a new evil force has corrupted it.The strongest attribute of this game is Wonderland itself. This creepy and dark vision of Wonderland is beautifully recreated in this game. The art design in it is top notch, and graphical wise it does it job well, even though there are some places here and there with some ugly textures. As you progress the game you will get to new areas of Wonderland, each one of it with its art style, which makes it feel less repetitive. Menus are also slick, easy to navigate, a negative being that in video menu you have almost no options of configuring the game graphically, you have to do your tweaks through the config file unfortunately.Sound is also pretty good, nothing mind blowing, but it does its job well enough. The voice acting its great as the soundtrack, but the second one can get repetitive very often.Gameplay wise, which its the most important factor in a game to me, is where this game falls a little flat. Controls are great, smooth and easy to use (I used a ps3 controller[/b]). Length is also a strong point in this game. Its not huge, but it is almost the perfect length to keep you interested during the game, with tons of collectibles to catch and areas to find. I spent about 12 hours to complete it and did not get all the collectibles, only about an half of them. You also have a neat diversity of weapons which make the combat more fun.Now to the negative things in the gameplay. The worse part its that the game gets very repetitive because it does not evolve much from the start. At some point, you will get to do the same tasks all over again till the end which makes the game a bit boring sometimes. Also the puzzles and other tasks to change the pace of the game are not very fun. Even less fun when they also start to get repetitive.The combat is very fluid and responsive, fast paced as well with a good variety of horrendous enemies to confront, but once you master it it becomes very easy.Acrobatics are also well done, which makes the navigation in Wonderland very smooth though jumps (even double-jumps and triple-jumps), floating and shrinking.The story is also one of the strongest attributes of the game, being amazing. Its full of interesting characters, riddles and surprising reveals.Game performance is pretty good, I played it on a laptop and only had 4 or 5 fps drops through the game. Its locked at 30 fps, but you can easily change that in the config files.Summary:Pros: - Beautiful dark version of Wonderland- Top notch art style- Smooth and easy to use controls- Great length- Amazing storyCons: - Tedious gameplay and puzzles- Steam version does not come bundled with the original game ""America McGee's Alice""My personal score:  8.0If you love action/adventure and platform games play this gem, there arent many platform games on steam, so if you are into that genre this is a good bet. The awesome story and setting of this game will make you forget about the boring gameplay, and you will have an amazing experience for a game that gets very cheap in steam sales (I got it for 2.50 euro if I am not mistaken).

												TLDR: Game is beautiful, story is intresting and atmospheric, but gameplay streches too long and some parts will be boring and monotone - game is often on sale, a -75% usual one is GREAT to pick the game up. Don't bother with full price, I don't think it's worth it.According to Steam I've played this for the whopping amount of 36.9 hours - ingame timer says 16 hours, 91% completion.About this game: picked up a copy for a friend to return a friendly gesture and at the same time I bought it for myself, because I was really intrested in it (Alice + implementation of madness? Yes please, I'm in!)The game starts out wonderful. You'll keep making screenshots - the game world is really nicely designed and well-executed, some landscapes are jaw-dropping both in terms of quality and creativity.Platforming works great, there are no issues with controls - but after a time it can be boring, because most chapters (5 looong chapters, all in 1-2 different settings than the others) use quite the same mechanics/ideas as precious ones, only re-skinned.Combat is both lacking and feels rewarding. Why?  Personally I really miss combos and airbone attacks. Maybe I'm too new for the third-person platformers, but I think while combat plays a really central part in the gameplay, it could have been much better.  And why is it still great? You have 4 weapons - basically a light and heavy variant of melee and ranged. As most things, the weapons look astonishingly good, with real nice sound - and visual effects. But the biggest and best thing of combat system is the really different enemies. They all work in their own way - one is easy to take on with the pepper-grinder (machine gun), the other one's weakness is the heavy Hobby Horse's armor-breaking hits. Each enemy, and especially their mixed groups require different tactics to defeat them.  It's a little shame that by the time you finish a chapter, most likely you'll be bored of the enemies - the first Samurai Wasp is challenging, the third is an intresting enemy, but you'll stomp on the 8th one. Not to mention the 20th one. Level design: Gorgeous. In chapter 2? you'll go into a snowy landscape, to end up in a ship-in-a-bottle, only to get it sunk then continue your journey underwater. Another chapter is all about Japan and the East - koi pond, china-landscape, traditional fans.  Chapter 4 and 5 are just incredible and maybe the best ones from the game, both in terms of gameplay and design. If only chapter 2 and 3 would be similarly good.Though there is one thing that can put a dent on the experience: invisible walls everywhere. You can't touch most of the walls because you'll stop running ~ 30 cm before them, you can't jump on most things because pleasantly placed invisible ~2-3 metre tall ""boxes"" are placed on them because you only can jump on something you're *supposed* to jump on. It's a shame in a game from 2011.Minigames! There are various minigames/ tasks in the game you need to complete to continue: chess puzzle, sliding blocks puzzle, shoot 'em up game, sidescrolling platformer, guitar-hero like small puzzles.. I haven't expected this much variation, it's a really strong positive of the game. Collectibles: Collecting memories gives you a small quote (1-2 sentence) from a specific character of the story that deepens the main story. Even though they are quite conveniently placed and easy to find/get most of them, this makes collecting them really rewarding.  Game lacks backtracing at several points of the game, making impossible to get the stuff at the other side of the crossroads if you took the correct one  - without chapter selection. What a pity.Afterall, all I can do is to recommend this game. It has several really strong aspects, while the weakest points aren't worse than ""average"".   Previously I thought it's a silly suggestion, but *Good Guy Nick* is right - playing the game for more than an hour can induce a strong feeling if monotonicity. I feel like most chapters should be 10-20% shorter, because while there are enough action, jumping and fighting to fill the gametime, there is not that much ""soul"" in the game to keep the gamer playing for longer periods.  At the end, it was a nice - after how bad is EA's reputation in recent times, it was refreshing and pleasantly surprising to see a really creative and daring game under their name.			"

spine-tingling music, good combat and platformer elements, witty, creepy, and in general fun to play. I've got a boat load of time logged on the game, granted, I believe a decent amount is on pause... >.>... but that's between you and I; However, it really is a fun game that you can lose yourself in. The boss fights are very spiffy, can be challenging (which is a bonus IMO), and the pace of the game is good. Little to no learning curve, you just hop right in and start killing things. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=250991152Combat throughout the game changes as you get new weapons, so there's a bit of variety as the game progesses. Also, get your screenshot trigger finger ready, because there's plenty of awesome stuff to snap pics of while you're playing!If you haven't, consider playing the original game as well. American McGee & Spicy Horse did a kickass job on both games, and they're both definitely worth having in your arsenal of games. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=252748888Solid 9/10.

												If you want this game because you think it's a cutesy little Alice in Wonderland game, then don't buy this game. If you want it because you want to play as a crazed lunatic who battles the demons in her head in a last ditch attempt to safe herself from insanity, and recover the truth about the death of her parents, then get a move on and get it, because it is frickin' brilliant.American Mcgee's twisted art style is just perfect for this game, and whilst some people might start finding the gameplay a little tedious towards the end, I think the combat is very well done, and the world surrounding you should make you want to carry on and see what other crazy things are gonna happen. As well as the art you've got a bunch of collectibles to find, like bottles, memories and flying pig snouts. (Literally). Alice also has the ability to shrink herself, revealing platforms and passages, which is downright awesome. It's games like this that make the real world seem pointless.			"

												Since it's on sale at the moment (Steam Summer Sale 2014), I figured I'd write a quick review. Alice: Madness Returns is a solid game. Stunning and imaginative scenery, spine-tingling music, good combat and platformer elements, witty, creepy, and in general fun to play. I've got a boat load of time logged on the game, granted, I believe a decent amount is on pause... >.>... but that's between you and I; However, it really is a fun game that you can lose yourself in. The boss fights are very spiffy, can be challenging (which is a bonus IMO), and the pace of the game is good. Little to no learning curve, you just hop right in and start killing things. Combat throughout the game changes as you get new weapons, so there's a bit of variety as the game progesses. Also, get your screenshot trigger finger ready, because there's plenty of awesome stuff to snap pics of while you're playing!If you haven't, consider playing the original game as well. American McGee & Spicy Horse did a kickass job on both games, and they're both definitely worth having in your arsenal of games. Solid 9/10. One of my faves. Just a unique game everybody should try at least once.			"

												I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time. And every creature lends themselves to change your state of mind...I finished this game about a week ago and for an old game it's pretty damn good tbh. Alice's past is pretty harsh and she dwells on it all the time thus her wonderland is falling apart.. again. And she must go into the depths of her mind to find the problem that's scratching at her sanity and execute it.I absolutely loved the scenery and artwork of this game the most. The levels were not too long but not too short either. And each chapter has so many secret rooms and hidden items. The storyline could have been a bit more compelling but it was still pretty good imo. It does have some decent plot twists. The game definitely has a pretty creepy feel to it and the enemies seem like something out of a horror movie as well. Some enemies can be very frustrating at first but once you get a good system on how to kill them then it's not so bad. The puzzles in the game were definitely a wide variety of fun, like how they should be in most games. They weren't too easy and they weren't so hard and/or confusing that it would just ♥♥♥♥ you off. One of my favorite aspects of the game were the weapons. Which you can also upgrade the weapons over time by collecting teeth. The characters in the game were just awesome. Ofc you have the ones you know like Mad Hatter, The Queen, Chester Cat, etc. The voice acting was spot on to the character's personalities as well and very good facial expressions.Another thing I thought was a really nice touch, was Alice's outfits. Each chapter she would change into a different dress and they would match the scenery of the current level. Also. I would eat Alice's green eyes. Even though I have green eyes myself, but... I just like her eyeballs. ಠ_ಠ The only complaint I really have about the game is that it can be a bit buggy. Sometimes when you kill an enemy it might move about like it's still kickin, but the game is just being derpy and the enemy will just disappear eventually. The only bug I had a real issue with (and others had issues on it too) was on one level, Chester Cat is suppose to appear and say something but he didn't. But it was an easy fix of just restarting the chapter again and it wasn't too far into the chapter either. But keep in mind that the game is just old.Overall, I highly recommend this game. I just didn't want to stop playing it honestly. And sometimes I find myself going back to the game and playing through a level or so. Still haven't found all the secrets and missing items though. Pros: -Amazing artwork and decent graphics for how old the game is.-The characters aren't dull-Not too easy and not too hard either. Everything in this game is pretty much a good balance-There is a lot more to do in this game than just hacking and slashing, defeating bosses/waves of enemies, and cut scenes.Cons:-Can be a little buggy at times-The story could have been a *little* more compelling			"

												Dear Alice,I find you dark and beautiful. You took me to place that I've never seen before and yet were hauntingly familiar. Introduced me to friends that I could have sworn I had met, and yet were different and twisted. Ours could have been a love affair for the ages. Now, four years after we should have met, I've followed you down the dark and twisting road of your past. I fell in love with you at first sight. You told me the horrific story of your past and for a time I sat raptured. I have so many good things to say about you. You're smart and graceful. Your movement is like a gazelle. You showed me places M.C. Escher would be proud to call his own. And yet, and yet.The truth is Alice, you don't know when to leave. I wanted to hear your story. I wanted to visit all the dark places that you promised me that we would go. I have to admit that you delivered on your promises. Each place we went was more interesting, darker, and haunting then the last. You just wouldn't leave. Every intersting thing you showed me you had to show me three or four times. As intelligent as I find you to be, your repitition was heartbreaking. The amazing thing is that your repitition was per location, not overall. As much as I wanted every time we met to be a joy, I found myself starting to resent you. I started to wish we could just finish this part and move on to the next visage that awaited. I knew that if I stuck it out, the next local, the next piece of the puzzle of your mind that you opened up to me would be amazing. It was just such a long time between one revelation and when you would open up to me again that I started to wonder if it was worth the time I was spending getting to know you. You had so many interesting insights, so many variations on how you viewed the world I wish that I could look past your refusal to grind through each and every insight multiple times. I wish, I wish, I wish. Dear, Dear Alice. You have so much to offer. Maybe it's not you, maybe its me. If another chap came up and asked me about you I would tell him how lovely you are. I would tell him how smart and charming you can be. I fear that after a few pints I would probably tell him that I just had a hard time with how long you would drag through any given situation. That the revelations were inticing, but the fluff between revelations didn't make me anticpate the revleations more, just make me resent the fluff.Love, KuasimoddoP.S. I am tentatively telling my friends you are a cool chick with the caveat that you waaaaay overstay your welcome.			"

												Fantastic game. I truly recommend it. Reminiscent of early games such as Psychonauts. Mini games resemble Little Big Planet. Dollhouse level reminds me of Saw and the Jigsaw doll. The game starts to becomes a little buggy at the Oriental stage E.g. Alice's hands no longer grasps the chain when she pulls on them.You begin to see repeats and less unique creatures. E.g. Ink Wasps are Bolterflys, Wasp Samurais move like Madcaps, Baby Doll dies to plain shooting.PROS1. Great visualsThe concept behind Wonderland is truly amazing. Looking at the floating Hatter Industries, the Insidious Ruins, the crying statue, hidden pathways that can only be seen with tiny vision and the vaiety of monsters to fight against each with their own method of killing.2. CreativityAs above.3. Combat systemAmazing. Each monster is killed in a different manner giving you the feeling of a unique creature. Unlike normal hack and slash games, you have to remember each monster's pattern of attack, else you won't be able to kill them. E.g. Insidious Ruin has to be blocked when he throws a fireball or knives, dodged when he charges and attacked from range. Eyepot has to be hit with a range attack first, followed by a melee slash. Repeat twice.I was surprised to see that this game had such an amazing combat system. I was expecting a puzzle solving game instead. The dodge and block modes with the umbrella were fantastic.The Hysteria mode will give the hack and slash fans the frenetic joy they relish if they prefer not to remember patterns of attack.4. StorylineLove the story. I'm at the beginning but I can't wait to find out more.  The story gets darker as it progresses, child sexual abuse, paedophilia, child molesters masquerading as doctors, p rostituted children hypnotised to forget and used to satisfy the perversions of wealthy London clients.Steam censors the word P-R-O-S-T-I-T-U-T-E for some funny reason. Considering the type of content that they provide. It is most strange.5. MovementLove the double jump and the quick walking speed.CONS1. MovementJumping in the air is still a bit clunky especially using the air vents. Jumping in the middle of an air boost creates some problems for long distance jumping.2. Character modelsOther than Alice, most of the beginning character models (children in the hospital) are quite boring. You can see that they are repeated multiple times.3. EA AccountI do not want to create another account just to play a game. It's irritating.SuggestionsI would love to see the combat system put into an MMORPG. Hope EA and Spicy Horse Games can continue to work together on creating quality games like Alice.			"

												If you want a gaming experience that is simply unlike any other, shell out the cash for this classic. A great mind twisting tale that delves deep into the questions of sanity and reality. Colorful, smooth, creative, and just the right length, this game is definitely up there on my list of Single Player Games. Oh, and have I mentioned, ALICE'S HAIR PHYSICS IN THIS GAME ARE AWESOME.PROTIP: You automatically get the dlc content (more dresses with powers and sweet new weapons) along with the purchase of this game, just ask me or look it up on the internet on what to do do unlock them. It has to do with changing the .ini file in the game directory.

IntroThe game has a very creative art style that changes throughout the game with various visuals and great atmosphere.StoryThe story is very interesting and getting the memories throughout the game to unlock more of the story itself is clever. Not only that but you are able to go back and look at the memories any time from a nice and effectively organized menu. The memories are interesting because they flesh out the personalities of the people around the main character and your understanding and roles of those individuals.GameplayThe game also offers you some rpg elements like being able to customize your equipment and upgrade what you desire. The combat itself is very fast paced, with some slow motion moments that allow you to quickly hit your dodge button to avoid attacks. ConclusionOverall the gameplay is great and fun, and so are the puzzles and challenges that become more involved the further you explore the game.			"

												American McGee has taken Gothic Steam Punk and made it into a palatable art style. Sure, you may have to spend an excessive amount of effort installing Origin and creating an EA account just to play this game but it is worth it for the brief snippets of enjoyment you'll get from this title. The platforming elemnts are tiresome yet there is a charm to the combat and after short breaks away to sate your frustration you will find yourself returning time and again to tackle the horrors through the looking glass. Not quite as enjoyable as the original, but that might just be my jaded memories of playing it 13 years ago.			"

												 just finished the game today. I have no idea where to start to be honest.Let’s say I was blown away; not only by the amazing level design, but the strong moral behind the game reaches far down in the back of your mind.This game brings the true dark-side of the story of Wonderland up. Wonderland truly lives up to their motto: “We’re all mad.”Amazing graphics, stunning level design. They weren’t lazy at ALL. Every corner, every new step reveals something new to witness. Whether it’s a teapot with eyes staring from afar or a doll hanging upside down from the ceiling and black liquid substance dripping from the orifices…The drawings on the wall, dolls, skeletons and the overall lugubrious perspective of the game.The artstyle is truly amazing.Gameplay:Not your usual buttonsmash, but a hack and slash nonetheless. But you have a heavy attack, shield, range which you can upgrade over time by collecting Teeth…pretty much anything you need. There’s a lock-on system which is pretty nifty. The jumping can be a little tricky, but overall you’ll get used to it.Whomever thought this felt very repetitive: I disagree. There are a few places in the game where you’d do the same thing, the same kind of puzzle, but they are all within a good “stop” in between.I mean to say there’s a lot of platforming in between the puzzles, a lot of other things to do before doing something you’ve done before. I think it was alright, they balanced it out pretty well.Story:I love the story, and the level designs…all the drawings, props, traps, enemies, you really feel that these are all interpretations of Alice’s feelings; something that used to make you smile is now corrupted and is  turned against you.This little review of thought MIGHT contain slight spoilers:Overall, the story, it being quite the deep moral. A girl having herself blamed for something she did not do, the grudge being pushed down her throat and the endless pain and depression ever soaring through her mind. She tries to justify herself, she isn’t sick; she’s in pain. But nobody who really reaches out for her, giving her what she really needs. All but her Wonderland friends…Although they may appear threatening, or they may appear as they want to harm Alice, they’re all merely afraid of HER.She is destroying her own beautiful mind: Wonderland. They are the creatures who roam over wonderland, and she’s her own murderer - the Infernal Train is her own invention. And if it wasn’t enough, the doctor is ever more pushing it down her mind and blaming her. If one only knew the darker intentions the doctor had in mind by letting these children forget their past…They are nothing but mere numbers. They are but the mortal bodies that walk on the earth, all forgetting their “unproductive” memories. She’s not just being tortured by herself, but others around her, who suffer the same pain, have a huge influence on her as well. 10/10 from me. It’s a damn masterpiece. "

												At it's heart, Alice: Madness Returns is a 3D platformer, with occasional action sequences that oscillate between (light) third-person shooter and brawler. Madness Returns is a diamond in the rough. It would have been so wonderful with more polish and time to add new original features here and there! I do not like brawlers nor third-person shooters, and yet I was able to enjoy the fights from Madness Returns. The first reason is that I gave a lot of thought to my key bindings so it feels as natural as possible despite the clunky design (it really requires too many inputs). The second reason is that the action is very tactical (at least in the higher difficulties, which I recommend) and has a great flow when the player masters the tools and weapons at use. For instance: Hit an enemy with the teapot canon to make it fall backwards and reveal its weak spot. Go in for a few slashes with the knife. Dash away to avoid another enemy trying to attack. Use the now reloaded teapot canon on that second enemy. Dash in to avoid the attack of the first enemy and quickly slash the downed second enemy. And so on. A ballet of butterflies and blades. New enemies here and there require different approaches, however the number of different enemy types is insufficient. Also, not enough true boss fights.Where the game really shines is in the environments. Chinese ceramics, doll houses, flesh castles, mushroom forests, steampunk factories: grandiose, beautiful, oozing with character and magnificence. The dark undertones of some locations is really fascinating, and builds a heavy atmosphere despite the childhood themes. Platforming and exploring in such locations is a treat for the eyes. Alice can go as far as to quadruple-jump and slow down her fall, and the levels accommodate in consequence with aerial elegance. The gameplay of these sections feels good, and is rather permissive (even dying by falling to oblivion is of little to no consequence thanks to an instant respawn onto a nearby platform), so progress flows well and the game feels like an adventure and not an hindrance. Exploration is well done, and some little traps and puzzles can add some spice to the platforming. Problem is, the levels are really big and long, and some sections can overstay their welcome. Well just one in particular in my opinion, the ice world. I would have rather preferred that they make the levels shorter and instead include some cool new ideas that got scrapped during development, but ok, this is just me yearning for more. The reality of game development is not as pretty as this game. Still, there are some sections here and there that are completely different than the main game and add variety, like a shoot-them-up or a 2D platformer, but they feel very floaty. Story-telling is not great, it feels quite disjointed. However the story itself is quite interesting, with lots of subtleties and darker themes. The person voicing Alice does a stellar job. Even though many people like them, I dislike the cutscenes that look like animated cardboard and would have preferred to see them done with the game engine. There are different costumes for Alice, some were part of a pre-order DLC or something. Thankfully they can be unlocked, but it is by editing the Windows Registry. Seriously, how annoying! And also if I remember correctly it is required to create/have an EA account of some sort to launch the game for the first time, thankfully not Origin or anything to install. But seriously, how annoying again... As a conclusion, Alice: Madness Returns is a game full of charm and character with grandiose levels to explore and a morbid undertone that builds a heavy atmosphere. Platforming and fighting is like a ballet once mastered, even if both will not please everyone: it can be argued that the platforming is too light and the fighting is clunky, and that both are repetitive. Alice is awesome, very elegant and pretty in all her dresses and movements, and she benefits from great voice acting.Overall Madness Returns lacks some polish and could have been better, but still very memorable and enjoyable as is.I liked this game so much that I finished it several times despite it being quite lengthy. I would only recommend it to people that are strongly attracted to its visuals and are not looking for state of the art game mechanics.			"

												This game is amazing. It's not your traditional platformer, that's for sure.Where should I start..? Probably with the best aspects of this game.The thing (that I believe) that stands out the most is the design. The game itself is like a work of art - it's a visual treat along with the interesting soundtrack and atmosphere. All the level designs are unique and they change often, keeping the player immersed and curious about the environment they are in. Sure, there are some disturbing or incredibly creepy stuff lurking around all the time, but I think that is what seals the deal. Just. Wow. I've never taken more screenshots in my life.Next would be the story. Now, I guess we don't really associate platformers with intriguing stories, but that's what makes AMR such a cohesive and linear game. As the player progresses through the story, he/she will realize why the levels are designed the way they are, why certain characters say certain things, etc. It'll all come together towards the end. Some people may think the story's a bit dramatic or just downright disturbing, but the purpose of the game is to uncover our protagonist's insanity and madness. It's GOING to be a bit provoking, at least.  But as for me, that's all the more reason to play this game.Finally the gameplay is quite smooth. Platformers need smooth controls, and I've played the first parts of this game using my keyboard, but then switched to controller (when I twiddled around with the menu and figured out it's compatible with one - just personal preference). For both methods, I think it runs fairly smooth. I've encountered a couple of problems with some levels where I had to calm down and then retry getting accross somewhere, but that just might be my technical ability to cope with the difficulties of some platformers. The only issue I really have is that camera control is relatively important in fights, but focus mode totally disregards that.  The puzzles are also pretty fun, and there are different minigames scattered here and there. It's refreshing...In conclusion I totally recommend this game. Maybe I should warn some people to not play this at night, but really, it's awesome!			"

Classic example of EA's DRM hurting the people who legitimately bought the game. If you want to play the game, pirate it. You'll avoid the hellhole of DRM and you won't support EA and their back-asswards business practices.

												A beautiful, creepy and surprisingly uplifting reimagination of a classic fairy tail as an unhinged girl's struggle with madness, abuse, guilt and probably puberty. Travelling between the bleak streets ov Victorian London and vivid dreamscapes of Wonderland, Alice battles imaginary nightmares and very real villains to fix her broken mind and her broken life. While as an action-adventure it is nothing special, and 3d-platforming sequences are boring and frustrating, it takes the player for an amazing journey of visions -- something that Tim Burton's version of Alice promised, but never delivered. Bittersweet, gruesome and fascinating, this game is something unique, something that every gamer should treat themself to.			"

There is one thing I don't like that you have to log in via EA account.This game ruins my childhood fantasy and replaces it with something better.เมื่อก่อนเล่นเถื่อนก็สนุก ตอนนี้เล่นของแท้ก็ยังสนุกเหมือนเดิมครับ			"

												Difficulty: Just RightThe Bottom Line: All it's Cracked Up To Be/Superb Score: 9.0Note: This Game Been Tried Out And Reviewed In Offline Mode or On Another Steam Account And Or Consoles.Graphics and gameplay are beautiful and fit the world wonderfully. The controls (using k/b and mouse) work well and are very responsive. Story is top notch IMO. Love the whole take on Alice and the interaction with the wonderland residents. The monsters you encounter are quite unique and do require some strategy, but they are not overly difficult at least on normalIt's not often enough that we gamers get to enjoy a twisted yet well put together story and game that is worth the money we spent on it. I got the complete edition which also includes the first game. Which I played long ago when it first came out. I definitely will be visiting it againHaven't finished it yet and really in no hurry to cause it's an Wonderfull game to just absorb slowly.			"

I encountered bug after bug, and eventually the game wasn't worth it. I'd reconsider buying it again if the ♥♥♥♥ing bugs were fixed. its pathetic that PAYING users have to resort to this website http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1935139in order to deal with the bugs, and go through files themselves, instead of the company fixing their ♥♥♥♥.Pathetic, highly disappointed.

”And like a lot of dreams, there's a monster at the end of it.”A visually stunning journey into an otherwise broken mind, Alice: Madness Returns is a dark and bloody twist on the weird and wonderful world of Lewis Carroll’s classic novel. With an eerie and intense atmosphere throughout and the soundtrack reinforcing it nicely, this American adaptation is certainly a distinct shift from its source material and does not pull any punches. A morbid character study of the now adult heroine, you are thrown back into a hellish re-imagining of Wonderland, yet again corrupted by its own creator. With a similar vibe to Masochisia, (an incredibly well-made psychological horror indie that I actually wouldn’t recommend anyone play), the plot is heavily based on the symbolism of Wonderland and the slowing fragmenting parts of Alice’s mind and life. The ‘goal’, if you wish to call it that, is simple and singular: save Wonderland, and thus yourself, from oblivion.Portraying mental illness and the various (often cruel and archaic) methods of treatment in a way that’s both thematically appropriate and believable within the forms of game design is an extremely difficult task to pull off and very rarely achieved as a result. The Darkness II did it brilliantly, as did Masochisia. So though it takes a while to get going, (the final section of the game to be exact), and the painful RPG-like task grind that’s required to reach that certain point, the narrative of Alice: Madness Returns achieves a phenomenal take on a truly demented world and the inner recesses of a damaged mind. The problem here is whether or not the payoff is worth the grind.Roughly three-quarters of Alice is useless filler that pads out what could’ve been a tightly-packed masterpiece into a drawn-out and mediocre adventure game. Controls are straightforward to use but are frequently slow to respond or completely unresponsive, detracting from any possible interest one could’ve gained from the relentless platforming and puzzles. Framerate drops, texture popping and outright freezing at times is also a significant issue that plagues the game, but hey.. how about those hair physics? If McGee and the team at Spicy Horse had completely omitted the puzzles and platforming in favour of something like an intermittent walking simulator, it would’ve been to the game’s overall benefit. It was these rare sections that I actually enjoyed the most, as they were solely focused on the narrative’s progression.Combat is satisfying as hell, with some fantastic hack n’ slash, and all of the enemy types are sufficiently diverse and interesting to fight. Colour bursts out of the screen and the striking effect of the Hysteria ability in particular is reminiscent of the visual styles of Sin City and Betrayer. This really is a gorgeous game to behold; right up there with BioShock Infinite and The Witcher games.But what I certainly didn’t appreciate was the ridiculous side-scrolling and Guitar Hero-like mini-games that completely break from the rest of the game. As excruciating as the aforementioned grind, the inclusion of something so one-dimensional and cheaply made is bewildering.  This is a game that is quite clearly trying to be a work of art, not a coin-slot machine at your local arcade or pokies club. Some people might not appreciate the warping perspective of the third-person camera either; tilting sporadically and playing with depth, so beware if you easily suffer from motion sickness.  Props for the checkpoint system though, it actually places you in convenient positions upon failing, rather than back to where you were.. which you’ll certainly need when the dodge and glide abilities fail to respond. Unfortunately, the CD Key that’s (hopefully) been provided needs to be authenticated through Electronic Arts DRM, which also requires you to have an account in the first place. If you’re getting the system error message, just log into the same account via a browser or Origin and verify the code there before launching it normally through Steam again. You should be good to go. To be quite frank, I didn’t enjoy playing most of Madness Returns. Apart from the visual presentation, it was often uninteresting and demonstrated a poorly thought-out sequence of thinly-veiled grinding to pass to the next (and equally repetitive) section. Basically nothing happens for about 7-8 hours before the plot begins to truly kick in and the best the game has to offer finally appears. Until then, it’s fetch quest galore and the many joys of running errands for lazy characters. Yet Alice: Madness Returns still does the job. It’s far from perfect, but offers a decent experience that sets it apart from the rest. Thanks to an enthralling narrative that saves it from the dreaded thumbs-down, this is recommended to anyone with the patience to see past its many faults and experience a well-written and mature journey into the depths of Victorian London and the dark corners of imagination. A fantasy horror for the ages.			"

												I feel obligated to write a review after taking 18h 47m (according to the game itself) to complete the playthrough. (The 26 hours recorded by Steam of course includes time when the game was paused or sitting on the main menu while I had to be away from the computer.)+ PROSGreat artistic style: The game is over-the-top beautiful. Even with the game's age you'd be hard put to find many others that hit the level of pure artistry in imagining the twisted vision of Wonderland.Amazing level design: Each of the five story chapters (the sixth is only the final boss-fight and cut scenes) has a very different look and feel and are peppered with mini-games that break up the platformer main play with other kinds of puzzles. Great voice acting: The actors were simply excellent even when the material was on the thin side.+ MIDDLE GROUNDFlat story; As much as I was impressed with the voice talent and how well crafted the words were, the narrative itself was a bit ho-hum. And you get a lot of it by finding items that trigger memories (voice-overs). It's the same as finding audio-logs in BioShock but not as well executed because a lot of memories add only weak context to the story. It almost makes finding them not worth the time in some cases, but finding them is really part of the fun. Consider that BioShock Infinite takes just as long to complete on average as this game, but the Alice storyline has nowhere near the depth or detail.Combat: It's OK. You get five weapons and all have important uses. In general combat helps break up the platformer experience of finding your way through Wonderland. But there's nothing terribly bad nor satisfying about it.+ CONSToo long: As beautiful as it all is, the chapters are about 25% longer than they really need to be. This made the fifth and final story chapter drag because I simply wanted the game to be over by that point. This wouldn't have been an issue if there was more to the story driving the game play.Bugs: Clipping issues (getting stuck on a seemingly smooth path). Game locking up under heavy button-mashing requiring a reboot. Also the beginning of chapter three has horrible button lag that made it a chore to get through.Clunky mechanics: The auto-target system locks the camera on the current target making you circle around it when moving Alice. This makes it impossible to rotate the cam to see what's coming up behind you in some cases. It also was a bit wonky changing targets. You can't play the game without auto-target though because the game often forces perspective shifts that make it impossible to aim like a traditional 3rd person shooter. You just deal with it as best you can.No Steam achievements: Lots of unlockables are tracked in-game, however no one but you will ever know how many you got.Rating: 6.5/10Worth playing, just be prepared for a long haul if you intend to complete it. Replay value is very low. "

												If there ever was a competition to select the most bizarre, most grotesque video game I'm sure Alice Madness Returns would be in the top 3. Some of the art design employed by the game is simply the creepiest I have ever seen! But all this in the good sense as this is a damn fine game with jaw-dropping visuals and music that gives you the goosebumps.This is a journey through vivid and dangerous dreams - Alice's Wonderland but as opposed to the cartoon this is now a horrified, alternative version of the same where the only way to survive is for Alice to be equipped with a bloody knife and a teapot that works like a grenade launcher. I like how idyllic it all begins only to gradually get more and more corrupt and in the process Alice faces more and more dangerous creatures of the Ruin - this powerful force that tries to stop Alice. You fight throughout the game and you will do that a lot - but you will also solve puzzles and jump and also shrink so that hidden paths can be revealed for you to make progress.You will jump a lot and many will result in your falling to certain death. But once you have put enough trial-and-error the game will be grateful as it shows you the progress Alice makes - a desperate progress to find out what caused the fire that killed his family at their home.The game is pretty long and is full of hundreds of collectibles. I finished it in roughly 15 hours and got only 90% of the stuff scattered throughout Wonderland. There is a special menu called Troubled Visions in the main menu that is only unlocked if you collect every single bottle during each chapter. Pretty neat, huh? Plus, you can always try the New Game+ mode if you think ""Normal"" does not offer a real challenge for you.Buy this game and immerse yourself in this unique, nightmarish world of Wonderland!			"

												This game is absolutely amazing. Alice: Madness Returns is one I would put under the tim Burton category. It has a creepy atmosphere and is a bit twisted. The storyline is very well written. Yes, the storyline is dark and twisted, as if it was written by The Grim Brothers. Although, the story is carried out by some shocking and disturbing images in the game, there are also amazing images in the game as well. Overall, the graphics and artwork of the game are beautifully designed. This game contains a variety of different settings and characters. It is a very well designed game. I would definitely encourage people to buy this game, so everyone can experience this wonderful game.			"

Peppered with a note of nonsanity. Oh and a lot of puzzles.-Bugs bugs and bugs: A lot of bugs, a lot of problems doesn't matter if you have an old system or new, just the latest steam version of that game is buggy. But 99% of the bugs are fixable if you bother to spend 10 minutes on google, or just read game guides. Don't let your dreams be dreams, fix your game and go to play.-No steam cards - steam backgrounds would be totally awesome.

												I never finished this game 5 years ago because my pc specs are crap. I just finished it on the last day of 2016 and I wished they continue with a sequel of this game. It is such a beautiful game and the story telling is very unique. The pacing is really great as it's not always the hack and slash gameplay. They have combined hack and slash gameplay, finding hidden secrets, advancing the story, as well as multiple mini games which serves to not only make the game fresh but also to perfectly match the theme of each chapter.If you didn't get it on steam before spicy horse has been dissolved, it's still on origin but it's a great loss if you didn't managed to get it on your steam library			"

												A bad port of an unique (but mediocre) game that could have been absolutely brilliant if not obviously rushed.GOOD+ Atmosphere and setting - especially if you've never played the original, coming into contact with American McGee's vision for Alice will leave a lasting impression - the series takes some of the subtle dark elements of the two original books by Lewis Caroll and churns them into a twisted, disturbing world of Wonderland - part steampunk fairy tale, part psychotic nightmare+ Visually, the game is simply stunning - aesthetics, visuals, scenery, animations and character models (Alice herself especially) are all gorgeous+ audio design is top notch as well - weapons and enemies benefit from some great sound effects, the game features a large amount of voice overs and the soundtrack itself is quite good (though not as memorable as the Chris Vrenna's masterpiece in the 1999 original)+ a number of interesting puzzles and set pieces that occasionally break up the normal playBAD- action is roughly divided into 2 sections - combat and platforming, and they're both not that much fun really. Combat is repetitive and quickly tiresome (enemies follow the same basic pattern throughout the game, weapons are limited in usefulness or creative synergy) and the platforming/exploring suffers from pacing issues, confusing environments and bad controls- the game itself is also far too long (~20h) and drawn out for it's own good - each room, enemy or set piece quickly wears out it's welcome before being used at least 3 more times within the chapter, and by the end the games feels more like a chore than leisure time. - the game world feels largely empty, bland, lifeless and depressive (even when it's not supposed to) - there's unfortunately not that much to do and see within the game- while the story has some depth and deals with some mature elements, it's delivered through a meandering mess of animated cutscenes, character dialogue and collectible in-game snippets of memories that are all ultimately too cryptic and pretentious and just don't make much sense. All of the characters speak in a random mix of rhymes, gibberish and shakespearian dialogue that not even the cast themselves seem to properly understand, judging by the delivery of their lines.- camera and controls are clunky and finicky (even while using a controller) - some moves don't register as you'd want them to, camera doesn't always do a proper job at showing you what's relevant in your situation (but at least platform deaths are quickly resolved by a minimal impact respawn, in-game)- horrible checkpoint system in place of proper saved games- invisible walls galore, things that don't work the way you'd expect them to, frequent stuttering, crashes, performance issues, game breaking bugs, you name it- how hard would it have been to port the (Xbox) Achievements into the Steam version as well, really?It hard to recommend this game solely on its gameplay merits. It's not really a good game. However, if you feel you have the patience and drive to overcome some of the major faults, Alice 2 can still be quite a memorable experience that is at least worth checking out. Think of this less as a game and more of an art project - style over substance.Also ♥♥♥♥ EA for not letting this project have the budget, time and care it required.			"

If you liked the original American McGee's Alice, you'll love Madness Returns.Cute yet creepy environments that are beautifully detailed abound in this successor to the original.

												I would consider Alice: Madness Returns to be primarily a platforming game with some fighting; including some arcade and puzzle elements to a lesser extent.The environments look pretty good and give the impression of a dream world, but the path Alice takes is extremely linear.  There is no real exploration in this game and there are no large open areas; in fact, there are hidden walls which prevent you from even walking behind some objects.  The main path will occasionally branch off to a deadend that leads to collectible items.  The deadend paths must always be followed first because events are frequently triggered that will prevent you from backtracking.Aside from the teeth you collect--used to upgrade weapons--there are ""memories"" that will provide you with a short audio clip and there are also bottles.  I had to google the bottles because they don't seem to do anything when collected.  According to the wikia, if all the bottles of a chapter are collected then it unlocks a piece of concept art to view.The weapons are an interesting take on conventional weapons (i.e., a pepper grinder chaingun), but there are only 5 to choose from: a knife, chaingun, two-hand club, canon, and timed bombs which may also be manually detonated.  After 13 hours I have yet to unlock the canon.  There's also an umbrella that, while not a weapon itself, can deflect bombs back to the enemies that threw them.  I end up using the knife, the weapon you start with, the most.  It has a really satisfying sound and animation that I never seem to grow tired of.  Upgrading the weapons change their appearance and makes them do more damage, but doesn't given them any new abilities.  Ammo is unlimited, but the chaingun will overheat if you hold down the trigger for more than a few seconds.There is no manual save option, but the game does a good job with autosaving right before some difficult platforming.  If you fall to your death while platforming, you typically won't have to worry about redoing much of that again.  However, if you die during a boss fight, you will have to redo some platforming to get back to the boss area.  This has got to be one of the more frustrating aspects of the game.  You could die on the platforming section literally 2 seconds away from the boss and only have to redo that 2 seconds of platforming again.  If you die figting a boss, you won't get placed at that save point 2 seconds away.  Instead, you might have to endure 2 minutes of platforming along with cutscenes that you can, fortunately, skip.  It makes no logical sense.A mechanic I thought was kind of cool is the ""drink me"" shrinking effect which can be used at any time simply by pressing a button.  This not only shrinks Alice, but reveals invisible platforms and tips scrawled on the walls and floors that are EVERYWHERE.  I emphasize ""everywhere"" because the developers somehow thought it would be good to hold your hand and tell you where every secret path can be found, what collectibles are down that path, what enemies to find around every corner, and what weapon to use on them.  Everywhere.  These tips can't be disabled.The most annoying aspect of this game is the constant camera hijacking.  The game will frequently pan the camera to some triggered event and then return it to a predetermined angle leaving you disoriented.  Infrequently it will fix itself at a particular angle and distance for platforming and also in confined areas.The mouse control was unplayable for me when I purchased this game over a year ago.  I decided not to play it at that time because of that.  You should consider yourself forewarned if you use a mouse because you may not be able to tolerate it.  I picked the game back up recently and I've been using a 360 controller which works fine--aside from having to manually edit an .ini file because the main menu does not include the option to disable force feedback.I find the platforming and boss fights to be enjoyable and challenging and not at all frustrating; instead, the frustrating parts are bad developer decisions that could have been avoided.  While the graphics and animations are beautifully done and the story is somewhat compelling, it doesn't seem like enough incentive to continue playing.  I feel like I'm playing just to get to the destination instead of playing it to enjoy the journey.I suggest only picking up this title during a Steam sale so you don't feel too cheated when you decide to not finish it.

												Okay, first of all, ‘Alice Madness Returns’ is too long… way too long. If they had cut out a third of the weaker content, it would have helped the game a lot. I mean it is still a fun and interesting game, which I enjoyed playing. It just gets a bit tiresome and finding the excessive amount of collectables definitely gets boring.With some changes to the ‘config’ files I got it to run at a solid 60FPS on my GTX 980. The game is very well designed for the most part and has an interesting, dark storyline. The animation style used in the 'cut scenes' is really cool and the enemy designs are great. The platforming is fun too and there are even a variety of surreal mini games spread throughout the campaign.There is also a nicely detailed ‘Main Menu’ with unlockable content and a ‘New Game +’ mode which adds replay value. To be honest though, when I had finished my first playthrough, I was done. After 23 hours of playing through the linear campaign, I had still only managed to achieve 94% completion. Like I said this game is waaaaaay too long and it ends up hurting the experience over all. I might come back and play the ‘New Game +’ mode in the future but I need a long break first.I would recommend that you play this game, it’s definitely worth your time (for the most part). It’s a unique take on the 'Alice in Wonderland' narrative, with interesting design elements and fun gameplay.			"

All and all it's the best game I've played yet. Good if you're looking for some hand-to-hand combat with the Vorpal Blade and a good storyteller.			"

												I am terribly embarrassed about this review myself, as I should've written it a long time (A long time) ago. I know, it's a little late to post a review about it as it's not on Steam anymore. Well, this is mainly the purpose of why I am writing this.I can simply say that this game is outstanding, I had to play it multiple times to understand it. The graphics are amaizingly awesome, SH and EA were absolutely creative when they built this game, such as the idiom (flying pigs), they are real, in a way. What made me feel really sorry is that they have removed this game from steam. This should NOT have happened, due to the fact that it is a great game with a complex plot and a magnificent horror story behind the curtains. There are interactive characters such as the Red Queen, the Mad Hatter, and Cheshire Cat.Moreover, the combat field, the focusing, the Pepper Grinder, the Hobby Horse, the Teapot Cannon and the classic Vorpal Blade and each and every one of their upgrades are incredibly powerful. With them, wrapped aroing the Shrinking and other magical abilities, and with the changing dress at every new chapter, makes Alice herself and her wonderful Wonderland a place of mistery and purity. All in all, I heard about the new some days ago, maybe a week, and I kept playing it whenever I have time, I cannot say how sorrowful I am to know that this game, once wanted by many video game players, is now being removed/ unable to be played via Steam. If it was any way Steam could bring this title back for those who desire and have not experienced this game yet, bring it back. So, regardless this remorseful news, I would most likely recommend this game in any way you can purchase it.			"

IntroductionI bought this game on sale for $5 and it sat in my library for a couple weeks. After starting to play it, however, it quickly found a spot on my favorite games list. Even though some parts were tedious, the story kept me engaged untill the very end.Prepare yourselves for an exceedingly long wall of text (go to the TL:DR if you wish to skip).

OverviewAlice: Madness Returns is a psychological horror game developed by Spicy Horse and published by Electronic Arts in 2011 for Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. It is the sequel to America Mcghee’s Alice, made in 2000.Before I ramble on about everything that I enjoyed about this game, I would like to point out a few flaws with this version on steam.First: the umbrella to block projectiles might not work (it didn’t for me) and if so, you will have to change some files to get it to work right. Next: the combat focus mechanic is far from perfect and has many flaws. It feels awkward to use at first and could use some polishing. Love it or hate it, this mechanic is essential for fighting certain monsters. I got used to it eventually, but it was hard starting out (because you have to hold down the CAPSLOCK key to stay focused).You will also need an EA account for a brief activation (as far as I can remember) but then you don’t need it for the rest of the game.Now on to things I enjoy about Alice: Madness returns:Varied environments: from dark castles, underwater cities, Victorian London, an asylum, and even a train. All of these settings make for an interesting experience as you travel throughout Alice’s now twisted version of wonderland.Platforming: Satisfying and well designed (albeit repetitive) embodied by unique jumping mechanics (I will explain later). Something that would make the platforming better would be to include the edge grabbing mechanic originally shown in America Mcghee’s Alice.Story: I won’t spoil it for you but here is a brief summary: Alice tries to piece together memories of the night that her family died in a fire and ultimately finds out who is truly behind her madness… The story is presented in an interesting way, mostly told by cut scenes, brief dialogue and memory shards that are hidden throughout the levels. The story is very thought-provoking and I recommend that you go into the game as blind as possible because of how captivating the story is, especially towards the very end.Challenge rooms, puzzles, and game modes: There are several puzzles in environment, needing to be solved to more on (they can also be skipped). They vary from playing musical notes, finding blocks that need to be arranged to form a picture, and chess. I enjoyed most of them, but the finding the blocks for a picture is repeated around 6 times, which got repetitive. There are also multiple challenge rooms where the goal is to survive waves of enemies or complete a certain objective. When a challenge is completed, you are rewarded with some red paint. Each time you collect this paint, a part of a rose is filled in. Once you fill in a rose 4 times, you gain an extra rose container (like a heart). Lastly, there are a few game modes, each unique to its environment. An underwater side scrolling shooter, 2D platformer, and baby head rolling course (which is by far the most bizarre of them all).Weapons: There are 4 of them, not including the clock work bomb which you will collect as you progress through the story. In order of appearance they are: Vorpal Blade, Pepper Grinder, Hobby Horse, and Teapot Cannon. (there is also an additional variant for each of these included in the unlockable DLC). The Vorpal blade is your first weapon and used for fast melee slashing. Next, The Pepper Grinder is used rapid, medium to long range assault (and for triggering switches). The Hobby Horse is a slow but powerful short range weapon that is effective against groups of enemies (and is my favorite). The last weapon you get is the Teapot Cannon, is long ranged weapon of high damage and large radius (can be used to break some walls).Character customization: There are several outfits for Alice, her original outfit that changes depending on which environment you are in, a few others, and the DLC outfits. The DLC outfits and weapons each have buffs (or debuffs) that can fit your playstyle. Also, the Teeth you collect can be used to upgrade your base weapons, changing their look and empowering them.Mechanics: many of them stood out to me, aside from the combat focus. Shrinking: used to get through small keyholes and reveal hidden paths. Activated by holding down left control.Health system represented by roses. You can regenerate health by picking up roses that enemies drop or finding a purple flower (if you shrink on top of a purple flower, it will regenerate your health). You can increase your health capacity by completing challenge rooms.Hysteria (my favorite) where Alice taps into her insanity for several seconds to become invincible and gain increased damage. This can only be activated at extremely low health by pressing enter.Jumping: you can jump 3(?) times in midair, losing height with each consecutive jump. If you jump and hold down space in midair, you will slowly float. Also, while we are talking about movement, you can dodge by pressing left shift.Enemies: Small leech-like slimes to massively destructive blobs with baby faces and flamethrowers. Nuff said. Each monster has their own attack pattern and vulnerabilities, which you will need to recognize in order to be victorious. The enemies vary from environment to environment.Level design: predominantly linear with multitudes of secret memories, bottles, and challenge rooms to be found. A few puzzles (mentioned above) are included, but the vast majority of each level relies on platforming. This may get repetitive, but this is up to personal opinion. Although there are no steam achievements (wish there were), you progress is recorded and you can see how many secrets you have found (no one but you can see).Graphics/art style: Surprisingly stunning, detailed environments. One of the selling points for me. I was constantly taking screenshots and have 350 of them (200 uploaded). Half the time playing I was looking for the perfect place to take a screenshot (I got some pretty good ones).Performance: Mouse sensitivity takes getting used to, controls are clunky at first, but after playing for an hour or so, you’ll get used to it. The FPS and a few other things can be changed by editing some game files. You can find guides on how to do this if you look on the Community Hub.Free DLC: Although it is not enabled by default, you can enable the DLC (that includes outfits and weapons) for free by changing the value of GIsSpecialPCEdition from FALSE to TRUE. Due to how much I liked this game, I decided to check out the earlier game, America Mcghee’s Alice. For a game made in 2000, it really impressed me. If you want to play Alice: Madness returns or have enjoyed playing it I strongly recommend you get a copy of America Mcghee’s Alice. It even has slightly better controls (sensitivity wise). TL:DRTo summarize: Alice: Madness Returns features a unique atmosphere, impressive soundtrack (which I forgot to mention), surreal story, decent platforming, weapon appearance customization, interesting mechanics, linear level designs, vibrant and dark art style, and average performance. On sale this is a must buy and at $20 I would still recommend it (if you understand some of the flaws).For personal enjoyment I’m giving it a 9/10 and for review purposes, I give it a 8.5/10 because of its flaws. Just be prepared to troubleshoot any potential problems that could arise.			"

												It's like Tim Burton and Lewis Carroll had a baby. Err...with that disturbing remark aside...The story really leaves a mark on you, and the visuals are gorgeous and well-thought out...like an amazing dream world. The atmosphere is alluring at some points of the story, yet gets more disturbing and haunting in some areas. This is a game that must go to your horror collection, whether you understand the base story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" or not.			"

												Alice: Madness ReturnsGame DetailsPublished by: Electronic ArtsDeveloped by: Spicy HorseGenre: Action/AdventureRelease Date: 17 Jun, 2011Completionist Gameplay: 22 Hours“Alice Liddell, believing herself responsible for a fire that consumed her home and her family, escapes into a twisted version of Wonderland. While held at Rutledge Asylum for treatment, Alice was able to conquer her doubts, and eventually was released from the ward. Alice, now 19 years old, resides at an orphanage in Victorian London, under the care of Doctor Angus Bumby, a psychiatrist who uses hypnotism to help his child patients forget their memories. Though she believes herself cured of her madness, Alice still suffers from hallucinations of Wonderland..""The GameplayAlice: Madness Returns is an action platformer that presents itself with a creepy, dark and creative atmosphere. Wonderland is inhabited by squirming leaches, firebreathing dolls and evil looking teacups, creating a twisted and surreal vibe. As you float and jump through an eerie dollhouse, you can drop bombs, shrink down to a miniscule size or dodge ceiling spikes ready to slam down on you. Unfortunately, the gameplay doesn’t evolve much from the start. This causes the game to become quite repetitive, especially when often, your task is to go and fetch something for another character. If it were not for the distinct and peculiar backgrounds, you might be tricked into thinking you’ve been playing the same level since the start. However, throughout the game there are plenty of hidden secrets motivating the player to fully explore every grotesque nook and cranny. There are enough hidden secrets to make it worth inspecting Madness Returns' grotesque nooks.Alice:Madness Returns does try to change the gameplay up. There are ramps to slide on, an underwater combat scene, puzzles to solve, and a giant dolls head to control. Unfortunately, oftentimes the camera gets in the way of doing these things. There are awkward transitions going in and out of third person, and side views are generally useless. Instead of a heart-pounding flee from a giant executioner, it feels like Alice is just jogging towards the camera. You’ll certainly be glad of the change of tempo, but it leaves a lot to be desired.Melee is the best part of the combat system in Alice:Madness Returns. It feels light, fast, and incredibly deadly. My favourite melee weapon would have to be the Vorpal Blade. Alice will flutter in and around her enemies, slashing them to bits and leaving a trail of butterflies behind. Unfortunately, ranged combat isn’t as fun. The controls for ranged combat lock your camera in place and the targeting system is a little frustrating to use. Unfortunately, this makes many of the battles you will face in this game almost impossible, especially when you are facing multiple enemies.The SoundtrackThe soundtrack in Alice: Madness Returns is spot on in setting the mood. The voice acting is good. Nothing spectacular, nothing terrible, as it can get a little repetitive, especially during the longer levels.The ExperienceIf you buy the DLC, there are some stunning dresses you can wear throughout the game. The Fleshmaiden is a direct example of this. While wearing this, Alice’s pupils are white, her legs are bloodstained and the actual dress itself is a mesh of bloody flesh and tendons. The story of this game will be left in your mind for weeks after you’ve played it. It is engaging and a dark twist on your childhood memory of Alice in Wonderland, and you’ll probably never be able to read it the same way again.Overall VerdictWhile the gameplay can be a little repetitive, I honestly think this game is worth it for the dark, realistic take on a fairytale.If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!

												So after comepleting this game, I found out it`s a sequel to another Alice game. Wow I think I missed out on something here.Presentation: Right of the bat, we see that the game is split into to ""stages"". stage one is the real world, where Alice is lossing her memories, and tryes to find out how her familie got killed. The secound stage is wonderland, where Alice turns into a badass and kills the monsters of wonderland. The story is based around the Alice in wonderland universe, but the universe here is far more disturbing, and shows a more grim side of wonderland. I think I would apriciate  the tone more if I had played the first game, but as long as you know  Alice in wonderland. It dose not feel like you are missing out on anything.If you don't know about the Alice universe beforehand, I would say you would find this game really random at times, since no charecters wouldn't make any sense to you. Gameplay/Controles:In terms of gameplay, this game is acually very fun. It can get repetetive now and again but the balance between combat  puzzels and platforming makes the game seem more or less fresh all the time. In terms of main gameplay, there is your 3D platforming and your combat. In terms of platforming, the game can from time to time fell a bit slipery, but after you get use to it, you fly around the levels. The platforming is also mixed with puzzeling, where you have to activate a switch, and afterwards run back through some tricky jumps. This can be frusterating at times, but when you succed you feel great.The combat is simple, you aim with the mouse and leed Alice towards an enemy. You will get other weapons than your standard knife, like a heavy weapon, and a light and heavy gun. This makes it up to you, to find out how you want to take care of your enemies all the time, and it`s a great way to make palyers chose what they want too do, and what battle type they prefer. One thing though which I`ll also mention in visuels. I had problems with the game, and it started to prefomre purely when to many enemies where on the screen, this runied the gamepley a bit for me, but it is a matter to be overlooked, if you have a strong PC.The enemies are all themed from the stage you are on. There are teapot fighters from the Mad Hatter stage and card soldiers from the queen of hearts stage. You need to find all the enemies weakneses in order to win, and some of them, needs a bit more of stragetie to defeat. There are also fun ministages, such as a sidescrole shooters, a maze game, and much more. There is also a lot of collectebels to find in this game. Which only makes you want to explore the beutifull world even more.Charecters:If you know your Alice in wonderland, you`ll know most of the charecters. All of them have been givin a more sinister look and perseronality, which is also reflected by the stages. You`ll meet many great charecters such as the Mad Hatter, the Carpenter and the Queen of hearts. All the charecters are well voiceacted, and have there own persenalitty, and it is a joyride all the way through.Visuels:As said sometimes the game slowed down for me, but it dose not change the great looks of this game. Every single stage is beutifull in it`s own way, and everything is so well done, that I think the visuels where some of the most importent things of this game. Evey stage has it`s own charm and it`s own looks, there is a steampunk stage based on the Mad Hatters tea factory, there is a Water level that looks beutifull, there is a japanese inspired level, a cardhouse in the sky and much more, everything looks so beutifull and nice, that you want to explore everything, and see even the smaller details in this game.  Music:the music is very well made, and fits in with all the stages. Not much to be said here, other than I want the soundtrack so I can play it for a D&D night. Story:The story is accually not that complecated , Alice needs to find her memories in wonderland, and also find the out how her famelie died in the real world. The game switches from wonderland to real world, and you find out new things all the time. Alice needs to face many of her old friends in wonderland, and the progress you make all the time, makes the games story flow by pretty smothly. I am not going to spoil anything, but let me tell you, the end boss is a blast to fight.Conclution:This game is really good, with great charecters, fantastic visuels, and nice music, but tihs is maybe also the minor complain I have. The gameplay could at times be a bit better, and the art direction seems to have taken over with this game. This is not a bad thing, but if you are a gamer, that don`t care about visuels, this game can seem a bit flat at times.			"

												i love this game so much.I was so interested in this game when it first came out, I completed the whole story mode within a week. I thought the art/setting of the game was beautiful, and the gameplay was great as well. This is definitely a story that I will replay over and over, the concept of finding Alice's memories is too sweet.I also really liked the ""Chapters"" concept, where each chapter would have a different mood attributed to it, with Alice Liddel in a different coloured dress. There were some puzzles in this game, but they were at the right difficulty - I didn't require a guide at all during this game and I found it lots of fun. Please treat yourself and buy this game. (I even own it on Origin, too)			"

												A beautiful 3D platformer (Don't rush through the levels, particularly the prologue and first level, stop and look around) that takes place after the events of American McGee's Alice. Alice, now older, returns to a corrupted wonderland to do battle with events from her childhood and her own insanity. EA initially market this game as a psychological horror game. While it certainly is creepy and dark at times I would never call it scary. This game has more in common with games like Spiro and Banjo Kazooie than it does with your stereotypical psychological horror title.The game is a lot of fun, both combat and platforming are incredibly satisfying (Having the ability to triple jump and glide from the beginning and LEARNING to master these abilities as opposed to unlocking them). Each area of the game grants access to new weapons, allows you to collect teeth (currency) to upgrade your weapons and gives Alice a new outfit whcih is a reflection of the level (a nice little touch). The game also contains 'memories' and other such collectables which allow you to unlock bonus content (concept art for example) which will appease the OCD side of the avid completionist.The game does suffer from some optimisation issues (It's a console port) and certainly does control better with a gamepad. If you are considering giving this game some serious playtime I would really recommend getting access to a controller. After a while the game does start to feel stretched out, few new mechanics and concepts are introduced and it turns into a slight grind to the end.Overall, I think this is definately worth buying and playing. If you are still making up your mind, check out this Let's play by Just A Friend and Sinatrapod from the lparchive:http://lparchive.org/Alice-Madness-Returns/Happy gaming.			"

												Not as good as the first but okay.Same sexy brunette Alice, same demented world from the mind of American McGee. Better than the movies by Tim Burton.Very strange game, kinda repetitive but yet fascinating because Alice is so mentally disturbed. So it is the psyche questioning that saves the game really.It's good enough.			"

												Bought this game on steam when it first came out and enjoyed it, despite some technical problems with the game. Reinstalled it this week to play it again and discovered that the third-party DRM is no longer working and the game can't be activated anymore. Despite a valid EA account and a valid CD-Key provided by steam, all activation attempts result in a very unhelpful ""system error"" message. I was finally able to activate the game through a series of methods discovered by searching extensively online for people with similar problems. All in all I spent about 3 hours simply attempting to launch the game - this is absolutely unacceptable. I notice that the game is still present on steam but can no longer be purchased. Perhaps Valve has halted sales because they know this game doesn't actually work? Or perhaps EA stopped new sales to focus on their competing platform. Either way, something needs to be done. Ideally valve would pull this game entirely and issue full refunds to all who purchased it, at EA's expense. I paid $60 for the perpetual right to play this game, and that contract has been broken. tl;dr: This game is approximately 3 hours long and takes place mostly in search engines, abandoned forum threads, and notepad. Not recommended.			"

												Fantastic and brilliant game. I never considered myself a fan of Alice in Wonderland, but now I do. You see, it's not just about a girl who goes down the rabbit hole into Wonderland. American Mcgee, creator of this version of Alice, showed me just how awesome this mytho can be if you interpret it in different ways. In this particular version, which quickly became my favorite, Alice is a delusional girl who lost her family in a fire, and spent most of her life locked in an asylum. Wonderland is nothing but a fruit of her (twisted) imagination, and a way to escape the tragedy of the real world. This is a sequel to American Mcgee Alice, released in 2000.  Pros   Incredible world inspired by the original Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, but ultimately created by American Mcgee. Enjoy a beautiful, varied, twisted and dark version of the original place Alice has such a passion for. Characters also get the American Mcgee treatment and fit perfectly in this new world. Prepare to bond with poor Alice, who is victim of her own mind, and start to root for her as you play and meet new characters. Sooo much variety in Wonderland. Everything is just gorgeous to look at, holding a lot of style and originality. Alice is such a good character in this version that I think she deserves her own point in this list. Alice is a beautiful young girl, and you will start to care for her the more you explore her tragic past. As always, emotional affection in games just proves how high quality the product is. Dresses. Yes, dresses. Alice will get a new dress with each new place you explore in Wonderland, and they just keep getting cooler and cooler. Plot. Just amazing. Seriously. The more you play, the more you want to know about what's going on. Story pacing is just superb. Weapons. While there's not a lot of them, they will certainly keep you entertained. The Vorpal Blade and the Pepper Grinder are your initial weapons, but you'll get a few, more intereresting options ahead in the game. They are all very stylish and creative. I guarantee you've never seen anything like it. Interesting upgrade system. You'll be collecting teeth throughout your journey, which you can use to upgrade your weapons. This not only will make them stronger, but also change their appearance. Great combat system. Not only is this a platformer game, the action in it is awesome, and the combination of both things is something no other game has done. While not perfect, the combat system can be mastered, and soon you'll be kicking some Corruption ♥♥♥. You can slash, bash, shoot, dodge, block, reflect, target, or throw a bomb to divert enemies from you. Great platformer. Madness Returns also stand out as a platformer, not leaving anything on the table when it comes to great 3d jumping and twirling. Enemy variety. No combat can be good without good enemies, and Alice: Madness Returns delivers. All enemies are fun to fight, and trust me, there are a lot of them. Enemy quality. Doesn't matter if you have dozens of enemies in your game and they all suck. Here, not only are enemies fun to fight (as I mentioned above), they are styled according to the place you're currently at in Wonderland. It's just awesome to enter a new place and try to imagine how the enemies will be, according to the current scenario. Hair. Alice's hair in this game is really a thing. While clearly not perfect, it works really, really well. The wind effect is just beautifuly created. Good boss fights. Bosses are just as good as regular enemies. Gameplay variety. You simply can't get bored when playing this game. There are at least 5 different gameplays in here, and most of them are great (see: Cons). Gameplay time. This game is really long (especially for a platformer), all while maintaining a great pace. It will surely keep you entertained for many hours. Great amount of collectibles that are actually fun to look for. Voice acting is top notch. Soundtrack. Oh, my. Just remembering that main menu theme gives me goosebumps. Graphics. While not the best (keep in mind this a 2011 game), they deliver. Holding up greatly to this day, they are supported by the outstanding art. Optimization. Very optimized game. And I don't mean ""I can max it in my gtx 970"" kind of optimized. I mean ""I can run it in my celeron, gt 620 combo with decent graphic options"" optimized. All cutscenes are skippable (useful when you're replaying the game). You don't need to play the first game to get into this one.   Cons   There are a few short segments (4 or 5, I think), where the game turns into a 2d platformer. Those parts are atrocious. Boring and sometimes unfair and glitchy. 30 fps cap (can easily be fixed). Negative mouse acceleration (no way to deactivate it). You can have a few problems if you remmap the keyboard keys, such as actions not happening, even though you are pressing the correct button (yes, I'm talking about that damn umbrella tutorial). A lot of people manage to get past it, and others don't. I had a little bit of trouble, but I got lucky and it worked. If all fails, I'm sure plugging a controller is a 100% reliable method. "

												How is it humanly possible to make serenic views, tea parties, and undersea villages horrifying? American McGee found a way, and it is terrifying as it is beautiful. Even knowing how it would end (a friend spoiled it for me -_-) and without playing American McGee's Alice first, it was still fun and it kept suprising me.Pros:-Beautiful graphics-Amazing voice acting-The story (it's original and different compared to the other interpretations of Alice in Wonderland).-The soundtrack -The dresses are beautiful and after completing the game the dresses get buffs or debuffs (to give you a harder challenge)-Puzzles weren't too difficult-The graphics-You experience Wonderland and Reality, which is interesting to add to the story-Interesting weapons and mechanics-Did I mention the graphics?Cons:-Had to do a bit of modding to get it to work-Had to follow a guide and download extra files to get American McGee's Alice (but it works well)-Control support wasn't included but I found a program online that allowed me to use it-Keyboard controls were unresponsive at times-EA forced the developers to rush it out so it could've had more content (Damn it EA)-No trading cards, achievements, emoticons, or backgrounds for your Steam profile -Can be repetitive-Ran into a few bugs but nothing game breakingOverall, this game is as beautiful as it is haunting.

												Отличная игра, стоит того что-бы её купить.Но понравится она не всем: кому, тем что игра сильно затянута, в плане геймплея. Кому своей безумной атмосферой.В ней можно отдохнуть от шутеров и наслодится атмосферой безумия: попрыгать по странным, а порой и не видемым платформам, и поубивать странных, а порой и страшных врагов.Но единственное что огорчило именно меня это то, что теперь надо учить Английский язык или качать русификатор титров и меню, поскольку стимовская версия полностью на Английском языке.К тому-же, если будет, с удовольствием поиграю в продолжение этого ""безумного"" шедевра.

												The design, feel and visual uniqueness of this game is hard to describe.  Being rather fond of surrealistic elements and other-wordliness, this game struck me from way across the field as both visually-aesthetically beautiful and packed with an overall feel and mood that makes playing it like being in a dream.  Really.I love it, I love the game mechanics, the design, and for what it matters there's also a storyline, but I scarcely care about it because whoever drove the main gist of this game is someone so well in touch with their own nocturnal affairs that simply walking through the maps is an oddly, bizarrely enjoyable experience.The only downside is the sluggish response and non-optimized engine.  Ever had that hard-to-nail feeling that ""there's something wrong here.. like I'm walking in shoes with sticky soles, or trying to drive a car with a slightly loose steering wheel and laggy servo mechanism"" ?  That's the feel I get in Skyrim too, the feeling of something made for a console (and in my world, game consoles are an entertaining, but utterly inferior species) ported to PC without optimizing.  'cause feck the PC gamers, right? They'll just buy new hardware, right?It's from 2011, this is 2015 and I think a dual core 2.8Ghz with a Radeon 290X ought to be enough to run these graphics smoothly, with no input lag.  Alas, not the case.Don't let the above deter you, I'm fairly confident these are somewhat card/driver-specific, and it's not actually a problem unless I max the physics (which I don't really notice anyway).  Just take heed if you're someone who's bothered by these things.Imagination, visuals, gameplay, cool mechanics and a unique atmosphere, it's a fantastic game, totally recommended.  Beautiful.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is one hell of a ride. It is hard to describe such an hybrid of a game; If there is one game that doesn't quite fall victim of genres, this would be a great example. It is loosely based on Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"", but with a much darker setting. The thematic present in the story is somber and sometimes psychologically disturbing. This is definitely an M rated game, due to a very mature story (younger players may have an hard time understanding it due to it's complexity) and the gore level involved, but even on this aspect this game is unique, the violence isn't gratuitous and it always serves the purpose of the story and the setting involved. Madness Returns is a mix of a third person adventure with a great combat system implemented for the action sequences. It has exploration as well, with plenty of collectables to find, but at it's core it's an action adventure game, but it's unlike anything else out there. This game is a work of heart and art. The enemies, settings, artwork in the game world are all unique. And unique is the best word to describe this gem. There is also variety in the game, some sections are played in 2 dimensions in a cell shaded style, and many more surprises that are better left unspoken. Designed and produced by American McGee, an experienced game designer that has worked at ID Software, on Doom and Quake, and also the designer of the first Alice game, Madness Returns is quite an accomplishment. The visuals are simply amazing, breathtaking and draw you in. You have never seen so much use of colour on the Unreal engine before, and the quality of the textures really manage to impress. Graphically it is one of the best looking games to ever grace your PC, even today 2 years after it's release. The real winner though, is the art and design of the levels themselves. You have to see it and experience it to believe it. The music is quite good, Chris Vrenna (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson) is the man responsible for the soundtrack, and it matches the visuals in perfection. This is one of the few examples where the audio is just as important as the visuals and the story. They all are and feel like a perfect match to each other, and not so many games can claim the same. There are some flaws though. The camera is a bit shaky at times, and it does get in the way on occasion. The mouse control is very sensitive and it will need adjustment. Some people may find some exploration parts boring, but it was not the case with me. If you decide to purchase this gem of a game, do so knowing it will take you quite a bit of time to finish. It is a long adventure. The Good-Story, superb visuals and audio-Unsurpassed art style-Animation-CG sequences are a living painting -Voice acting-M Rated-Variety in gameplayThe Bad-Camera angles get in the way on occasion-Some players may dislike longer exploration sections9/10			"

												I am torn on this game, on the one hand the Gothic and peculiar style of the game is amazing, and provides a nice dark twist on the classic story. The graphics are very good for its age and most of the time, the combat feels great. However, every level feels the same as each other, with just a different skin dashed over the same mechanics, the same platforming, the same monotonous puzzles and honestly this is where the game completely lost me. The story is barely there, the game feels drawn out purely for the sake of stretching playtime as it adds nothing to the story and when you've killed 1000 black baby blobs, you've killed them all and it starts to become a chore more than actual fun. It also doesn't help that the game, on a technical level is objectively ♥♥♥♥. The performance is dire when compared to any other game from 2011, the numerous glitches forcing me to kill myself in order to restart the section because some how a giant monster is walking on air and it won't die, the slight jolt in game rendering as it places ""moving objects"" at the incorrect moment just adds to how frustrating this game is and ultimately killed it for me.See, that is the worst thing about it, if you would have given me this repetitive but stylish game in a better engine, I would have been happy and would have more than likely completed it, but as it is, it's a repetitive, annoying, broken slug fest and that is a damn shame.

												I don't think there could have possibly been a better sequel to American McGee's Alice. It's darkly gorgeous and creative with brilliant level design and simplified combat driven by a dark, psychological story. That said, the boss fights were underwhelming to me, especially the final one (Just start the game on Hard or Nightmare), but all my complaints are minor. In contrast with the first game, there are few memorable music pieces, as there's much more focus on background ambience, though the addition of heart-pumping fight music is nice. Still a bit disappointing considering it's Chris Vrenna. Anyway, there are plenty of moments where I got stuck not knowing where to go - another leftover from the original, but this sequel really succeeds where it counts.There's simply much more plot going on here, more characters and a mystery to unfold - all fueled by solid voice acting. There are some loose ends still untied once it's all over and I did feel some of the symbolism - especially with the end villain - was forced, but considering the dark creativity at display with the monsters and levels, I can easily forgive that. Seriously, the amount of detail put into places you won't even necessarily visit is amazing. Anyway, if you enjoyed the original game, absolutely play this - and vice versa. I didn't even like Madness Returns at first, but it won me over for all the above reasons.			"

												Alright so, you found out about this game, came here looking for directions, wanting to know if it's worth your hard earned money, and is currently reading this review. Unfortunately, as you probably noticed, this game is not on sale anymore on Steam (but you can still buy it from another popular digital distribution platform).Which is a REAL shame.Why is it a ""REAL"" shame?Let me start by saying that this game is a masterpiece, graphically speaking. Its enviroment design is gorgeous, each chapter has its own feeling to it, its own story, its own enemies (which are decently diversed), I can say without a doubt that this is the most beautiful game I've ever played in my life, period. I'm not one for art, I never really cared about art in general but this game made me actually stop whatever I was doing to enjoy the scenery, enjoy each and every single detail in it. To sum up, this game is breathtaking. For real. The focus the developers put into making every moment unique is already worth the buy....Wait, what exactly IS Alice: Madness Returns?Let's get something out of the way first: it isn't a horror game. It certainly has some horror elements to it, but you won't be constantly scared of what's going to happen. It's more of an adventure-platform game. You'll be jumping and stabbing creatures like crazy, though. It's a fun game, I'll tell you that!Beautiful that, gorgeous this, but what about the gameplay?The gameplay is not the best, but it's good nonetheless! The controls are pretty tight, you can feel that you have total control over Alice, and if you fail trying to do something, it's all on you buddy. You'll be double even triple jumping during most of the game, so you better practice your timing and coordination.This is vital to explore the world. The main plot is uncovered by simply just going from a chapter to another, but the sub-plot is revealed by discovering memories hidden all around the level, so you have to be paying attention to everything and be willing to do some crazy tricks to find them all.But you'll probably spend some time familiarizing yourself with the controls when battling, since they are kinda confusing and frustrating sometimes, but mostly at the beginning when you're still learning how to focus on an enemy while trying to evade multiple attacks, among other things.Since we are talking about the combat, I'll let you know that this is also not a hack'n'slash game. Yeah, you'll be gutting creatures like it's f****** christmas, but the game will force you to strategize your attacks, since each enemy has its own weakness, and you can't kill them all using the very same technique, even more when there's a bunch of them attacking you at the same time.So, the game is beautiful and the gameplay is decent. But what about the story?""Alice: Madness Returns"", as you probably already know, is the sequel to ""American McGee's Alice"", released in 2000, but I wouldn't say it makes much of a difference to play the first game before this one. Since Alice is just revisiting Wonderland after 10 years, the only things you'll be missing out are how this one character ended up this way and why some places are like this, apart from that there's no major event that you should be aware of that'll actually prevent you from fully comprehending what's going on in this game.And, boy, what ISN'T going on in this game. I won't talk about the actual plot since that is vaguely explained in the game's description for a good reason, but I can guarantee you that I enjoyed every part of the story. The game's premise is pretty interesting and it does a very well job in making you theorize about if Alice is actually in Wonderland or not, and if you really are paying attention to everything that's happening, you start ""losing"" your mind. The story hits a point where  even you, the player, the only mentally stable person so far, starts to question what's real or not, and that, my friends, is what really got me hooked up in story.Alright, alright, but a game is nothing without a good soundtrack!This is not an issue either. If you really care about music in videogames, then I must say that you're in for a superb ride! The soundtrack, totally orchestral, composed by Jason Tai and Marshall Crutcher, is absolutely phenomenal. Each track captures the moment you're at, more ""aggressive"" tracks will play while on combat, more relaxing tracks will play while trying to solve a puzzle or while exploring the game in general, and some tracks will even make you stop and just... Think.Alice: Madness Returns has one of the best gaming soundtracks, in my opinion.Come on... This game can't be perfect! Tell me some bad stuff about it too!You're right! Nothing is perfect, so here we go:  It's too repetitive. Alright, I understand, you can't go many different ways with a platform type of game, you'll have to jump and jump and jump again to reach that item, that's not my real issue with it, but they actually re-use the same puzzle at least two times in a chapter, and when you're reaching the end of the story and all you want to know is how it's going to end, they actually get reaally annoying. There's a straight path ahead, but you can't cross it because you HAVE to finish this simple-yet-frustrating puzzle. Besides, some mini-games are just plain boring.  It's buggy. It became a routine during my gameplay to get stuck in the ground after a cutscene or ""just because"". Or sometimes after a battle the game wouldn't let me progress because it kept waiting for me to finish off all the enemies, even though all of them were dead already. This is the worst type of bug, but didn't happen often, at least.  It crashes ocasionally. During my first playthrough, which took me 17 hours, the game crashed at least 4 times. It isn't much, and maybe it won't happen to you, but a crash is a crash, so be aware of that.I'm still not sure if I should buy it!Alice: Madness Returns is not a game for everyone. If you like to play all kinds of games, if you want to watch a good story unfold in front of you or if you like platform mixed with adventure and some action, then I would highly recommend it. You won't regret any single minute of it, assuming you'll look past the game's flaws and focus on the bigger picture (which isn't hard to do).But, if you're here because you thought this game would be all about that psychological terror or some hardcore hack'n'slash, then you'll be disappointed.I shared with you my thoughts about the game, so now it's up to you to decide for yourself. As you can probably see, I loved this game. Maybe you'll love it too!			"

 The short answer is that this game is a work of art. It's a paradigm of how other works can be adapted into new and great ideas. I think it's also the last ""Art"" that EA ever published.First, the good: The graphics are gorgeous for its time. It may have been made in 2011, but it could easily pass for 2014-2015. The problem that I find with most of today's action-adventure platformer titles is that they feel short. Madness Returns, however, is a meaty adventure. It's filled with all kinds of secrets, nooks and crannies to explore, and pig noses to shoot. The environments of each chapter are varied and detailed, right down the very clothes that Alice wears. The story is interesting in its own right, although I'll admit, there were points in it where I got a bit lost. The characters are all good adaptations of the ones from the original book. They still follow similar roles, just in a darker way. The combat is a decent challenge, although it can get a bit easy once you fully upgrade the Hobby Horse. The thing I like about it is how the battles are well placed, with a good amount of time set between encounters. The enemies are also diverse, although there are some instances of re-use (i.e. Boltorfly and Ink Wasp doing basically the same thing). The platforming segments of the gameplay are executed nicely. It felt like the levels had been designed with care, rather than just spitting random moving platforms and ledges everywhere.Now, get ready for the bad:
 You know how I said earlier that this was a meaty adventure? That can be a double-edged sword. Yes, it has a lot of level to play, but sometimes the levels drag on. This game was tagged as being a horror game, but I wasn't scared for most of it. It didn't spook me until the last chapter, and maybe once in the second. The one consolation here is that Madness Returns doesen't rely on cheap tactics like jump scares when it tries to scare you. The things that spooked me were actually kind of nightmarish. "

												Do you like third person platformers?  You'll like this game.  You are born into the world with not only the ability to double jump, but you can quad-jump, and you can glide after each jump!  Platformers dream come true.The imagery in the game is beautiful and twisted.  Some scenes are wonderfully gorgeous, while other scenes are ruthlessly violent.  I'm not really a screenshots kinda person, but I did end up taking a lot of screenshots of this game.  And the hair physics...you wouldn't think something so small as which way Alice's hair blows in the wind would be such a big deal but it is surprisingly pleasant to watch during those moments when I stop to smell the roses.The platforming complexity is decent.  Hardcore types might be turned off because the path forward is relatively linear and the puzzles themselves are relatively straightforward, but it's still a satisfying experience.  Especially because this game has not frustrated me even once, which is surprisingly difficult for games in this genre.The fighting isn't incredibly complex and the moveset is fairly limited, but it does give you four different weapons, fast melee, strong melee, fast ranged, strong ranged.  Some attacks work better than others against some enemies.  The fighting adds a nice break between platforming segments; I don't grumble when a fight starts, but I don't get all excited either.For the completionist, there are lots of little things to look for that are hidden away.  I'm usually pretty thorough at searching for things and I've managed to miss two or three things in each level (out of about 30-40).  Fortunately, the game allows you to replay previous chapters you've beaten, so you can get a perfect score.			"

ENG: Score 11 ouf of 10! The worst fears a kid can have is from the people he thought were good, if they do bad stuff to him it's just hundred times more hurting. And if this kid is emotionally sensible, the pain can be multiplied by his perception, as you can see the aesthetic beauty from Wonderlands, before its falls. It happens that these crazy things just made a super fun and never old fighting mechanic, with some creative and dynamic gameplay. Better yet, American Mcgee and his team rightfully leaves EA as Bioware should have done a long time ago. Impressive.But the last thing you hear before descending to the Wonderlands is ''I need a drink'' from a over caricatured granny, from some over caricatured, 18th smoky world who is curiously leaving Alice's beauty untouched. Curiously her psychologist isn't charicatured neither. You're just on the ugly fourth dimension looking at a third dimension caricature, mirroring your world's real beauty. Clever.Little silly spoiler ahead I never saw such line so perfectly timed with an event in a game's plot. Already expecting the worse, Alice's mind immediately triggers the Wonderlands, but gradually warping the place into a hell hole makes you think. What is exactly that is happening, assuming this is but an dream? ""It's just a game'' claims the skeptics, but the undertones on the dark music will never let you forget to theorize things like beating or touching. Water falls made out of tears are sad enough, but hot grease/tea eruptions? Shocking.Thoughts, not spoiler On my opinion, whatever is happening, Alice is obviously far away from being a hero. I don't like her so forced voice acting, but she's anti-hero by all rights and means. And even if a darker plot is taking place she isn't saving anything, sometimes not even her own self. In the other half you feel this ''I don't care'' trying to erupt somewhere. That's a common child abuse collateral. No worries, this is just another subtle message from the writer, we live on a society that bad plus rebellion equals to hell. Like literally assuming she-demon powers, like in the first version? Intriguing.Post Traumatic Disorder victims treatments often relies on remembrances, you do that the whole game but the memories seems to be all but fragmentated, shattering the little reality there is and you just can't trust the Cat. (best voice acting in the whole game) Curiously, he seems to be the salvation. The granny is drinking to get higher, Alice's drinking to get smaller. Step on a violet plant with arms pushing her down, it closes but you don't lose any health. Sad.My interpretation This is truly an sophisticated psychological triller of the most saddest and subtle meaning I ever came to play and because of that, I'm always fully depressed during and after my gameplay. (the game is great for delivering it so precisely and subtly) I don't have control over my character, I don't know what is happening to her real ''her'' in the third dimension that is, leaving lots of room for interpretation. It makes me feel that I'm just helping the character to get even more lost instead of saving her, and this is absolutelly depressing. Devs went after some psychologist or pedagogue on the matter, Alice is definitelly being molested on her outter self... But as the game has a non-realistic approach on the theme, it is obvious that some darker forces are taking advantage of her unfortunate condition. So you will find a lot of possible fantasy themes in there and not all of them are on the third dimension... see? If the dark music is cool, so it's when on action, making the game looking even weirder (positively). Outstanding.To avoid any massive spoiler, I'll finish it. Sick/saddest/awkward game I ever played, which wages an perpetual war between subliminal conceptualisations and a nice third person gameplay. Go for it, but please, this isn't a children oriented game. Speaking of which, always be smart and gentle with children and teenagers... that's what the message is all about. Optimistic?			"

												The artwork in this game is really awesome, I love the scenery and the whole style of the game in general. It can go from a bright beautiful setting with an upbeat tune and nature sounds, to a dark twisted scene with eerie music and a cold feel, in matters of seconds. Which I think nicely reflects the ups and downs of emotion the main character Alice is going through while she’s trying to fight her insanity.Even though it’s a sequel, it’s not as if you need to have played the first one to get this one, it’s a unique game and I like the collectables you find along the way to give you just that little bit more background information on the characters.The voice acting is amusing,the game is enticing,the combat is easyand the plot is pretty decent.In general, a really good game, I definitely recommend it to anyone that thinks they might be interested in it, but isn’t all that sure.

												This is a good game, not one you enjoy a lot but still worth playing, it's fun. This game is about Alice Liddell, and the corrupted Wonderland, through the story you will find facts to remember what happened to exactly her family 10 years ago, why her house burned, if it was just an accidental issue or it was done purposely, Alice will remember more and more things thought the game about her past. Also art style of this game and story are creepy. People say girls like this game a lot even if they don't play a lot of videogames, so maybe.I liked a lot of things from on this game like in every new chapter she gets a new dress, her hair is also very good done(it's not like TressFX in Tomb Raider, but not far from it), you have an interesting weapons that you find by progressing the game you can also upgrade them, graphically game looks good with a lot of beautiful zones, there are a lot of secrets, story is also good.Things I disliked, game sometimes freezes for 1 sec(happens to a lot of ppl, maybe is caused because of PhysX, because I have them disabled with my AMD card), while fighting some buttons are just next to each other so this makes you sometimes pressing the wrong one(but I guess you can change them to another key if you like), sometimes game becomes boring if you play a lot in one day.I would give it 7/10.

												This game has so much wonderful potential, but falls flat on it's face because of extremely poor key-press design, glitchy game-play, and show-stopping bugs that EA in their wisdom decided not to fix. I was only part the way through the game before I was hit with the dreaded umbrella fail glitch, and was unable to proceed beyond that point. The assorted fixes on the internet didn't work. Having said that, provided that you don't attempt to change the key-presses, then the game is playable with the odd lag, and you may find the superbly imaginative graphics are irresistible.			"

												Alice Madness Returns is possibly my favourite game of all time. It's a beautiful game, with cleaver puzzles, lock-based hack'n'slash combat.The audio is very well done, with excellent ambient music and scores. You play as Alice Liddle, exploring the memories of your past to find who set her house on fire, killing the entire family.You can shrink to fit in tight spots, and see things that you normally wouldn't see.Triple jump, with a very nice floury effect, floating to those; hard-to-reach areas.Dashing out of the way is nicely done, turn into a flutter of butterflies then reappear out of harms way.The environments were stunning, gorgeous and serene, contrasting to the dark and ominous. Cut-scenes are fantastic, very well animated. (Love the art style)It's a memorable experience; a game you'll never forget.The minigames are enjoyable and well designed.Had puzzles that once completed I thought ""damn, that was pretty cool."" so I loaded an earlier checkpoint to replay the puzzle.Makes me sad that the first game (American Mcgee's Alice) isn't on sale anywhere. Not even on origin. Controls take some time yo get used to. (if playing keyboard) but it's still playable.Collecting teeth will let you upgrade your weapons to make more powerful versions. Each has it's unique use.Bugs:I have had several issues with enemies/minibosses being invincible, thus prevent progress. (Mostly in CH5: The Dollhouse) Restarting from last checkpoint/restarting game fixed it, but it got rather annoying. * There are a few tweeks you should do in the config file before playing, ie; Removing the 30fps cap, unlocking the dlc...)(Check player guides)* Required a one-time activation on Origin. Origin does not have to be open to play this.10/10 Must Try.			"

												Alice Madness Returns is a great, well put together, 3rd person action game. First of all, you can clearly see from screenshots and videos that this game is a great looking one, sometimes even breathtaking. The game is divided into 6 chapters and each chapter has its own unique look and they all look great and I think the developers did a really good job in creating a Wonderland that is shaped out by Alice herself. Along with the corrupted Alice mind and the corrupted Wonderland the creatures that once lived there also became corrupted and even though I found the enemies to be really well designed at first, they quickly get repeated over and over throughout the entirety of the game but they still provide solid and enjoyable combat scenarios.Alice Madness Returns tells you the story of how Alice thinks she's responsible for the fire that burned down her house and also killed her parents and sister. She gets the help of a doctor from an asylum which tries to make her forget about what happened and that it wasn't her fault. By thinking that she was responsible for the death of her family, her mind becomes corrupted, and so the Wonderland, and this is where the game takes place. Throughout the game you'll visit various regions of the Wonderland which have become corrupted and each one them has been designed in a very unique way.Alice Madness Returns is pretty much a straight up linear third person action game with alot of platforming segments, puzzles, minigames and alikes. The game rewards exploration by giving you extra health and teeth, which you can use to upgrade your weapons (knife, hammer, pepper gun and tea cannon), not only you get small benefits by exploring but you'll also be able to collect ""memories"". Memories are audio logs that when picked up they will trigger a memory of someone you know on the real world, this, in my opinion, makes the storyline progression not that linear in the way that if you don't explore and don't collect all the memories you probably won't get certain parts and you won't understand the game that well. The gameplay is pretty simple, you walk/run, you can jump, glide while in the air and jump multiple times while in the air, this is the key, along with great timing, to solve alot of ""jumping puzzles"" that are scattered throughout the entire game. I mentioned above that there are also some kind of puzzles and mini games, the two examples I can think of right now is some kind of minigame which plays pretty much like Super Monkey Ball and another one is chess, except that in this chess you have a maximum number of moves that you need to use in order to move two pieces of the chessboard to a certain location by moving them at the same time (pressing right will make one piece go to your right and the other piece move to your left, inverted chess if you can call it that way).Besides what I already mentioned I think nothing else needs to be told about this great video game. Absolutely gorgeous environments and music, well designed and breathtaking scenarios, surprisingly good and interesting storyline and characters along with the solid and satisfying hack and slash combat are reason more than enough for me to recommend this game and for you to pick it up.

												Alice: Madness Returns.(What is it?)This game is a twisted take on Alice's wonderland, often macabre and dark,  sometimes just gloomy, this game touches on topics like denial, insanity, murder and molestation, and the story is probably the darkest i've ever seen in a video game.  The story has a TON of twists and plot holes, though i wont spoil it, if you have any triggers about ♥♥♥♥, insanity, denial, murder and so on; do NOT buy this game.Best storyline i've seen in a LONG time 9.5/10(Is the gameplay good?)In MY opinion, no, i do not like the platforming, and the combat is very flawed. The level design sometimes suprises me, but it's often just generic platforming with very little inspiration. I can tell that this game took inspiration from psychonauts and the previous alice game, however. it fails miserabely to emulate the charm and wit of those games. As quoting the children in the orphanage ""Mad as a hatter, without the charm"" I will not lie, the game has allot of suprises when it comes to gameplay, and dependant on what kind of gamer you are, these changes can make or break you. I did however feel a huge rush of adrenaline when in hysteria mode.Decent-ish combat, but sub-par level design. 6.4(I do not mean the graphics and visual stlye.)(How does the game look?)Put Psychonauts in a blender, add some denial and a few doll heads, and some rabbit blood to boot. There's your game. In all seriousness though, the game looks amazing. The visual styles often remind you of how you're inside alice's broken mind. Graphical quality could be better, the post-processing is ugly, and the game doesnt run as well as it should.Amazing visual styles, but i bet this game would run on the original xbox. 8.8(So is this game right for me?)If you're like me, you like a deep and dark storyline over amazing gameplay. The gameplay in this is not to my tastes, but the story is just perfect. I recommend playing the previous Alice, however, first. As I like a deep/dark story line WITH amazing gameplay, I'd play Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix over this any day, but this is so much darker.If you liked the walking dead and psychonauts, yes, this game is right for you.(Replay value?)Nothing for me, i doubt i'll go anywhere near the game now that i've completed it.No score for this yet.SUMMARY:8.5 The game is great, though very flawed, the story makes up for the lack of innovative level design, and  shabby combat. If you're just in it for the combat, don't get it. If you want a story that will be in your mind forever, It's well worth whatever you pay.Small update: Haven't played for about a year now, and I have no desire to.			"

												Alice... Alice... Alice... I have to say i was very skeptical about getting this game, seeing that im not as big on Alice in wonderland than a lot of mainstream society. I jumped into it and found it to be a very smooth game with devilish humor and dark suggestive intents. This game fits me perfectly as for my studies in college and career wise. It plays on psychological themes in Alice's mind. Her memories, and within those memories a very dark and gritty atmosphere. I have only just started this game and i feel i definitely got my money's worth and i plan on continuing this game. The graphics in this game.. although they're not amazing, they're clear, dark themed and her hair... my god, every strand of hair she has moves with her. They did quite amazing on the physics. This game not only captures a dark mind of a schizophrenic Alice, but involves a dark world with kind of a scary, horrific tendency to keep you compelled to keep playing. The combat is actually fun, i actually really enjoyed it and it's difference on crouching and dodging. It involves her teleporting into butterflies and shifting around the enemies. The combat so far uses a knife that can upgrade. it's actually quite fitting for the type of game it is. So i leave you with this, i recommend this game through and through and i'm not even done the story yet. When i do finish the story i will probably update this review even more but i just feel with this game it's too good to pass up. I just wish i had played the first one so i could understand everything. Enjoy this game.			"

												This game revisits the fantastic and equally unique, Quake-Engine built, American McGee's Alice, and went under the radar as a rough diamond at the time of release mostly because of its rushed release schedule, and in part because of how different it was. It's a relic of a better time in that it uses good old golden-era game design elements, like introducing you to new enemies every so often, teaching you how to use abilities and combat techniques, and then testing your skills with bosses and platforming sections. Some players will find frustration in these forced hold-backs and see them as restrictions, others will love the less forgiving gameplay.HighlightsExploring the world and discovering the, albeit thin, story and character history while passing through some stunning visuals is a real blast. I couldn't stop taking screenshots from start to finish and most of what makes this game so much damn fun to dig through comes from the diverse but always distinct and visually compelling art style.* Interesting, worthwhile collectibles and extras which add to the replay value. For example, unlocking new dresses gives you different abilities.* Some of the best visual elements and art styles of any game ever made, despite the now aging graphics and texture resolution.* Lots of interesting new gameplay elements as you progress and weapon design of a somewhat different calibre.* Old school Apply-What-You've-Learned boss battles and progresion.MistakesDevelopment for this title was rushed out by EA and it suffered as a result. Despite a number of small issues in different areas, it's a striking and alluring solidly built piece of awesome gaming which lets you to forgive its few mistakes.* Invisible walls, when coupled with the, at times, unpredictable controls can cause frustration and take away from the gameplay.* Mildly repetitive combat and lack of weapon variety despite the very interesting weapon designs are an oversight.* There are annoying bugs and a general lack of polish in some areas, and some underlying technical issues.RecommendationsAlice clocks in at an incredibly satisfying 13-15 hours of play time and even has lots replayability for completionists. It's fairly priced, currently at £14.99/9.99€/$19.99 it's cheapest by far from Europe. It goes on sale at -75% at least once per year on Steam, usually during the big sales and is well worth buying then.* Like most EA games, Alice: Madness Returns includes a free CD Key which can be redeemed on your Origin account/client. To activate, right click Alice in your library menu and select View CD Key, then simply redeem that key from inside Origin as you would any other game.* The DLC is included on Steam for free. It's hidden, but takes 60 seconds to activate. [Instructions to unlock the DLC are available here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=121133044)* While fine with a keyboard, Alice handles better with a controller.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is possibly the first game to make me wish that reviews had a third option: a shrug. A ""meh"". A non commital ""eh, it's alright.""Well, that went ahead and summed up my review. To explain, I need to emphasize that this game is in no way a bad game. It simply has too much going for it to be a bad game. The art style, something many agree upon in their reviews, is tremendous. Each scenic area is more beautiful, more mystifying, more creative, and more surreal than the last. The combat is visceral and feels great. Indeed, it is very responsive and very smooth. When you're not pitted against enemies, you're platforming, and the controls in a platformer need to be of a very high quality lest the player get upset that they're fighting the controls and camera. Alice: MR succeeds at this and provides more than enough options for the player to overcome any and all obstacles and jumps to be done.This sounds really positive, but honestly, these are the only positive things Alice: MR deserves, as it simply fails at so many other things. While the combat feels great, it gets incredibly repititive and boring, never really rising above any sort of difficulty. In fact, I died two times in the entire game, and felt challenged only in one of those two fights. Every single other encounter had me quickly dispatching the enemy and moving on, never really feeling like I was overcoming anything. On the other hand, the platforming feels great, but due to the fact that Alice gets three jumps as well as a long distance float, levels end up being stretched to large scales, creating a sense of emptiness. Indeed, while the levels look very pretty, they are also nearly completely lifeless and hollow.But you know what's worse than the levels being as lifeless and hollow as they are? The fact that they go on FOREVER. Seriously. Alice: MR should not have been longer than a five hour game in all honesty, but it took me fourteen hours of what I would describe as ""slogging"" through the game in hopes of finding a conclusion to the madness. The various chapters will pack a punch in the beginning but will ultimately fail to keep you interested not even before you get 1/6th of the way through a chapter. You'll be forced to perform some ridiculous pace breaking puzzle like solving a shifting cube puzzle or playing chess instead of simple progression, and believe me when I say that you will end up just skipping all of the minigames after a certain threshold of tolerance. Before every level there is a segment where Alice wanders through her city in a non combative, explorative manner, and honestly, this is the best part of the game. This is where all of the (very minimal) story is, and once it's over, you realize you're going to have to slog through 3-4 hours of repetitive gameplay before you get to have more story. And that's weird, right? Wanting the gameplay in a video game to be over with so you can enjoy the non gameplay parts. Guess that's just the sort of Madness in Alice: Madness Returns.I think the biggest problem stems from the fact that there is no hub world like, say, Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie, Instead of getting a variety of small but interesting levels with lots to do, you are forced onto a ""train"" of endless repetitiveness and linearity. Imagine if Super Mario Sunshine had no Delfino Plaza but, instead, you simply moved from one level to the next, and instead of these levels being detailed and full of stuff to do, they were stretched out into a blank, empty shell of its former self. Actually, I guess that kind of sounds like New Super Mario Land. Huh.So, do I recommend Alice: MR? Yes, but with a huge caveat: it's entertaining, but only in the shortest bursts. Attempting to play for too long will drive you... quite mad.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game. My initial reaction was that it handles horribly, but once you actually get past the real world and into Wonderland the game really opens up and allows for excellent platforming and combat. The pinned down and awkwardly restricted feel of being in the real world serves to highlight how liberating going to Wonderland is for Alice, even if it has been overrun by horrible monsters. The story is dark and quite cleverly written, which really helps to drive the whole game along and keep you wanting to find out more (as if exploring the scenery and cutting up creepy slime-oozing dolls wasn't enough to keep you moving through Wonderland). Collecting memories as you explore your damaged mind helps to slowly reveal the entirety of the story in all its ugliness. Definitely worth a play; I would have to list this amongst my very favourite games such as Psychonauts and Second Sight. 10 out of 10, would psychoanalyse.			"

I came across some pretty bad bugs which I know most people that have this game on Steam do experience.      This is one of my most favorite games but EA really didn't give any patches for the many glitches in this game. I couldn't use my umbrella or do anything what so ever (other than walk) when I was big Alice. I searched the internet everywhere and I tried everything that people have suggested. But nothing worked. It started to look like I wasn't going to be able to go any further into this game because I kept running into problems that seemed impossible to over come.     How I got around EVERY GLITCH I CAME ACROSS, I plugged in a controller! For some reason the computer keys would never work (no matter how many times I changed or reset them). Try using a controller for the parts you can't get past. It was the only thing that worked for me!Hope this helped!			"

												Charming, twisted and beautiful; a 3D platformer set in a darkened, nightmare dreamscape of the Wonderland mythos. Aside from the theme, what sets Alice: Madness Returns apart from other 3D platformers? The answer here would be, without a doubt, the environments. The platforming itself isn't taxing, it's simply the mode through which we traverse the obscenely pretty level design; whether it be the Victorian, smokey and claustrophobic city; the pristine fantasy of Wonderland, contrasted very quickly with a horror-packed perverted version of; a dirty, mechanical Hatter's domain; or an underwater grotto. What of the gameplay? The platforming is fun, and whilst not difficult, it's not dull either, and is often spiced up with some combat - which, with a controller, feels fairly robust, isn't overwhelming and offers a satisfying break from platforming. The story, in collusion with the environments, delves into the sick mind of our mad Alice, spiralling downwards with a half-memory of burning her home, and in the process, killing her family. As is often hinted at, Alice is duelling with real-life turmoil manifesting itself through her fallen-from-grace Wonderland, and therein lies the key element of the game, the pivotal relationship between her unreconciled conscious and unconscious.  All in all, Alice: Madness Returns feels cohesive and well put together. The gameplay is solid, but the real reason to play is the journey you'll take.			"

I've always loved dark twists on Alice in Wonderland, but this one truly takes the tea-cake! I love it!			"

												This is a complete solid game. I trully recommand it. Great story and art style mixed in a imaginative dark and twisted atmosphere. Audio is also very good, combat system is not bad and platform system is well used by developers.This game is kinda unique, you should definitely get it.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I went in with not much of an idea what the game was, but I expected a dark themed Wonderland with some Wonderland themed enemies, weird looking scenarios, and maybe something more of a horror story. Sadly, that wasn't what I got.What is the game? Imagine God of War, with less fighting, more awkward floaty jumped platforming and stuff to collect that you might not even know what it does, and no boss fights even though it teases you like there's going to be one, but then cancels it, plus a very weird narrative that you are supposed to care for.Do I recommend it? Well, no, not if you're expecting greatness from this game. If you're on for a mediocre game that in terms of gameplay puts nothing new on the table, and has a story that might get more interesting and twisted and psychological towards the end (which I personally still hope it does, as I have yet to see anything like that), then sure, go for it.To mark my point it might just be better to list what I liked and what I didn't. Just keep in mind that these are my opinions and that I have yet to complete the game, and these are the points I already feel are faulty for the enjoyment of this game. Let's start with the dislikes:· The camera acceleration is too fast and feels wonky, as in unstable. When in first person view though it becomes too slow.· Weapon upgrades that just upgrade the weapon and give it a new look, what new features it has beside that? Who knows, more damage? Maybe, didn't feel like much though after upgrading the knife twice.· Enemies. The common enemy is a petrol blob with a baby doll face and some tubes on it's back. Then there's a giant version of it with more faces and doll arms. A floating version also exists and who knows what else. Not the most interesting enemies to see. Each zone seems to have 2-3 extra monsters in it, which is still underwhelming to be honest. Industry zone has a nice looking mechanical tea pot, which fits the theme of the Mad Hatter, flying screws that come from a metal nest, not the fanciest of designs, and some goblins with cutlery and cups as helmets, which are fine. Water zone has walking Angler fish and crabs with a cannon arm and a cigar to light it, yay?· The combat lock camera and parry. You want to fight multiple enemies at once and parry? Then you shall only lock onto one and THEN be able to use the parry, and while locked, not know what comes from behind as you can't really move the camera and are constantly facing the enemy.· No boss fights. The thing I hoped would happen after so many repetitive fights, but no, there are no boss fights, which might have been even a good idea, cause who knows how they might have turned out.· Bugs. Most noticeable during a 2D ship segment, which is supposed to be able to fire, yet none of the commands worked, not even in a secret room which had a harder version of that segment. Sometimes a line is said just before another characted finished his. Some say there are more, I haven't found them yet, thank god.· The jumps are way too floaty and combined with the weird camera you'll probably miss a lot of jumps, specially since most of the game seems to be floating platforms.· The soundtrack (if I dare call it so). I read praise for it, yet when I play the game, all I can hear is a 5 tune loop that becomes very repetitive, obnoxious and boring. It makes the platforming even less entertaining. It just feels slow.· Alice's voice acting. For a character that at the start of the game narrates that she's traumatized and her Wonderland is broken and twisted, as the imagery suggests, she sounds pretty uninterested when she actually lands there. She sounds the same in all the conversations I've heard her speak yet. The other characters at least put some emotion or charisma in it, whereas Alice probably could see her house go on fire (again) and say ""Oh, well that isn't pleasant at all, what a shame, better move along"".· The graphic designs of the levels. I've seen 3 areas, and I only liked the first one, as it was Wonderland, it was nature mixed with weird elements like domino pieces, statues, the potion that lets you shrink, the colors. It was nice to look at indeed. The other two areas, well.. The second is an industry level, which, oh joy, mostly greyish and brown colors, like in all the other games, though admitedly, some rooms where alright when mixed with the lava fountains. Third area, water levels (without the physics), cause everyone loves them, specially when it's all dark, the wall decoration doesn't stick out much, and once again, there isn't much to look at. And yes, I said I expected a dark themed Wonderland, but then again, what part of this is it? And if you make the platforming boring, at least make the visuals more fancy.· The narrative. The point that should get you hooked, but kinda fails to do so, at least for me. Care as this part might contain a bit of spoilers until the 3rd area, which is where i'm currently at. It starts with you telling your Doc your trauma in the real world, which is pretty ♥♥♥♥, as you might expect and that's perfectly fine. Then you're sent off to get some medicine, on the way you encounter people with weird rabbit faces (which would have been nice enemies, but I have yet to see them), which turn out to be illusions which disappear after an old lady talks to you. Till this point, I found it pretty good. Then you are on a rooftop with the old lady, some dialogue happens, she gets a weird rabbit head, the floor breaks and you fall into neverland. I suppose that it despicts your mind while you fainted in real life. What I don't get is how after the 1st and 2nd area, you go back to the real life world, and have her wake up at a port, there's not too much that explains it, and once again Alice does not sound concerned at all. Meanwhile in Wonderland, the part that you play more actively, you ""have"" to collect your memories, which are very loose sentences someone spoke, either your doctor, or your therapist, or family. I say ""have"" because it seems to be more of an optional task, as you can miss them, simply ignore to collect them, and some are even hidden (though not too much either because the game tells you everything about the level). So, while there are cutscenes after long whiles and completing an area, which talk about Alice's past, these memories do so as well, yet not really in a satisfactional way. I remember one saying something alike ""Some insects eat their young, Alice. They have much to teach us, alive or dead."", which only made me question what the hell that had to do with my house burning down.I really don't know if I'm missing something because I haven't played the first Alice game, but this one feels just weird.Things that I liked:· Alice's character design and change of dress when in a different area.. The idea of a twisted Wonderland.. The characters you encoutner and their voice acting.			"

												Alice: The Madness returns is a game where the enjoyment of the gameplay and narrative may stand apart from eachother.Let's start with the part that  ends up failing: Its platforming.There is a distinction to be made between not challenging and boring or tedious. In this game's case, it is the latter when speaking of it's platforming element, the practise of jumping across platforms to reach your destination.While the difficulty of the jumping puzzles does raise slightly, it rarely introduces new elements or methods of thinking that help you pass future puzzles. The gimmick remains simple. Jump platforms until you can no more, shrink yourself to see secret platforms or keyholes, and flick switches and shoot targets to progress further. The implementation of the latter two eventually ends up to be slightly confusing in the last chapter, but not excessively so.This simply is a case of a gaming element that is it's weakest part, while being omnipresent. If the platforming wasn´t basically the only method of transportation throughout the game, it could´ve been forgiveable. But right now it becomes a question of whether the game can be redeemed by it's strengths.One thing that surely is not one of it's strengths is the combat. A lot of interest from this games comes from people having played the original American McGee's Alice. There, the platforming was somewhat reduced and combat took a much higher priority.In Alice: Madness Returns, combat takes a little bit of a backseat. The grand array of weaponry has been replaced with your faithful old knife, a pepper grinder for a quick firing ranged weapon, a Hobby Horse as your heavy attack and a Teapot as a heavy bombardment firearm. Each of these are unlocked throughout the game, and do tend to play a part in progressing the platforming. But not in a Metroidvania style, of course. There's no level backtracking, which is good because that only helps one of the games strengths stand out: The design.If there is one thing that the game developers did spot on, it was level design. In many levels, you feel like things have been hand placed. Every area feels unique, and are beautiful in their own respect. Seldom have I felt as enticed to just stop and look at the areas that I pass, as I have with this game. While I will not say that there have been some less interesting corridors, they are far and few between. All in all, the world does not just imply madness, it genuinely invites the player to believe that they are in a world of fantasy, where they can safely forget the rules of reality. And a play on reality this game really is, at least when going by it's story...The story of Alice: Madness Returns is not the best I've ever experienced. In the end, it did not make me think deeply or differently about the things that I already knew in life. But it follows three storylines and beautifully merges them together at the right time. These storylines are mainly Alice in reality, dealing with events around her as she tries to manage menial tasks ; her investigation of why her 'Wonderland' is slowly falling to ruin ; and her placing pieces together of her past, the burning of her home and family that left her in this state to begin with. These three branches meet in the end and reveal the final plot, which wasn't very surprising, but very well orchestrated nonetheless.Alice: Madness Returns is not very good as a game. But as a narrative story that allows some interaction, mainly serving progress, it can manage to suck you in and make you want to finish it. Which is the way that everyone should experience this game:Play it once, enjoy and experience the story to it's fullest and end, and keep that experience with you. But probably not play it again.Priced 10 at time of writing, a 50% off should certainly justify the purchase of this title.Get this game if you are interested in a good story and are curious about American McGee's version of the Alice universe. Put the game on easy (there are no achievements to speak of) and try to muscle through the platforming, and you'll be rewarded with a worthy storyline, well narrated and voiced appropriately.			"

I Re-downloaded the game on Origin, and the game wouldn't launch. I've owned this game for 4 months now, and I havent been able to play it once, due to so many glitches.I have re-installed, I have spoken to tech support, I have set compatibility modes, ran as admin.. Nothing works.I do not recommend purchasing this game. Simple as that. "

												Bought this game then proceeded to spend three quarters of my waking hours over the next few days spelunking through the depths of Alice's insanity, the girl's got issues, to say the least. And after that dose of crazy, I've been having funky dreams, too. Been a while since a game drew me in this much. Consider this TL;DR.Now onwards, to the good, the bad, and the ugly.THE GOOD:The aesthetics. The scenery is really satisfying and pretty, even when obviously bad things are happening. It changes slowly, sometimes subtly, but you can't help but notice how broken Alice's mind is once you scratch the surface. And the journey is going to be long, indeed. Things will get worse before they get better. Also Alice's dresses, they're lovely and fit the theme of whichever part of her mind she's currently in. Complete mood whiplash when you swap into the monochrome-with-red Hysteria mode that's one of the best visual depictions of psychotic episodes I've ever seen.The combat. It flows nicely, and all enemies have their weak and strong spots. A few occasions will pit you against a formidable challenge, and split-second decisions will need to be made to survive. The weapons are imaginative and you can switch between them seamlessly, and Alice isn't shy about using them. The variety of enemies is decent, and all of them represent some mental problem Alice is dealing with. You also get a last stand mechanic, once you're down to your last rose, you can enter Hysteria mode (or ""Psycho Mode"" as I like to call it) which renders you invincible and increases damage for a short while (while looking awesomely morbid and badass), and if you gather more health while under effect, you can chan it if you drop to a single rose again. Don't get too reliant on it, though, later on many enemies can do enough damage to not even let you have the chance to use it.The sounds. From Alice's voice acting that does wonders for relaying her personality and Cheshire Cat cryptic snarking, to the ambient sounds and the soundtrack itself, you won't even notice most of it because it flows so seamlessly into the setting and just becomes part of the whole experience. The subtle puns. ""Train of thought"", ""Jumping off the slippery slope"" and ""Shattered mind"" are quire real in the Wonderland, to say the least.The ending. It leaves things open to interpretations, of which I have at least three competing ones at the moment, ranging from mildly optimistic to downright depressing, and none of them is more likely than any other. It's that kind of game.THE BAD:The lack of bosses, especially since it's obvious they were planned, but only one made it to release. Why did that happen? Well, likely budget or deadline problems, and considering who published the game, that doesn't surprise me. There are some tough, mini-boss like enemies, but they can't both present challenges at significant points of the game, AND not get a little repetitive as the time goes by.The game feels shorter than it could have been. There's more to explore, Alice's mental issues run deep indeed, and at times I felt as if things were unraveling too fast, some characters aren't explored as deeply as they could have been. With the cast, content and concept, this game could have been made considerably longer, however...The platforming sections sometimes feel too long, and start screaming ""filler"" at you. Especially in the first and fifth chapter, there were extended times when I felt I wasn't actually doing anything, nor getting any closer to the underlying mental taint while I spent long periods of time getting from point A to point B. The platforming puzzles themselves are okay, but sometimes too concentrated.The focus mode. While combat is good, this is one aspect that simply doesn't work. The focus mode only really works one-on-one since it forces you into wonky camera angles, so aside from the scene not looking as gracefully badass as it couls, the beasties trying to eat your brain from directions other than twelve o' clock are going to become a real problem. This mode is reduced to something you use to deal with the strong enemies once you've dispatched the trash mooks through normal (and impressive-looking!) combat. A shame, really, because it has much potential for blocking and ranged combat.The occasional glitches. The only one I really ran into occasionally was invisible ankle-high-walls in the middle of nowhere that I got stuck on and had to jump over which cost me just enough time to have to restart the jumping puzzle, but people also report crashing and the like.THE UGLY:The truth. Not going to spoil, but bloody hell, the truth is ugly.Several enemy types. If you think being insane could be kind of cool, remember that you really don't want these abominations traipsing through your skull. Sanity is not overrated.Everyone except Alice. Honestly, pretty much everyone except the protagonist looks like they just crawled out of the gutter. Whether it's just her perception of everyone is up to interpretation. I'd say that it likely is, especially considering who the only other relatively normal-looking character is.THE BOTTOM LINE:If you like platformers, atmospheric horror, and disturbing, morbid content, this is a game for you if you're willing to forgive its flaws and the fact that it requires EA authentication (but not an Origin account, oddly enough). Oh, and this game definitely isn't something you want to let your kids play in the evening.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a mad game: its style is mad, its soundtrack is mad, even its story is mad. Alice and every character are crazy and I fell in love with this madness.  BUT:  this game is one of the most repetitive games I've ever played and it's just too long compared with what it actually has to offer. Another thing I can't stand is the totally dumb camera while using the lock system, it makes you go crazy. Also, this game is meant to be played with a controller.			"

												A good third-person Action/Adventure Platformer with varied weapons, enemies, collectibles, locations and even gameplay.Great art, story and protagonist.It has a casual design with simple mechanics and most everything being explained to you before you can figure them out for yourself, you can even skip the already few puzzles.The combat works but the narrow camera angle makes it hard to see enemies around you, a lot of spinning is necessary.Also you can't switch to enemies off-screen with the Lock-On system, so you have to constantly turn it on and off as it is needed to fight some of the enemies.Getting used to these things makes the combat better.The biggest problem I have with the game is the fact that most of what you do in it is traverse environments devoid of enemies but FULL of easy ""puzzles"" like putting weight on a pressure plate for a platform to go up.Ignoring collectibles/sidetracks makes the experience flow a lot better.The music is great, but most tracks are short and get repetitive quickly.You'll need to change some things in .ini files to go above 30 FPS and unlock the extra content.Check the Steam guides.Played with a wired Xbox 360 controller.

In the end, I think about him like a mysterious friend, but still a friend...Alice is a game where you face the reality of mentally abused child that became an adolescent with mental problems, her wonderland is her perfect world where she can win their enemies and fight for her desires. All the fight against her enemies is her way to face difficult, wonderland is a place where the evil humans are monsters and even the good ones are bizarre creatures. Her memory is what can maintain Wonderland in one piece, her lost of memory is what makes it in many pieces. The poor Alice had a horrible life, but she faces all that in Wonderland, a place that always exists in her heart, in Wonderland she is capable of win.Some quotes that I enjoyed are:Save myself? From death? Is that it? Is that why I've come here? I'm not afraid to die. Times I've welcomed death! (Alice);A secret is only a secret when it is unspoken to another. (Cheshire);Different denotes neither bad nor good, but it certainly means not the same. (Cheshire);Authority must be obeyed, or it must be overthrown! (The Queen of Hearts). "

												It's really good... yet flawed. The game is excessively linear and can feel a bit repetitive after the first chapters. There's a lot of platforming sections, and I really think you should use a controller to be more precise with your movements. Also unlocking the 30 fps cap helps a lot because it will obviously make the game feel a lot more responsive. You are also sometimes presented with puzzles and mini-games, but these tend to be very basic and fail to result interesting... some of the mini-games simply outstay their welcome. The combat is fast and feels good, thanks to interesting weapons and some creative enemies. Yet the camera does sometimes go nuts when you lock on targets, it gets stuck in the most unconvenient of angles.Aside from solving puzzles, fighting stuff and jumping from platform to platform, the game doesn't really offer much more in terms of gameplay. It took me 12 hours to finish it on hard difficulty and I have to say I don't really feel like going for a second playthrough. I guess I could raise the difficulty to nightmare, find all the collectibles (they add details to the main story) and maybe change the voice acting to my native language but... 12 more hours are going to feel like a lot of time now that I know how the story unfolds.The narrative and writing in this game is what really got me, I think it's pretty good. Many things are left unclear because Alice is costantly in a state of deep mental confusion, so that you are left with interpreting a lot of stuff on your own. Including the meaning of the ending sequence. The developers have revealed what you may call the canonical meaning for the ending of the game, but it doesn't really feel much of a payoff to me, so I am willing to simply reject it in favour of my own interpretation. Another strong aspect in the game is the overall graphical design. Every chapter takes place in completely different landscapes, and all of them feel very inspired and sick. The screenshots in the store page don't really show you that much, but this is a game where Alice's mind is on the verge of complete and utter madness, so don't expect Wonderland to look all cute and safe. Even the real world sections are great and succeed in depicting industrial London as a grim, dirty and vicious place. The beginning of chapter 2 is the only part of the game which I didn't like from a graphical standpoint, but that section lasts merely half an hour.Keep in mind that you will need to activate the game via an EA account before you can play it, and that buying it from Steam will NOT give you access to the DLC and to the original game American McGee's Alice... though it is possible to unlock the DLC by changing a single parameter in the same .ini file that you need to tweak in order to get rid of the fps cap.To summarize, avoid the game if you don't like platforming. Do not expect any replay value unless you like hunting for collectibles. Use a controller, enjoy the writing and aesthetics and don't miss the train!			"

												I love Alice:Madness Returns. It's a wonderful perspective of the classic Alice in Wonderland story. It centers around Alice being insane, suffering from the guilt of killing her family by accidentally setting her house on fire while everyone was trapped inside. (Don't worry, by the way: none of this is spoiler) Bereft of a home she's forced to move into an orphanage for kids with troubled pasts. While there she gets treated by a psychologist who advises her to create a ""happy place"" in her mind, also know as ""Wonderland"". However, her inner turmoil slowly begins to pervade and poison Wonderland, causing it to decay and fall apart. Throughout the game her favoriate imaginary pet/spirit animal/Jiminy Cricket Cheshire, along with the other iconic characters of the book, guides her through her tattered mind in an attempt to help fix Wonderland, and, by extension, herself. However as she digs deeper into her mind, she finds that all is not how it seems.The game is absolutely beautiful; everything you would have read in the book is here is this game, but completely reimagined to fit the new story. Most of time, you'll be tempted to just stop and oggle at all the beautiful, colorful structures there are. The developers attempted to encompass quite a couple different art styles in the game as well. There's one chapter where everything has been imagined as if it came off the scroll of a traditional Japanese painting. It's eery but still beautiful at the same time.It's your traditional platformer; not much to say here. You run, you jump, you try to keep from falling. That's not really the most difficult part of the game, but it can be challenging when the platforms move around so creatively. It gets difficult at some very rare times, but not so much to become frustrating.The part that sold me the most was the fighting. Over time Alice is equipped with a unique arsenal of weapons, each specifically tailored to handle a particular set of enemies. She has a knife for elegant-yet-deadly combos, a hobby horse for hard-hitting skull-bashing, a pepper shaker that doubles as an smg, a tea kettle cannon ('nuff said), and a dainty little umbrella to repel and block the heavy hits she can take. And if all of that isn't enough she come fitted with a dodge that allows her back-stab/smash just anyone that gets in her way, which, in this game, is just about everyone.Overall, the game attempts to have a little something for everybody, at least, those interested in RPGs, anyway. There's puzzles, fighting gauntlets, 2D and 3D platforming, ball-rolling puzzles, shmupping, and some other stuff I've probably missed. If some of those don't tickle you, then don't worry. They happen in chapter formation, so even if you don't like a particular mechanic, you won't see it for too terribly long.The game is great! I would totally buy it if you love beautiful scenery and excellent fights!			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic.

I have pc that runs witcher 3 smoothly with high settings, and this game lags if there's plenty of enemies in the battle.Overall rating: 4.3/5Ps. It's summer sale.

The gameplay is also good, but you probably won't like using the default controls, and the camera can be a little obnoxious at times, but nothing frustrating.I just wish the prequel was available on steam.

												What Alice excels at is great great creativity. Every piece of the environment seems to have been thought of and not just thrown away or recycled. While diving into a more and more corrupted Wonderland, you will discover memories of what has happened and try to put the pieces of the puzzle together. The jumping off an on platforms becomes increasingly difficult to the point of pure frustration (or maybe that's just me). While this happened more than once,( because i really suck at jumping), I absolutely enjoyed the game, as dark and disturbing as it is. I do admit that leaving aside the story behind it, I really stayed for the eye-candy. And the awesome dresses :) "

												Flawed, but a very...interesting action/platformer/adventure/thing.The setting and aesthetic and everything is downright amazing. The different levels are completely different and are all downright brilliant.The story is...fairly interesting, if a little flat.Gameplay varies between platformer and spectacle fighter; it's alright. The camera and auto-targeting have a habit of being painful (dodging into enemies or getting hit regardless). Nothing really special. The major complaints are that it does drag on a bit (the levels could be, say, 25% shorter) and that the auto-targeting issues tend to be an annoyance after a while.It's definitely a very unique game I'd recommend playing.

												""Only the savage regard the endurance of pain as the measure of worth""-cheshire cat Alice Madness returns Takes place almost almost as soon as you leave The asylum from the First game and Return to the World of Wonderland...not only is wonderland Shattering but most of its inhabitants Though Deranged and Wicked are also feeling the effects of alice's own Horrific Imagination.  *Note that i beat alice on nightmare and got 99% complete, =( missed like 2 Memories </3    Mechanics wise for a Platforming/Adventure game Alice plays very solid as the combat is Fluid and somewhat Forgiving with some heal drops from slain enemies, but Difficutly can be ramped up with the Cosmetics like denying Those heal drops and only recovering health through special Flowers found in the level.  Controls Feel Great on PC with Key board and mouse, though i believe it is possible to hook up your Xbox Controller. The only problem i have found is that the camera tends to Swing left and right very dramatically while exploring in areas where the developers wanted a sudden change in camera angle (though not game breaking). Jumping from platform to platform and other various puzzles feels great.    Art Style and Presentation is off the chart, this game had some talented designers since every chapter is a diffrent theme, impressive and not even campy. From Bizzare land scapes to under water Habitats, very gruesome killings, body parts, decapitations, hangings, etc  it is all well done, the game puts you into a very immersive ride through alice's Story. Character designs are great, even a Enemy or two actually gave me chills while fighting them, especially in the kids land...*shivers*   THough the game differs from the 1st alice, it plays really well along with some old returning characters more as Interactable characters and plot devices. With a slew of Toys such as the Memorable Vorpal Blade, The Hobby horse that breaks most if not all gaurds, A shield that knocks enemy attacks back and some long range fire power, there is a multitude of ways to beat your enemies but employing and quickly switching too and fro through all your weapons is a must skill to have if you wish to live long enough on higher difficulties.Locking on to enemies is a great way to Focus fire and dispatch weaker ones, i found it more usefull to actually not lock on for bigger fights and use a combo of Hobby horse/Pepper grinder/Rabbit bomb ;D manual fight! dont be a scrub ;DNow those are some Good points, now lets talk about some downers.1. EA registration is involved i believe (i downloaded this game a long time ago but just got around to it, might have changed)2. 30 FPS, this is the Unreal engine on a PC, why in all that is Sane is it 30FPS? you can unlock it in your Alice Engine file to make it go 60 FPS (you should) then the game will feel like you are in a movie, its incredible. here is a guide http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=235427066 3. Limited Graphical option for being a Unreal Engine game, only AA, Gama, Bloom, and Physix. woop de doo...4. You ned to unlock the DLC, guide here--->http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1211330445. The game tends to Crash/stop and go, this could be with current Nvidia drivers, i have had this GTX660 when i downloaded Alice and played long ago and ran like Butter, but now its having some weird crashes, so im gonna guess its Current patches that botched it all up, not to much of a problem but really sucks to restart. (in short Performance may vary)6. Akward camera angles when exploring at times when developers change the camera angle on you.*This game is for everyone who likes fast action Platformers, a moderatly Good Combat System thats not to in depth but enough to have fun, and a Driving Story that actually makes you hunt down for the extra Items for more back ground story to connect and make sense of! Did i mention the Story is full of twist and turns? gruesome scenes? Funny commentary, disturbing spikes of Slaughter, demented children, Tim burton-esk Themes, Prostitution, Acts of violence upon kids?! yes and more! then this is for you!!Alice Madness returns 8/10    * a under dog Game with a Hype Story and game play!and once the Madness is over...well who is to say...that it is truley is over?   =3			"

I get the feeling some cutscenes have been cut and lack the contet the developers were originally planning dor them. In the end of the game especially. The controls are a bit rough and i find movement in general being rather unsatisfying. The setting in the game world on the other hand is very unsettling and made very well. Tho it has it's set of invisible walls, to me the world was a huge plus. Something not every game gets right. This of course is my personal opinion and majority could be finding the world rubbish. The game sure had it's moments but I get the feeling it's not finished so I can't recommend it.			"

												(I'd like to point out that this review was written before the whole ""I recieved this game for free"" checkmark box became a thing so I think it would be good to state before reading what I have to say about the game that I recieved it as a gift from a friend for free.)This game is awful. Let me start off by saying that I wanted to like it. I had wanted it for years and when I finally got it for a gift I was estatic because I've been wanting to play it for so long. The concept is beautiful, the horror atmosphere with the unique weapons and gothic take on Wonderland appealed to me more than anything. But then I played it on Nightmare mode.I assumed through my vast experience in playing insanely difficult games that I could handle Nightmare mode (and 13 hours in I'm still convinced that anything lower would have been too easy) right off the bat. In playing Nightmare mode, as unforgivable as I expected it to be, I slowly grew to despise this game and can safely say that I will never purchase or play another Spicy Horse game after this.Why is the game awful? Well, here's why:1) Clipping - Clipping is usually something that's never an issue in video games. Usually the developer understands that it's better to underclip and make a few objects that a part of the terrain mere textures so that the area is easier to move through for the player and removes the problem of the terrain being an issue during combat, puzzles, anything at all really. In Alice: Madness Returns the clipping seems uber random and is the one of the most annoying things about the game. Every single texture is a part of a clipped object. Literally all of them. I'm sure there may be a few of textures that aren't clipped, but from what I've seen, every single thing is clipped. So what? Well, now, in the middle of fights you'll get randomly stuck on gravestones or in the middle of a shinking puzzle you'll get caught on the edge of an invisable platform and oops, because of that error you're either dead or at the beginning of the puzzle again.2) Hitboxes and Colision - The hitboxes in this game are gigantic and the way hitboxes colide is infuriating. The hitbox for every attack is 100% garunteed to be larger than the animation for the attack, the hitbox of Alice is bigger than she is so the already large hitbox of the attack easily hits you unless you've made an awkwardly large amount of space between you and your oponent. The hitboxes of the enemies? Also overly sized. This means that while you're already getting caught on every single surface, you're also getting caught on every single stationary enemy. Lovely.3) Checkpoints - I want to punch whoever decided where to place the checkpoints in this game in the face. Let's look at an example: In Chapter 3 once you get into Wonderland, you're faced with a large enemy as a part of learning how to use a new weapon you just obtained. The enemy is uber strong and on Nightmare mode can kill you in a single hit (though Nightmare mode is the hardest difficulty, so I expected that to happen; I am in no way complaining about the damage the enemies deal). Once you beat that enemy? Checkpoint. Great! I won't have to redo that terrifying fight. Then I do a few parts of a jump puzzle, fight a pseudo-boss, do more jumping puzzles and - oops - ten minutes past that initial checkpoint I died. Ah, that's alright, there's no way I didn't run into another checkpoint, right? Right...? Wrong! Back to the beginning of the chapter you go! I shouldn't have to explain why that's annoying.4) Jumping Physics - I still don't even understand them. Ever since the first jumping puzzle I haven't been able to understand them. The ""Float"" mechanic that you're allowed to use after a jump that replaces an extra jump (you can jump three times mid air, which I found to be way more useful) is useless, Jumping mid-air does nothing after your first mid-air jump while the rest just... I don't even know, prolong the inevitable fall? On top of that, every time you land you slip all over the surface you just landed on which makes the jumping puzzles insanely annoying.5) Forced Fights - Forced fights in a game aren't bad. They make the player have to face the strong enemies and learn how to conquer them, and I like that. But when 99% of the combat in your game is forced, you're doing it wrong. When some of your fights are clones of previous fights in the game and they're still forced, you're doing it wrong. When your fights require memorisation in order to clear on the hardest difficuty, you are doing it wrong. Essentially the forced fights in every chapter work out like this: First, introducing a new enemy that's kinda difficult that you have to learn your way around. Not really that hard, usually beatable in the first try. Not a problem. Second, locking you in a room with that new enemy and a pseudo-boss. Kinda annoying, but the hierarchy of threat is pretty clear in this game, so not impossible. Towards the end of the chapter, locking you in a room with at least two pseudo-bosses and a rapid income of high strength grunts. This is annoying - no - infuriating, and in some cases impossible unless the perfect series of events occur.This game is not worth $20. This game is annoying, infuriating, and I would be upset had I spent real money on it.			"

												Overall, it's a very nice game, I can only recommend.I loved the atmosphere, and the story.The combat system is meh, there are mobs what can be defeated in only one way. Good thing that they don't tell you how, you have to figure it out.The jumping puzzles were enjoyable, other puzzles were not too hard, but enough to keep us entertaining between 2 combats.Graphics is a bit outdated( obviously, it's not a today's game ), but nothing serious.It's a little buggy, little rough, but definitely a good game.

												Alice: Madness Returns is an adventure game that features the characters and settings that are all derived from the classic Alice in Wonderland. Our character suffers from the trauma of losing her parents, and is seeking therapy from a psychiatrist, Angus Bumby. Without stating or implying any spoilers here, it is clear that the methods Mr. Bumby is using are not effective. Alice is still at a constant struggle to recover her own sanity. That is the basis of the plot. Bland and not too hard to find in the Horror genre of games from my experience, but with its own story that is different from the old novel. So there is some credit there for its originality.The gameplay is where the fun comes in. Yes, you will meet those inevitable moments of trying to stay in the air, on the edge of a platform or having ½ life point left while facing a strong monster (i.e Colossal Ruin). The monsters have their own individual weaknesses and strengths that we must consider to strategize/defeat them – examples being the red gem of the Eyepot that we must target when in combat with them, and to aim for the mask of any ‘Ruin’ type creatures. With each chapter you complete, you're introduced to new enemies, puzzles and new challenges along with the old ones. I remember always being thrilled to see what’s new in store, when we, as Alice, enter a new world and after completing the former chapter. It’s as though we are given small rewards for our progress which is an effective way to grasp and keep the player invested. Alice even has her clothes changed when she starts a new chapter!That being said, you can tell that the artists have placed in a lot, if not the most, effort into the game’s aesthetic appeal. The original characters from Alice in Wonderland have been re-designed, and Alice’s Wonderland never fails to baffle me with its stunning themes – from Oriental Grove (aka Mysterious East), to the deluded depths, the artists has touched on nearly every unique part of culture of our real world and has it implemented. There is also the wide variety of music, from calm and settling, to loud and eerie depending on our environment and how close we are to specific characters or monsters. One funny feature that I always find amusing is the snorting sounds that would alarm if a pig nose is nearby.The voice acting was also well made, and suited to the culture where the story takes place. Their accents and old-style English indicates that this is taking place in Britain. The major downside to this game however, is the repetitive nature of the game. There’s the likelihood that you will meet more former enemies then you will to meeting new ones, and having to repeat many of the same notions like invisible pathways to reach to an end.To sum everything that's said: the cons were the dull story that all wrapped up into a … slightly disappointing ending, and the repetitive nature of challenges. The pros however, were the stunning atmosphere (both Wonderland and the real world) the characters and its audio + music. I recommend buying this game, and give it a 2 thumbs up!			"

I simply loved the game. The story is very interesting and finding out Alice's memories is very exiting as well.The PC controlls are horrible so I highly advice you to play this game with a controller. I used Xbox360 controller and the controls were way better with that. After switching to controller the game felt much much better and movements were more fluent.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is by far one of the best games I have ever played. Alice is a strong female lead that although can do everything, she's still human. Struggling with her own mind you venture through her insanity and pick up the puzzle pieces together with her, figuring out what's really going on, what really happened. It felt refreshing and great to play as a young woman and I think many women will feel the same, she is fierce, witty and most of all, capable.Not only is her world and mind extremely beautiful, you will find many allies and really enjoy the combat. The world is so visually stunning and well thought trough. Her world is lurking with secrets and absurd creatures, and it is up to you to figure all this crazy mindboggling stuff out.If you're looking for a game were absurd and crazy comes into mind this is really the game for you. The combat is simple but yet very satisfying and easy to enjoy and learn. It is a casual game that's hard to not fall in love with. I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would.Would absolutely reccomend this game.			"

												Take a tour of Wonderland's shattered body. Mindbendingly beautiful and refreshing attempt at breaking the conventions laid by other more popular game franchises, it features engaging game play in diabolically captivating landscapes. Weaponry is devastating when used well and cute to watch.Cons; The larger bosses can be difficult if the method for their destruction is not adhered to - leaving little room for creative alternate solutions.The reward system leaves me flat - Early, I am nearly always too healthy and charged yet later, play involves a lot of time-critical evasion to refresh against ...say... savage Wasp attacks for example but I still enjoyed the battles thouroughly regardless. Pros; The puzzle aspects of the map and some of the mini-skills (see what I did there?) make for witnessing awe inspiring map design. The team Mr McGee selected for this adaptation shows a high level of dev skills to rival any of the more popular ""bang bang you're dead"" franchises.It has a relaxed state of pace, a sad alternating plot driving device and... well... magic, ffsA light refreshing couple of days or a few weeks for the time-poorGet this game and play it, you won't be sorry.

												This game has a decent story and amazing creative level designs, reminding me a lot of Psychonauts. (If you haven't played Psychonauts and you like this game, then you need to get on that.)Negatives would be the lack of options for camera controls (no invert horizontal camera), and the targeting system is very lame for how often you have to use it. Your target will basically lock on to whatever it wants and you cannot switch it directly, you have to turn it off and on (toggle or hold) until it catches onto the target you want, and often when surrounded by a ton of enemies, it's not going to typically lock on to the one you wanted. Then when you're locked on you cannot change the camera angle at all! This is fine when you just need to take out a bunch of mobs at ranged, but not when they get up close. This became extremely frustrating towards chapter 3. Melee/close range is flawed.Also the blocking ability does not have its own button when you play on a controller. you MUST be locked on to something to bring out your blocking umbrella. And if ""locking on a target"" is acting up, then good luck trying to block anything in time, as you must also be standing completely still to block. Your umbrella does make you basically invincible when you are able to bring it out in time. TIP: Also get that DLC early, you just need to lookup what line to change from False to True in some text file. Easy but dumb that you have to do that. The alternate dresses you can unlock are really overpowered so if you have trouble, just use one of those.There's some parts I wish weren't cinematics, they take it away from you and make you watch the little movie instead of letting you get to complete the bosses. That's kinda anti-climactic. The game definitely doesn't have enough real boss fights, just tons of ""mini bosses"" or over powered mobs who become redundant.Those are all my biggest complaints, these types of flaws wouldve been so easily fixed if they did slightly more testing or even a patch.Other than that, I definitely recommend the game if you're into surreal stories and you like platforms.

												[Full review of Alice: Madness Returns]Graphics:Not gonna lie, the graphics are not the strongest aspect of this game, so if that's your main focus then you may dissappointed. The graphics aren't necessarily bad though - just not the best. However, the art style is phenomenal. I mean I absolutely fell in love with the creepy environments and character designs. I even bought the art book for this game and have spent many hours going over the Timburton-esque style drawings. - 9/10Audio:Definitely the stongest aspect of the game for me. If you haven't listed to the soundtrack all the way, YOU NEED TO! Seriously, it's on Spotify, I listen to it al the time. It is unbelievably atmospheric, even just the title screen music is indescribably perfect for the tone of the game. - 10/10Gameplay:Okay, so this is where I stop praising the game. It's a bit of a button masher and one of those hack and slash types where the enemies NEVER stop coming even though you got bored of killing them like 5 hours ago. There are several different types of enemies (not too many or too few) that all have to be killed in specific ways. This would be fine if there were more varieties of weapons and/or upgrades for the weapons you already have. You basically end up using the same strategies throughout the entire game to defeat the same types of enemies and bosses are no exception. As for the platforming and puzzles; they're a'ight. - 6/10Story:I'm feeling pretty conflicted about the story because I liked certain aspects (like how dark and creepy both Alice's real life and Wonderland were) and I've always been a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story anyway. However, I was extremely confused about who the real villain was and what my ultimate purpose was throughout the entire game. Though you do find out who the real enemy was all along, I never felt like I fully understood the story even after I finished the game. However, I did enjoy the parts of the story that I understood. - 6/10Replayability:Unfortunately, I would have to say that Alice: Madness Returns has very little replayablility due to it's repetetive gameplay. Though the art style and soundtrack are nothing short of perfection, they can both be appreciated outside of the actual game. Combine the lackluster gameplay with the confusing story and I'm afraid there's not much incentive for a second playthough. Unless, of course, you enjoyed the combat mechanics. 4/10Overall:Though obviously not perfect, I do not regret my playthough of Alice: Madness Returns and would recommend it to any fan of the original game, American Mcgee's Alice. If you can get it on sale, it's a steal. - 7/10.			"

												Madness Returns is an acceptable sequel to the fantastic Alice which was released so many years ago.The dialogue in the game is as nonsensical as you'd expect it to be considering the source material and then putting this psychological twist to it where Wonderland is some how Alice's way of dealing with her problems.    It's a tad unfortunate that the game doesn't explore this more beyond just some short cut scenes and the even shorter collect-able ""memories"" that you can retrieve.  Levels are usually too long and a bit boring also so if you miss one of these collect-ables it's not exactly enticing to go back and get them.Speaking of the levels, at face value they seem pretty interesting.  The very beginning of the game has you start out in a lush green forest area with fungi and all sorts of vegetation.   This doesn't last long however as the game quickly gives you the impression that they got lazy.  This is because the level design is quite heavily invested in the platforming.  You'll come upon one area after another that's wide open and is littered with several tiny platforms that you must jump through.  None of it is very challenging and it just feels like it soaks up time.  There's not much to look at beyond the platforms either.  The sky boxes look nice, but that's almost all you'll be seeing for each area.  Unfortunately this is the bulk of the game and it doesn't take long for it to become dull as it feels like a chore.  Another thing that can make these areas last longer than they should is that there are often secret invisible platforms that often lead to the collect-ables.  These are found by pressing the LB button and making Alice shrink in size.  So frequently as you hop through areas you'll have to stop, shrink and visually scan your surroundings to make sure there's nothing you missed.  As stated before these collect-ables give you teeny tiny hints to the story.  So tiny in fact that most of them only last about 3-5 seconds.  It's not very rewarding and there's at least a hundred of them.I should also mention that there are small mini-game type sections within stages as well.  These are also quite boring and some of them seem slapped together at the last moment.  For example in one section the game changes up into a shoot 'em up style game where you control an under water ship shooting at skeleton fish.  It's not challenging, it's slow, there's no boss, and no power ups.  You just tap the fire button and wait till it's over.  Other mini-games include slide puzzles.  None of these mini-games add anything to the experience.  They just slow down the game.The combat in the game is very Zelda-like, as in you target an enemy, wait for an opening and attack and some enemies have a weakness to a certain weapon.  It's alright for what it is.  However many times when there are several enemies to fight picking the one you want can be a hassle and sometimes the camera doesn't give you the best angle.  The weapons are cool though and very fitting for the theme of the game.  Alice has the Vorpal Blade, which looks mostly like a giant kitchen knife, a Pepper Grinder which operates like a machine gun, a Hobby Horse that acts like a giant sledge hammer and a Tea Pot that lobs drops of tea like grenades.All in all this is an okay game, but the level design is absolutely atrocious.  At $20 it's a little pricey, I'd pick it up for around $10.6.5/10			"

												There is a great atmosphere due to the asthetics and sounds in this game. The gameplay itself isn't anynthing out of this world however. I would reccomend this game if it wasn't for the amount of bugs present and the annoying camera. I also get framerate issues in most fights later in the game. You now also require an EA account to play even if you owned the game previously. Controller support is lacking, an xbox controller will work with the game fine, but all tutorial prompts give keyboard hints.Overall the game is beautiful but lacks a lot of polish and feels rushed.

												I love this game, but the awful controls and the countless bugs almost made me rage quit. The visuals are gorgeous, the art style is amazing, and the game mechanics and level design are incredible (a bit repetitive at times though).It's not supposed to be a rage game, but it almost made me jump out of the window.

												Take a tour of Wonderland's shattered body. Mindbendingly beautiful and refreshing attempt at breaking the conventions laid by other more popular game franchises, it features engaging game play in diabolically captivating landscapes. Weaponry is devastating when used well and cute to watch.Cons; The larger bosses can be difficult if the method for their destruction is not adhered to - leaving little room for creative alternate solutions.The reward system leaves me flat - Early, I am nearly always too healthy and charged yet later, play involves a lot of time-critical evasion to refresh against ...say... savage Wasp attacks for example but I still enjoyed the battles thouroughly regardless. Pros; The puzzle aspects of the map and some of the mini-skills (see what I did there?) make for witnessing awe inspiring map design. The team Mr McGee selected for this adaptation shows a high level of dev skills to rival any of the more popular ""bang bang you're dead"" franchises.It has a relaxed state of pace, a sad alternating plot driving device and... well... magic, ffsA light refreshing couple of days or a few weeks for the time-poorGet this game and play it, you won't be sorry.

But if you redeem the code on the origin website, if you have an account, you should be fine. Tons of oldschool gaming nostalgia and feel with nice smooth graphics and physics.

												Hi there, this review will be reviewing spicy horse's and american mcgee's alice madness returnIts a re-imagining of the alice in wonderland story with a thing primarly , there is no wonderlandits all in alice's mind.being the second game in the series ( and last one) this was a great sequel, i never did play american mcgee's alice (that is the name of the first game) but i looked some parts of that game up on youtube and i must say that this is just way better from the looks of it but then again this had less limitations compared to the first one, now lets get on with the pro's and con'spros=-art style is great-levels are very different from one another (in looks atleast)-great music-story that you will most likely want to see to the end-checkpoint system is great, the game places you spots you touched before you died and it doesn't even have to load!-insane asylum level where you play as bald alice -10$cons=-story whilst interesting can also be a bit confusing at times-gameplay in fighting can get repetitive -puzzles can repeat in story modeSo the main objective of the game (spoiler alert but im not sure it counts since you learn this on the first chapter so it shouln't be surprising) is to stop a train that is ruining alice's wonderland somehowSo whilst almost everithing about this game is great the gameplay can be repetitive and it can make people stop playingbefore ending the game (it did with me) but if you can look past the repetitive gameplay you have a great game (one of my favourite soundtracks even though it isn't that big :P)So finally should you buy this game?Heck yeah you should. This game is for 10$? Im surprised it isn't higher then that because id say this is like a 25 or 30$ game.			"

												This game has a decent story and amazing creative level designs, reminding me a lot of Psychonauts. (If you haven't played Psychonauts and you like this game, then you need to get on that.)Negatives would be the lack of options for camera controls (no invert horizontal camera), and the targeting system is very lame for how often you have to use it. Your target will basically lock on to whatever it wants and you cannot switch it directly, you have to turn it off and on (toggle or hold) until it catches onto the target you want, and often when surrounded by a ton of enemies, it's not going to typically lock on to the one you wanted. Then when you're locked on you cannot change the camera angle at all! This is fine when you just need to take out a bunch of mobs at ranged, but not when they get up close. This became extremely frustrating towards chapter 3. Melee/close range is flawed.Also the blocking ability does not have its own button when you play on a controller. you MUST be locked on to something to bring out your blocking umbrella. And if ""locking on a target"" is acting up, then good luck trying to block anything in time, as you must also be standing completely still to block. Your umbrella does make you basically invincible when you are able to bring it out in time. TIP: Also get that DLC early, you just need to lookup what line to change from False to True in some text file. Easy but dumb that you have to do that. The alternate dresses you can unlock are really overpowered so if you have trouble, just use one of those.There's some parts I wish weren't cinematics, they take it away from you and make you watch the little movie instead of letting you get to complete the bosses. That's kinda anti-climactic. The game definitely doesn't have enough real boss fights, just tons of ""mini bosses"" or over powered mobs who become redundant.Those are all my biggest complaints, these types of flaws wouldve been so easily fixed if they did slightly more testing or even a patch.Other than that, I definitely recommend the game if you're into surreal stories and you like platforms.

												Madness Returns is a game that has really nice visuals and decent storytelling. It runs on the Unreal Engine, so you're likely to see typical glitches found on most games that run on the engine. The game itself isn't very demanding, I could run it on an AMD HD 4000 series card and really well on an HD 6870. The thing that dimineshes framerates is the use of nVidia's PhysX, which is really extensively CPU dependant. If you have a decent nVidia card with plenty of CUDA cores, then you're going to be fine running this on Max settings, otherwise, try to keep the PhysX settings low.There are some engine config edits you can do to run this on older or less powerful hardware, and lots of helpful guides. There's also an issue early on in the game where you might not be able to use an umbrella to block, I can't remember what I did to fix that... All in all, EA ended up pushing some of their own ideas onto McGee's game. I've read a few articles where Spicy Horse Studios ended up ignoring most of EA's ideas or suggestions. I really like the game, and really wish I had the patience to 100% it. I can't really comment on how well it lives up to the first Alice game, since I never got to play it.			"

												This game is different from the Alice in Wonderland story that we all know. Don't expect any magical creatures filled with diamonds and rainbows. The game is dark, the enemies are creepy ♥♥♥ babyheads that can blow themselves up, Alice herself looks like a girl in 8th grade who listens too much to My Chemical Romance, and even the Chesire Cat that will guide you along the way is spooky as hell (don't even get me started on how Mad Hatter and Red Queen look). But it's all good because the environment is pretty and the combat system is just excellent.Overall a solid platforming, puzzle-solving game, with great combat and cool selection of weapons with a slightly disturbing backstory8/10 would play DLCs "

												Worthy successor of American Mc Gee's Alice. If you liked it, you will like Madness Returns as well, although it's unofficial continuation. One of EA games that actually is very worth its price.Pros:- It's Alice.- Grotesque everywhere. From allies, enemies to NPCs. They are sometimes so twisted it's actually pleasant to look at.- Beautiful levels. Sometimes you just stop to stare at the details. - You retrieve Alice's memories through all the game and it somehow nicely adds to overall climate.- Music is amazing.- Plot is nicely done. - The mix of fairy tale beauty and horror-like uglyness.- It is as good as American McGee's Alice. Period.Cons:- Got graphical hic-ups sometimes.- Some levels seam to be just toooooo loooooong for their attractiveness. - Controlling Alice's floating or jumping can get irritating ad times.- Unnecessary camera changes here and there. Especially after or before cut-scenes. Cost me life once. - Cheshire cat will not always appear after pressing ""c"" again. - Fighting needs getting used to. Plus: most of the times it's better not to use lock on target option. But then you cannot use your umbrella parry...Still game is a must for everybody who likes previous one, who likes grotesque and pretty serious matters wrapped in twisted, part fairy-like part horrorish cover.

												Alice Madness Returns is an enhanced sequel of the original American McGee's Alice. Featuring significantly reworked gameplay, and style the game takes many liberties that the original dared not venture toward.The game is dark, cynical and beautiful at the same time. It features nice modelling, animations and voice acting, and an experience that feels a long time coming. Madness Returns is certainly a worthy sequel, to an already worthy predecessor.			"

												The alternate version of Alice in Wonderland returned the summer of 2011 and as most of the times, I'm late to the party. But what a gorgeous party it was! Varied environments and they all look just as great as the last one.When it comes to gameplay, it's a rather standard platformer, with a lot of jumps and a few puzzles here and there, so if you're after a good platformer, this would be it. The voice acting is on point but the music gets somewhat repetitive as you go along, so I turned off the sound completely during a part of the game, just to get rid of the so called soundtrack.Then, the last part - story. Alice has been released from the asylum (she was being held there due to her believing she burned down her family's house and killed the members of her family) and during a errand in town, she started to hallucinate and thought she was back in Wonderland, but as usual... something goes wrong. The Infernal Train wrecks havoc in Wonderland and force called ""Ruin"" is trying to stop her from putting things back in order. So in short, you could say that you have to stop this train and the force from destroying Wonderland altogether.Taking about 11 hours to complete, I had a lot of fun with this game. I, myself, bought it during a sale so I got it for about €4, which is TOTALLY worth it. No doubt about that.			"

												I don't know if American McGee was still attached this (final?) installment of Alice's return to Wunderlund but, as a sequel to his sleeper-hit, 1998's American McGee's Alice*.The action is quick paced so you'll probably enjoy grinding inbetween encounters -- smell a flower, break something... who knows what you might find.I prefer running in HARD or harder modes. If you do too, there might be some frustrating moments when it seems like an adversary wont die. No worries. Just get up, go for a walk and pickup from that checkpoint later.This is the Alice I fell in love with from our first time through Wunderlund.[*NOTE: If you haven't played AMA, Congratulations!, there's more for you down this rabbit hole.]			"

												The biggest asset of this game is its visual style; it is breathtakingly gorgeous to look at. The environments are truly stunning, lending real depth to the tortured imaginings of a fragmented Wonderland. The story line is dark, engaging and entirely adult despite the youthful protagonist and fantastical thematics. It's twisted and downright brutal in places, and I particularly enjoyed the gothic stylings of the game. However, having just completed this game, I'm actually quite disappointed, and it's hard to explain why. I should have really enjoyed this game as it's something that's normally right up my alley - beautiful graphics, interesting story, developed characters and relatively easy-to-learn gameplay that's just the right mix of gaming, cut scenes, puzzles and combat. The major problem for me is that Alice: Madness Returns is actually much more fun to look at than it is to play. I could spend hours looking at the pretty graphics and backdrops but actually negotiating the levels got downright repetitive - if you like jumping from platform to platform then this is the game for you, because that's about 90% of the gameplay. It's fun at first with the triple-jump and float functions, rendered as they are with butterflies and graceful effects, but after a while you do get bored of doing the same thing over and over for five long chapters where the only thing that really changes is the scenery, and Alice's dress. The combat style is pretty simple to learn but can be difficult to master - the odd target lock function leads to weird camera angles and can frustrate you when there are mutliple targets. Most battles end up being fairly frantic but the game does force you to think tactically when facing multiple foes, as you will need to employ different weapons to defeat certain enemies. To its credit, it's not the straightforward hack n' slash that I'd first anticipated. The enemies have a good range of abilities and tactics to counter, though it would be nice if there was a bit more variety in appearance - okay, doll's heads are creepy, but after a while you do become immune to the terror-inducing effects of black goo with an empty-eyed doll's head for a face. Adding more doll's heads does not make it creepier. Just harder to kill...The game does suffer from a number of well-documented bugs, just check out the community hub, which solved 99% of the problems for me. These did not make the game unplayable but did detract a lot from the enjoyment and flow of the gameplay, particularly an inability to access one of the weapons for nearly all of the first chapter in my case without having to exit the game and/or reload from my last save point. Another thing that I found incredibly irritating was the minigames - for some of them the switches in artwork/style/gameplay seemed a refreshing change at first, but then you realise it's just more jumping from platform to platform, just in a two-dimensional or other such different setting. On some of them the camera angles are so odd you end up having to work towards the camera with no clue as to where you're going or what you're supposed to be doing. ""Maybe that's the challenge!"" you may cry - true enough, but it's pretty annoying when you can't see where you're going and you end up dying a dozen times before you work out where the next platform is in relation to where you are. Some of the smaller puzzles, which involve chess pieces, or playing a tune, can be skipped entirely without affecting the game play, so there seems little point in them at all. Hidden objects are strewn throughout the game, but there's no real impetus to find them all unless you happen to be really into your extra features/concept art/character profiles. Perhaps if the game supported Steam Achievements or some other such reward it might have been worth spending more time searching out these items, but after a while you will probably decide it's all more effort than it's worth - after all, it's not like you're short of platforms to be jumping to and from in the main storyline. I do recommend this game, though, simply for being a visual spectacle and an interesting, dark, really screwed up story line. Definitely one to purchase during a sale at a heavily discounted price, as I did - I think I'd be much more disappointed if I'd paid full price, especially given the minor bugs, the repetitive gameplay and the many small irritants that made this game a lot less enjoyable than I'd expected it to be.  Oh, and at the risk of a spoiler, don't expect any ""big boss fights"" until the only one that comes at the very end of the game. It teases you by making you think there will be some, but each chapter usually just ends with a cut scene that doesn't explain anything and tells you to go talk to someone else instead. Now go jump across some platforms to get there...			"

												This game is truly a work of art. The visuals are incredible, both the design and graphics absolutely excel to give you an experience that is visually fantastic, and this factor makes this game nearly worth it alone. Not only is the game itself gorgeous, but the cutscenes are done in a paper-doll style, which really gives them flair and makes them a marvel to watch. It also sports a sublime soundtrack, although the tracks are a little on the short side, and a brilliant plot. Taking up from the first Alice game, but giving enough information that a new player can hop onboard no problem, this is an excellent and highly original take on the concept of a ""darker"" Alice in Wonderland.  I will not spoil, but it is very interesting, and the conclusion is very satisfying. This game also features excellent voice work, with most actors reprising their roles from the first game. The gameplay itself is a mixture of hack-and-slashy combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, with several unique and intriguing mechanics, as well as several segments that introduce a completely different set of mechanics for a short while, offering an interesting change from the regular gameplay. However, although I would absolutely recommend this game, there are a few issues: The controls on PC are less than stellar, as this is a console port. The game likes to tease you by constantly letting you think there will be a bossfight and then not giving you one; this persists throuought the entire game, and apart from some regular enemies that are slightly harder to beat, there is not a SINGLE proper boss fight in this game until the end. Finally, I found it quite irritating not being able to summon the Cheshire Cat at any time as could be done in the first game. This may not matter to some, but to me, it's quite a disappointment, albeit a minor one. But to summarize, this is an excellent game that is well worth your time and money with fun gameplay, great visual design, and a compelling story.			"

												This is a very average platformer, it had potential to something much more though. The game lacks variety in the gameplay which would have been fine if the platforming and combat wasn’t so basic. You are mostly double jumping and gliding between big gaps landing on big square or circle platforms floating above a giant pit. Great platformers like Jak and Daxter keep the platforming fresh each level by changing how you traverse the level with it’s unique level design which is something this game lacks. You do the same thing from start to finish it never changes things up and there is a lack of challenge because of how basic and easy the platforming is which makes the game less engaging. The game ends up being a bit of a bore the more you play it because of how repetitive the experience ends up being, especially because it’s surprisingly a really long game. Combat is ok, there is nothing to really praise about it though. The story works just fine but I wasn’t too invested in it, I did like the ending though. The game has some unique design and aesthetics. Even though the level design is kind of being held back by the basic platforming, it does throw out cool environments and details in the levels.  I know a lot of people really like this game but from my experience, I just didn’t have fun with it. 5/10 (Average)			"

Wonderland is on the edge of crisis and corruption once again which is reflected on the more and more desolated level environments. Lead Alice through 6 various chapters with each having it's unique design and followed by little backstories leading Alice to discover the Real truth.Arcade combo action combat system when you have to time your strikes to make precise blows through enemy lines or just turn on Hysteria mode to destroy everything standing in your way.

												A Review Mostly for me so I know I’ve completed the story, as well as feedback on the game.My View:- Not a bad game, I like the style of it kind of dark matching the original book of alice in wonderland. The camera angles can be a problem at times. Has loads to do like finding memory’s and bottles as well as pepper pig snouts.Achievements:- N/AGraphics:- Graphics are alright could have been better as they do a kind of pop in style of loading. Its dark and strange.Game Play:- A platform game with a lot of jumping and some action, there’s riddles to solve, puzzles to do, things to find and collect.Story:- Alice the lone survivor of the liddle house fire, driven mad by the memory your wonderland is in chaos but is that all there is to it?Replayability:- 6 chapters as well as a new game+ could finish the game 100% in 2 play throughs or just for the story of alice.What Could Be Added:- Would be nice to see some achivments added to this game, give some drive to find everything and complete it on the hardest difficulty.Rating:- 8/10 "

												The game for money well spent. Something between art and game which makes it quite an unique piece of entertainment. Wonderland is on the edge of crisis and corruption once again which is reflected on the more and more desolated level environments. Lead Alice through 6 various chapters with each having it's unique design and followed by little backstories leading Alice to discover the Real truth.Arcade combo action combat system when you have to time your strikes to make precise blows through enemy lines or just turn on Hysteria mode to destroy everything standing in your way. Upgrading weapons, lots of various collectibles which you have to find by using all the game mechanics altogether. All of these things make this the game what I really like and enjoyed so much.			"

												I don't know if American McGee was still attached this (final?) installment of Alice's return to Wunderlund but, as a sequel to his sleeper-hit, 1998's American McGee's Alice*.The action is quick paced so you'll probably enjoy grinding inbetween encounters -- smell a flower, break something... who knows what you might find.I prefer running in HARD or harder modes. If you do too, there might be some frustrating moments when it seems like an adversary wont die. No worries. Just get up, go for a walk and pickup from that checkpoint later.This is the Alice I fell in love with from our first time through Wunderlund.[*NOTE: If you haven't played AMA, Congratulations!, there's more for you down this rabbit hole.]			"

The player will also contemplate their own existence as the world is turned upside-down and inside-out. Throughout the game, the player will experience many modes of gameplay (3rd Person, 2D Side-scrolling and 4th Dimesion). ***Prepare for a long adventure as Alice with help from friends of ""Wonderland""			"

												Would I recommend this game? Yes! 8/10Alice: Madness Returns somehow manages to have colorful lands that are still dark, grey and a bit disturbing. The gameplay is a bit hack-and-slash, some shooter, and platforming. The voice acting is great; I love Alice's voice and the Queen of Heart's as well, and I love the Cheshire Cat's the most...so dark and yet a bit soothing.Alice has a tendancy to be a bit snarky and doesn't respond so dramatically as many female game characters out there, which can be a good and a bad thing at times, but overall she is a well made character who comes across as rather lethal. Depending on te stage of the game her outfit will change which is a nice touch, and her animations are great; attacks fall one after the other without any clipping and move beautifully, dodging is quick and comes with a cool butterfly effect, and jumping and floating seems a bit elegant.Cutscenes are interesting because they are done in a pen-and-ink 2d style that gives the game a book-like feel as it tells you a story about her insanity. They often give insite to her mental state and her past.Most gameplay takes place in wonderland, but starts off in reality. The scenary changes with each location (and as mentioned before, so does her atire). In reality, the scenery is dark, dank and dreary, and the people of the towns don't exactly qualify for any beauty pagents. Despite their uglieness, their appearance adds to the atmosphere. When you first get to Wonderland though everything becomes colorful and vibrant...then slowly changes to dark, then darker, then even darker yet. Water turns to blood, vibrant green grass turns dead and ugly. Even in areas like the frozen landscapes has its own disturbing atmosphere with frozen animals that have exposed inards. Pleasant, right?Each area of the game acts a platforming area where you have to run and jump from place to place, pull levers and turning things on and off. As you move around the game you are attacked by monsters and things, and these opponents can get monotonous as you are often attacked by the same things over and over at points. The enemies do differ frm level to level but there comes a point where you'd rather kill something else.This game is well done, fun and disturbing. Some of the dialog is a little hard to follow, but its clever and dark and often strange, but remember she is insane and this is Alice in Wonderland (and we're not talking Disney). And as I've said, the voice acting is great so dialogs are enjoyable.Alice: Madness Returns is well worht the money.			"

												Visually beautiful and disturbing at the same time, I really enjoyed the gameplay. It's more casual than Bayonetta (no crazy combo chaining), though the visual styles are somewhat reminiscent (butterfly and feather motifs). It's as fast paced as you want it to be; you have the choice of finding all the hidden paths and items, but you can just as easily skip over them in favour of just sticking with the main story. The music is low-key and nonintrusive, but lends itself to the general mood and theme very well.I love this reinvention of Alice. I only wish its prequel was available on Steam.			"

												Madness Returns is one of the best games I have played in a long time.  I do have a thing for Lewis Carrol's creation and by extension, American McGee's creations in Alice and Madness Returns.  The original Alice was okay, but Madness Returns simply takes off as far as sound design, graphic detail/design, and control.  It plays almost like a God of War game in terms of combat.  You have light, heavy, and ranged attacks.  The combat is fun and can be challenging.  It is a beautifully grotesque world created in the mind of a mad girl (alice) and the ""real"" world is something straight out of Sweeney Todd.  There are light puzzling elements and a wonderful twisted wonderland to explore.My only regret is that I didn't buy this game sooner.			"

												Pros:Incredible art direction/aestheticsImersive enviromentFluid combatMemorable charactersRefreshing gameplay mechanicsCons:BuggyRepetetive combat/gameplayConfusing/bad keymappingOddly unresponsive menus and at times in game inputExtremely on rails/linear gameThe game itself is a ton of fun to play ignoring a few cons that should have been fixed during development (bugs/ wonky aiming and lagging menus). At its core it's a hack and slash action platformer. In fact, most of the game is either slashing away at enemies, or jumping from platform to platform. This may get repetetive to some, but that's what the game is. And it's a damn fine looking platformer at that. The aesthetics of the game are fantastic, from boring dreary London (?) to the vibrant and morbidly twisted wonderland. Voice acting is also spot on.Overall, if you can overlook a few bugs that will require a quick restart from checkpoint, and don't mind gameplay getting repetetive after a while playing, Alice: Madness Returns is a really fun game to anyone looking for a arcadey hack'n'slash platformer. Psychonauts comes to mind when playing this so if you enjoyed that game at all, this one is very much worthing looking in to.			"

												EH.... I love Wonderland. I love the source materials and I like the direction this game went but it feels like it did not quite make it. There are numerous points where I notice what looks like corners being cut to keep this game in budget which is an understandable concern but not something that should be so easily notable by the player. A particular disappointment is looking into the characters section at the main menu and seeing a LOT of them that were never seen in game.Alice also feels exceedingly dim in this game. Not because she's necessarily unintelligent but rather because the game in a not-at-all-subtle manner let's you know the plot 'twist' concerning who is responsible long (reeeeaaaalllly long) before Alice herself figures it out.At times the story moves jerkily like a puppet dangling from strings. It's a beautiful puppet but it doesn't have much life despite how unique many of the character designs are.About half-way through I realized I wasn't having much fun anymore but forced myself to plow through to completion for principle and not to see the end. Speaking of which, if you don't know already the end boss (which is also the ONLY boss) is actually pretty spectacular in itself but the story is handled like someone trying to complete three separate jigsaws at once which ruined any emotional impact it could have for me.Do I recommend it? Not really. That said, as a fan of Alice in general I would have been disappointed had I not followed through and I have no regrets.			"

												Alice: the Madness ReturnsBackground: Big fan of American Mcgee's Alice and Alice in Wonderland in general. Been excited to play this game for some time now.Impressions: When you are dealing with a place called Wonderland you really need to give people a sense of wonder. A:TMR does some really interesting stuff with Lewis Carroll's base material and adds it's own twists that compliments the imagery established in the first game. In short it's dark, twisted and does everything right that Tim Burton's film got wrong.The Good:* The grim 'reality' of Victorian England is grotesquely exaggerated.* Glorious and twisted Wonderland is the perfect counterpoint.* Some absolutely gorgeous visuals, outfits and backdrops.* Thoughtful plot with cues and callbacks if you pay attention.* Honours the design, voices and locations of the original.* Weapons have impact and look great.* Voice acting is decent throughout, huge improvement over original.* 24 hours plus game play.* Shrink/Hint mechanic is fun and helpful.* Very linear but lots of content keeps you wanting to progress.The Bad:* Lots of jumping puzzles, but few are particularly hard.* Enemy lock-on makes encounters feel samey.* Killing enemies is repetitive, use the same tactics over and over.* Limited range of weapons and upgrades could have been more visual.* Dark themes, visuals and language are not for everyone.* Shrink mechanic could have been more diversely used. * Hint mechanic can be too helpful.* Hidden items rarely challenging to obtain.* Retry system sometimes takes you back further than at other times.* Side scrolling sections are unchallenging.* Feels slightly 'console port' like but not overly so, plays well with keyboardRecommended for: Fans of the first game. Those who like twisted and dark fairy-tales. The 15 age rating seems about right.Conclusion.8/10. Great fun to play and explore with some interesting encounters for those that like their fairytales with a hint of gothic about them.			"

												A classic story such as Alice in Wonderland is a bold platform(er) to stand on; bolder still to instill such a dark flavored atmosphere.  “Why?” you ask?  Because for many of us, our most recent memory of the character Alice is bleached Disney.  For me, there was a G rated nostalgia barrier I needed to break through to fully immerse myself in the experience.  Embracing the dark connotations that Alice: Madness Returns has to offer was effectively my rabbit hole.The environments and overall feel for the gameplay pay a solid tribute to that N64 era of three dimensional platformers.  From hidden collectables to Alice’s environmentally adaptive dresses, the developer’s attention to detail is apparent throughout. Further supplemented with artistic story-book-style cutscenes and well executed phasing to/from Alice’s mundane real world existence.  I found myself stopping to paint the rosses and taking an excess of screenshots.I highly recommend this title to all platformer loving gamers.  9/10.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a game like none other I have ever played. If you are a fan of Wonderland, then you will love the creepy, strange beauty of this game. Each chapter is rich with artistic detail that looks as if it has been pulled straight out of a Tim Burton movie. Every chapter has a unique look that will make you well acquainted with your screenshot key.While the art style is clever and interesting, the level lengths are quite long and can be a little tedious after a while. Don’t go into this game expecting a fast play through, especially if you plan on collecting everything. The boss fights, are thankfully, unique to this game. They are challenging and had me at times wondering if I was actually playing a mini Dark Souls game instead. The clumsy controls make for an aggravating experience when facing enemies in flight, and don’t even get me started on that umbrella.  Besides the games shortcomings, including a few bugs and glitches here and there, the game really does make you feel as if you were traversing through a strange, yet wonderful Wonderland. There are several challenging puzzle games spread out through the chapters that I felt were a nice break from the constant platform jumping, and the characters you meet along the way are interesting and unique.My overall score for the game: 7/10. I would recommend this game for those who like challenging puzzles or those who just want to experience a darker version of Alice in Wonderland.  "

												FULL WRITTEN REVIEW:Aww Alice Madness Returns. Ive never got obsesses with a game this much since half life 2. I knew this game before but never really got to play it because i never had the chance to untill a couple of months ago and i dont regret playing it and ill explain why. The idea is just fantastic. A game based on Lewis Carroll's famous novel Alice Advetures in Wonderland (aka Alice in Wonderland) but with bloody, dark, twisted theme and story is just a very original, genious, fantastic,cool, awesome.......gosh im lost for words.====STORY (SLIGHT SPOILERS FROM THE FIRST GAME)====So, the story in my oppinion is very original and unique. Alice Madness Returns is a sequel to the 2000 game American McGee's Alice released only on pc at the time with a ps2 version that was in development but got cancelled. In the first game, Alice, after feeling guilty for her parents and sister's deaths, goes insane. Her madness made wonderland as twisted as it is. At the end of the game she leaves the asylum thinking that she is finally cured from her madness. In this game, Alice's madness and bad memories about her parents and sister's deaths return, hence the name Madness Returns. The game sets in a victorian age London with a Tim Burton-like artstyle (if i do say so myself) which makes for a really beautiful looking game. Alice, now 19 years old (if im correct), lives in an orphanage where she takes medication for her madness. After her therapy session with her doctor, doctor Bumby, Alice is told by Bumby to get some pills from the High street chemist. Alice leaves the orphanage to get the pills and stumbles upon a white cat. She then procceds to follow the cat into a dark alley where she begins to hallucinate people with insect-like heads (i believe its the jabberwock's head). After her hallucination, an old woman by the name of Nurse Witless (a nurse from the asylum Alice was in) touches Alice's shoulder and she then tells Alice to come with her. After that, Alice starts talking with nurse Witless asking her if she was going to return her to the asylum where she was internee in the first game. Alice then has an hallucination of nurse Witless as a monster and Alice retreats slowly in fear. Then the floor beneath her breaks and she falls into Wonderland. After falling through the floor, Alice finds herself in Wonderland where the Cheshire Cat appears in front of her to inform Alice of a new evil that reigns and is destroying Wonderland. The Cheshire Cat points out that the evil isnt from her head, it is something from outside. Now throughout the game Alice needs to figure out where is this evil coming from. An important fact that is mentioned in the game is ""the destruction of Wonderland means the destruction of Alice"" (youll know why later on), thus begining a new adventure for Alice.====GAMEPLAY AND PROS====Lets begin with this game's beautiful graphics, combat, enemies, visuals, soundtrack, etc. The level design is so beautiful, the levels are very detailed and colorful at times. The music fits so well with the environment that youll get the chills like i did. The platforming is fun and enjoyable and neither very hard or very easy. The voice acting, holy cow, it s just fantastic. The character animations are really well made including the lip sync. The different dresses you can unlock are really cool and good looking. The combat is really fun and unique. You have a total of 6 weapons. The vorpal blade is your main melee weapon, the pepper grinder is like a gatling gun that shoots pepper projectiles, the teapon cannon (it has a really big downside but ill talk about that in the cons) is a short ranged teapon that shoots powerful hot tea projectiles, the hobby horse acts as a very powerful sledgehammer-like weapon, the clockwork bomb is a doll bunny that explodes and acts as a disctraction for enemies and finally, the umbrella acts like a shield for low powered attacks. The enemies resemble toys or characters from the novel and get harder the more you progress. The visuals are not the most realistic but they look really beautiful. This is one underrated game that should be played by anyone who loves a good and complicated story like i do. The game might not be a legendary 10/10 but it is a good story driven platformer and it delivers its story bits in a really interesting way. So, throughout your journey you can find items such as bottles and memories. The bottles being collectibles needed to unlock concept art and character bios. Memories being items with the shape of different items that represent Alice's past and belongings such as toys, syringes, houses, etc, that can be found in secret places. When collecting one of these memories, you can listen pieces of dialog from Alice's past and memories. Collecting these memories is a very good representation that throughout Alice's journey she is trying to uncover and remember her past and experiences about the incident of her familiy's deaths. Also, throughout the game you can find these pig snouts which you can shoot with your pepper grinder making them sneeze and revealing secret rooms with collectibles in them.====CONS====Now lets talk about an important thing that is, of course, the game's cons. First of all and most important, why and the hell is a triple A pc game capped at 30 fps? that is so pointless since the game runs very smoothly even on lower end hardware. Another annoying thing is the fact that EA involved Origin on a steam game which if you ask me it is totaly pointless. In many instances the textures can look so low res that you wonder if the game is just loading the textures or just buged. The graphics menu is lacking a lot of stuff such as anisotropic filtering, different types of alti aliasing (the anti aliasing is just ""on and ""off"" without giving the information of what type of anti aliasing is the game using), vsync, ambient occlusion, texture detail, etc. The game can get a bit repetitive at times but you dont really notice it because you focus more on the story. The game's Nvidia Physx option isnt well optimized like many games with Nvidia Physx have suffered. What i hate is that the combat isnt balanced. I mean, once you aquire the teapot cannon and fully upgrade it the game gets impressively easy and once you beat the game you can use the different dresses that give you buffs and when you figure out how to unlock the DLC dresses in the .ini files you are practically unkillable even at the highest difficulty. Im not saying that the combat is bad, it is really good compared to other button masher games, the fact that you can easily die if you just rely on only one weapon is a nice touch (unless you have the horribly unbalanced teapot cannon fully upgraded or if you just wear the most overpowered dress in the game, Late but Lucky) , its just that it could have gone better. ====CONCLUSION====Even after all the cons i pointed out, this game is still a very good game because it focuses more on an engaging story and that is a big part of this game. This is one hidden gem that should be recognized as a good game by many more people and we will probably never see a third game and it makes me sad because this franchise has the pontential to be a succesful and well-known triple A experience. After writing this review and playing through this game i can officially and proudly say that Alice Madness Returns is now one of my favourite games of all time and it is totally a 20 dollar worthy experience. Alice Madness Returns gets an 8/10. It is a good game but ill be honest, the combat can get really repetitive that it almost earns a 7 but i feel like thats way to low. It honestly didnt bother me because i was more engaged in the story and i love games with complicated stories and oh boy this is one of them.If you really took the time to read this entire review thank you very much, i appreciate it alot and i hope i encouraged you to give this game a try			"

												This game is horrendous. Incredibly buggy, poor platforming design, the jumping must be so precise that it makes this game twice as long as it needs to be. You will die a TON if you are even slightly off with your timing. Tedious, my god is it tedious. This game is a chore, I'm so far into it at this point I'd like to just finish it, but every step of the way is incredibly painful and time consuming. I've played almost 16 hours and I'm only halfway through. Pros:The game is very aesthetically pleasing and colorful. I've always really liked American McGee's take on the Alice in Wonderland tale.The invisible platforms are a pretty neat idea. Cons:BugCertain platforming areas I've likely spent half an hour on just to get across to the other side. In the section where you must free the souls in the Lost Souls Locker, some of the platforms will glitch out and get stuck at the bottom if you've failed and died too many times. Of course you don't want to redo the entire section so you must let yourself die some more until the platforms actually start working again. BugThe side scroller mini games are also terribly buggy. I use shrink to dodge some fire cannons and of course it gets stuck in shrink mode, meaning I cannot jump and therefore must start the entire mini game over again.BugYou must change your key bindings in the config file as well as going back and changing them in game. It doesn't recognize your changes if you only do it in game.BugThe cube puzzles only let me move one piece up or down. I cannot select any other piece surrounding the piece I just moved therefore making the puzzle impossible to complete. Poor Game DesignOh, you've just completed a really difficult part and then died soon after? Welp ♥♥♥♥ you because this game only auto saves (that's the best feature of the game btw). You must complete the entire section over again ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Poor Game DesignWhatever health you have is all the health you get when you are going into a boss battle. I was not warned that I would soon be fighting a Colossal Ruin so I didn't know that I needed to heal myself. I had 3 health going into battle and needless to say, died many times. Even when I died and restarted the battle it still did not give me any more health than what I had going in. Design flaw.Poor Game DesignA very minor gripe I have is that when upgrading weapons it doesn't tell you exactly what is being upgraded. The weapon looks different but you aren't exactly sure if it does more damage, has a shorter cool down time, faster firing speed, etc. You just have to hope that it would upgrade all of those things ¯\_(ツ)_/¯If you're looking for a scary, thrilling game, this is not it. The enemies are more obnoxious and monotonous than scary.I really wanted to enjoy this game, but it's horribly disappointing.			"

												The only reason I finished this madly bad game are its visual designs, which are in most cases beautifuly done, sometimes even breathtaking. However everything else is utterly shameful. Enemies are not there to present a demanding challenge as they are a horribly boring obstacle on your way to encounter just another senseless fight. And its mostly fighting the basic enemy in different versions (Ruins), annoying you the whole game instead of giving space for other enemies (Card guards were the most enjoyable ones). Puzzles are so stupid, you'll bash your head against the head hoping for more mental activity. You can fail only because of poor controls. Oh, the minigames... an atrocious attempt to make the game richer making it only even more dumb and empty. The story, dialogs, cutscenes, all of this is a bunch of plain and childish writing culminating in a ""finale"" of zero thrill, zero emotion, I could not care less. I was happy that this game and its frustrating save system ends. Alice: Madness Returns is a resentful sequel to American McGee's Alice and I deeply hate it.			"

												Bite me!I don’t care much for platformers but decided to pick up a copy of AMR while it was on sale simply because it looked intriguing. What drew me the most was the visual design, and this is where the game scores most highly. It’s very striking visually (although the quality of the graphics could be better), and it’s in keeping with the various other imaginings of Wonderland that have been produced over the years. It has a reasonably strong story line and the voice acting is of a high standard too, both of which help to make the AMR version of Wonderland all the more convincing. So what of the gameplay? Well I’m no expert due to my dislike of the genre but the platforming here is fun for the most part although it got old for me about two-thirds of the way through. The combat is okay and their are some cool weapons, such as a teapot cannon and an awesome hobby horse melee weapon. But the game utilises a crazy targeting system that seemed utterly pointless to me and spoiled some of the fun. Overall I was impressed by AMR, and it was fun to play. It has not, however, converted me into an ardent platformer. 3.5/5			"

												I have to say, I really enjoyed this game. As a child I loved Alice in Wonderland. I also enjoy twisted fairy tales. So this game, putting both things I enjoyed into one, was something I was excited to experience. The artstyle of the scenery was amazing. Each world had its own beauty. I also loved how Alice wore a different type of bow on her dress depending on what world she was in. I loved how they used the story of Alice in Wonderland to tell the story of a young adult/teen with mental issues. It was really interesting. Most of the gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward. Although, some were challenging and needed you to get the timing exactly right, which was rather annoying and repetitive when trying to get Alice to twirl at the right point. Otherwise I have no issues with this game. Yes - it is linear, but I found the story to be a quirky take on fairy tales and so enjoyed it.			"

												Tips for those who are having problems activating the game:NO, you CAN'T activate it straight through steam, but you CAN use the serial number steam offers you to activate the game. It only takes 3 single steps:First you need to register an EA account. You DON'T need to bind yoru EA account with Steam.Next you go to ORIGIN site, or download and install the ORIGIN software. Eitherway, Origin and EA use same account infos so simply login with your EA account.Then go to the game activation page and choose Alice: Madness Returns, and paste in your serial number.Once you have activated your game via ORIGIN, you'll be able to use steam to run the game w/ your steam account.

												Alice Madness Returns can be very fun, and for the most part it is - but it can also be tedious. It has never been patched (thanks, EA) and suffers some bugs and glitches and performance issues (plus its an obvious console ports with the usual problems).It plays well enough however (better with controller), platforming is a lot of fun, combat is alright, like a watered-down spectacle fighter, story is just a creepy/crazy/mad as you'd expect... its a good sequel to the first Alice game, I would just hope it was more polish. And a bit more trimmed - some levels are just too long and some parts are superflouos. Thankfully you can skip some of the (many) minigames included.Either way, its a fun game.

												My abosuletly favourite 3D third person action game so far. The environments are detailed and cartoonish, and get ever more morbid the further you progress through the game. Am also totally in love with the exaggerated character designs & costumes. An interesting plot makes you anxious to know the ending, and it doesn't dissapoint. Varying enemies and boss fights keep you on your toes and if you've read the original books you'll be even more interested in seeing how McGee turned them into a horrific action environment. The caricaturistic cut scenes are an added bonus. Play this game.			"

The enemies too are very well done.The music is amazing too, many songs I will remember.It has flaws, the combat, while fairly fun, is simple, there are few combos, you can change between your melee weapons while hitting, so it's nothing disastrous, it's fairly solid, but it does get repetitive. The game is also plagued with random minigame segments. Thanks to EA pushing the studio for early release.Still, the game is amazing, the story is one of the most ballsy a game could have.Get this small masterpiece.			"

												Once upon a time There was a game developer. His name was (and is) American McGee. Now this - yes children, his first name is American. Now this man - Yes children, I agree that's a neeto name. And no children, I don't know why he was named 'American'. Ask his mother.Okay. Now. Long ago (2000) this man, along with a huge entity named EA games, released a game named Alice. It followed a girl named Alice as she journeyed through her mind trying to find a path to sanity.Did I mention She was lying comatose in an asylum. Well, the mental realm she travels in this game is, you guessed it, Lewis Carrol's Wonderland.This game is one of my favorites. I just played it again and despite it's turn of the millinia grafics and such found it still held it's charm.Did I mention the Cheshire Cat is my all-time favorite sidekick.  I bought the game based solely on its picture on the cover. Good thing I turned out loving the game. Wouln't want to feel like a tool right?I wholeheartedly recommend American McGee's Alice. Even though it is an anicient video game it's worth a shot. An updated version of Alice was released In a limited edition of Madness Returns. Their is a download for it io the Community Hub.  A web search and a couple of bucks should also find you a copy.! give it ten out of ten Boojums.With that bit of backstory and the shameless edorsment of a game that is not carryed buy Steam We procede to -Alice: Madness Returns.This game begins where the first game left off. Alice is living in a half-way house under the care of a psychiatrist. She is working on her recovery when problems begin. Old 'friends' start appearing and pull the fabric of her hard-earned sanity out from under her.Next thing you know she is once again ♥♥♥-over-tea kettle down the rabbit hole and having another disquieting journey through Wonderland.Like the first game we puzzle our way  from realm to realm running into Carroll's famous Wonderland denzens as the story unfolds. From the soot filled streets of London to hieghts above Wonderland this game is beatiful. The puzzles are somewhat challenging and the evil critters fun to fight. The story well-told. It has just enough strage humour to balance the darkness. And of course the Cheshire Cat is back ready, to once again offer snarky advice or just thumb (claw?) it's nose at you.Alice: Madness Returns was fun.I give it ten out of ten psycho-therapists.			"

												I love this game. the graphics for it are nice and each level is very different. Goes from a forest setting to under the sea. The gameplay can be a little rough here and there due to the camera but quickly you get better at it during fights. The story was a bit confusing at first but comes together nicely at the end. The story makes you think one thing and quickly switches your mind to think another which makes guessing the plot a lot harder. Alice madness returns gets creepier as you play along making more exciting. There are some parts here and there that make you wish they would just move on or wish you could skip but almost every game has parts like this. I suggest playing it when you get a chance especially if you love puzzle games, then this game is really for you. The puzzles get from easy to difficult as you progress through the game. I had a few moments that i had to stop and think about what i was missing to move on which no gamer wants an easy game to play through. Finally, I loved the length of the game its over 14hrs ish of gameplay which is nice and unlike some games a second play through isnt that bad. You discover some paths you missed and fight new monsters. I only wish Steam got American Mcgee's Alice, the first game before this, so i could understand the story a bit better. Overall I would give this game an 8/10 and suggest people to play it when they get a chance.			"

												I'm a total sucker for ""twisted fairy tale"" settings so this one earns easy points from me. It's weird and twisted, sometimes bloody and violent, and makes for a very fun journey, if not the most polished one. Gameplay is a mix of platforming and combat, both of which are so-so. Never too frustrating but never feeling especially engaging. The real strength is the setting and backdrop, exploring deeper and deeper to find out what creepy surprises await you as you press on. It's worth diving into, and I had enough fun with it to keep going right to the end, and it is surprisingly long too, clocking in at 10-12 hours if you take your time to look around.			"

												I wont offer up any story spoilers, but suffice it to say that the story is engaging and well written. If you are used to the Disney classic version of Alice in Wonderland and the newer Disney/Tim Burton takes on the story then this will definatly be a very different stance on the classic story.Combat, although slightly repetative after playing for 22 hours out of the last 48 (lol) is engaging and very fun, Hack'n'slash games always are for me :) The gore and violence factors for me are to be commended, I thouroughly enjoyed Alice in wonderland meets Jason X.To me the voice actors were well cast and played thier parts well, no complaints there.Having completed the game on Normal and felt fairly challenged at times and slightly hand held at others, I would say the devs got the balancing nicely spot on.I am now on my second play through, playing on Easy this time for all the secrets, then will move onto Hard and Nightmare.I would rate this game 8.5/10			"

												I've only played one chapter of the game, but i love it so far. The animation is absolutely beautiful, the music is splendid, the mood and atmosphere is creepy and chilling etc, the enemies are terrifying, and aesthetically it is absolutely great. I could foresee the fighting becoming menotomous, but so far it's extremely enjoyable and runs pretty smoothly. A lot of people complain about the controls without a controller (which worried me greatly,) but with my Anker gaming mouse, i can just set the dpi way down and it works great. I'd also reccomend (if you go the mouse option, which would require a gaming mouse, not just any off-the-shelf wireless deal) setting some of the utilities to programmable mouse buttons (instead of [Caps Lock] i've set the lock-on to one of my thumb buttons, along with the shrink and dodge. i'd recommend this game if you're looking for a pretty standard platform/hack-n-slash game with a good story and creepy feel. just a protip: when you use the mushroom-trampolines to jump, dont hit [spacebar] until you've reached the max hight of your bounce, otherwise you will waste the jump and wont be able to double-jump as effectively.tl:dr- beautiful game, pretty standard gameplay, mouse and keyboard works if you have a programmable mouse (low DPI), and i reccomend this game			"

												Alice Madness Returns can be very fun, and for the most part it is - but it can also be tedious. It has never been patched (thanks, EA) and suffers some bugs and glitches and performance issues (plus its an obvious console ports with the usual problems).It plays well enough however (better with controller), platforming is a lot of fun, combat is alright, like a watered-down spectacle fighter, story is just a creepy/crazy/mad as you'd expect... its a good sequel to the first Alice game, I would just hope it was more polish. And a bit more trimmed - some levels are just too long and some parts are superflouos. Thankfully you can skip some of the (many) minigames included.Either way, its a fun game. Unfortunately it is very expensive in Europe still.			"

												I love this game. the graphics for it are nice and each level is very different. Goes from a forest setting to under the sea. The gameplay can be a little rough here and there due to the camera but quickly you get better at it during fights. The story was a bit confusing at first but comes together nicely at the end. The story makes you think one thing and quickly switches your mind to think another which makes guessing the plot a lot harder. Alice madness returns gets creepier as you play along making more exciting. There are some parts here and there that make you wish they would just move on or wish you could skip but almost every game has parts like this. I suggest playing it when you get a chance especially if you love puzzle games, then this game is really for you. The puzzles get from easy to difficult as you progress through the game. I had a few moments that i had to stop and think about what i was missing to move on which no gamer wants an easy game to play through. Finally, I loved the length of the game its over 14hrs ish of gameplay which is nice and unlike some games a second play through isnt that bad. You discover some paths you missed and fight new monsters. I only wish Steam got American Mcgee's Alice, the first game before this, so i could understand the story a bit better. Overall I would give this game an 8/10 and suggest people to play it when they get a chance.			"

												THIS is how I view Wonderland in my head and this is the way Alice should always be remembered: The beautifully intelligent, badass girl. Everything is so wonderfully twisted, excellently referenced, and completely crazy. It was completely fun but I suggest playing it on the hardest difficulty for it to be challenging and fun. I thought the twirling and floaing was going to be over powered...it was absolutely balanced and was wonderfully done. The most badass weapon you could possibly have in my opinion was the Vorpal Blade, so Awesome. My advice is when you get the Coffee Pot use it in a combo with the Vorpal Blade to be amazing.This game was Perfect.			"

												8/10As an Alice in Wonderland fan, I'll be the first to say that I adore this game. It's not Alice though - it's a set a few years after Alice's parents burned to death in a fire and Alice's has to make her way in the world, occasionally seeing her therapist. Now, she returns to Wonderland. Madness returns.I completed this game on the Xbox 360. The controls are pretty clunky for PC so I'd recommend using a controller of some sort. The mechanics of the game are fairly enjoyable. A bit simplistic in places, There's a typical optional side quest for the completionists where you can collect some hidden treasures scattered throughout the game.The plot is excellent, and pretty dark in places. For those who require it, I'll offer a trigger warning for sexual abuse.			"

												Ah Alice, you wonderfully insane girl. True to the vein of Alice McGee's first game, this beautifully macabre depiction of a different Wonderland will have you slashing and bashing through six lengthy chapters. If you're looking for plenty of exploration and collecting then this gorgeously rendered title is right down your alley. Pros:-Gorgeous graphics which still hold up after five years-Memorable characters and settings-Gritty horror interchanges seamlessly with beautiful decors-Challenging platforming and battles-Long, rich gameplay with plenty to explore and collect-Lots of three-dimensional movement freedomCons:-Somewhat frustrating camera especially during combat-Limited arsenal/upgrades-Bit of a basic combat scheme, but very satisfying-Very forgiving checkpoint system, might not appeal much to those looking for higher challenge-Frame capped and a little unoptimized, might not run as smoothly on older machines (so I've heard)The story comes with brilliantly simple and fun minigames that are all woven into the main experience in a way that makes sense but sometimes leaves one to wonder if they weren't pushing for too much, however, it all plays out nicely. I couldn't help but notice that some parts felt stitched in later on leading me to assume it got rushed at one point.Every location feels like it's made with love and with an attention to detail, with a large and colorful variety of enemies to dispatch. A rich in-game collection makes up for the lack of achievements, and will most likely have you replay it a second time somewhere down the line.All in all, Madness Returns is a big and beautiful, action-packed, sometimes frustrating but overall rewarding experience with a twisted story that combines both body and psychological horror which is bound to tickle your cravings for a solid action-adventure game.

												Good character design, good combat system, fun game play. An overall improvement to the first game. Switching between London and Wonderland can get a little confusing at times, but usually the London sections are usually short.Controller support definitely helps with this game, but a few things can get a little confusing, but overall using a controller is probably better(but I could be wrong, I haven't tried mouse and keyboard).Mostly it's just a fun little hack and slash game with platforming in beautiful, yet sometimes disturbing, environments.  A must play for anyone that enjoys a twisted tale.			"

												-If you value visuals over minor bugs, then I'm sure you'll be okay with this game. Any glitch or bug I've had while playing could be fixed by restarting the game, so nothing game-breaking so far.-This game is beautiful and dark. There is some blood and other disturbing elements involved, but also some gorgeous sights to behold.-The general game difficulty and puzzles aren't mind-numbingly difficult, so prepare for a smooth ride.-There aren't jumpscares. (This is something I'm happy about.) It saves you the terrifyingly annoying fear of being screamed at around the next corner. The horror aspect is mostly from the atmosphere, and there are many bits (Alice's attire, environment, music, etc.) that contribute to the theme of the chapter/area.-Took me a little while to understand all aspects of the story, but being the age I am, it always takes me a while to get it.-The combat, weapon upgrades and platform/jumping puzzles are quite fun in my opinion, especially once you know what you're doingI will continue to play and replay this game. It is one of the gems that reaches many of the things I love to see in games.			"

It gets annoying after a time, but as I said, something in the game keeps me wanting more, it makes me care for Alice enough to push on, so I get over the next obstacle, then I get a boss fight, then an other, totally messed-up environment and new enemies.

This game is really beautiful, the graphics are astounding, storyline is original and characters are simply amazing. Suprisingly it doesn't get repetitive, at least not so much that it would make you turn off the game. The parkour is probably the hardest thing about the game, because if you upgrade your weapons, you can easily kill any enemy without getting a scratch. Although, this game is not for you if you expect a fairytale Wonderland. Not at all. Lot of blood and your childhood heroes dying. You know, casual stuff.			"

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.Okay, so I wound up playing this game for 5 hours straight and absolutely love it. From the beginning, this game is artsy, gothic, surreal, creative, inventive, and a bit disturbing. The beloved fantasy realm Alice used as her escape from reality-from life-is thrown into chaos, mirroring the once innocent girl's now tomented mind. Through stunning and disturbing imagery we can see what Wonderland once was, what it has become, and what it is turning into. The camera and movement controls are just as perfect as directional buttons and a joystick, so those used to PS3 like myself had no problems adjusting. Gameplay is fluid, colors are vibrant to dull, sharp to blended, and the attention to detail is perfect. There is nothing boring or dull about this game as it really takes hold or your senses of sight and sound, keeping your brain stimulated and your reflexes ready.My only complait about this game is that there is no camera sensitivity controls and during in-game play it's kind of fast, out of gameplay it's slow. Other than that this game is worth the money for more than just the gameplay, but the experience as well.			"

												Where to start, where to start...If you were ever a fan of Mcgee's original work, it goes without saying that you will utterly love this. I personally jumped into playing the Alice games without knowing anything prior, it was merely something that peaked my interest, and I'm glad it did.From start to finish I loved this game. The character development throughout the entire thing is incredible, the expressions of emotions pulls you so deeply into it that you just keep wanting to play through. You can really begin to sympathise with Alice as you begin to piece together her story. Each stage is tailor made to help with sucking you in, the aquatic level and the Queen of Hearts has to be my personal favourites. You, at a point get to be a giant cranky stomping Alice. What more could you want?When it comes to graphics and level design, I cannot tell you how many times I stopped just to take screenshots or simply to admire the scenery. Each spot has something special to it, little details that are so well placed to give it depth and character, sometimes you almost want levels to last longer just to enjoy each one a little more.Levels, really decently long, oozing with story, characters developing right before your eyes, beautiful scenery, and all around are well put together to make the entirety have substance, this is all helped and topped with incredible voice acting and sound effects just being the cherry on top.OH! The weapons. The weapons... I want each and every single one as a replica on my wall. The detail to each unique piece is marvalous. The different feels and different looks to each upgrade, how well they fit into the environment, how they handle. Not one single complaint about them, aside from the lack of replica's.. Also When it comes to the hobby horse (my personal favourite), I almost didn't want to upgrade it to the final level due to the black deathmare being so badass.When coming down to it, I only have a few major gripes.. One resting with the god awful camera controls making certain places to get through a nightmare and some if not most fighting areas a near impossibility that is made even worse with the wonky targeting feature. Half the time it is targeting something you can't even hit while the closest enemy is in your face almost killing you. All while you're juggling to get the camera to not be looking at the pretty rock behind you but to focus on the crabs with cannons now blowing your face to pieces. Which then leads to your respawn, generally half a level behind, or just at the beginning of the same fight that you've been struggling with for about an hour now, making it even more infuriating. None the less, it's worth suffering through to enjoy this masterpiece. Afterall, we're all a little insane.			"

												8/10As an Alice in Wonderland fan, I'll be the first to say that I adore this game. It's not Alice though - it's a set a few years after Alice's parents burned to death in a fire and Alice's has to make her way in the world, occasionally seeing her therapist. Now, she returns to Wonderland. Madness returns.I completed this game on the Xbox 360. The controls are pretty clunky for PC so I'd recommend using a controller of some sort. The mechanics of the game are fairly enjoyable. A bit simplistic in places, There's a typical optional side quest for the completionists where you can collect some hidden treasures scattered throughout the game.The plot is excellent, and pretty dark in places. For those who require it, I'll offer a trigger warning for sexual abuse.			"

												I heard about this game a lot and saw Pewds play around with it a bit & I immediately fell in love with it and had to buy it (not even on a discount if you can believe!)At first it was absolutely mesmerizing to watch and everything was a surprise to me.The story is a bit all over the place, and the gameplay resembles games that came out in 1995, but the graphics are beautiful and the concept feels original. The art style is just breathtaking. Although it is a little glitchy at times, it has a lot of challenging puzzles and a unique gameplay.It has many, many weapons and a lot of combinations which come together to a very challenging fighting mode.It has a large variety of monsters to fend off and all of them to this day give me chills. It has a very mature and creepy vibe that I just adore.It does gets kind of repetitive after a few hours of gameplay, but I cannot lie, I enjoyed them all.7/10 is fair			"

												This game is beautiful, but the problem is, it's so crappily made that I can barely play it. EA could've done a much better job with this game, and they wasted its promise. I had to contact EA at first, cause it wouldn't even let me install it. After a few hours, I finally got it installed but the lag was really bad. I managed to fix it and everything was fine, but after a few more hours in, the problems came back and it wasn't even playable. I wish they would fix these things, but they won't. It's really unfortunate, because I have a great gaming laptop and it won't work.			"

												Mágico! Melhor jogabilidade que vi até hoje. o Enredo é excelente, te prende até o fim. O único problema é ser um pouco repetitivo, não ocorrem muitas mudanças, e, se analisarmos cada capítulo como único, torna-se massante. Ainda assim, é um jogo incrível e vale à pena ser jogado.			"

												Quality 3D platformer. Happy to see one with a demented plot too instead of the usual Nintendo formula. The floating in the triple jumps makes for fun timing puzzles and the combat can be really hard on the right difficulty. Good replay value for anyone into earning 100% too what with all the collectibles to be found.			"

												Alice Madness Returns can be very fun, and for the most part it is - but it can also be tedious. It has never been patched (thanks, EA) and suffers some bugs and glitches and performance issues (plus its an obvious console ports with the usual problems).It plays well enough however (better with controller), platforming is a lot of fun, combat is alright, like a watered-down spectacle fighter, story is just a creepy/crazy/mad as you'd expect... its a good sequel to the first Alice game, I would just hope it was more polish. And a bit more trimmed - some levels are just too long and some parts are superflouos. Thankfully you can skip some of the (many) minigames included.Either way, its a fun game. Unfortunately it is very expensive in Europe still.			"

												I freaking love this game. It's the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥ to beat but worth it. It's one of my favorite games of all time because its beautiful and you get great satifaction from beating the bad guys after challenging battles (and swearing a lot at the screen). Some games I find really repeatitive and boring. To complete achievements they just become an annoying time wasting chore. Who wants to play a game like that?? That's not the case with alice.

												I have a really divided opinion on Alice: Madness Returns. I'm giving it a highly qualified recommendation based on what I enjoyed and disliked about it.Let me begin with the cons:- Combat isn't always smooth. The lock on aim is subpar, as sometimes the camera angle will lock in awkward positions. Switching between weapons also isn't smooth; switching to a ranged weapon can sometimes incur a massive delay that feels out of place.- Terrible pacing. If it'd been shorter it would've been short and sweet, but at times playing through was a chore because it felt like the same puzzles over and over. Each chapter was a marathon, and the random minigames throughout were weird and not very fun. Time spent developing these minigame sequences should have been spent elsewhere.- Weak puzzles. While it's meant more as a platformer, there are enough puzzles in the game that it becomes quite uninspired and repetitive. Most of the game is ""jump jump pull switch jump jump"" in an obvious way. The last level has some more interesting puzzle/platform sequences but the rest of the game is weak in this regard.- Shrink is unexciting. Shrink is a mechanism introduced near the game start that lets you shrink down to enter keyhole doors and also gives you shrink-vision, revealing hidden platforms and hint messages. However, I mostly just spammed shrink so I wouldn't miss things visible only in shrink-vision, and the passageways entered by shrink were very straightforward. It could have had more potential but it ended up a bore.- Invisible walls. Given how the rest of the game visually is planned so carefully, I think that actual objects could often have been placed instead of invisible walls. What especially made me sad was that there were often gaps in walls that I hoped I could walk through with shrink, but it was just another wall.- Radula rooms. They were really boring, to be honest. Only two settings for Radula rooms, and they're only either battle challenges or minigames.Now here are the pros:- Visuals. Although the actual level of detail on the textures and polygons isn't always ultra-high, it's quite irrelevant because every inch of the game oozes style. It's absolutely gorgeous. It's visually almost like watching Avatar. absolutely gorgeous, except everything is also coated in blood.- Combat is fun. While not smooth if you rely on the lock-on, if you free-flow your combat it can really be a lot of fun. The enemies are generally challenging up until the end of the game. The ""transform into butterflies"" flash step mechanism also works well in tandem with the short Matrix-esque slow while fighting to dodge enemy attacks in frankly really awesome ways.- Memories are good collectibles. I have no idea what bottles are for, but the memories always add just a bit more to the narrative of the game, which makes for much more worthwhile collectibles as you want to get them for reasons beyond ""catch 'em all.""- Narrative. While Wonderland is visually quite gory with heavy horror imagery, the true horrors occur within the story itself. In fact, at times I felt enough empathy for Alice that it was difficult to continue. The narrative would have been smoother if the pacing of the game was more compact, but honestly it was one of the main driving factors for me to play through! It was quite a nice story.			"

I wouldn´t recommend it to anyone who easily loses it and doesnt like a bit more hardcore games but everyone else should give this great game a chance, because it is really worth it. Price is also much lower than it could be, so there really is nothing to lose!+ environment and character models+ music+ combat style+ story and main character+ enemies with their cool fighting strategies- autosaving (you aren´t able to save the game manualy = might lead to annoying rollbacks)- sometimes the difficultyFinal rating: 95%			"

This part is kind of like a poor man's Silent Hill+ The asylum segment was great+ Each level has at least one cool moment+ The entire game foreshadows a single moment in the final cutscene, which I thought was fairly well done- All Wonderland stages are really repetitive and drag on enough to become boring- Enemy designs are mostly boring and similar to each other- The platforming is awful- A big mechanic is platforming on invisible platforms- The puzzle solving is boring- The underwater level is one of the nine circles of hell- Many glitches & bugs- Animations can be clunky and awkward in 3D cutscenes- Most enemies aren't that fun to fight- The voice acting is mostly decent but there are a few that are distractingly badI really can't see myself playing the New Game +, but there's enough that I liked to give it a recommendation.

												I have many, many feelings about this game. It's gorgeous to look at with great visuals and really cool locations and great aesthetics. The storyline was solid with bits and pieces shown to you just enough to keep you guessing where it was going to take you. And as a platformer, it's pretty darn fun. Having played and enjoyed the first one, I really liked going back into Wonderland.However. The game has mini-games interspersed throughout the levels that with the exepction of one (the chess pieces), suck. The addition of items to find doesn't really add anything to the game and makes it feel less of a puzzle-platformer and more of a hunt-and-find platformer. The memories are a good item but the bottles and snouts...not so much.Overall, if you played and enjoyed the original Alice or if you really like the idea of Wonderland and seeing various themes of it, I'd recommend this game. But if neither one of these things interests you, I'd stay away. "

												I was only able to get halfway through the game before my data got wiped for whatever reason. I did want to finish the game, but I'm not interested in re-playing 40 hours worth of the game. This issue aside, it's perfect if you're interested in experiencing a new, creepy twist to Alice in Wonderland. It's primarily a puzzle game, but the 3D aesthetic, unique mobs, and challenges makes it more addicting than it seems. The game is pretty lengthy, but it's a great time waster, at least. There are a few minor bugs and glitches, but they aren't too bad to the point where they get in the way of the gameplay. While there are several other twisted versions of Alice in Wonderland out there, this is by far my favorite.Music: 10/10. I noticed the tunes played for every arc fits the mood and situation perfectly. It tops off the twisted wonderland feeling.Controls: 8/10. I used a controller to play, so I can't say much about keyboard controls, but I was able to get the hang of it without any issues. Some of the control settings aren't the most convenient, but they're doable.Gameplay: 10/10. Puzzle games by themselves probably don't sound very appealing. However, this game is the full package. There's a well done story, the 3D aesthetics are well done, and the chacter, mob, and setting designs have clearly been thought out and pushed the limits of creepy. Despite this being a horror based game, you can see that subtle enchanting affect popping up here and there. There are tons of other small details about the game that I love, like the unusual weapons and outfits changes.Graphics: 8/10. It looked a bit choppy and could use some smoothing out, but the creators did a great job in terms of visual affects. I couldn't pass by a new place without taking a screenshot because there was simply so much to look at and admire.			"

												To fully understand Alice: Madness Returns, we must first examine the original game, American McGee's Alice. Which is arguably my favorite videogame of all time. Let's consider various qualities of the first title and let's see if they were brought back in the sequel.Alice had a wonderful level design and art direction, with impressive textures for its time. While Madness Returns retains such great artistic value and a fairly good level design, the textures and props scattered around are fairly repetitive, and rather muddy in some sections. To the point of low resolution.Alice's combat revolved around various weapons, saved for the late, very powerful, mandatory tools of destruction. Also, the title offered various enemies to keep things interesting. While Madness Returns got its good share of unique monsters, the combat is made a trivial affair by two or three weapons, with some of the Alice's moves barely being involved at all. It's a practical matter.Alice liked to throw in some puzzles from time to time, each of them different and increasingly difficult, to the point of reaching PLATFORM HELL in later levels. Madness Returns has a great total of three or four kinds of puzzle which are repeated every time is needed. Also, they are skippable with impunity.To cut this suggestion short, Alice: Madness Returns can be enjoyed for its intriguing, fridge horrorific story, atmosphere and artistic design, but it has very little to offer elsewhere, with a repetitive gameplay and a general lack of polish.... Also, no bosses.... I belived I had to mention that.			"

												This game cannot be described with words, whoever made this game is mentally corrupted, and honestly sick. The new Alice is certainly more mature and hotter than your classic Alice. The atmosphere in the game is full of corruption, darkness, and sickness, it makes you feel really weird. The game has really astonishing story, not necessary in a good way, this is its greatest advantages. The puzzles are somehow boring to me, they are waste of time, The combat moves are nice and there are some really tough enemies, however, it needs some improvements specially camera wise :| , the combat system is similar to Darksiders II, But Darksiders II has much entertaining combat skills and moves. One of the amazing thing in the game is the levels design, art, and effect. You will enjoy this game if you want to, don't play it just to finish it like me (then you will enjoy it less)			"

The one thing that stands out the most about this game is the breathtaking visuals and elaborate sets and stages.

												-If you value visuals over minor bugs, then I'm sure you'll be okay with this game. Any glitch or bug I've had while playing could be fixed by restarting the game, so nothing game-breaking so far.-This game is beautiful and dark. There is some blood and other disturbing elements involved, but also some gorgeous sights to behold.-The general game difficulty and puzzles aren't mind-numbingly difficult, so prepare for a smooth ride.-There aren't jumpscares. (This is something I'm happy about.) It saves you the terrifyingly annoying fear of being screamed at around the next corner. The horror aspect is mostly from the atmosphere, and there are many bits (Alice's attire, environment, music, etc.) that contribute to the theme of the chapter/area.-Took me a little while to understand all aspects of the story, but being the age I am, it always takes me a while to get it.-The combat, weapon upgrades and platform/jumping puzzles are quite fun in my opinion, especially once you know what you're doingI will continue to play and replay this game. It is one of the gems that reaches many of the things I love to see in games.			"

												I heard about this game a lot and saw Pewds play around with it a bit & I immediately fell in love with it and had to buy it (not even on a discount if you can believe!)At first it was absolutely mesmerizing to watch and everything was a surprise to me.The story is a bit all over the place, and the gameplay resembles games that came out in 1995, but the graphics are beautiful and the concept feels original. The art style is just breathtaking. Although it is a little glitchy at times, it has a lot of challenging puzzles and a unique gameplay.It has many, many weapons and a lot of combinations which come together to a very challenging fighting mode.It has a large variety of monsters to fend off and all of them to this day give me chills. It has a very mature and creepy vibe that I just adore.It does gets kind of repetitive after a few hours of gameplay, but I cannot lie, I enjoyed them all.7/10 is fair			"

												THIS is how I view Wonderland in my head and this is the way Alice should always be remembered: The beautifully intelligent, badass girl. Everything is so wonderfully twisted, excellently referenced, and completely crazy. It was completely fun but I suggest playing it on the hardest difficulty for it to be challenging and fun. I thought the twirling and floaing was going to be over powered...it was absolutely balanced and was wonderfully done. The most badass weapon you could possibly have in my opinion was the Vorpal Blade, so Awesome. My advice is when you get the Coffee Pot use it in a combo with the Vorpal Blade to be amazing.This game was Perfect.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is an action platformer inspired by Alice in Wonderland. This is a follow up to American McGee's Alice, and shares the same style. That style is what this game has in spades. It stars the Alice in Wonderland characters, but in a very grimdark/steampunk universe. If that is your cup of tea, then this game is definitely for you. If not, then take a closer look at the gameplay to see if you would like this.This game is a very linear action platformer. You will be ushered along from point A to B in mostly constrictive environments. Along the way, you will battle baddies with you selection of weapons (blade, hammer, pepper gun, umbrella) and look for collectibles. Collectible teeth can be saved to upgrade your weapons. The other collectibles have no noticeable effect apart from filling in some backstory. Combat can be quite exhilirating at times, since the enemies are varied and are thrown at you in different combinations. You will definitely have to use dodging, blocking and switching weapons to succeed. I mostly stuck with the Vorpal blade since it seemed to be the quickest, although some enemies require the Pepper gun to create openings. Learning enemy patterns is also very necessary to survive. The combat can also be very difficult at times, which would not normally be an issue, but if you die due to enemy attack you could be set back several minutes in progress. Checkpoints save automatically, but on more than one occasion I found that after dying I had to complete several sections of platforming just to get back to the battle. This can be quite annoying, especially since if you happen to fall during platforming you are usually just sent back to the platform you fell from. I do not know why they are different checkpoints for each, and I would much prefer just starting again from the beginning of the battle. The platforming controls are tight and fun, with double jumps and floating at your disposal. You know you made a mistake when you fall, and that is all you can ask for.The graphics are definitely a selling point, especially if you are a fan of steampunk. Everything is heavily stylized, with only Alice having a hint of being realistic. There was some noticeable slowdown in certain areas, especially during battles. Framerate came to a stutter a few times, which is odd considering I can run most newer games from 2014 in medium-high settings and this game came out in 2011. The music and voice acting are all very well done. Once again, if you like Alice in Wonderland or steampunk you will probably really enjoy the dialogue, but if not, well it can be quite silly at times.I would recommend Alice: Madness Returns to all those that are huge fans of action platforming, or like the idea of a steampunk Alice in Wonderland. While it is not the best of its genre, it is worthy of a try if you really like those types of games. I found myself not terribly interested in the story, but I am just not a fan of that style and i won't hold it against this game. People that are only mildly interested in platforming might want to look elsewhere first.Grade: B-			"

Each of the themed levels in wonderland make a certain kind of sense given the series' frank commentaries on sanity. The gameplay itself is a combination of platforming and simple combat encounters that are very subjective to the different ""regions"" of wonderland. This is largely a casual, adult adventure filled with amazing environments but not a whole lot of depth.			"

												Hands down some of the best art direction I have seen in a game in years. If you are fan of the weird and messed up this is for you. The game does have it's problems as far as a few chrashes, targeting and the camera at times, but it is well worth a run through. Best played with a controller.

Some levels reminded me of the Quay brothers' Crocodile Streets (which is awesome), and all levels were just fun to explore. Highly recommended, especially if you played and liked American McGee's Alice.			"

												It's nowhere near as good as the first Alice, but it's still a pretty good game. The graphics are beautiful, and the physics are really great. However, the level design is pretty dry and repetetive, and there is an extreme lack of boss fights. It has more flaws than most triple A releases, but I enjoyed it. I'd only buy it if you're a fan of the first Alice, otherwise skip this.			"

												Standard progression, through a wonderfully prepared set of levels but just when you begin to tire of the one-paced experience they throw in something different to keep it interesting.A shame the in-game collectibles don't entice you in to having a need to complete the set - and considering there are 150+, they've missed a trick. The weapon upgrades are straight forward, and again it would have been nice to see something other than simply brute force and a change of graphics added.Chaper 5 onward is strictly out of bounds for your kids as the game takes a dark, bitter turn and won't be pleasant viewing for any little ones.Beautiful, bonkers and occasionally an exceptionally frustrating playing experience - but the other 95% game and delicious scenery more than make up for the occasional shortcoming. Most definitely recommended.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns has almost everything I love in a game.The platform gameplay is brilliant, and the combat has its level of dificulty, make the game incredibly fun.The story is envolving and the atmosphere is pretty creepy. The combat reminds me of Legend of Zelda: OoT and Twilight Princess, with a enemy-lockon feature and a great variety of weapons.The art style is divine and the graphics, while not perfect, are pretty good.

												Alice : Madness Returns is a adventure/platformer game that takes you through various locations, while jumping, bouncing, exploring & killing monsters. I will keep the review simple, list of pros & cons below.+Unique artstyle, creepy, eerie & dark is what it's best described as.+Game runs fluid for me, 60+fps all the time (a few stutters do happen mainly when starting a new level or due to physx)+Physx is amazing, dust, particle effects & other things all move around when touched.+Various locations to explore, half the time you'll end up just gazing at the wonderfully done environments & backgrounds+Platforming is actually fun and not tedious, you have the ability to double jump & hover.+Cheshire the cat and his quotes+Various enemies will be encountered along your adventure+/- repetitive combat, while I didn't mind it others will be bored to death because you're mainly doing the same moves over & over. You do have some different weapons to take on enemies, the vorpal knife & hobby horse for light/heavy melee attacks, pepper grinder & teapot cannon for light/heavy ranged attacks and an umbrella for deflecting some ranged attacks back. +/- Game takes about 9-11 hours average to complete, while I thought it was a decent length, it might overstay it's welcome to some-Some ugly graphics up close-Needed to edit a file to unlock framerate-Previous game not includedWould definitely recommend this game to people who like Alice and/or adventure platforming games with a unique artstyle.PC SPECSGTX 980ti4790K 4.4ghz16GB DDR3 Ram			"

												Took me 18 hours to finish the storyline (Steam counting bugged for some reason), took 300 of screenshots. This game is really beautiful, the graphics are astounding, storyline is original and characters are simply amazing. Suprisingly it doesn't get repetitive, at least not so much that it would make you turn off the game. The parkour is probably the hardest thing about the game, because if you upgrade your weapons, you can easily kill any enemy without getting a scratch. Although, this game is not for you if you expect a fairytale Wonderland. Not at all. Lot of blood and your childhood heroes dying. You know, casual stuff.			"

												An interesting and enjoyable game. It has an original and absorbing story. The main character, Alice is pretty badass such as her arsenal. A little bit gory, implies strong language and can even be scary for those with doll phobia. However it' s not a finnished game, it was released too early, it' s not polish, it has countless bugs (some of them really annoyng) and could do it with a patch or two (i think).

												NOTE: This is my opinions and thoughts of the game and not an overall view if the game for general audience. As with many reviews and opinions, take this with a grain of salt and do your own research. It is a shame I have to put up these notes telling people what they should already know on to do their own, but due to inflammatory commentry, I do.Okay, so I wound up playing this game for 5 hours straight and absolutely love it. From the beginning, this game is artsy, gothic, surreal, creative, inventive, and a bit disturbing. The beloved fantasy realm Alice used as her escape from reality-from life-is thrown into chaos, mirroring the once innocent girl's now tomented mind. Through stunning and disturbing imagery we can see what Wonderland once was, what it has become, and what it is turning into. The camera and movement controls are just as perfect as directional buttons and a joystick, so those used to PS3 like myself had no problems adjusting. Gameplay is fluid, colors are vibrant to dull, sharp to blended, and the attention to detail is perfect. There is nothing boring or dull about this game as it really takes hold or your senses of sight and sound, keeping your brain stimulated and your reflexes ready.My only complait about this game is that there is no camera sensitivity controls and during in-game play it's kind of fast, out of gameplay it's slow. Other than that this game is worth the money for more than just the gameplay, but the experience as well.			"

												I BECAME A BUTTERFLY. Jokes aside, the game is good with amazing story, authentic artwork, and decent battle system. The good of this game is the rich of story and it makes you want to play further until it will satisfy you. for the bad side, you will have to experience death many times when you struggling to solve the puzzle, but, as your go further into the story/chapters, you will be used to it.  Decent battle system as you need to collect teeth as your currency to upgrade weapon and you don't need to worry about upgrading to the max,as you will max it out most of it if you explore ab little bit. Overall, I like the game and I feel it was a little bit underrated as I don't know the game until I watch a certain youtuber play this game. And I can assure you, this game is one of the most amazing game. Totally badass Alice.			"

												A game worth playing. I enjoyed the view and the creation of wonderlands. No wonder the developer spends time on it, in different chapters the worlds are different but marvelous. The monsters are brutal, but all have their own way to attack so prepare youself before they attack. Still, you may die a few times before clear your path, this game is not for beginers.This game also challenges your control ability. It requires a lot of accurate jumps, and quick jumps/reactions in limited time. The main story is solid, characters are believable. It took me 12 hours to beat the game, a bit long but you won't get tired.And yes, I recommend this game. "

												To fully understand Alice: Madness Returns, we must first examine the original game, American McGee's Alice. Which is arguably my favorite videogame of all time. Let's consider various qualities of the first title and let's see if they were brought back in the sequel.Alice had a wonderful level design and art direction, with impressive textures for its time. While Madness Returns retains such great artistic value and a fairly good level design, the textures and props scattered around are fairly repetitive, and rather muddy in some sections. To the point of low resolution.Alice's combat revolved around various weapons, saved for the late, very powerful, mandatory tools of destruction. Also, the title offered various enemies to keep things interesting. While Madness Returns got its good share of unique monsters, the combat is made a trivial affair by two or three weapons, with some of the Alice's moves barely being involved at all. It's a practical matter.Alice liked to throw in some puzzles from time to time, each of them different and increasingly difficult, to the point of reaching PLATFORM HELL in later levels. Madness Returns has a great total of three or four kinds of puzzle which are repeated every time is needed. Also, they are skippable with impunity.To cut this suggestion short, Alice: Madness Returns can be enjoyed for its intriguing, fridge horrorific story, atmosphere and artistic design, but it has very little to offer elsewhere, with a repetitive gameplay and a general lack of polish.... Also, no bosses.... I belived I had to mention that.			"

Alice: Madness Returns presents the beautiful but dark memories of a young girl.Pros: Graphics, Sound, StoryCons: Controls, Gameplay, PerformanceThe world of Alice: Madness Returns is wonderfully crafted, each preserving a sense of eerie beauty.  The sound and voice acting is excellent, matching the world and characters well.  Alice's adventures through Wonderland allow her tragic and dark past to come to light.  A Mature rating is well-deserved.The controls leave much to be desired, expecially camera and combat controls.  Though no support is listed, an XBox 360 controller seems to work and is recommended.  Gameplay becomes tedious after a while.  Finally, performance is severly lacking, with multiple crashes, bugs, and freezes.Alice: Madness Returns, despite its problems, is one of the best games based on Lewis Carroll's classic.8/10			"

												I bought this game many years ago. It was fun, but got repetative in the middle so I stopped playing it. I have too many steam games to keep them all installed so I uninstalled it. I came back to it and had some more fun for a bit then got bored again and uninstalled it. Then my hard drive failed and I got a new one an installed it again but didn't really play it so I uninstalled it again. I got the urge once more and tried to play it again but I could not.You only get 3 installs with this game and afterwards you cannot play it anymore. So now this game is forever in my steam library but I cannot play it because I have installed it too many times. DRM - so amazing for consumers. What is the point of this game in my library if I cannot play it?EDIT: Policy has changed and you can now install the game more than 3 times. Thank you ssjkenny for letting me know.

												What can I say about Alice. Well it's another journey down the rabbit hole through her madness and her journey to cure or at least learn more about it. There are locales showcasing her inner darkness and her whimsical imagination so there are nice shifts of the overall feel between levels. That and slowly gathering the pieces of her memories either through actually collecting them in game as well as the bits the story gives you is intriguing and you want to know more just like Alice herself. My only gripe with the game are the controls are odd with a mouse and keyboard and make the platforming a nightmare at times especially in latter levels where platforming is changeling, involving timed jumps, slides and changes of direction.

												Just as great if not better than the first. Most certainly a visual masterpeice.*Added in Nov 2016*I originally played and finished the game shortly after release.Upon returning to it, I've found it to be even more enchanting in 2016.I had no issues with the EA authentication but am aware that it is currently not for sale on Steam. Hopefully that is resolved as it's still a gem of a game and triple screen support is quite easy to fix.			"

												This game is gorgeous. The art direction is beautiful; every environment is nothing short of brilliant. I don't think I've seen anything quite like Tundraful, with the moon and sun having an almost papier mache quality to them; the sun literally frozen in its orbit; while the crescent moon smokes a cigarette, the green trails of which become the aurora borealis. The gameplay itself is great, but you'll probably find yourself stopping just to rotate the camera and take everything in. Definitely pick this up if you haven't already.			"

												I would buy it when it's on sale. It isn't worth the full $20, but there are definitely things worth seeing in this game. It is definitely quite the experience, and the game does ""insanity"" well.The fighting system is good, and the animations are stunning. It feels very powerful to be swinging around a giant unicorn mace.The gameplay is where this game falls short. The entire game is mainly (I'm not joking) jumping puzzles. While there are story bits here and there, the game is full of annoying, repetitive jumping puzzles. Other puzzles include moving tiles to match an image, and these are often ♥♥♥♥-easy. Graphics are pretty good too (Unreal Engine), and offer the perfect balance between beauty and horror. 7/10, would buy on sale.			"

												The only thing this game really has going for it is art direction.  The actual game design was boring in the original and it's quite boring here as well.  This very much remains a typical 90's style 3D platformer with clunky combat.  For a few bucks, it's not a bad buy, but if you played the original and didn't like it, you won't like this one either.			"

												Even if you didn't play American McGee's alice 14+ years ago this game is still worth a play. Personally I played it more for the art rather than the gameplay, but that's just how it appealed to me. Both the combat and the ""graphics"" are great. The game's combat can be challenging for an adventure type depending on the difficulty one plays the game at, and if one refrains from abusing the teapot cannon *wink, wink*. There are a few puzzles of average difficulty, but they can even be skipped if the player is so inclined. The game encourages the player to look for secret's and solve puzzles as they give one a clearer idea of what's actually going on in the story, but it tends to not be required in order to advance in the game. All it serves to acomplish is to give the player a clearer idea of what happened in Alice's past that lead up to the mystery that drives the game. The story is pretty dark and some of it is left up to one's own interpretation, but overall the game gives you a fantastic plot that has some great twists. The cinematic's are fantastic and ample throughout the game (but not annoyingly so) and the art style varries for the different cultures expirienced in it as well. Everything about it services to create a very ineteresting expirience that the player won't soon forget.			"

												Alice is an interesting tale of dark magic and repressed memories from psychological scarring. I won't applaud it for doing anything particularly amazing as the gameplay and story feel mostly disconnected. However, it provides drive to keep you going, if you can push yourself through the hurdles this game unnecessarily provides you.As a 3D platformer with combat elements, the game is actually very solid, with tight controls and a (mostly) fluid combat system. It's a pretty stock standard combat system, but it's functional and with additional abilities unlocked over time, it does gain some diversity.My biggest complaint is the sheer length of the game. While it looks pretty good throughout, a lot of areas drag out far longer than is welcome. I legit put in about 15 hours to complete this game and  I have to say most of it was tedious and repetitive.Alice is a good game, trapped inside EA's Origin system. If you're prepared to struggle through, you will get a pretty decent platformer so long as you bring a controller. The mouse/keyboard controls are balls.			"

												If you like Alice in Wonderland, macabre/horror, and gameplay that is simple but challenging, this is a great piece to play.  This takes you through American McGee's grim take on Alice's story.  This is actually a sequel to a previous game, but I played through and enjoyed without knowing that.  The artwork and dialogue/voice acting in this game are great.In essence, it's like a 3D platformer with good story and art behind it.  The gameplay is essentially simple battles, simple puzzle-solving, and a ridiculous amount of platform-jumping.  The amount of platform jumping really frustrated me, but I had to just deal with it to see where the story ended.  There is a basic upgrade system and there is DLC available (embedded in the game files) if you'd like to replay the game differently, many of the extra outfits for Alice change up the gameplay well.

												Since Steam only supports up or down reviews I’ll give this one a thumbs-up on the basis of its great graphics, superb voice acting and dark story. The action throughout the game is generally good as well, although, as other reviewers have pointed out, the “lock on” feature can be a pain to use. In short, if you’re willing to see the game through it can be a rewarding experience, and the finale is incredibly satisfying.Unfortunately, the game has its fair share of faults as well. There are no Steam achievements and the game is home to more than its fair share of bugs and glitches, sometimes requiring a restart. However, the biggest problem with the game is some of the design choices; it's full of “padding” meant to add hours to the game that feel totally unnecessary. Worse, while some of the easier puzzles can be skipped, most of the gimmicky sections, like directing a doll head through a 3D pinball machine, can’t. These sections are in equal parts painful and annoying and you’ll be glad when they’re done. The game’s jumping mechanic is also totally merciless; while most games will let the protagonist crawl up onto platforms that they nearly made it on, Madness Returns does not. If even Alice’s tippy-toes don’t make it onto the platform you will plummet to your death, again and again and again. This is not a game for the faint-hearted.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is true homage to the Duck Tails type of games where you jump over obstacles, collect flashy stuff and kill enemies without graphical violence. I purchased it because the design looked so irresistable beautiful. And I didn't have to be disappointed. The world is awe-strickingly beautiful, crazy in the sense of fantasy and highly original. The running speed and jumping capabilities are really pushing the whole flow of the game and make Alice a sort of superhero. I played Borderlands 2 after Alice and I couldn't get rid of trying to attempt the double jump, that was so well embed in Madness Returns that I felt disabled from the lack of this feature in other games.I consider gaming an escapist hobby and Alice: Madness Returns has taken hold of this idea and put it to use. Alice travels between two worlds: the real world, which is a dark, distorted, unpleasant and dirty place while the other, Wonderland is a colorful, bright, interesting place where Alice gains superpowers - a true escapist vision and understanding of balance between fantasy and reality. And it's yet another aspect that upgrades the game once you discover that the creators have thought about it.Some negative aspects:The game had an issue with the fighting script, especially when you were surrounded by several enemies. Executing the malee attack command caused Alice to either attack in the wrong direction or deliver several uncontrolled attacks. This put the player in a tight position because it's not a particularly easy game and every health bar was on count. This problem became more and more of an issue in the second half of the game.Verdict:The game was and Experience with a capital. It was fun, the flow of the game was very enjoyable, the puzzles were challenging, the fighting script has potential for improvement but overall the game has great replay value.			"

												A basic hack'n slash platformer with a crazy twist. I've loved this game ever since it came out and I recommend this to people who get easily hooked on the story and like to solve puzzles. Some minor bugs in the controls, for example Alice gets stuck on some carpet's edges while running over them. Beautiful scenery, insane soundtrack, disturbing details and oh my, those 2D animation clips... The ending's a bit rushed and it lacks a big fight with a big bad guy even though one has been foreshadowed from the very beginning. Truly a game for people who like their games weird and who enjoy gazing around and finding collectable items. Snort snort!			"

												While Alice is now a bit dated (time of writing 2016), the colors and design of the levels make the very best of the relatively simple geometries from 2011 and looks great. The unique story is interesting and in each chapter you learn a new clue that keeps your attention. It's also been a while since a game had actual sidescroller mini-games in it. The dresses are cool and the music is great. While you might think ""an Alice in Wonderland game? Must be for kids.."" Ha no, don't let kids play this, they'll get nightmares and end up like Alice!The bad: This is unfortunately a console port and EA did very little to make it compatable with PC controls. First off, if the game won't let you register open starting, copy the key and add it to Origin, then it'll even work through Steam. There are many forum posts online on what lines to change in the .ini's for removing the horrible mouse lag/smoothing, as well as removing the 30fps cap among other things. You will run into bugs and sudden crashes happen occasionally, but it's not bad enough to ruin the game.			"

Alice: Madness ReturnsTo begin with, I highly recommend playing this game, and here's the reason why: Alice.Based on American McGee's vision of Alice and her imaginary (for sure?) Wonderland, this game takes you on a adventure into depths of Alice's mind, which in it's current state, is a pretty devasted place. A:MR is a typical platforming slasher, similar to Devil May Cry but a little less complicated - combos are limited, there's not much special attacks etc. Fighting mechanism, though limited, is based on finding enemies' weaknesses and using them, which on higher difficulty levels (I played on Nightmare) can be a bit tricky to pull off. Throughout the game, you're able to use 5 types of weapons (with a very interesting design), given to you on various stages of gameplay. Fights are extremely satisfying, challenging and well-balanced. The only aspect of fighting which I didn't like was targetting (by default set to Caps Lock), as it sometimes messes with the camera. Platforming aspect of the game lacks a little comparing to similar games. There are a lot of invisible walls, meshes and textures which block your path (best example being straight floor with a little crack in it which you have to jump over) or places where you'd think you can jump to, but you can't. Also, Alice's ability to dodge mid-air, which makes your jump longer, sometimes doesn't work properly, making you dodge into the abyss rather than forward.  All of those though, become forgivable, when you take a look at scenery and level design. I've never seen world more beautiful and grotesque in a video game. There's always a challenge of some sort in your path, which makes the game enjoyable throughout the ~17 hours gameplay (on Nightmare difficulty). Every chapter is different, introducing new lands in Wonderland and what comes with it - new enemies. The most important thing is the plot. Grotesque, fascinating and magical at the same time. I can only say that you must save Wonderland, to save yourself, and vice-versa. Pros: gameplay, plot, atmosphere, fights, visuals, Alice and WonderlandCons: invisible walls (!), targeting during fights, places which you might find reachable in fact are not, a little bit of general ""bugginess""All in all: 8/10 "

												I once heard that insanity is when, ""what's [in one's head] doesn't match [what's around them]."" Alice: Madness Returns takes this definition and constructs around it an artful story of a young woman fighting to reconnect with “what’s in her head.”From the moment the game starts, I was met with intricate character design and thoughtful scenery; the entire game oozes with wonderfully dark depictions of Lewis Carroll’s beloved incarnation of the imagination. A true treat for fans of the macabre and an artful abomination for others! But enough with this, let’s get to the game itself.Alice: Madness Returns is a platformer indeed; puzzles and side-scrolling games are scattered throughout. All are quite nicely done. However, for many of these puzzles ad side-scrolling sections, the controls are not explained and camera angles are off. Consequently, players will be unable to see looming dangers and drops hidden off-screen. A frustrating prospect indeed. Still, not enough to deter players but certainly enough to become quite the annoyance. Enemies can vary from easy to challenging. While there is only one true boss-fight in the game, the introduction of many new enemies can certainly seem to be a boss-fight. Players will be forced to learn how to take down new foes. I found the scarcity of true boss-fights to be enjoyable. In my opinion, it was certainly part of the storytelling. Still, I can imagine some gamers may be disappointed by this.In any case, Alice: Madness Returns is certainly one of my new favorite games; taking platforming and storytelling to some interesting places indeed! And, as I’ve said, certainly adding an insightful look on mental illness.  "

The graphics and physics engines mesh well with the art style, yet the music is largely forgettable. The platforming is very well done, however the combat is lacking in some respects. Having read the original Alice books, the games make many references to the characters and events of the novels, yet is devoid entirely of all of the literary nonsense and madness, at least in the dialogue, that made the originals so intriguing. The story premise is also very interesting, yet the pacing and dialogue falls a tad short for me in the game.It's a good sequel to the original, and people looking for a nice romp through a dark game will find it enjoyable, as will those who like 3D platformers. I still feel it could be better, and hopefully if a sequel comes out to this one day it will further improve upon the already solid series.			"

												The game designers were very creative with their artworks. They are able to pull you in to the scene itself with such unique picturesque views. While playing it is fun to find all the secret snouts & memories.Sound effects & music is perfect. The storyline is good, but not too detailed. Unfortunately the character can be hard to controls due to all they keys blindings: especially during battle. But overall fantastic game.			"

												This is a very good sequel to the cult classic game, American Mcgee's Alice. with great graphics and artwork and really knows how to continue on from the first game.Pros+Unlike the first game were the platforming feels cumbersome. Madness Returns improved it with more fluid jump mechanics.+Very lush, detailed graphics. Not to metion the various dresses Alice wears in each chapter.+Unlike Alice where is it basic. Madness Returns adds a combat focus mechanic where you can lock on an specific enemy. Also Alice can do a dodge dash, and when low on health she can go in hysteria mode (Just don't too reckless).+Inludes a new game plus for replayablity.Cons-The combat focus mechanic is a double edged sword. While it is a good mechanic. Its cumbersome to switch on multiple targets and you can't jump while in focus mode.-Not as many weapons as in the first game.-unlike in the first Alice where there are a fair number of boss fights. Madness returns only has one boss fight which feels cheap.Some minor stuff-No DLC in this version			"

 I LOVE IT!  Gore + Female (with menstrual hysteria on low health ^_^ and floating midair with butterflies just by using her skirt!) + Goth outfits + Very cute but deadly weapons with cool visual and sound effects  = Alice: Madness Returns! The puzzles are not that easy to accomplish if you want games that just jump and do the deed... Nope! Not Alice! She likes it hard! I checked every corner for clues while on my shrink Alice and collected as much teeth as I can. This game taught me  PATIENCE. Since I'm not really good at jumping and using her floating skirt! ^_^ I give this game 100/10 (Does that even make sense? LOL!) Had so much fun playing this and killing all her nemesis with her badass weapons. Still having second thoughts on buying this game? Don't think! Just look at her and click the ""Add to Cart"" button! Never regretted buying this game because it's worth it. ^_^			"

												Games these days have begun to trail off from one another with different themes and qualities. From Physical Action, strategical thinking, dark mystery, and more, we all love them in their own special way. However even though they are great in their own ways, what would a game look like with all of their attributes combined into one look like? And that my friends would be the very game called ""Alice: Madness Returns"" This game is purely amazing. It has a very nice balance of all of the qualities other game posses. As you play this game you will travel into the depths of Alice's mind (Wonderland) seeing the beauties and terrors of what lurks within, while you try and prevent her madness of overcoming her. Throughout  your journey you encounter hellishly twisted enemies , complete a large verity of quest which each one involving a different form of thinking, and of course spectacular views of Alice's marvelous Wonderland. Even though once in a while the game may have a glitch or two you may need to look up to solve, over I rate this games a tumbs. Although i consider this to be one of the ideal games for adventure gamers, I still recommend it towards everyone. "

												I loved the 2001 Alice, it was a one of a kind game at the time.  While that game was a FPS, Madness Returns is most accurately described as a platformer, with awkward, gimped first person aim mode (the game basically forces you to use its auto-aim ""focus"" mode while fighting) and ""challenge jumping"" a constant throughout the game.  The graphics are well-done for the most part, but game progression relies too much on making a new platform appear, etc. by turning levels and shooting pig snouts with a pepper gun (Pig snouts, why?  I don't know).  Side activities are mainly to find teeth (to upgrade weapons - which is fine, but isn't finding a new gun more fun??) and bottles, memories, etc., which as far as I can tell don't directly help the player and are more of an achievement thing.  Thumbs down for an overall tedious experience.			"

												I waited for so long for this game to come out, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed. I've played the first game, but was happy to find that you really don't need to in order to fully understand what's going on in this one regardless. The level designs are beautiful and well thought out, but some of the jump puzzles are a real pain. I love how Alice's dress changes to suit the levels; it was a nice touch on a great game. The characters in the game are a well thought out twist on the characters from the books and the voice acting is *phenomenal*. Being a fan of the original books, I like how they've chosen to represent the characters and their respective lands.There are a few things I don't care for, though. The controls can be clumsy and it makes it difficult when fighting hoards of enemies. Sometimes the weapons will lock up and not let me switch them out, as well.Overall it's a great game. I guess 'enchanting' would be a good word for it, since it's absolutely beautiful and has its own distinct personality. 9/10 I really recommend it.			"

												First of all ... yes, this game has bugs. I completely understand why that can take some off the fun out of playing Alice, but for me personally, this game was so much fun that by the end, I had all but forgotten about the bumpy start. It's a lovely, intelligent story, combined with beautiful graphics and clever gameplay.The design is wonderful to look at, although better in some levels than in others. The game remained a challange right through the end. It's not insanely difficult, I'll admit that, but it's also not repetive and with frequent weapon updates and new enemies, you'll have a good time trying out all kinds of ways to kill your oponent. It's still amongst my favorite games and (especially on sale) it's absolutely worth your money!			"

Alice: Madness Returns  is a game that felt like a really clumsy dance with your high school crush. By which I mean you're constantly looking past the fact that she keeps treading on your toes, and at the end of the evening you're glad that you got to do it, but also kind of faintly let down.  So the game is interesting visually, with lots of colour, and the slow destruction of that vibrancy into a Tim Burton-esque Victorian London. I actually really enjoyed the black goo and the fire damage and the ebbing away of light, even if it was a little ham-handed in it's lack of subtlety. The combat and platforming are fine - they're entirely servicable and combat in particular feels nice and responsive, but it's all very repetitive and nothing really interesting happens to shake things up. And, while the world seems large and entirely open, invisble fences artificially shoe-horn you along the plot.My biggest issue - and it isn't really an issue, I just didn't really dig it - was the plot. The reveal is about as obvious as the screen in front of you, and yet it's teased so relentlessly. There's no real need to spoil it though, since you'll figure it out in the first 10 minutes of the game.So yeah. It's a fun enough game, and definitely worth the price if you get it for a couple of pounds, but don't expect to fall in love - your bruised feet will be sore for a good couple of days.  "

If you can allow yourself to be immersed in it, the game can hit at a psychological level few try, and fewer still succeed, at hitting.  I'll put it this way: in a world of 90% off Steam sales, if Alice has a sequel, I'd buy it at full price when it came out.			"

												A gorgeous 3D platformer that will take you through beautiful and dark worlds in Alices mind, as she tries to deal with the psychological trama of loosing her family in a house fire. ------Summary at the Bottom------GameplayAlice Madness Returns for the most part is a linear 3D platformer with basic elements of combat. The platforming feels tight and I never had any issue with the controls other than the camera in a couple of spots but adjusting the camera fixes it easy enough.The combat is basic hack and slash combat with a small variety of weapons to use such as a teapot, a knife, a pole horse and an umbrella. Each weapon is used in its own unique way and is needed for certain situations both in combat and for progressing through levels. Each weapon works differently from one another, for example the knife is quick but does weak damage where as The horsepole is strong but slow.GraphicsThe graphics in this game are very well done with sort of a steampunk goth horror style. Whether it be the dark streets of london or the beautiful mushroom forests of wonderland, this game knows what it wants to be. Its beautiful eye candy when it needs to be and digustingly creepy when it needs to be. Each chapter is very unique with its own setting and visuals. The levels are cleverly designed using things that would be naturally found in the environment as part of the platforming, such as steam from pipes working as sort of a boost between platforms in the factory levels.Character designs are unique and well done, with each chapter having its own unique characters, some being better than others. I personally enjoyed the mushroom forests and the card castle levels.AudioThe Audio is decent with the voice acting being very hit or miss for some characters, however the voice they chose for Alice was a perfect fit. Not sure if it was the same voice actor from the first game as I never looked into it or not, but they sound similar. The level audio is well done and makes the levels feel living and tangible.StoryThe storyline is a dark one continued from the first game. However you do not need to play the first game to really enjoy this game, as I actually played through this one first without even knowing about the first game. I have since went back and played the first game and although it does help to understand the story slightly better, it is not needed.You play as Alice who is a mental mess after her family dies in a house fire with alice being the only survivor. Events lead to Alice thinking she was the one who started it and blaming herself for the death of her family. This in turn does weird and disturbing things to wonderland, which is Alices sort of world in her head she can use to escape from reality. After noticing wonderland has gone into array and is in a very dark time, Alice sets off to find out wahts behind it and solve the issue and save wonderland as well as herself.SummaryIf you are a fan of steampunk/Gothic horror visuals then you will love the setting of this game. The storyline is pretty well done and will take you through a variety of different chapters, each very unique from one another and no you do not need to play the first game to understand this one, as I actually played this one first. The platforming controls feel tight and fluent, however the combat can feel a little bit stale with it basically being a hack and slash format. You have a small variety of upgradable weapons with Some being needed to take down certain enemies. This is definetly a game I would recommend with fun platforming and so many unique worlds to go through and explore. There was so much eye candy in this game, I couldn't stop taking screenshots. The game is decently long at around 12+ hours nad a variety of hidden collectable items can keep you playing even longer. Worth it at full price.			"

												Pros:+Absolutely stunning art and world design.+Alice is a very likeable protagonist (at least to me)+Game is a decent length and is actually a bit of a challenge on the hardest difficulty.Cons:+Shaky performance on AMD here, I have a 6350 paired with a 2GB 7850 and I get nasty framerate drops every now and then when there are a lot of particles on the screen. This happens on both the Steam version and the Origin version, and did not improve with a cracked version of the game either.+Relatively short experience+Combat camera can be exceptionally clunky at times+Boss fights are generally easy, even on the hardest difficulty.Overall: 9.5/10, but sadly, as a huge fan of this game, the PC version suffers from slowdowns even on very high end computers (tested with a 4770k/GTX 980 and had the same issues.)

												This game is an all time favourite of mine. The world is beautifully crafted and the atmosphere is suitably crazed and dark, with strange entities everywhere you look. The voice acting and cutscenes are excellent as well. While I cannot speak for gameplay without an x-box controller, with one the game flows very well and combat is challenging yet not frustrating (except for those damn teapots). Though you only have a few weapons, the enemies vary greatly and particularly in nightmare mode you have to approach them in very different ways and experiment to find the right technique to kill each enemy most effectively. The areas differ vastly as well, offering a refreshing change just when the game begins to feel monotonous. TL:DR BUY THIS GAME ITS COMPLETELY AMAZING			"

 Positive + Gorgeous art style/environments+ Creepy and eerie soundtrack+ Interesting story laced with dark elements+ Good mixture of platforming and combat sections, as well as many other gameplay elements+ Lengthy campaign (approximately 10 hours on Normal difficulty, almost twice as long as the first game). Negative - Various content reused throughout the game (sliding puzzles/sections, rhythm-based minigames etc.) leads to tedium- Poor camera during combat/awkward lock-on system- Minor performance issues for the PC version (occasional stuttering, frame rate cap (though the latter can be fixed via config file))- Some low resolution textures and texture pop-in (courtesy of Unreal Engine)- Lack of an extensive and memorable weapons arsenal, unlike the first game. Verdict “While the gameplay may get somewhat repetitive over the course of the long and mostly linear campaign; the visuals, sound and compelling story make the visit into Alice’s psyche one worth experiencing (again).” 8/10 TJBs  "

												Alice: Madness returns looks beautifull. And so it is the art that drives one trough the game. To a extent.Because Alice: Madness returns also has masssive problems (that, coincidentally are the same as in the older game).The first is that every level JUST DRAAAAGS OOOON! More or less every level is faaar to long, outstaying it's wellcome beyound the wonder of the new designs and graphics and beauty that the game posses.The same jumping puzzles, the same enemy hordes that won't and won't end making fighting to a grind, the same way the leveldesign is structured (besides the optical elements). It all just feels made to keep you from progressing more then anything else.It just doesn't end. The pacing is totally off and after a while you just want to finally move on to the next level so you can see the next beautyfull designs.The second problem is the godawfull camera. No matter if it's the platforming or (even worse) the Zelda esque battlesystem, the camera is far to drawn in and so utterly infuriatingly inflexible in the battles. It's so limiting that you often die BECAUSE of it instead of the diffculty of the enemys.Conclusion: Alice Madness Reborn is a beautifull game with really fantastic designs and enemys and an equally great atmosphere.But i just can't go on trough levels that keep going on and on and on for no reason, stacking the same exercises up one after another and another and another, level for level for level.Take a look but don't expect to finish it.

												IMPORTANT NOTE:To get to play the game, you need to activate it. The very first time you start up the game a product key appears - copy it to your clipboard ... and then go to EA.COM (the homepage of the EA company) online.The game will NOT activate if you just use the activation code in the small windows that pop up on your screen, one after the other, when you start up the game!REVIEW:Good stuff:- STUNNING graphics, gorgeous and imaginative.- Great atmosphere, mysterious and slightly unnerving.- Good musicBad stuff- The game is basically a platform-jumper (urgh!) with a lot of fighting and some puzzles.- I play on a PC, and controlling Alice is dificult and confusing.- No save option. The game choses when to save your progress.Verdict:While the game is a champion when it comes to imaginative, gorgeous graphics, I found it to be very, very frustrating to play. Alice is so dificult to control that I failed a lot of jumps and battle was not a fun experience. This is especially annoying when you can't save your progress after finally succeeding with something dificult!The game does a lot of things right, but the few things it does wrong, it does wrong to SUCH a degree, that I did not enjoy playing the game. A real bummer!Bonus info:It seems that the creators of the ""Batman: Arkham"" games have been very heavily influenced by this game! Alice's ""shrinking vision"" is the same as Batman's ""detective vision"" - and moving around, doing puzzles and fighting as Alice made me feel like I was playing Batman in ""Arkham Asylum"".			"

												Well, I was a fan of American McGee's orginal ""Alice"" game and as much as I really, really want to give this a ""thumbs up"", I can't.  I mean, there is a lot to like here.PROS:- They've created a Wonderland that's beautiful, twisted, creepy, dark, and wonderful.- The story (or at least the part I made it through) seemed very interesting.- Platforming elements are challenging enough to be fun, but not to the point of being frustrating.  Alice's ""twist"" and ""float"" are neat.- Hidden stuff to find.  Yay.- Alice's ""shrink"" adds some fun elements to the game.- Great soundtrack.MEH:- Combat is a bit clunky, but it's do-able.CONS:- If I remember correctly, this game didn't used to have an EA registration.  In any event, EA has now added a thoroughly annoying and pointless required registration (of course, right?)- But here's the real deal-breaker, folks: The game is FREAKIN' BROKEN!  Once you get the umbrella, you realize that it's required to defeat the enemy that immediately follows.  And the umbrella is busted; I can't equip or use it.  And, of course, using the umbrella seems to be the only way to defeat that enemy.  And without defeating that enemy, there is no way to move on in the game.  Nice.Apparently, there is some fix available that requires the player to re-write part of the config.  Seriously...what a pain in the @$$.  Anyway, this whole mess essentially ruined the game for me.  And it seems I'm not the only player to encouter this glitch.  Buyer beware!Needless to say, I'm über-bummed with the mess this game turned out to be.  I was really looking forward to enjoying this one.  :(			"

												Beautiful, smooth, fast-paced, charming, this game has it all. If there was an over-world it would rival Ocarina of Time, the combat system is very similar and in many ways an improvement, the art style is both macabre and manic, like you would expect a sequance of dreams to be, Alice contols satisfyingly and her varied abilities make her seem strangely both helpless and empowered. My only quip is that the game feels the need to remind you every 5 minutes how to play it... but atleast theres no Omochao with an obnoxious voice or any of that.			"

												Technically and as a game, I suppose it's ""better"" than the original but it lacks the spark. The original Alice felt like it was pushing the envelope creatively and artistically. This looks like any competent team could have put this game together. Despite the visual upgrade it doesn't feel as immersive as the original Alice. Also, it doesn't feel like a proper PC game, more like a console port. And I got bored with it. If you're a fan of the original Alice like I am, this might disappoint you.Pros: It's pretty. Though that's kind of expect now days. Mechanically, I suppose it's more of a game.Cons: Bland and repetitive. Not pushing the boundries the way the original did. May not appeal to fans of the first game. Feels like a console port.			"

												This is a very unique game. Very different then a lot of the other games out there. Beautiful grahpics, wonderful story with a twisted minded perspective. Very creative with the character designs. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a different view to the original story of Alice in wonderland. I very much enjoy this game to the deepest part of my heart.			"

												Alice Returns is  a really good game from what I have played so far! Granted there is bugs... But you really can't notice them.... I never played any of the other ones (  even if there is another one  lol )  I've been hesitant in buying this game for some time... because of the mixed reviews :( But i really  really love Alice in Wonderland an decided  why not :D The thing is tho people  saying "" Ohhh you can't really play  this game with out a controller ' <--- That's  wrong. .. I have no problem playing. It does take some getting used to but for me? Was easy granted i am a gamer girl and prolly used to that style of play but believe me  you'll get used to it as well...  It's all   "" Trial and Error "" But over all it's a beautiful game  with so much detail I really can't wait to play more!! GETTTTTTT IT!! ♥ You won't be Disappointed ♥ 10/10			"

												I bought this game because I loved the American McGee's, Alice, that came out in 2000, so of course it was only natural that I purchase Alice: Madness Returns. It is the similar fantastic psychological horror. action-adventure, third person video game as the first one, however, you do not need to play the first one in order to enjoy this game as it isnt a direct sequal. It's extremely imaginative, unique and fun! You will enjoy a slew of great costume changes and a selection of crazy weapons you obtain as you advance throughout the game. Although I'd reccomend this game to anyone, I feel the story lacks the complexity I'd hope for from a psychological horror. Also, the ideas and theme of the game is extremely close to the 2000 version, and I was kind of looking for a new spin on things. 8/10.			"

												The game is very good, but the mouse acceleration is ATROCIOUS, it's hardcoded into the game and there's no way to disable it. You can always use a xbox controller, but it still can't rival a raw-input mouse and the camera movement is slow as ♥♥♥♥ with it.Apart from that the game is glorious, specially if you like lovecraft and really weird ♥♥♥♥.

A twisted journey through the mind of a disturbed AliceBeautiful platformer with decent mechanics and relaxing gameplay.-----✓ Great visuals and PhysX integration✓ Levels are decently long✓ Gorgeous outfits in every level✓ Varied gameplay, it's more than just a plain platformer✓ Delightful voice acting/cutscenes✓ Upgradeable weapons✓ A wide variety of difficulty modes✗ NO ACHIEVEMENTS!✗ REQUIRES EA/ORIGIN ACCOUNT FOR ACTIVATION!✗ Plenty of potato textures, poor graphic settings✗ Full of invisible walls✗ Even if you're using a controller, the game will keep showing mouse+keyboard commands✗ Although fun to find, collectibles feel kinda pointless✗ Capped at 30fps (see how to uncap below)✗ Nightmare difficulty is a disappointment (see detailed explanation below)-----Personal thoughtsIf you're looking for a relaxing platformer game with third-person-shooter and hack-and-slash elements, don't think twice and get it. However, keep in mind that it has no achievements, which (in my opinion) takes away the sense of self-improvement for completionists. So you found all the memories/bottles, upgraded all the weapons and finished the game in nightmare difficulty? That's cute and all but it won't be engraved in your profile. Ever.Looking for a challenge? Think twice, because Alice: Madness Returns might not be for you. Why? Because Nightmare difficulty is a disappointment (and boy am I gonna get thumbed down for saying this). It won't spawn more enemies, it won't give them more HP, puzzles won't be harder... and it won't take away the constant hand-holding factor in the game (clues everywhere and the Cheshire cat appearing out of nowhere, telling you exactly what to do). Originally posted by you:		Well, what the hell does Nightmare difficulty change then?
	The damage you take from enemies.That's it.That's all it does.And given that there are no achievements, you're better off enjoying yourself, playing in whichever difficulty suits you best and finishing the game in a 100% solitary experience. However, if you can see past these major flaws, the game is quite an enjoyable experience that I'd recommend to anyone.Noteworthy In order to get rid of the peasantry in this game, go to ""Documents\My Games\Alice Madness Returns\AliceGame\Config"", open AliceEngine.ini, find ""MaxSmoothedFrameRate=31"" and change the 31 to your monitor's refresh rate (60, 120, 144, etc.) Best played with a controller "

Promising game fails to deliver to the fullNote: after replaying parts of it, I've rewritten some parts, being more ""mild"" ;-)This is - once more - one of those occasions I wished the Steam-review system had a third, more neutral, option. I've been tossed between thumbs up and down all the the time - some it really should be ""neutral"". Alice: Madness Returns is by no means a bad game. It's a sequel to the earlier American McGee's Alice, a game I loved at first sight when I played it. Compared to the original, this second installment in the series is darker, grimmer, more mature, focusing more on the evil going on in Wonderland and on the catastrophy that happened early in Alice's childhood.The first couple of hours into the game are stunning, and I felt like being on for a rare gaming treat. The way in which 19th-century London where Alice lives in an orphanage is depicted, is visual genius. Every detail counts and adds to an unforgettable atmosphere. I felt like walking round in one of my beloved novels by Charles Dickens. These ""London"" scenes do re-appear in the course of the game, but all too far and few between, and much shorter than the opening scene. Controls and actual gameplay felt very intuitive, and made me reach for my gamepad. This is after all a genuine third person Action Adventure (or Platformer quite often), and I prefer my Xbox 360 gamepad for this genre.After marvelling at the way London was depicted, I all of a sudden fell into Wonderland, and the visual contrast with the grim and grey London atmosphere was huge. Wonderland feels at first like, well, a real wonder: brimming with colours, flowers, trees and unusual animals, most of them well-known to anyone who has read the book. The game does well in gradually introducing new weapons and abilities to Alice, and during the next couple of hours into Wonderland, fighting off my first enemies and meeting my friends of old, I still felt very much at ease with this game. But, when the first chapter in Wonderland (the Mad Hatters Domain) continued on and on and on, with jumping puzzles following each other in a very similar fashion, and ever more difficult fights with over-powererd enemies following suit, a feeling of unease raised its head. Surely the next chapters would be better, with more variety, better difficulty balance, more original puzzles? Alas, they were far from it. The second and third chapter felt like under-developed, since the visual quality dropped all of a sudden - it felt like etiher an altogether different team developed these graphics (and ininspiring level-design), or out of lack of time the middle levels of the game got less attention than the outer ones.Anyway, I really, really had to convince myself to keep going, stumbling through chapters 2 and 3, only to finally reach the much better two final chapters. Graphics and level-design are much better there, but in a weird way the difficulty issue came back, only reversed. After having upgraded most of my weaponry to full power, I smashed through the different enemies all too easily now. It's a real pity the developers could not get the difficulty curve for the entire game right.The sheer outburst of creative imagination however the developers let flow in the last quarter or so of the game, is stunning: it made me even feel worried, at unease, looking behind my shoulder now and then. I got a few stomps in my stomach as well, especially when the subject of the Asylum where Alice spent most of her ill-fated yout, is touched upon again.In the end, Alice: Madness Returned felt like a partly missed opportunity of ideas that could have written game-history. If only the level of imagination and wonder of the first hours could have been maintained throughout the entire game, it would have been a classic. It should have been much shorter too: at half the length, the less inspired levels wouldn't have made that devastating an impression. Now it feels like over-extending a not very substantial story.Gameplay: 18/30 (most of the fighting is ok, albeit too repetitive, some of the jumping action is quirky)Graphics: 13/20 (the first and last quarter would have gotten 18 out of 20...)Sound: 9/10 (the soundtrack is wonderful)Technical & stability: 6/10 (even after setting the nVidia-based physics to low on my AMD-system, I got too many stuttering)Replayability: 6/10 (single-player only, but it's a very long game clocking at appx 20 hours, and that's without looking for all the collectibles)Steam integration: 3/10 (nothing extra here, which is a pity)Personal appreciation: 7/10 (out of love for the scenes in London)Overall: 62/100Buy and play at your own risk, having enough time and perseverance to continue through the awful middle section.

												Alice: Madness Returns... My favourite game since its prequel, American Mcgee's Alice, Which by the way, isn't on Steam OR Origin. I tried finding it...It's one hell of a beautiful game, I must say. The visuals are meant to be taken as metaphors most of the time, so to those who don't like things like that... This game won't be your cup of Tea. It will be a really weird game to you.The game DOES have peculiarities and it's just how it's meant to be. I like the story. Alice is one hell of a role model. Except the brutality in Wonderland part. She's a character that I could describe as one of the most humane characters in the whole gaming industry. She's smart, but not strong or too fragile, she's not some kind of an all-knowing person. She has her fears, doubts, strengths, weaknesses. She's a beliavable character.I know the game has its plot holes, but so does nearly every game EVER.Now, gameplay-wise, I would advise anyone who has a PC-compatible controller to try and play it. It feels way smoother that way. I'm not saying the PC controls don't work or anything(Which has happened to me sometimes), but the game is smoother when played with a controller.There are some sections of this game that should have ended sooner. They felt dragged out and I know they would be. That's what you get when you work with EA in the first place. There is no way to get rid of tutorials even after you have completed the game, so it will remind you again and again about some stuff.Overall, the game has its flaws, but it still stands up strong. DEFINITELY recommended.EDIT: Forgot to mention that the music is very appropriate in most cases, but it's just not as memorable as the one from American Mcgee's Alice.			"

												Alice In Wonderland by way of Tim Burton and Sam Raimi. You play Alice as her memories return and she has to come to term with what really happened to her family in a house fire and the reasons behind it.Within the grimy Victorian seediness lies a fantastic platformer, and one of my all-time favourites, together with the orginal American McGee's Alice. The platforming is regularly interspersed with some surprisingly frenetic combat.You have five weapons at your disposal: the Vorpal blade which is your standard weapon, the Pepper Grinder (read machine gun), the Teapot (read grenade launcher), and the Hobby Horse which is really a substitute for a Sledgehammer. Also the player can also drop clockwork bombs that either uses a timer, or can be manually detonated. Though the fighting can get frantic at times, it is only ever really difficult if you don't employ some kind of tactics. The bomb, for instance, is essential for distracting enemies and overturning crabs to reveal their weak underbelly.The graphics of this game are gorgeous, but they have an 'ugly beauty' about them, inspired by the East European puppet animations of Jan Svankmeyer and the Brothers Quay. The music of A: MR also has a disturbing charm, as it moves between whimsical piano and grungey industrial ambience.I can really recommend Alice: Madness Returns to any platformer-lover, but with reservations about the adult themes that run through the game. Also, if activated (my Steam version was deactivated by default), the language can be quite mature at times, with the C-word used once or twice.My only gripe with this game, and it's not the only game to be guilty of this, is doors shutting behind the player, thus closing off parts of a level without warning and without the player having fully explored an area. This often means completionists need to replay levels to get pickups they missed. Surely some warning that going through a doorway, or moving into an area, will end the level isn't too much to ask?Apart from that, Alice: Madness Returns is a great old-school platformer with some of the most creatively inspiring environments I've ever seen in a game. Weapons are varied; Fighting frantic but fun; Lots of collectibles; Soundtrack is awesome.Always been a big fan of this game: 9/10.			"

												So this game? This games was ♥♥♥♥ing amazing! The game is about Alice, a girl who watched her parents burn in a building and was lead to believe it was all her fault. She remember the one time she every went to Wonderland, it was horrid. She never wanted to go back until one day an old mysterious lady leads her back into the wonderous land. She is stuck inbetween reality and fiction. She must fight her darkest nightmares to escape this dream. You play as Alice, with many different upgradable weapons. Each world you get a new dress, and are put against new enemies, the game is very diverse and has a non-linear game style. The art is done beautifully, the dark twist to the classic makes for a great story.Pros ~ Art was done greatlyFighting was always fun and simpleAlice with a dark twist? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!!!Story was awesomeThe cat :3Cons ~ Some parts of the game got confusingGame had a few bugsThe game switches between Wonderland and the real world very weirdlySo all in all, I give it a 8.6/10, Game was great, never once wanted to stop, made me feel great and spooked :O "

												Alice Madness Returns is the successor to American McGee's Alice.The Story is about Alice Liddell. She suffers from a trauma which effects hear reality.She often goes into the Wonderland. She suffers from this because of a fire in her family house when she was young.She lost her whole family to this fire and therefore suffers from the trauma. But something is different. Her Wonderland suffers from destruction and madness. In the game she figures out what really happened in the night of the fire.Pinpoiting the game to 1 Genre is nearly impossible because it has so many different ones.Jump & Run, Hack & Slay, Puzzle, 2D, 3D, Action, Fantasy, Horror.I rarely seen a game with so many different influences. I really enjoyed it. The game got never tedious because of this great variety in gameplay. But the main aspect of the game is the Jump & Run and Hack & Slay gameplay. She has to pass several levels. To do so she has to jump and run, fight against monsters or solve riddles and puzzles. Or sometimes just explore the world. I really like the fighting system. Its really addicting for me because it has a learning curve. The game might be difficult to new players. I in fact died very very often when playing this game the first time. What helped me was a controller though. I dont think mouse and keyboard work well in this game. You have several weapons to attack the monsters like a blade or a pepper mill machine gun. You also have to dodge the attacks of the enemies either with an umbrella or just vanishing and appearing somewhere again. This game definitely needs skill! There are also many secrets and collectibles in the levels which are fun to explore and collect.The whole game runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and it looks really beautiful!I rarely seen such amazing designed worlds. Especially the PhysX effects give the game an own touch.However, those can be quite taxing. Not even my GTX 970 could maintain 60FPS on High PhysX settings.I only had like 5% of the game slowdowns or whatever so mostly it went totally fine. Sadly the game suffers from some annoying stutter from time to time. Like all 5 minutes it hangs for a sec and then continues playing. This is not that bad and I got used to it. I dont know what exactly is causing it. Maybe the texture steaming system of the UE3 or PhysX or even EAs badly and horrible implemented copy protection.Postive:- Very nice and diverse gameplay- Interesting Story- Never gets tedious or boring- Addicting fighting system with learning curve- Beautiful designed worlds and artwork in general- Stunning PhysX effects- Nice and fitting soundtrack- Nearly totally bugfree, even without any patches, since none have been released- Limited Edition content can be activated with an easy ini edit- Steam version automatically unlocks the game on EAs Origin aswellNegative:- Some small performance and stutter problems- Annoying EA copy protection which needs an EA account- The Steam version misses additional content like the American McGee's Alice HD version.Check out my guide to obtain the HD versionRating: 8.5/10I really enjoyed this game. In fact this game was one of the best of 2011. It was totally underrated by gaming magazines for whatever reason. The art design was just so beautiful and sick at the same time. This game is not meant for young people! I mean it seriously.Also make sure to check out the first Alice. It might be a bit dated but its just as beautiful. Wouldnt mind a remake of this one!			"

												Someone once said this game forced them to play it until endgame, I still don't understand that because it was hella easy to beat. I think he was just being a big baby. Combat is relatively simple, alright story, gorgeous atmosphere, and while you can see throw the seams of the worldspace it still looks alright. Replay value is eh, the collectibles don't do much except unlock concept art and backstory which I enjoyed anyway. Bizarrely, whenever you go into menus the framerate just eats ♥♥♥♥ and skips, I still don't understand why that happens.I would wait until it goes on sale to get it; this game has EA's seal of approval on it so there are a handful of bugs and glitches which will sometimes hinder progression, but it's no biggie really.Fun short experience honestly.Strong 7 to a light 8 out of 10			"

In fact this game was one of the best of 2011. It was totally underrated by gaming magazines for whatever reason. The art design was just so beautiful and sick at the same time. This game is not meant for young people! I mean it seriously.Also make sure to check out the first Alice. It might be a bit dated but its just as beautiful. Wouldnt mind a remake of this one!			"

												TL;DR: Pretty, if extremely boring game. The pacing is horrendous.Alice Maddness returns is a sequel to 2000's American McGee's Alice, which itself was a sequel to the 2 books, Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass.Too bad the game is boring as salt. There are ... 5 or 6 levels. Each levels last 3 hours. You simply get bored of simple platforming, followed by shallow combat, followed by platforming, followed by combat.The upgrading system is a joke. The levels are not even sufficiently twisted enough to keep your interest engaged.  The story  is barely there. The performance? Fine, if you are not using Physx. The effect is pretty I guess.END: Boring game, with huge pacing problems, uninterested combat and platforming sections. American McGee's Alice was a much better AND twisted game. This? Play this if you have time to waste I guess.			"

												I am a huge fan of the original ALICE and highly suggest you go back and play that game instead of this newer game. It still holds up in my opinion. This new game has some of the same vibe, but I found the checkpoints frustrating and the platforming can be wonky. It seems more of a punishing arcade than bat-♥♥♥♥ crazy textures and animation like the original.			"

												8.6/10A very flawed but a gem of a game, which really should have cut some content here and there to give more time to polish.Wonderland is falling apart, Alice forgot what happened to her family. Why is Alice going mad, what happened to her family and what happens in the real world when Alice is in Wonderland, find it out while playing this deep and crazy and mad game!+ Great deep storyline when you make it past the halfway point+ Great graphics most of the time+ Great platforming gameplay+ NVIDIA physx looks beautiful!- Framedrops and stutters every now and then!!!- Story starts slowly- Boring and flawed start of the game- Not always great graphics- Terrible voiceover sometimes- Requires some fiddling with .ini files to get 60 or higher fps- Had to noclip one level due to a bug (which also required fiddling with .ini files to enable it)The game starts ok, graphics ok and the story is very vage. But halfway, after 6 to 8 hours the game really starts to shine, the bad voiceovers dissapear, graphics become more beatifull every level, story starts to become really interesting etc. The story even becomes pretty gross and suddenly all the madness slowly gets explained by mixing real world and immaginary wonderland world experiences. The game really is great, but sadly it takes a while for it to show it. And no the last few chapters aren't perfect either, but the story really excells here and you discover more and more the further you play.I recommend playing this game if you like platformers and games with a pretty hefty storyline, since it definately is not a children game. And if you find yourself being bored, expecially the first (and longest) chapter please try to make it through. Its a great game when you allow yourself to look deep enough since the lack of polish here and there really tries to kick you out.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns to put it bluntly a fun game. Although I found myself from hour 6 till completion (around 10-11 hours) dreading the combat as it gave nothing inherently new, the art style in the game will keep the player hooked. I personally have never played the first game, but I still found Alice's tale engaging and one that made slogging through the repetitive combat (sometimes rage inducing) not that hard of a task.

												I'm not sure how far I am in the game. But I'm happy it's long enough to make me feel I lost track of time. I am happy because this game is wicked and strange and somebody took a good stuff before making it... XD I do not like controls, the way this game feels like a game for console :/. Sometimes when You change point of view You might not realize that keys changing their function. Game is really athmospheric, and keeps me entertained. I do think that its hard enough and You need a trick for most of the enemies. I wish there could be more places to visit and I wish this game had more enemies. BUT I might not see all of it yet. I will update this review once I finish the game.UPDATE  21-01-2016 after ... longer period.This game makes me feel exosted. I've played nearly 15 hours or so? (No AFKING) and I made 65% of the game.And I know already I did miss few places and the cons is You cant go back to them, so whenever You go somewhere and to ""check"" if thats a right way, and then You want to come back, You most probably will have to kiss the wall XD.I personally think till now, that one act that is at 50% is the longest one, and the hardest one.I don't want to spoil anyone anything, so I won't tell what it is... but it's RED.And I need to say the futher You play the more You think what developers were smoking/taking while making this game because I never even thought about anything as sick and as mad as this game is.

												Alice: Madness Returns took me down the rabbit hole like no other could. I love this version of Alice in Wonderland. It might have caused me to question my own sanity but I wouldn't have it any other way.Practical info:At first I couldn't play the game as I was supposed to play it because I couldn't use the umbrella. It has been confirmed by a lot of people that the game doesn't always want to be played. I tried playing further by using the trick with the rabbitbomb but it was tiresome. I needed a real solution. Buying an xbox-controller for the pc was that solution (in my case).Experience:+ Art: simply beautiful! I played it on a big tv and it was as if my tv turned into a painting!+ Story: Halucinating instead of dreaming. Purrrfect!+ Gameplay: the concept is rather simple. Platforming and battling. The battle style is a bit comparable to the legend of Zelda. (Don't expect a legend of Zelda wannabee though! The games are not similar, I was simply talking about the battling system.) For me it sometimes felt a bit repetitive.+ Puzzles: too simple! It could have taken this a step further but it didn't. It was a bit disappointing.Overall score:I don't like to put a number on a game but I'll tell you why I liked the game. I liked playing it because it was equally beautiful as it was a t(h)reat to my (in)sanity. But if I need to be honest with myself it feels like the art and the story need to compensate for the gameplay and the puzzles. Even though it was enjoyable, it sometimes felt a bit repetitive and the puzzles were a bit simple. In the end I'm glad I bought the game.(If you really want a number, take 7/10)			"

												Alice Madness Returns caught my attention due to its graphical style. After playing through about half of the game, collecting as many secrets and collectibles as I can find, I have an opinion on the game as a whole.As I said, I love the visuals, the models still look great and the scenery is timeless. Not every part of the game is equally gorgeous though. After completing a part of the game, the game puts you in an underwater environment. The visual appeal of this part is underwhelming when compared to the part you just completed. Another thing that bothered me about that part is that the physics didn't change at all while underwater. But even if this all felt unnatural and a bit underwhelming, parts of the level still got me interested. The next level I was dropped into was equally awesome as the first.The story and the unique and interesting characters really add a lot to the experience. Every character in the game is memorable in some way. Even the enemies have a memorable look. They're not that hard to kill most of the time, but can provide quite the challenge when attacking in groups and do require you to be fast with the controls. The biggest challenges lie in the side missions though, so you don't have to face enormous hordes of monsters when playing through the main game.After all this positivity, we need to talk a bit about the negatives, as there are quite a few.Some parts of the game feel a bit rushed. Enemies placed in awkward spots that render parts of their behavior useless (example: an enemy that can only be defeated by returning it's ranged attacks is placed in a spot where he's not capable of firing shots). This can get really frustrating. The fact that if you die from damage, you have to redo a part of the game doesn't help either. The game also suffers heavily from random crashes through all of the game. One moment it works smooth, the other it closes down without any clear reason. The controls are sometimes fiddly as well, but this does not pose a major issue.To make it run smoothly, you need to apply some tweaks, such as unlocking the framerate and fixing a bug with the umbrella.After all, Alice Madness Returns brings a compelling adventure that still holds up to today's standards in it's genre. It's well worth it's somewhat high price. The collectibles really add to the game as well. They're fun to collect and provide a nice bit of extra story. I would recommend this game to people who like games like Rayman, 3D Mario games and old platformers alike.			"

												Alice: Madness Returns is a rather unique beast of a game. I never found the jumping and fighting incredibly fun (Although it can be a little fun sometimes), the keyboard and mouse controls stink, the game has some optimization issues, sometimes the jumping is wonky as well as the game having frequent loading times. On top of that, the game runs at 30 fps unless you hop into the config files and change some stuff, which is a bit bothersome.Despite these issues, it's still one of my favorite games I've played in a long time. The story, the view on Alice's mental state, and the presentation of this game make it all worth the trouble. Wonderland is a broken mess, and so is Alice in a lot of ways. Wonderland is falling apart and a destructive force is barrelling through the land, tearing everything apart and threatening to destroy Alice mentally. Meanwhile in Victorian London, Alice struggles with finding answers to her family's death in a fatal fire. Frequently, Alice slips between London and Wonderland, switching between trying to find answers from people she knows, and looking within her memories, respectively.Weaved through all of these events is an odd mix of disturbing and beautiful environments that you'll be jumping through and fighting all sorts of nasty beasties in in your search for the truth. As the game goes on the environments become more gruesome, further signifying the slippery slope into madness.Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys an interesting story and more interesting art. The platforming is alright, the combat is sometimes pretty fun, and the aesthetic is incredible. Just remember to look up how to unlock the framerate and use a controller.			"

												There's a part where you have to go through a tunnel opening that is - unmistakably - in a doll's butt. 10/10 would enter butt again.			"
