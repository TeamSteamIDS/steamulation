												This stand-alone expansion adds a fun survival mode, an improved RPG skill tree, more varied weapons, and better special effects & physics. Like the first game, it's a lot more fun to play in local co-op (online co-op NOT being supported).There's a level editor included, but it seems like nobody ever released any maps. Likewise, nobody seems to have released any mods, despite the game being open source.			"

												Can definitely recommend! usually goes on sale for 90% off - really good game - 3 characters, well voice acted, upgradeable ""survivor"" and weapons. I played it on the second to the hardest difficulty, will definitely replay on impossible difficulty and try different weapons and upgrades. Guns sound great, one of the best things about the game is how powerful the weapons feel - but the aliens are still a scary threat despite the punch your weapons have. Awesome map design with 20 secrets to find in the highly detailed environments, i found 5/20 first playthrough - secrets unlock interesting new options for gameplay such as ""super physics"" or ""black and white mode"" Final battle seems a bit weak compared to some of the previous challenges already overcome - but still an awesome sequence of gameplay nearing the finale! This is 1 of my best buys of the holiday sale. i havent played the original, but after finishing this it makes me wish i bought the shadowgrounds pack and trusted the title more. 7.7/10			"

Shadowgrounds: Survivor was first released 7 years ago as a sequel to the original Shadowgrounds. It's a pretty well-made game, all about shooting hordes and hordes of pesky zombies from a top-down perspective. The story isn't remarkable in any way: three survivors of a massive alien attack try to ""get out"" in any way possible.Developer Frozenbyte has however improved upon the original in several ways. First of all, the three characters manage to come across as individuals, not as thirteen-in-a-dozen heroes, mostly thanks to the excellent voice-acting (although it's sometimes over-the-top, but better this than bland voices). Secondly, the weapons-arsenal is pretty neat, with a very distinctive ""feel"" about every weapon and individual weapons for all three character. Added to this is a well thought-out weapons- and character upgrade-system, which adds a light rpg-flavour to the game. Don't expect any keep of delving deep into weapons' customization or character builing, but still, it's pretty well done and really adds some much-needed depth to the gameplay.The original Shadowgrounds already had some solid graphics and these are markedly improved upon in Survivor. Especially light&shadows, explosions, fire effects (awesome flamethrower!!) and physics-effects are really impressive. Just as in the original, level-design is more than decent, with several items to search for and a logical built-up of each level. I found the game to be a tad short: after just under 5 hours I was through the singleplayer-campaign, not even having unlocked all of the character and weapons-upgrades. This can be done in the six unlockable missions where you have to keep alive for as long as possible, but since the leaderbords are dead now, that's fairly useless. Actually I wanted to play along for a bit longer, which is always a good sign. Alas, there have been seven years past since its release, so it seems like this little ""franchise"" will stay at two items forever.All in all, this is totally recommendable game for anyone who fancies shooting dozens of zombies in a no-brains way. I feel it's a bit expensive (7 euro at the moment) for a small-scale seven years' old game, but it gets discounts quite often, especially in a pack together with the original Shadowgrounds. Steam trading cards are a welcome addition too, Steam achievements are not here.Overall score: 7.5/10			"

												Shadowgrounds Survivor is the unmistakable sequel to previous years top down horde mode shooter Shadowgrounds. Unmistakable because if you didn't see the title you'd be hard pressed to tell them apart.That's not to say Survivor doesn't introduce a few new features, multiple playable characters and a more detailed level progression makes the game a good deal more engaging as you go along. The storyline is as was in the original utterly forgettable and can be easily ignored.The greatest strength of Shadowgrounds Survivor is once again it's use of atmospheric lightning which does a good job at turning otherwise bland encounters with the alien horde into something a little more suspenseful, lending somewhat from the horror genre.The problem is also, once again, that this is a genre that has done it all before, the top down shooter horde mode gives you nothing new, nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before. You go from room to room in a linear progression stopping only to pick up the occasional ammo pack in between scripted attacks by the same massive blob of aliens you've already killed in the last ten rooms. Even the boss battles mostly boils down to the same run and gun tactics as the rest of the game making playing the game feel like a grind the more you progress.All in all as with the original the problem is that Shadowgrounds does nothing to innovate. It adds nothing that you didn't see in the last five games you played int this genre and that makes it a tiresome experience for anyone but the most hardcore fans.			"

												Largely disappointing. The first game had a somewhat entertaining plot development, a larger variety of weapons and a fair bit ofpromise. There were more enemies and boss battles. The sequal looks more graphically robust, but at the same time just a poor attempt to grab some more money by releasing a dumbed down game with the same assets.Edit: A lot of people are experiencing 100% crashes with this game. This is due to PhysX. Look up the lagacy PhysX from nVidia and you'll be fine.			"

												Still playing through my first purchases from my backlog:After a bad first impression, having the game crash on me, I got the needed driver installed in 1 minute flat, and got to work playing. The game then continued to give me sh|t by freezing up my computer when I alt-tabbed to write some notes for my review. I almost quit then and there, but seeing the previous title was pretty good, I stayed on. And I'm happy I did.Sans the minor technical difficulties, the game has some improvements over its predecessor. Grenades are a welcoming feature, implemented with an easy to use meter for measureing distance and timing. You now control 3 different characters with their own chapters in the story, which is a welcome addition. This time you can upgrade your characters as well as weapons, and the varied skills are easy and fun to use. Finished without a hitch on Hard, so players might want to go one step above that.Recommended in spite of the jank. This one should be remastered like the one before it. There is a masterpiece waiting to be born here, but we're not there yet. Fix your sh|t, Frozenbyte, and the remaster of this could be a very decent classic.			"

												Top-down shooter in which you murder lots and lots of aliens, collect upgrade parts to upgrade your weapons, and unlike in the first game, get EXP, level up, and spend points on several passive abilities, as well as one active ability.The roll has been replaced with a much needed fast dash, the battery on your flashlight never runs out now, and you can now carry up to 5 medkits when you run over them with full health.Also including: Wacky physics, cartoonishly gibbing critical hits, modified weapons, and one newish weapon.It's episodic, you switch between 3 characters throughout the campaign as you progress through it. They all have 3 different playstyles, weapons, and abilities;Play as:The Marine, with the Pistol, Pulse Rifle, Rocket Launcher, and Frag Grenades.As Napalm, the drunk Shotgun, Flamethrower, Minigun, and Poison Grenade wielding dude.Or as Sniper, equipped with a Pistol, Rail Gun, Plasma Rifle, and EMP Grenades.Overall, the game was a bit too easy (well, at least easier than the first) as I NEVER used any of my portable medkits. Also, theres way too many crescendo events (get barriered in, kill a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of aliens until they're all dead or something unlocks, etc) sprinkled throughout the game.Also theres only like one boss, and thats near the beginning of the game, any other ""boss"" after that are bloody crescendo events. The first game had at least several bosses :/Not a bad experience, definitely faster paced (for the most part) than the first game, but I actually kind of liked the first game a bit better.Anyway, if you're a fan of top-down shooters, give this a try when its on sale.

												Like its immediate predecessor, Survivor is a top-down shooter that hearkens back to the days of Smash TV and Total Carnage, except that there is a much more detailed plot and a heavy nod to role-playing games. As opposed to the blanket machine-part upgrade system of Shadowgrounds, Survivor has implemented a more refined approach, with unique class abilities, general class abilities and weapon abilities tailored to each of the three characters. Basic gameplay is still kill or be killed, run and gun, etc. Every kill nets you some experience, which is banked toward increased levels, and each level brings with it some upgrade points. Weapon upgrade parts are still found on the battlefield, dropped by enemies, but now you also get class-specific abilities and character tweaks. These are what increase with each level. Using the marine as an example, you'll be able to buy quick weapon reloads, tough skin and fragmentation grenades. This is in addition to the basic set of character improvements that all three avatars have: radar display, increased health, critical hits, and an ""auto-doctor"" that will dose you with a health kit (if you have one stockpiled) if you fall below 50% health at any time.Survivor really beefed up the graphics. Lighting, already a major element of the ambience of Shadowgrounds, has been used to even greater effect this time. I lost count of how many rounds I wasted shooting at flickering movement that I thought was an enemy but was really just shadows playing off of my flashlight beam. Shaders have also been given some love, textures and particle effects. The overall effect is beautiful.Gameplay: 8/10It is easy to control after re-mapping the keys to your liking. Some weapons have secondary fire and there is lots and lots of action. This is the non-thinking man's action title.Graphics: 9/10Surprisingly, the game looks way better then the original; I know that's not uncommon (duh), but for a value title, the spit and polish rivals that of other full-priced games.Sound: 7/10I liked the voiceovers the characters had, and the ambient music does provide the right feel for the game, but some sound effects are lacking.Difficulty: MediumYou can set the difficulty to your liking.Concept: 7/10A well-used idea, wrapped neatly in a simple game that is surprisingly fun and entertaining.Overall: 8/10You must like killing aliens, lots of action and the kind of game where it pays to go looking down deserted dark corridors.

												Enjoyable for what it is; an older arcade shooter with some RPG elements. You switch back and forth between three different characters at points throughout the campaign, each with their own unique special abilities and weapon skills. Aside from that, there is nothing truly remarkable about Shadowgrounds Survivor. The graphics are dated but acceptable, and the soundtrack/sound design is actually fairly good. Overall, it's entertaining enough to finish, but it isn't something I'll ever replay. NOTE: In order to play Shadowgrounds Survivor, you'll need to install Nvidia's PhysX LEGACY driver. I wasn't able to launch the game at all without this driver installed. You can find it on Nvidia's website.			"

												A top down shooter with to many problems to list. You have to go out of your way just to get the game running by downloading old compatability drivers just to get the game to start up. Then be prepared to be underwhelmed.The enemies are so dumb sometimes they will simply stand there without response and get gunned down. The graphics at first look alright, then once you continue strolling through the drab environments you really start to notice just how bad the character and enemies models look with a second glance.Local Co-op is almost impossible to get to work, and even when you do it turns into a mess of mixed up controls and an unresponsive menu. So good luck trying to play with a buddy, even if you can get them to sit through the whole ordeal of you trying to set up the freakin' game.Unless you get this in a package or on sale for like a buck or so skip it. You're not missing out on anything, and there are a TON of better top down shooters then this thing.			"

												Shadowgrounds Survivor (SS) is an above-view shooter which sees an array of characters stranded at various points upon the surface of the moon Ganymede. The not-so-original plot of mass alien invasion is at the core of the game and in turn, provides whichever character you currently control - plenty of enemies to shoot and kill.Along the way, you control the typical grunt, armed with a pistol, pulse rifle and rocket launcher. There's also the female sniper who also has a pistol, railgun and plasma rifle. The last of the controllable characters has a flamethrower, shotgun and minigun at his disposal. None of the stages are particularly hard on standard difficulty and SS itself is not a particularly long game either. I completed it in under 4 hours, with the final 'stage' of the game actually being easier than earlier parts of the game.However, you can play the game in co-op and this makes it much more enjoyable as a result. A worthy purchase, I'd give it 7.5			"

												Spending less than what a sandwich costs on the shadowgrounds + shadowgrounds survivor pack was money well spent (bought it on sale for 1,50€). Survivor is a good ""sequel"" to the first, improving on many features. The new physics, the same (or better?) lighting, shadows and shaders for a game not really demanding, the hordes of aliens, with the occasional variety in them, improved weapons, skill upgrades, experience, fun survival mode, some secrets you can pick up to spice up the old campaign from now and again, a cheesy but okay story, fitting the style for people who like movies like Aliens but are fine with not taking everything so seriously.Not many bugs, I did have the physx problem, but a quick look into the community forums resolved that (had to download a legacy driver, then it worked just fine).It's refreshing to see when a developer takes an old idea, the top-down shooter with the sense of style of gunning down hordes of aliens, and mixes it up a bit with working ideas, adding what you can do in a fight; from throwing a grenade with the now-added grenade button, to doing a special attack, to fleeing, flashlight alters at least the spiders behaviour, to simple shooting, also having an alternative attack at your disposal, which varies with the weapon and also needing to be upgraded. The design of the levels and aliens are obviously inspired by many iconic films and characters, but still made in their own unique way which is appealing for a light game of this nature.There are drawbacks, some cinematic animations can be mediocre (animations in general are simple in nature), as with the voice-acting, but I can let that slide, seeing as the atmosphere and gameplay still holds up as giving much more than what I paid for.

												After making a negative review but resolving the issue by installing NVIDIA's PhysX Legacy drivers (per the Community Hub for Shadowgrounds: Survivor), the game actually launches flawlessly with all of the eye-candy turned on.  Time to enjoy the buck-forty-nine!Perhaps the game ought to INCLUDE the installation of NVIDIA's PhysX Legacy drivers to avoid future negative reviews.Post Review Comment (about an hour of gameplay): this game rocks... well worth the buck-forty-nine; though, I would've purchased it for more (if I didn't have to go through the task of troubleshooting it right-after installation). Many gamers, like myself, expect to be able to play the game upon installation without hiccups.  Having to dig through helpful (and non-helpful) suggestions at the Community Hub is expected, but not for something critical that would prevent the game from running properly (or at all) right from the start. Still, a very nice game and a great deal at under 2-bucks.			"

The graphics are OK nothing wonderful but plenty good enough for this romp through the alien swarming survivor take on things eternal.Story is just enough, no deep philosophy here but enough to keep me page turning.  Each level is a different survivors story with each storyline heading together towards the end.  Also had no problems on my win7 machine running it unlike others.

												What a boring game.You are given the powerful pulse rifle early in the game. The first game made you use the pistol and because ammo could become scarce, you were forced to use it. Survivor even gives you a sqad worth of grenades in the first 10 minutes and explosive barrels every 5 seconds. This and the extremely linear and overal bad level design makes the game a waste of time. It does look pretty, even for an older game, but that's all I liked. I expected some technical problems with an older game, but this game gave me a bit too much. First, there are no settings other than gamma. I can't turn on vsync nor change my resolution. It runs at over 120 frames per second, but every 10 seconds it drops 5 and then again back to 120. It's like a slingshot. This and it crashed the first 2 times I tried to run it. Not good.			"

												On Ganymede, we kill spiders like we do in Soviet Russia...with FLAMETHROWER! HAHAHAHAHA...anyways, on a more serious note, Aliens, parasites, and Space bugs are everywhere, so many dead bodies...no for real though, this game is even better than the 1st. It does have some issues, as it did freeze up on me once and crash, but for the most part it has run well and although shorter than the 1st this game is easily leaps and bounds better. That is not to say the 1st was bad, just too drawn out and it did not have the story to keep going that long. This time, Shadowgrounds is shorter but a ton more fun. The options and ways to dispose of aliens is varied and a blast. Survival mode is even more exciting than the campaign, in my opinion. It is worth a try, however due to the possibility of it crashing on you, I would get it when it is cheap. I got it during the summer sale bundled with the first for only a $1.20. Fun times! ^_^			"

												Well lets see.....First I thought ""Hey, look I get both of them for 0,99€....They cant be that great"". So I started playing Survivor and it was pretty boring and strange at the beginning but it started to be a hell lot of fun a bit later. I played it on Easy but it somehow got a bit too hard during the last missions. I would rather call it ""Easy (or Not)"" Anyway I appriciate the graphics, it definitely needs some open-worldish levels. (Some levels can get pretty confusing x3) It is fast, makes alot of fun Isnt too bloody and has some great ideas.-- Shadowgrounds Review --If you are looking for a cheap alien-slaying-adventure THIS is the game for ya :3 Giving it 7.5 out of 10 Pina-Points ^<^			"

												This review is for the game ''Shadowgrounds Survivor''.Developer:FrozenbyteSeries:ShadowgroundsRelease dates:Windows November 14, 2007,Linux:September 18, 2009,Mac OS X April 13, 2011Genre:Fast-paced top-down shooterPlot:You take control of three survivors who team up in order to defend against an organized alien assault.Pretty straightforward,huh?You have to reach New Atlantis,after having acquired some ''critical'' data and fixed some terminals and pathways in order to do so.In the end you choose a survivor and after you feed in the data to the Defence Mainframe-in order to activate the turrets so that the alien swarm won't get inside the city- you complete the final mission and you finish the game.Pros:1)Fairly cheap(You should consider buying the whole Frozenbyte Collection in order to save some money or wait for sales),2)Pleasant time killer,3)Simple yet fun story,4)Simple gameplay,5)Massive graphics enhancements since it's predecessor(Shadowgrounds).Cons:1)Even though you get to have some more costumization since the original game Shadowgrounds the costumization is still limited and might i say no-brainer,2)Not challenging(You simply have to survive and reach the ending rather than doing quests or completing tasks),3)Limited information(No PDA like ''Shadowgrounds'',no computer screens),4)Really really really small(took me only 4 hours to finish the game and i paced myself)There's no connection whatsoever to the original game(Is it staged before the first Shadowgrounds game is it staged after,nobody knows.Plus in the first Shadowgrounds game the aliens were attacking in order to save the humanity from destroying itself.In Shadowgrounds Survivor the aliens are just mindless creatures,just wanting to kill stuff.I'd really like to know why this happened.Maybe in a sequel?I hope so.Overall a nice experience.I recommend this game but not for the people who want a challenge.Thank you Frozenbyte Developers for this game :).P.S There's the Survival mode where things toughen up and you can set high scores.

												I would define Shadowgrounds Survivor as ""Weekend light fun"".It's almost the same as the original, just a bit deeper: Different characters blasting their whay through alien hordes using different weapons and skills, going from point A to point B grabbing supplies, shooting everything and discovering secrets.As simple as that, the game is short and limited: Three characters, each one with two different weapons and a tipe of grenade, not a big amount of enemies to shoot at, some levels with the smallest variation (There's some defense zones, and in the end you get a mecha) and.. nothing else. The campaign lasts over 3.6 hours (Or that's what Steam says). After beating it, two new difficulty levels are unlocked, several survival maps and extra options (If you found enough secrets) to help you or make things silly in the second playthrough (If you want to do it).Also it has a map editor and coop, although I don't think that it has a very active communitty.In short, is a REALLY short game that does not a lot of things, but it does them right. Its not a great game but it is also not a bad game. If its on sale and you want to spend some time killing aliens, this is a good choice (Even better if it comes with the original), if you are looking for something more than a short distraction, look elsewhere.

I mean you can get use to third person perspective but some elements of enviroment just get in the way of your aim. It is soooooo anoying. If the game wasn't so easy, it would be really pain in the♥♥♥♥♥

												Very nice little game: lots of fun for blowing off steam (such as breaks inbetween studying), and genuinely fun, interesting, and challenging. Lots of dark and sometimes confusing areas, but nothing that really bugs. At first it may seem as if the aliens need too much ammo to kill, but once you upgrade that's not really a problem, and you constantly find ammo and are frequently full.There's also a nice story and you play with several characters who have different skills and weapons which makes the change interesting.

												Oy, how could developers go from a decent game into...this. First off, if you play this game immedietly turn off the free camera so that it drops it into an isometric third person shooter. This mimics the first game's camera and it improves the playability of the game immensly. It isn't the worst game, but it pales so much to the first one. It does a decent job at makeing the different 'characters' play differently...but the sniper basically puts the game on easy mode. Not to mention the ending...or rather 'non-ending'.But my biggest gripe comes from changing the flashlight system. In the first game it matteres to manage it since running out of power where it has to recharge in the dark...is bad. However in this game most of the enviroments you don't need a flashlight. This removes the fun and tense moments of entering a dark room, turning on the flashlight, and realising you are in a nest of critters. Pros:-Characters play differently-Graphics are pretty-Decent Isometric shooterCons:-Need to play the first game for the 'story'-Camera is awful until you make it 'classic' style-Characters are flatter then paper-Flashlight mechanic sucks now-Sniper makes the game to easyGet this one on sale, and only in a bundle with the first one. The first one may be an average game, but it was so much better then this outing. Which stinks, since it really could have been so much better.			"

												With attractive isometric graphics and an above average soundtrack, Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a quality action shooter.  The levels are not to linear, and do a good job of combining indoor and outdoor environments.  In addition, controller, widescreen and the Steam Overlay are supported.  Add to that an interesting experience and upgrade system as well as an online co-op mode, Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a good purchase for fans of the action isometric genre.			"

												The first Shadowgrounds kind of typified the linear top-down shooter type in terms of design and was overlong, but had its moments. Survivor attempts to establish more of an identity for itself by offering multiple characters with multiple skill-sets, but this makes the balance and level design suffer. It's just hard to imagine quite what the developers were hoping to accomplish beyond the most surface level aspirations with such a change.			"

												I really like Shadowgrounds, but this installment was a little hard to play. But not to the point that it detracted from my enjoyment of it. Every level you control one of three main characters that level-up independently. So it's a little frustrating to jump around and not have that awesome rifle I just picked up for that other character.And I really hate the flamethrower character. I have never, ever found a use for a flamethrower. Fire is not good for killing things. It's only good for scaring them. Let me re-phrase. Fire is not good for killing things efficiently. It is good for killing one or two things so the rest of the things run away in terror. Except in video games the aliens rarely (if ever) run away, so flamethrowers tend to be pretty useless. I'm sure the flamethrower in this game isn't completely worthless. I just don't like it and would rather stick to my trusty sidearm, ""Ginger.""			"

It is a great atmospheric slightly top down shooter, the story is a very bare bones almost john carpenter movie style plot but I loved the basic progression and story from the three different characters as the game went on.  the graphics are basic for today's standards but everything is still easily readable and runs fine.  I would almost say it is a top down version of doom 3.  I would love to see this made into a movie or short someday.  the best points is the great soundtrack and character upgrade system.			"

												What a pathetic excuse for a sequel.  What happened to the story?  This makes no sense if you played the first game.  Terrible story if you ignore the fact that the first game happened  Found myself not caring and just trying to find the end of the level as fast as i can.  Voice actors are cheesy.  Graphics feel like they were downgraded.   Play feels choppy from the first game.  What happened to all my weapon choices?  The best weapon is the lame assualt rifle i liked least from the first game.  This feels like they tried to get a quick extra paycheck riding on the amaziness of the first game.  The aliens who once had character now feel like a nuisance.  This game is a huge step backward from the first.  I feel compelled to finish playing becuase I loved the first game so much, but it just gets worse as I go.			"

 Windows 10 UnfriendlyBuying this game is such a tragedy decision for those Win 10 players, espicially for those who are using RADEON graphic card. This game will contidiuly telling you lack of physXloader.dll which is a Nuvdia graphic card driver. If you want to know if the game works on your computer, then just luanch the game from the file where you installed them but not dirtly from steam since you are not going to receive any response from it. Then you shall know what are you lacking to play this game. "

												I didn't think I liked isometric shooters - then I played the orignial Shadowgrounds.  The controls took a brief getting-used-to, and once I had, I was roll-flipping-behind-the-back shotgunning aliens in 360 degrees.  So fun.[EDIT] Below is no longer relevant - since I last payed ages ago, the devs have added a setup utility to scale graphics (and more importantly physics) detail - blast away!  I now recommend this game.This sequel introduced physics objects - which I think is actually a very bad idea, as they briefly slow down the flow of time in the game on older computers.  Part of what makes this original Shadowgrounds so great is it's silky-smooth and consistent gameplay throughout.  Nothing drives me nuts more than inconsistent flow-of-time / speed-of-time in a game.  (I'm looking at YOU, EA.)  I'd much rather have simple graphics and solid-as-steel gameplay than super HD realism and feeling like some man behind the curtain is filddling with the universe's speed-dial, screwing up my reaction time.Seriously.  Action games are all about reflexes, judging and anticipating movement - hitting stuff that moves with other stuff that moves.  If you were about to hit a baseball as it flies towards your bat at 92.6 miles an hour... and suddenly, 10 feet before it reaches you, just as you are releasing your wind-up... the ball decides to move at 84.5 mile an hour until it passes your already-swung bat, accelerating to an unexplainable 135 miles an hour as it no-clips through the wall.  No.			"

Secrets are interesting enough to want to hunt out as they give bonus ""cheat"" modes you can apply to a new game, awarded to you once you complete the game for the first time. That gives you a little reason to replay but not much. Game is a big challenge on the hardest difficulty.			"

													Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a top-down shooter set in a darkened environment. A game from 2007, its graphics have aged poorly, but not nearly so poorly as its predecessor; still, close-ups on faces look quite terrible. On the whole, it is a great improvement over its predecessor, with superior pacing and voice acting, and it feels less like a low-budget title. Still, it gets repetitive at the end, and unlike the first game, it lacks boss fights. As such, I would generally recommend Alien Swarm, which is free on Steam, over paying for this game.Story	A base on Ganymede has been attacked by a horde of aliens. Three survivors work together to save the world:	A soldier, who is the last member of his platoon and is trying to work his way back to the colony.	An old Russian janitor, who seems to enjoy setting things on fire.	A sniper, who keeps a count of every kill she gets.	They are assisted by a scientist, saved early on in the soldier’s sections, who helps them set up the defense of the colony.	The game’s story is very bare-bones and exists to serve the gameplay, and in that role, it is adequate; the voice acting is fine and not phoned-in, unlike the first game, and on the whole it serves its purpose, though why the aliens are there is never clarified – though on the other hand, maybe it doesn’t matter.Gameplay	The game is a top-down shooter. Each character has three weapons plus grenades, and each character has a special power that only they can activate. As you kill aliens, you find upgrades for your weapons, which makes them more powerful and gives them alternate fire mechanisms, and gain experience, which allows you to directly upgrade your characters’ abilities and stats.	On the whole, the gameplay is reasonably engaging, and by switching between different characters with different weapon sets, the game keeps its gameplay somewhat fresh. Unfortunately, by about halfway through the game you have encountered every type of alien present in the game, and as a result the second half of the game is mostly greater and greater numbers of aliens, with the odd “defend the area” or “ride around in a mech shooting things” or “sit in a turret shooting things” thrown in. As a result, the game does wear a bit thin by the end, though the game on the whole isn’t terribly long.	There is a secret hidden in each level, a S lying around on the ground, which adds a minor exploration aspect to the game, but on the whole, I didn’t really feel driven to find the things. Still, it was nice that there weren’t an excessive number of collectables.Graphics	The game was made in 2007, and while it looks okay when you are looking from the third-person, well-above-the-character perspective, whenever the characters speak their faces are shown on-screen and look absolutely terrible. On the whole, the graphics are serviceable, but it has not aged well and nothing looks really spectacular.Final Summary	The game is a competent third-person shooter, and you could do worse. However, Alien Swarm is still probably a better game, and it is free on Steam. "

												This game tells a story of another group of survivors except the previous protagnist Tylor. Basically nothing big is changed except that they added a character upgrade system besides the weapon upgrade system, and that there are three fighting characters instead of one since you are only allowed to carry 3 weapons plus granades.First of all, the linux port run okay but there's a sound issue that is very annoying. After a while the sounds seem to be competing each other for the speaker and the gun shots are skipping, and then it breaks down completely and there is no more sound. I'll have to restart the game to get the sounds back, and if this happens in mid game then I must finish the level companied with complete silence since there are no saves. This happens a lot when there's a lot of environmental sound like rain and snow. It's like ten times I had to restart before I can finish this game.I think this game has a lot of potential but somewhat inferior compared to the previous Shadowgrounds. Design is sloppy because there're no new monsters, and there isn't one boss (or there is? i can't remember). Three characters are a redundancy except for the story to unfold because there are no online multiplayer, and the story is simply too short for all of them to get their own stage.I'm rather disappointed with this game because there's only silght graphic boost and they basically just reused elements that were available. The story aren't good.5/10.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Shadowgrounds Survivor is a game developed and published by Forzenbyte, the same people behind the Trine series and Shadwen. It is a sort of sequel or continuation of the first game titled Shadowgrounds. Shadowgrounds Survivor is a fun, challenging, and hectic game with plenty of upgradeable weapons to wreak havoc with with 11 decently long levels and the voice acting is pretty poor and sometimes funny at some pointsThere are no quicksaves in Shadowgrounds Survivor, your progress is only saved when you complete a level, when you die, you can respawn up to five times roughly around the area where you diedThe game does feel a bit clunky at first with friendly AI following you around and at times are often useless with their poor shooting pistol and tend to block you alot and then there are at least two game breaking bugs that require you to either cheat or restart the levelHowever, Shadowgrounds Survivor isn't that bad and if you like games such as Valve's Alien Swarm and Team 17's Alien Breed along with many others, then give this game a try when it's on sale or at a price drop RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Shadowgrounds Survivor does make some minor improvements this time around and does provide a fun experience. The only problem for me is that it's repetitive. After an hour or so, you just get bored of shooting the same aliens over and over. I really wanted to like this one and I felt that it (like the first shadowgrounds) held a lot of potential. But with a blah story and meaningless missions (shoot aliens, walk around, shoot aliens, shoot aliens, computer terminal, shoot aliens) my attention is not held.If you're into these types of shooters, don't listen to me. This one's decent. But I can't sink in the hours to finish it.6/10			"

												Picked this up for 99 cents, and I can't really say it was worth bothering with. The game is, in a word, unremarkable. The monsters are all boring and repetive, the color pallate mostly consists of brown and grey, the plot and voice acting are both bad, the physics serve almost purely to make navigating past boxes and chairs annoying, and worst of all, the gameplay was outright dull. You just sort of move around from point A to point B while fighting small handfuls of monsters, and hoping desperately for something interesting to happen. The game at least tries to break it up with the ocasional survival section, where you have to fight off waves of monsters, but those are honestly even more dull. There were some mech sections near the end, but the controls for it were just abysmal.The game tries to spice things up with an RPG-lite element, but it's nothing to write home about. You have three different characters, each with three different weapons, where each weapon has three different upgrades. Fairly standard stuff, nothing you haven't ever seen before. To the game's credit it at least has some replay value in the form of secrets hidden throughout the levels, as well as other things such as survival mode. However, the game was boring enough that I couldn't really bring myself to actually bother trying any of that stuff out.Overall, I'd say don't play this. Instead, do yourself a favor and pick up Trine and Trine 2, both much better games that were both made by Frozenbyte. If you're like me and were only considering this because you've already played them, then just go ahead and play them again.			"

												Shadowgrounds Survivor Review - Raymond KTThe biggest problem with this game is that it feels and plays like a re-hash of ""Alien Breed"". The graphics aren't even much better quality, and a lot of the weapons/opponents seem the same. Horrible game. Almost exactly like Doom3 with bad graphics and horrible controls. I reality you can see in front of you, aim at something directly in front of you and SEE more than 5 feet in front of yourself. I would rather play the original GTA. This is a pretty primitive engine being used for this game; it literally looks like a game that should have been released 4 or 5 years ago. The gameplay is kind of ok, nothing great and I was growing bored after a few levels. Unless your pc is old and can't run a better game with a more modern engine, I would not bother with this mediocre game.Not only does the game steal Doom's premise (not that it was a very good premise to begin with) to create a game that inspires laughter instead of the expected fear which its poor choice of camera placement (what is scary about top-down camera placement?), contrived concept of enemies, bad AI, laughable dialogue, and bad voice acting. Not only that, the graphics are sub-par at best (which is forgivable for an independent game) and the weapons are nothing special. Boring, boring, boring gameplay. "

												Ok game, not a bad shooter, but it's plagued with issues that the devs know about but won't fix. A well known issue is a crash on a near end level. Devs solution is to download another save game, and load from there. Don't buy this game, and don't buy from these devs who only do a half finished product.It's a shame since the game would have been recommended if it wasn't for the awful bugs.			"

												Better technically speaking than the first game, but that isn't saying much. I had to fk around with this because it was randomly crashing. I fixed it but it doesn't matter because this game is just sh-ttingly generic like the first one, with slightly better graphics. Like putting rib sauce on a big pile a dog sh-t. One hell of a crappy, generic, boring game. I would rather get f-cked by a horny gorilla than ever play this sh-t again. Ever. Up yours.3/10			"

												Still a good game but not quite as good as the original sadly.  If you enjoyed the first you'll have fun with this but probably not quite as much. It suffers from 'Set Piece' Syndrome. Gone are the sprawling levels that invite and reward exploration , they are now replaced by relatively linear A->B style levels.Oh the fights are fun but yeah you could feel that they were just throwing cool stuff in without much to pad around it, The real bummer is loca only co-op... be nice to play this on line. If you liked the first this is worth a shot but... don't expect it to be quite as fun. Oh and in case you;re wondering how I can judge the game after only 7 hours... that's how long it took me to finish it. So kinda short			"

												I assumed I reviewed this garbage game when I also reviewed Shadowgrounds. Don't buy these games. The controls are abysmal. My hour of play time is mostly trying to figure out the horrible controls and dying and reloading. These games aren't going to get any better and they're a decade old. They were probably as bad then as they are outdated and uninteresting now. If this game goes on sale, still don't get it. It's only worth it if you can find it for free and care about getting one more free game that you'll never play linked to your steam account-but is that really worth it? No. I don't think so. Maybe I just think Frozenbyte is a terrible game company. I also hate their Trine games, so if you wanna believe my opinion is biased, feel free. I only just noticed they made all these games I don't like.			"

												This review is about Shadowground Survior, the spin off/sequel to Shadowgrounds.The graphics are about what you'd expect for a game made in 2008, nothing too special, the lighting effects however, are quite nice. The RPG upgrade system is very simple, yet functional, more of an RPG-lite than an full-blown RPG system with stats and other whatnots. The shooting mechanics are solid, which is good, because you will be spending a LOT of time doing that in this game. The story and characters are nothing to write home about, just save generic space colony 9 from alien menace #101, with a rather generic space marine, a pyromaniac, and a special forces sniper. Overall, I'd give this a 7/10, for when it was made.TL;DR, if you're looking at this game, but are torn between the original, or this one, get Shadowgrounds, the original.I can't help but feel they took one step forwards with two steps back in this release, looking forward to more from this developer.

												I like the game, the atmosphere, the fear and horror of the distant planet , when player is trying to survive alien hordes. At first this game reminded me of WarCraft III mode, but some cool details, as weapon upgrades, different characters, neat graphics and full camera circle pushes this game one step further. Ther are couple things, I did'nt like about this game:- Survival mode takes to much time to load, even when you choose 'Try again', you have to going thru process of choose charater and weapons again and agi every single time (Maybe -fast reload- button?)- I bought this game at The Humble Store for the low price - €0,79 instead of €7,99. Low price and the fact that game works on Linux makes me buy this game. However, after redeeming key on Steam, I wasn't able to play this under Linux. Quick search on the game studio's forum shows me that even when dowload directly from the Humble Store a version for Linux, one must have to do lot of hacking/patching to make game works on Ubuntu. Developers should fix this as soon as possible- The last one: Main campaign is a little bit short, I managed to finish it in some 6 hours of playing, on easy level of difficulty, though (1 of 5 levels).Conclusion.  Despite some downsides, I'm glad to have this one in my collection. I hope that replaying campaign at more diffucult levels, survival mode, a eventually the coop mod will provide additional  fun gaming hours.   "

												I'd like to preface this by saying that I haven't played the original Shadowgrounds game yet.Shadowgrounds Survivor is a very curious mix of top-down shooters and RPGs. On the one hand, it has all the elements for a really good shooter, and also manages to meld them with some RPG elements on the side to keep things interesting.The graphics have not aged very well, but they are very serviceable along with the versatile game engine they work on. It's really quite fast, even with all the dynamic shadowing and lighting going on. Problem is, getting all that to work is a pain since you have to install an outdated version of PhysX back when it was owned by Ageia.The soundtrack is top-notch surprisingly, It really does help sell the atmosphere and knows how to transition from that feeling to pure hectic fun when it wants to. The gun effects all sounds really quite effective and powerful. My only gripe is with the creatures' effects, they are all pretty lacking in a way and really failed to get me excited about my fights with them whenever there were no jumpscares to be had. Voice acting isn't too bad and works well for the most part aside from some cringeworthy situations.A lengthy campaign is a gift that keeps on giving, except when the story is absolutely horrible in writing, and pacing. Could've gone better with some changes to the script and the game's pacing, but I hear the original title is a lot better in that regard.			"

												Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a sidequel [Isn’t that what you call a game that takes place at the same time as the original, but from a different character’s perspective?] to Shadowgrounds, and it improves on its predecessor in a number of ways.  Let’s see how it does it.First off, the gameplay is almost exactly the same.  Shoot aliens, collect upgrade parts, get new weapons, repeat.  The twist this time, though, is the addition of RPG elements for your 3 distinct characters.  The Marine, Exterminator, and Sniper all have their own set of specialized weapons, and they play completely differently.  You can also upgrade their specific abilities, giving them area control powers or instant kill moves.  This little bit of variation gives a huge boost to this game over the original.But that is hardly all the improvements that were made.  The graphics are noticably improved as well.  The detail is much sharper, and there are a lot more interactive objects.  Frozenbyte did a great job making the levels this time around, as they all are relatively easy to nagivate, rather than the directionless mazes from the last game.  There is much less emphasis on finding keys to progress in this game, it is focused on what the title says: Survival.Ammo is a non-issue, even for your special weapons.  It flows so fast and plentiful you will almost always be at capacity.  This allows you to approach different encounters and have fun with them, seeing if you can kill 25 aliens with just a rocket launcher or sniper rifle.The story in this game stays largely out of the way, and it is probably a little more interesting because of that.  The (relatively) improved voice acting definitely helps.  Instead of single-handedly trying to stop the alien invasion through brute force, you are simply trying to assist a single colony to survive and repel the advancing army.All this comes together to make an enjoyable romp.  Shoot aliens, improve your weapons, shoot some more aliens.  The three characters are all unique and fun to play.  It is also fun to go back and play levels you’ve beaten in Survival mode, an endless assault of aliens.  Play to try and beat your high scores.Sequels are not usually such vast improvements.  The upgrade system, the graphics, and the story all saw major change for the better here.  If you liked Shadowgrounds, you’ll really like Survivor.  If you skipped Shadowgrounds because of its faults, give Survivor a closer look.  You might like what you see.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Reading the description I was expecting a full sequel, but this is an expansion pack at best. It adds very little to the original formula, and misses a chance to fix some issues and bring the series to a higher level:PROS:- Three different characters, with different weapons and different skill sets.- Simple RPG style upgradable character skills.- Better voice acting.- Enhanced physics using NVIDIA Physx; everything can be moved around and destroyed, updated enemy gibbing.- Slightly more detailed environments, fog, better particle effects.- Secrets unlock new gameplay options.- More varied environments; snowy landscapes, rainy canyon, lava cave, sewers...- Survival mode.- The mech.CONS:- The campaign can be finished in 4-5 hours, which is half of the time it took me to finish the original. Just when I upgraded all my characters the game was already over.- Maps are tiny compared to the original game, and are much more linear.- There are no side missions like in the original, you basically just have to survive from start to end of the level.- The stories of the three characters have no touching points. Even when they finally meet, you have to just pick one of them to continue. It would be much more interesting if they interracted more during the story, or if you could play with all of them at the same time like in RPG games or like they did it in The Thing.- There is only one new type of enemy.- The AI isn't fixed, and enemies still sometimes get stuck, I feel sorry for them :(Btw, some reviews here mention problems running the game on Windows 7 64bit, but I had no problems.At the end I had fun playing this ""expansion"", and the last part, where you have to pick your character, I replayed with each one of them. The gameplay is very fun, but unfortunatelly Frozenbyte lacked either the ambition or the money to bring the series to a higher level, plus the modding community missed a chance to make some interesting mods. It was fun while it lasted.			"

												sometimes I don't get what's wrong with people. this is a HUGE improvment over the first game, everything is better: gameplay, graphic, athmosphere, variety. the only thing that is inferior is the story, but just beacause there is no story.however i still can't recomend this game, enemies are still dumb as hell, the pointing system doesn't work well (3 times out of 10 your bullet will either fly over the enemy or hit the ground before reach it, even if you shoot in the right direction), you still have no way to avoid enemy fire (but the difficulty is lower so it's ok) and the game is a bunch of battles all similar to each other. maybe it can be good as a time waster but no more than this			"

I never even liked this genre at all but the game did a great job of sucking me into the story and it is actually pretty suspenseful at times.  I got this game in a pack I bought for the other games in it and ironicaly, have played this one the most.  I really like how it jumps from character to character too.  This game deserves a way better overall review than ""mixxed.""  It's fun and cheap, people need to get over the fact that not every game is going to have the amount of Fallout 4 content...			"

												Game is super unpolished and buggy, compared to the original Shadowgrounds.  It was almost more trouble than it was worth to get the game to start/work properly.  But in the end, the gameplay is so solid and addicting that it makes up for it.  That is saying quite a lot.  For the record, I got this from the Humble store Spring sale for either a dollar or two so the money was right and a good price on a game does make it a lot easier to give a positive review.  Can't say enough good things about the gameplay though and I can't wait until the next Shadowgrounds game.  Top-down shooters like this are few and far between.  If you enjoy games like Crimsonland (which has been remade/brought to Steam recently!), the Shadowgrounds games have a similar feel.			"

												Shadowgrounds Survivor,an clear point to me back to the past,but not in a good way.But why?Lets talk about it.Warning,this part of the Review will contain Spoilers of the first game,Shadowgrounds(the ending of it).if you don't wanna Spoil it skip this part to the next Head-textat the end of Shadowgrounds,the invasion which attacked the colony ended,with maybe one of the worst endings ever in a game.they say before launching the bomb,the ghosts(?) of people like the person you just killed and tell you ""no its bad don't do it its gonna destroy EVERYTHING."" and they are like""oh okay,lets listen to the ghosts which look like the guy i just murdered in a fight and leave.""You maybe think,that's it?No.Meanwhile somewhere else! Our Story takes placesomewhere else.Meanwhile by our new heroes.You play from mission to mission constantly other people,besides from the last mission,you can choose which one you wanna be there.which doesn't changes the fact that its not an good thing.They Force you to use the weapons which come with your new character you are gonna have for the mission,and you cant do anything against itThat's an clear BAD point,unlikely in the first game,where you were 1 person,you keep on switching from the first not interesting person to the next one to the next one and back to the first one ,through the entire game.The only good point i saw,was that you can safe more easily then in the first game.The game overall has an,at least for my part,an 2 hour playtime,which isn't the 7.99€ FULL buy price worth it.Its leaking of everything which was good in the first game,and the story isn't good to.this game,in my opinion shouldn't be called Shadowgrounds Survivor,more like it ruined what i was thinking over the first game.Shadowgrounds Destroyer.There was an moment of enjoying the game,but it didn't last long and,oh look!credits.if you still wanna give it a try,wait until its cheaper,its not gonna be worth it to buy it for the whole price,the first game MAYBE(not),but defintly  not this one.

												I finally tried this game after a bit of apprehension, luckily purchased for ninety-nine cents. I actually found this game to be great fun. It is worth much more than the ninety-nine cent price tag, at least worth the full ten dollars. The only problem I had with this game was before I played it, I have never even heard of the name Shadowgrounds, but do not let that deter you. This game does not look great by any means, but it is great fun. The top-down perspective gives it a Diablo/ Torchlight feel, but it does not play like those games. It IS a shooter, but a good one. The RPG style upgrade tree and leveling adds a decent twist to the game and allows you to defend yourself against the horde, of which seems to have a rather fair difficulty curve to it. This is just good fun.			"

												This review is about Shadowground Survior, the spin off/sequel to Shadowgrounds.The graphics are about what you'd expect for a game made in 2008, nothing too special, the lighting effects however, are quite nice. The RPG upgrade system is very simple, yet functional, more of an RPG-lite than an full-blown RPG system with stats and other whatnots. The shooting mechanics are solid, which is good, because you will be spending a LOT of time doing that in this game. The story and characters are nothing to write home about, just save generic space colony 9 from alien menace #101, with a rather generic space marine, a pyromaniac, and a special forces sniper. Overall, I'd give this a 7/10, for when it was made.TL;DR, if you're looking at this game, but are torn between the original, or this one, get Shadowgrounds, the original.I can't help but feel they took one step forwards with two steps back in this release, looking forward to more from this developer.

												Really nice game, I finished it on medium difficulty and it was rather easy, but there are 3 harder difficulty levels to choose from. Killing aliens is fun and the possibilities to upgrade every weapon makes the game more exciting. Through the story (I didin't really care the plot) we play 3 different characters, each with up to 3 weapons and personal skills. Controls were easy to learn for me. The graphics are quite good. There is some kind of easteregg in the game that gives us bonunes while playing the game one more time. All in all, the game is very good and gives fun for a few hours. I finished it in 1 day.

												I rate this game at 6/10. It's a playable fun enough game. But there's a lot of squandered potential with this game. The characters are limited to 4 weapons, with 4 characters. You really don't get to choose who you play as instead they force you to play as x character. Also my game crashed a few times, while in the process of going to the next level. Which was frustrating because I had to do the levels over again in order to get the chance to try the next level. Also, there's little to no improvement in the graphics, or voice acting from the previous version. It's fun, but they could've done better.			"

												This seems to essentially be a subtle variant of its predecessor, so its faults are largely the same: it's a bit of a disappointing mishmash, to be honest. I don't even mind the iffy graphics, since they were obviously going for a retro feel here, but everything is just so clunky and stilted--itemization, combat, enemy configuration and level design, etc. It might be a nice throwback for the first hour or so, but your time is probably better spent elsewhere.

												The second part to the series. The story doesn't continue but it takes place on the same moon (Ganymede).The graphics are better this time around and the dodging has been improved. The main characters (yes you get to play multiple characters throughout the campaign) don't go around rolling like crazy men/women anymore.Also each character can't lug around 10 weapons at a time, which is a bit unrealistic imho, but only 4 weapons out of which one would be standard hand grenades. The other three weapons are unique to each character.The upgrade system has been revamped. This time around you can upgrade your character as well as your weapons. And different characters have different upgrades.Again not much of a story but definitely very fun playing. Also allows local co-op, but I havent tried it yet. If the sale is on, then I would say go get it. Fun timepass.8/10			"

												I seriously don't understand all those negative reviews of this game... most of them are because of the fact that you need to upgrade your drivers to be able to play the game (As with most pc games) and the developers provided a sinple link in the discussion board on steam. It took me 4 clicks to be able to make the game work.The game is a little bit similar to the first one but with upgraded graphics and slightly better gameplay. They could have made a better story with nice cutscenes but all in all what we get is not that terrible. The ambiance of the game really stuck to me and I just played the game for a whole day without even noticing it.I think this game deserve a better rating then this...7/10			"

												Shadowgrounds: Survivor is a sidequel [Isn’t that what you call a game that takes place at the same time as the original, but from a different character’s perspective?] to Shadowgrounds, and it improves on its predecessor in a number of ways.  Let’s see how it does it.First off, the gameplay is almost exactly the same.  Shoot aliens, collect upgrade parts, get new weapons, repeat.  The twist this time, though, is the addition of RPG elements for your 3 distinct characters.  The Marine, Exterminator, and Sniper all have their own set of specialized weapons, and they play completely differently.  You can also upgrade their specific abilities, giving them area control powers or instant kill moves.  This little bit of variation gives a huge boost to this game over the original.But that is hardly all the improvements that were made.  The graphics are noticably improved as well.  The detail is much sharper, and there are a lot more interactive objects.  Frozenbyte did a great job making the levels this time around, as they all are relatively easy to nagivate, rather than the directionless mazes from the last game.  There is much less emphasis on finding keys to progress in this game, it is focused on what the title says: Survival.Ammo is a non-issue, even for your special weapons.  It flows so fast and plentiful you will almost always be at capacity.  This allows you to approach different encounters and have fun with them, seeing if you can kill 25 aliens with just a rocket launcher or sniper rifle.The story in this game stays largely out of the way, and it is probably a little more interesting because of that.  The (relatively) improved voice acting definitely helps.  Instead of single-handedly trying to stop the alien invasion through brute force, you are simply trying to assist a single colony to survive and repel the advancing army.All this comes together to make an enjoyable romp.  Shoot aliens, improve your weapons, shoot some more aliens.  The three characters are all unique and fun to play.  It is also fun to go back and play levels you’ve beaten in Survival mode, an endless assault of aliens.  Play to try and beat your high scores.Sequels are not usually such vast improvements.  The upgrade system, the graphics, and the story all saw major change for the better here.  If you liked Shadowgrounds, you’ll really like Survivor.  If you skipped Shadowgrounds because of its faults, give Survivor a closer look.  You might like what you see.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. Reading the description I was expecting a full sequel, but this is an expansion pack at best. It adds very little to the original formula, and misses a chance to fix some issues and bring the series to a higher level:PROS:- Three different characters, with different weapons and different skill sets.- Simple RPG style upgradable character skills.- Better voice acting.- Enhanced physics using NVIDIA Physx; everything can be moved around and destroyed, updated enemy gibbing.- Slightly more detailed environments, fog, better particle effects.- Secrets unlock new gameplay options.- More varied environments; snowy landscapes, rainy canyon, lava cave, sewers...- Survival mode.- The mech.CONS:- The campaign can be finished in 4-5 hours, which is half of the time it took me to finish the original. Just when I upgraded all my characters the game was already over.- Maps are tiny compared to the original game, and are much more linear.- There are no side missions like in the original, you basically just have to survive from start to end of the level.- The stories of the three characters have no touching points. Even when they finally meet, you have to just pick one of them to continue. It would be much more interesting if they interracted more during the story, or if you could play with all of them at the same time like in RPG games or like they did it in The Thing.- There is only one new type of enemy.- The AI isn't fixed, and enemies still sometimes get stuck, I feel sorry for them :(Btw, some reviews here mention problems running the game on Windows 7 64bit, but I had no problems.At the end I had fun playing this ""expansion"", and the last part, where you have to pick your character, I replayed with each one of them. The gameplay is very fun, but unfortunatelly Frozenbyte lacked either the ambition or the money to bring the series to a higher level, plus the modding community missed a chance to make some interesting mods. It was fun while it lasted.			"

												Not sure why people are hating on this game so much.  I have about 80 games I can play right now and I was most excited to get home and play this.  I never even liked this genre at all but the game did a great job of sucking me into the story and it is actually pretty suspenseful at times.  I got this game in a pack I bought for the other games in it and ironicaly, have played this one the most.  I really like how it jumps from character to character too.  This game deserves a way better overall review than ""mixxed.""  It's fun and cheap, people need to get over the fact that not every game is going to have the amount of Fallout 4 content...			"

												Similar to the first installment, with darker lit areas and more enemies hitting you from all sides. This would be all fine and dandy however for whatever reason the Devs decided to change your loadout at each level. This can make for some interesting (read fustrating) gameplay especially when you're surrounded and stuck with the Pistol, Shotgun and a handful of Shock Grenades.  It also seemed to me, that there are alot more places to get your character hung up on, when enemies are coming at you. All in all if this was a $20+ (usd) game I would not recommended it. However it is regularly on sale (currently $0.99) and for that price you can't go wrong.			"
