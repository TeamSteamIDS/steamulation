												The best part of BioShock series so far, simply a masterpiece. Sure, the gameplay's solid, smooth, fun, and plasmids system are quite innovative, but that's not what makes ""Bioshock"" a masterpiece; it's the story. You get a chance to see that a world without morals are doomed to fail, even so beautiful, like Rapture. Dont be lazy to pick up all the audio, or you will miss the most intersting parts of the plot.			"

												Bioshock is truly an amazing singleplayer FPS game with some RPG elements to it , and it is set in 1960 in the breathtaking and beautiful fallen underwater city of Rapture. I must say , this is one of my favourite games ive ever played from the story to the artsyle to the gameplay , everything is a complete masterpiece! The Story The story of the game is an absolute masterpiece! It begins in 1946 when an underwater city called Rapture , was built by a wealthy Russian immigrant called Andrew Ryan so it can escape the outer world's laws and government and create its own which is mainly based on the rich people's desires thus making the poor to start a rebellion later onSome scientists found a sea slug which can produce a special material called ADAM which can manipulate DNA which can cure diseases and grant people ""super powers"" , funded by smuggler Frank Fontaine they've started to produce Plasmids and Gene Tonics and sell them to , to boost the process they've discovered that if the slugs are implanted into little girls they produce 30 times the amount of ADAM , Then Frank Fontaine opened an orphanage home for little girls and used them as an ADAM FactoryAndrew Ryan attempted to arrest Fontaine but Fontaine faked his own deathDays later a rebellion has started in Rapture against Andrew Ryan  led by Atlas and the poor to bring him down of his throneThe year is 1960 and the game starts as you Jack , the main protagonist , is onboard an airplane which crashes near a mysterious Lighthouse Gameplay The gameplay is just brilliant! The game is a singleplayer FPS with some RPG elements to it as you can choose from many ways to play the game completely diffrently as it best suites you8 unique and interesting weapons to choose from with each one having 3 diffrent ammo types to choose from11 creative and useful Plasmids (super powers) you can choose from which each one has their unqiue and special effect on enemiesMillions of diffrent ways to customize your character with player enchancements which completely change the way you play Graphics Tho the game is released in 2007 i still find the graphics to age very wellThe artsyle of the enviroment of Rapture is at the same time beautiful and creepy in some partsIt totally makes you feel like you're in an adandoned underwater city where a rebellion used to be Soundtrack Nothing special but brings the creepy tone to the enviroment PROS: +A well written Storyline+Brilliant Gameplay+A very well-aged artstyle+Tons of ways to customize your gameplay with diffrent weapons , player enchancements and much more!+Variety of creative and unique enemy types+Dark and Creepy atmosphere+A nice amount of gore+Love the Big Daddies :) CONS: -Nearly the end of the game you'll be full on ammunition and money and the drops of the enemies will be annoying and useless-For Windows 7 users when you first start up the game you'll have some sound and resolution issues which can easily be fixed by finding some guides on the internet ( It didn't work for me tho -_-)-There's a chance that the Steam Overlay for this game won't work after you fix the resolution and sound issues ( as happened to me ... -_-)I totally recommend buying this game if you haven't tried it out yet I rate a total of 8/10Now , would you kindly buy this game and give my review a like? :)			"

												Bioshock was a genre shifting masterpiece upon release.Looking back, there are some cracks in its foundation that stand out a bit more obviously today after so many reiterations and refinements have been made to first person shooters on the whole, but that the experience is still such a rich, deep, and enthralling one is a testament to how incredible it originally was.Bioshock is first and foremost the story of Rapture, an underwater utopia plunged into chaos by its own design of rejecting traditional ideology. It was a city created to be a safe haven for the most ambitious and intelligent people of the world to tap into their full potential; to experiment and create, free from the burden of morals and law found in the world above. Along with this came the discovery of a gene altering drug known as Adam, which when injected alters the hosts genetic code and bestows superhuman powers to them, from shooting fire from your fingertips to telekinesis and mind control. In a city removed from natural order restrained only by owns own ingenuity, the thirst for power eventually led to the city's demise.Entering this decrepit city as a castaway from a crashed airplane is among the most impressive and memorable opening sequences to any video game I've ever played. It's a perfectly executed series of events, informing you both of what the city once was and the nightmarish hell it became in a matter of moments, before leading you into an astonishingly well crafted world that devours you whole in its overpowering atmosphere. Everywhere you look there are callbacks, visual cues and audio diaries that retell what life was like in Rapture, and how it got to be the way it is. The sense of place and level of detail carved into the environment informing you not only what Rapture was, but what it represented, is an astounding achievement in world design and environmental narratives. There's never a room that feels out of place, or an oddly written character; it all fits together in this twisted world of objectivism steeped in the writings of Ayn Rand, so successfully realized it's almost frighteningly easy to see how a city like Rapture could potentially come about.Much of this is presented non-verbally, with art deco banners and store fronts, dated vending machines, and various subtle hints at Rapture's history peppering the environment and bringing it to life. The disturbing sounds and dialogues of the splicers inhabiting the city add a level of characterization to enemies that turns them into more than soulless targets, providing a glimpse into their backstories and bizarre relationships, and at times making me hesitant to actually kill them (at least until they tried to). The world design is so strong in fact that it largely overshadows the core narrative of your character, one which stays in the background until roughly 2/3 of the way through, and then ends in a rather disappointingly cliched manner. It's not to say it's bad, as when the plot finally comes to the forefront it does it in a way that's startling and unforgettable, but it seems almost secondary in many ways to the numerous auxiliary stories you hear as you make your way through rapture. It's there to keep the experience on a straight path, but it's not what drives it.With how much depth and originality was given to creating this remarkable world, it's a remarkable feat that just as much work has been put into Bioshock's combat mechanics. Utilizing plasmids, the same substances that turned the citizens of Rapture insane, adds a host of combat options to the standard gunplay, often working in tandem with each other to open the game up for dozens of different tactics that makes combat almost like a puzzle as you mix and match the tools at your disposal to find the most potent combinations (one of my favorites was the ""one-two punch"" of electrocuting a splicer, the enemies of the game, and then delivering a hefty hit with the wrench). Being able to carry an entire arsenal with you further broadens your capabilities, allowing you an immense amount of freedom in how you approach encounters and with it coming a welcome amount of variety.The inventiveness and distinction of each enemy you face layers on yet another element to combat encounters, from the different ways splicers react to you and each other (from running straight forward, arms flailing, to climbing the walls and dropping down from above), to the intense encounters with Big Daddies: huge enemies outfitted with an enormously powerful drill and far more speed an maneuverability than there colossal diving suit bodies would have you believe. These fights are brutal and require you to more carefully time your attack and fine tune your strategy, often using the environment and traps you set to your advantage as a head on approach is almost certainly suicidal.The few areas that Bioshock trips up on are largely the result of the existence of its more mechanically sophisticated sequel, which streamlined the tedious hacking minigame and added dual wielding to make combat faster and more fluid.. They aren't huge issues in the overall picture, but it does make returning to the original harder than I'd imagined and would likely seem a bit clumsy to those who played the other two games first (which I would certainly advise against).Despite all the years since its release, very few games have managed to match the scope and creativity of Bioshock's world and mechanics (even its own two sequels). It's an astounding achievement in every area of its design, and the sort of game that would be fair to consider something of a requirement to play. It's among the most amazing games I've ever played, as well as one of my personal favorites that I see myself continuing to return to as without fail I fall back in love with it again.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												The long awaited Bioshock has the distinct honor of being the first non-sports title to usher in the long awaited holiday gaming rush. As the spiritual successor to the System Shock series, Bioshock is a highly anticipated title because of its blend of incredible visuals and innovative First Person Shooting. Our tickets to Rapture have finally arrived, and everyone is obviously wondering if Bioshock can live up to its own hype. The answer is a resounding yes, as Bioshock is a genre-bending adventure-roleplaying-FPS hybrid that completely absorbs the player and doesn't let go until the thrilling end.Bioshock takes place in the underwater city of Rapture, built by the homicidal genius Andrew Ryan. Ryan conceived Rapture as a place for geniuses and the mentally elite to be able to separate themselves for society and flourish without the constrictions placed on them by morality and government. However, something goes deathly wrong in Rapture, leaving most of the inhabitants dead or raving, murderous lunatics. The game begins with the protagonist as the lone survivor of a plane crash in the ocean, with Rapture being your only hope of refuge. You quickly get caught up in unraveling the mystery of Rapture as you fight for survival, getting caught up in the different objectives of other ""sane"" inhabitants that usually need favors before they'll aid you to escape to safety.The blessing and curse of Rapture is the rampant use of Adam, a material that allows individuals to alter their own genetic code and give themselves superhuman abilities. Adam is a hot commodity in Rapture even long after most of its inhabitants are dead. Odd ghoulish girls called Little Sisters harvest Adam from dead bodies while armored monster known as Big Daddies protect the girls from harm. This relationship between Adam, the Little Sisters and the Big Daddies is at the core of Bioshock. Your character needs Adam to evolve and to remain capable of surviving the various foes that Rapture throws at you. However, the choice at the center of the gameplay revolves around the sacrifice of the Little Sisters. Will you kill the changed little girls to get maximum Adam, or will you attempt to save them and risk not having enough power to stay alive?The first and most noticeable thing about Bioshock are the visuals. Bioshock simply looks gorgeous. The underwater effects are among the best ever in a game, which is wonderful since there is a lot of water in the game considering that it takes place at the bottom of the ocean. The character models all animate incredibly as well, and even the protagonist has lifelike movements, flexing his on-screen hands occasionally in a convincing manner for the idle animations. The varied locales all look great as well, ensuring that the game experience is as immersive as possible. Rapture actually feels like the dilapidated city it is supposed to be. You'll encounter scattered bodies, some hung, some killed by gunfire, some killed by traps. There's always a sense that something has happened here, that the stage isn't a simple backdrop for you to explore.The next most noticeable thing is the high level of audio quality in the game. The sound effects are all spot on, from the bang of the shotgun to the whisper of the Little Sister to their protectors. The assorted splicers all chatter when they believe themselves to be alone, espousing nonsensical or deranged statements that reinforce their insanity. Also commendable are the voice actors in the various audio diaries scattered around Rapture.This brings us to perhaps the best quality in Bioshock... the story. Bioshock masterfully weaves an intricate tale by allowing you, the player, to piece together the story of Rapture and its mysterious fall. The various audio diaries, though not essential, help to evince the large picture for the player in between radio transmissions for various characters that guide you to the finale.Though classified as a First Person Shooter, Bioshock shares elements with a role-playing game or an adventure title. The various plasmid induced abilities as well as the different Adam-costing upgrades to your character give you a constant feeling of growth.There are also assorted ""minigames"", such as the ability to hack different machines via a pipeline game, or the ability to take photos of your enemies to give your character combat bonuses against them. There are also slots for combat, physical ability, and engineering where you can equip gene tonics, which enhance your abilities with traits such as a faster melee attack or the ability to turn invisible when idle. You can also upgrade your weaponry and invent items at designated stations. This variety serves to keep the gameplay fresh, as your character is always encountering a new ability, a new weapon, or better traits.			"

												In BioShock you are a survivor of a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. You are able to make your way to an island where a submarine is waiting to take you to into the great depths below where the mysterious underwater city of Rapture awaits. The city is trashed and genetic freaks called splicers roam around, attacking anything that gets in front of them. In order to survive you will have fight through these Splicers and other oddities keeping your eyes and ears open for clues into what has gone wrong, how you may be able to help or how you can escape.One aspect that makes the storyline work so well is the way it is told. BioShock uses a real time method of telling the story through random radio reports, overheard conversations and audio recordings.You can choose from a variety of different weapons, anywhere from pistols and shotguns to chemical throwers and grenade launchers. Each gun has different ammo that you can use. There are also many plasmids that you can use. You can electrify the water to kill everyone in it, set people on fire, freeze them and then smash them with a wrench, among other things.The graphics in this game are good, out of date, but still good.The sound of BioShock really puts you into the game. From the creepy things the splicers say to the background music, everything fits perfect.BioShock builds a great atmosphere by using terrific graphics and sound to set a creepy mood. BioShock is truly a stunning game and worth to buy.Sounds 9/10Graphics 8/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 9/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												A marvel. A wonder.For me, it has a much more value than Bioshock 2 or Infinite, because it was before, and it said it all, loud and clear.I don't believe you've not heard a thing about Bioshock, it would be a total bewilderment!Yet I must state there, that Bioshock was like a grasp of fresh air for a submariner, when it hit the shelves in the 2007.In the thick of of bleak and obtuse FPS games, flooded all stocks and minds, Bioshock felt like a blessing from above. Ken Levine made his brightest shot into the eternity. Bioshock is a Magnum Opus. A real deal stuff. A resurrection of System Shock principles with the isogenic battle system (mixture of guns, guts, wits and magic), with modern, looking-better-than-Half-Life-2-graphics, and deep, dark, sound and comprehensive story. Again mankind was looking for salvation, but drowned itself by ever-growing sins like greed, powerlust, and false infallibility.A miraculous experience of witnessing the end of time and humanity. A travel to mad scientist inner space. A nice reason to forget about sleep, in my book.Mark is 8.5/10: the narrative falls down a little in the very end, and there are some other distracting little things on the way through Rapture, that keeps me from praising Bioshock as ""the-best-my-eyes-ever-seen!"" title. But it is still a brilliant of game design, totally worth of your time.			"

												I can't believe it took me until now to play this game, it's just brilliant. Has its lows like most though but I have to say it impressed me how the story develops and gives you much more than what you could get by just running through shooting things (like you do in some shooters). It's a different shooter in most ways, let's say shooting weapons is not what you'll be doing the most in the entire game, you'll have these kind of superpower things named plasmids which are the aquired and upgraded as you advance and consume a meter bar named eve each time you use them. Also hacking stuff (security cameras, turrets) is a good part of it if you decide to, which is somesort of minigame but very helpful IMO.It's kind of easy if you ask me. I spent the entire game trying to save on everything, I mean, always have the maximum medipacks, the maximum ammo for every gun, etc. Every single bullet was important. I regret that choice as I ended up with most of my arsenal and currency unused. Yes you can run half of the game thru just using very little ammo/eve and just melee attacking your enemies with a wrench (default attack). Of course you'll have a lot more fun if you use guns/plasmids which I recommend you to. There are some unbalanced plasmids however, but try all of them so you can see for yourself which ones you like the most.Also, if you want to get the most of the story you should try to listen as many records as you can, helps you understand the whole thing (you'll find them randomly across the entire game).You'll definitely have a good time playing this. Worth $20? Definitely, but you can find it for $5 on most sales.			"

												I am extremely Jealous of anyone who hasn't played this yet and gets to experience it for the first time. It is an amazing adventure that will leave you wanting so much more. It will not only hook you on the story, but it will open up a door to a genre you never knew you loved so much. Nothing more needs to be said. If you enjoy an amazing story with a concept that is so amazing that it is almost impossible to believe somebody could come up with, then this game will be your best friend.Easily without hesitation 10/10			"

Bioshock: A Tale of Poor City PlanningBioshock is great.  It is the story of a man who wakes up in the ocean and stumbles into an underwater city full of grumpy people.  In this city it is not only common, but encouraged, to buy chemical supplements and inject them willy nilly into your body.  This seems to have had a negative effect on the general population, but it doesn't stop you from doing it.  Bioshock features monsters and madness, suspense and surprises, twists and turtles, parents and powerups.Pros:Atmosphere.  Bioshock's environment is completely unique.  It's a city with a real story to it, and you learn about it from the plot and the environment itself.  It's beautiful and creepy and immersive.  The music is awesome, the art is awesome, the NPC dialogue is awesome.  Bioshock's atmosphere is awesome.Plot.  Bioshock's story is complex, deep, and of course interesting.  It's constantly engaging, you always want to keep going to find out what the hell is going on, and of course what the hell happened.  It poses questions about individuality, capitalism, government, morality, selfishness... maaaaaan, it's great.Nifty combat.  You get to use superpowers, but you are never overpowered.  Combat is always challenging.  Enemies are varied and interesting.  Big daddies are so fresh.  They are terrifying.Length.  Bioshock is actually a long game (31 hours for me), but it doesn't overstay its welcome.  It's most definitely not padded, it's always moving forward.  You get your money's worth.Cons:You collect way more money and goods than you can ever use.   You just fill up on everything and have nothing interesting to buy.Honestly, the guns feel a little... man, I don't even know how to describe it.  Floaty?  Disconnected?  Not smooth?Conclusion:Bioshock is fantastic and you will be thinking about it long after you've completed it.  Buy it, yo.			"

												""Why children take so long to grow? They eat and drink like pig and give nothing back. Must find way to accelerate process...""I can honestly say Bioshock is the most fun single player game I've ever played. It has a great story, moments of surprise and interesting twists. You have freedom to make your choices. To be a good person or a bad person. Moral dilemma which is very straightforward in Bioshock. You can very easily predict how it will influence the ending. But that's not where your freedom ends.You can decide whether to destroy or hack security bots, cameras and turrets. You can use weapons you like the most and you can upgrade them. You can choose active and passive abilities (combat, engineering and physical) according to your playstyle, preferences and situations. You can collect items and craft! You can buy items in vending machines and if you hack them you can even reduce the prices there! You can take pictures of enemies with your camera and yield rewards for it. You can also roam around, explore and possibly find valuable items.So many choices!!! But can you really choose?The voice acting is excellent. All the voices talking to you via radio and all the audio recordings you find give you some kind of clue about what was going on. The game looks great. Very impressive graphics.Now would you kindly look out of a window of underwater city of Rapture at least once?			"

No Game has nor ever will be able to beat Bioshock 1's WTF Moment:  ""Would You Kindly....?""[/b] Very Good Game - Cutting Edge Graphics/Physics at the time, and still impressive today. I like to call it CRYTEK's ""Crysis"" of its time.I do not particularly care for FPS (usually play only the good AAA FPS titles), yet this game managed to give me such a good ever-lasting impression.STORY:Welcome to the Underwater World of Rapture!Your commercial Jetliner crashes in the Ocean. You are the only survivor and manage to swim to a little piece of land. On this piece of land is a little submarine type vessel - you climb into it & pull a lever it causes the vessel to take you underwater. As you are submerging you see a whole city built underwater. This is Rapture. A place built for people who sought freedom from persecution, religion, politics & the morals/ethics of the world. You find out that they began to play around with Biological/Genetic enhancements and that somehow things went wrong. The Setting is very interesting and beautiful but very disturbing as you will soon find out.The Story can get a little confusing at times, but as I mentioned, there is a really awesome WTF Moment or Plot Twist. This happens about half way through the game and after that things should start making a little sense.To enjoy the story to its fullest be sure to collect and listen to all audio logs. They contain vital story points, in depth information about the characters of Rapture and how it all fell apart.GAMEPLAY:Very Unique FPS: Your using of Weapons, Different Types of Ammunition, Plasmids and the Environment all in combination (e.g. Shock Plasmid + Water Combo) to defeat your foes was something new at the time. It had never been done before and it works really great. Never did the combat feel dull or repetitive to me.There are also light puzzles/riddles to solve and hidden areas to find that are loaded with loot & other goodies.WARNINGS & RECOMMENDATIONS:1) Play on the hardest difficulty so that you are forced to use use combos and converve ammuniton to survive.2) Do not  kill Cohen after helping him with his ""masterpiece"".  It will pay off and provide additonal content later on in the game. Don't worry, you can kill him later :-)3) Collect and listen to all Audio Logs - There is a great guide with maps and photos to find them all - otherwise you will miss out on a lot of content.I remember the days when Bioshock 1 came out and everyone was astonished at the graphics, physics etc. and then everyone (including my friends and I) ran out to buy a better graphic card in order to be able to play it.Shortly after Bioshock, Crysis hit and both looked great!RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN EXPERIENCING THE ""SHOCK"" & PARTICULARY ""THE BIOSHOCK SERIES"" OF GAMES:- Play the classic ""System Shock"" games.- After that, play all three Bioshock Games + their DLCs (the SP DLCs are good). Play the games in the order that they were released.- Each time you beat each game,  Read/Watch a few analysises of the story/plots twists/ending/morals of each game before moving onto the next.DO ALL THIS, AND YOU WILL GET THE MOST OUT THESE WONDERFUL GAMES - YOU CAN THANK ME LATER!

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Bioshock Original Release: 2007 Genre Tags: FPS; Atmospheric; Action; Story Rich My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 8-16 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Aesthetes; Strong narrative advocates; Game atmosphere connoisseursREVIEWBioshock is a wonderful example of what can be accomplished in the realm of video games when great design meets great execution. A FPS at its core, and the spiritual successor of the System Shock series, Bioshock is rooted in a strong and established foundation. But it isn’t just any other FPS game that will be mildly fun and then quickly forgotten. It is so much more than that. The fantastic gameworld design, the gripping atmosphere, the mysterious narrative, the idiosyncratic characters, and the uniquely identifying combat system all contribute to propelling this game into the elite caste. It is a legendary masterwork of gaming culture, and I posit: anyone who has yet to experience it would be wise to change that.With the high quality of all of the aspects of the game, it is difficult to name one as the “best.” But I would have to argue the most defining and inspired aspect is the wondrous and mystical gameworld atmosphere. The captivating atmosphere will grab hold of you from the opening scene and not let go until the ending credits. The world of Rapture is an absolute pleasure to explore and the ominous, dystopian ambiance is splendidly engaging. And it isn’t just the obvious things, but also the little subtleties and minute details that really elevate the gameworld atmosphere to elite status. The attention to detail is outstanding. Bioshock has an undeniably “A+” presentation.The narrative elements of the game are also exquisite. There is a main storyline that unfolds as you play and there is also a clouded history of lore that slowly becomes clear as you progress the game and discover the collectibles (which provide backstory). This multidirectional storytelling will keep you curious to learn more at all times, adroitly holding your interest as you make your way through the campaign. Moreover, the well-designed character development leads to interesting and idiosyncratic NPCs that are infinitely more intriguing than the usual forgettable clichés. It all amounts to an overall experience that will keep you engaged and entertained.As for the actual gameplay and combat, it is quite unique and variable. Nevertheless, I will admit that it isn’t necessarily the most riveting combat system around. But, as you are part gunslinger and part spellcaster, you can wreak havoc on your foes in a wide variety of ways. That, and the ability to purchase upgrades for your gear and abilities will keep the combat fresh and interesting throughout a playthrough.  Aside from that, there are also many collectibles to search for, there is loot hidden all over, and there are hundreds of interesting little things to look at. There is a lot going on.The last thing I’ll specifically mention regarding Bioshock is that I believe a large reason as to why it is so well received in the gaming community is because of all of the little things that were done right in allowing the player to decide how he/she wants to play the game. For instance, there is a great autosave/checkpoint system that won’t screw you over if you mess up and there is also an option for unlimited respawns (if you choose to use it). On top of that, you are free to manually save whenever you want. Or you can turn off respawns and never manually save if that’s your preference. Also, there is a large amount of lore, backstory, and narrative elements, but there isn’t hours of forced dialogue or unskippable cutscenes. You are mostly free to choose how much you want to learn or how much you want to plow through the game. This fundamentally open design allows for a wide audience to easily enjoy the game.

												Would you kindly read this review and buy this game? If you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.In terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen,

and the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons,

adding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite creepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).The story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.BioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again.

-Quick Review-BioShock is a FPS that was released in 2007, the story is very interesting, the game play is quite enjoyable, as you progress through the game you get different abilities, power ups, and new weapons that can also be powered up. All in all, this is a classic FPS to many gamers out there. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Welcome to Rapture, a city devoid of morals and government. A city where the inventor can invent, where a scientist can do science without the government questioning ethics. Oh and one more thing about Rapture... It's at the bottom of the Sea.As far as the story goes, you've just stumbled across rapture and now you need to try to get out of here alive, one problem Ryan {the founder of Rapture} is out to kill you. You will be helped along by a man named ""Atlas"" to navigate the various things you need to do to survive in Rapture.As you progress you will meet several people who will either try to help you along your way, or kill you, or both. The game is very streamlined, as long as you check the map it is quite difficult to get lost in this game.Game Play: The first FPS ""Story"" game that I played was Half Life 2, so when you start out a game with nothing but a Melee weapon, and then eventually pick up more weapons as the game progresses, I can't help but have flash backs to the good days of Half Life 2. I'm sure there's a name for that type of game mechanic development, but I will simply call it ""the half life progression"".You start out with a pipe wrench, which I proceeded to hit everything with... Dead bodies, light switches, little sisters, pretty much anyone who wasn't a ""big daddy"" (Because big daddy's would knock me into tomorrow if I wasn't fighting my hardest). Sorry, I digress; I love that wrench. The first few weapons you get are: Wrench, Pistol, Shotgun. You get about 8 different weapons but I won't spoil the rest for you, they're fun, trust me.You also get special abilities that require ""the blue stuff"" as I've so quaintly called it. What I want to call ""Mana"", ""Force skills"", and more names of blue energy meters is actually known as ""Plasmid"", which can only be restored by stabbing yourself in the arm with EVE syringes. You collect several abilities that use this energy source, the basic ones being: Shock, Fire, Telekinesis (Force pull *cough* ).There is one more thing to note about game play: Hacking. To hack you play a simple mini game that you need to complete circuits on. Before you try to hack you're warned how difficulty the hack will be and then you need to navigate a slow moving flow through a maze to complete a circuit, I found most of these to be very easy. Which made this part of the game slightly forgettable, but it does give you a break from the hoards of splicers trying to slice off your face. Achievements: At the time that I'm writing this, there are no achievements for this game, but sometime I would expect there to be a release updating and providing the Xbox achievements to steam users. (Date written: 10/23/14) Price: BioShock's standard price is $19.99. As I always say, I recommend buying the game on a sale, or from a humble bundle. So far I've played roughly 15 hours of the game, on normal difficulty. So this isn't one of those games where you're going to spend a large amount of time playing it. And since there aren't achievements I won't be pumping in extra time. Conclusion: Story: memorable. Game play: Logical. Achievements: Nonexistent. Price: Affordable. For everything else there's MasterCard. ...I wanted to end it that way, but I'll elaborate a tiny bit more as to what kind of person would enjoy Bioshock; most FPS players would enjoy this game, and probably find it quite easy to play. This game has high intensity, it's nowhere near ""horror"" quality, but the game keeps you tense for what's about to happen to you next.I recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a bit of a different chance of pace for their typical First Person Shooter games, BioShock definitely sets itself apart from the rest; which is probably why it's such a favorite to many.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for Bioshock 2Here's the URL to see my review for Bioshock Infinite "

												Bioshock is one of the most expertly made games I have ever played. The game takes place in a ciy called Rapture, a city under the sea created by Andre Ryan to be a utopia, where people's dreams would not be limited by things such as government or morality. You play as Jack, a man in a plane crash that landed in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, who finds a Lighthouse that leads to Rapture, now ruined and destroyed due to a war created by Atlas, a man who leads a rebellion group against Andrew Ryan, and wants to help you survive as you fight Splicers (genetic mutants created by splicing up on something called ADAM; a substance found at the bottom of the ocean that can be used for a variety of purpose. Medical, entertainment, or even getting powers called Plasmids) and Big Daddies, protecters of the Little Sisters, who hold sea slugs in their stomachs that produce loads of ADAM.The gameplay is fantastic. Bioshock is a FPS with RPG and Survival Horror elements. You can geta total of 6 different guns throughout the game, each of which are good for certain situations. You can also upgrade these guns to make them stronger and better over the course of the game. You can also collect different types of ammo for each gun, usually there's a normal type, a type good for armored foes, and a type good for fleshy foes. Then of course, there's ADAM. ADAM is obtained after killing a Big Daddy, then by making a decision on whether or not to let their Little Sister to live. If they live, you get some ADAM, but for every 3 you rescue, you get rewards. Or, you can harvest them and get a huge amount of ADAM, but no rewards. ADAM can be spent on Plasmids and Tonics. Plasmids are you're alternative to guns, basically giving you special powers over the course of the game. Tonics give you're character direct upgrades, of which have varying degrees of usefulness. The gameplay has so many layaers of depth and strategy, and is still realy good in high-strung intense action moments. And it's just plain fun to shoot bees at a splicer, then set them on fire, and when they jump into water to get rid of the fire, you can eletrocute them and finish them off.Even if the gameplay wasn't good, the story alone is worth the buy. I won't spoil it, nor will I reiterate what I already wrote, but know that the story of Bioshock is not only one of the best, most though-provoking stories there is, but the best part about it is that it could only work as a video game, nothing else, as the story brings up the idea of whether or not the player's choices have an impact, and whether or not the player actually had a choice throughout the whole game. It helps that all the characters in the game are very complex and believable. I could write an entire essay about how amazing the story is, but I won't because I don't feel like wasting you're time. Now, would you kindly buy this freaking game already?			"

												Bioshock I don't even know where to begin the good, the bad, the scary, the funny the impressiveness, the uninspiring.  This game has to be one of the best story’s I have ever played.  I went in not liking the game not wanting to play the game.  And even though it did take me about a month or two of casual gaming to achieve the ending because I did not want to play it.  The game play and story won me over.  This has to be one of the scariest, 80's hack and slash style movie, rolled into a first person shooter.  Now if you have read my other reviews you know I'm not a huge fan FPS's (first person shooters).  I do like to play video games so I play them and above all else I love video games with a fantastic story and this has one.  Bioshock is like the Twilight Zone meets Alfred Hitchcock and they had a baby.  Now I think it took me so long to get into the game because it starts off slow and you are leveling your character getting new ability’s, weapons, and getting the crap scared out of you by the slicers and the enviroment.  It takes you awhile to start to understand this game its set in the 1950's in an underwater city called Rapture.  If you are going to play it the biggest element to the game are the audio diaries.  They give you an inside look into the minds of the citizens of Rapture and explain how the city has evolved into its current state of commotion.  There are some essential lines in the game and one of the best is at the very begin as you ascend to the majestic city.   “I am Andrew Ryan, and I'm here to ask you a question. Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow? 'No!' says the man in Washington, 'It belongs to the poor.' 'No!' says the man in the Vatican, 'It belongs to God.' 'No!' says the man in Moscow, 'It belongs to everyone.' I rejected those answers; instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible. I chose... Rapture...”     This honestly does set the tone for the rest of game.  Now if you are going to play this game beware there are three different endings.  Make up your mind at the begin which way to go kill, save, or do both on the little sisters those three options determine your ending.  The game is 14-20 hours long depending on your play level and style.   Now I can't stress the audio diaries enough they are essential for you to get the whole story out of this phenomenal game.  Just when you think you are like this is it this is the ending nope hold on to your hat.  I think that was a decisive turning occurrence for me to start apprenticing this game and seeing why it has a 96 meta critic score.   Now the downside the game crashed on me a few different times. (Windows 7 user)  So just save often.  The story little slow at first but it picks up.  Wallet has a cap.  Hacking certain machines not set up to well I thought. Bots not the brightest.  Now the last couple I'm nitpicking because honestly this game doesn't have a lot of flaws in my opinion other then being a first person shooter :)  Get it love and play it again and again.			"

												As a spiritual successor to the greatest game that has ever been made and very underrated which is System Shock, I have to say I really enjoyed the game so far...Now into the review! When it comes to the plot here's how it goes. It takes place in year 1960, while travelling in a plane ya had a accident which ya survived in a middle of the sea, yet with a hope ya stumbled a small building with a golden statue at the top with a weird machine inside. After turning it on ya went down to the city build under the sea called Rapture, which fell due to the one man called Andrew Ryan, the owner of this city corrupted by the power created from the strange liquid called ADAM, which was never seen in the surface. Almost all of the people were addicted to it and started killing each other. While giving up hope, one man called Atlas who is against Ryan asks for your help to stop the madness.When it comes to the graphics I must say it still holds up to this day and looks great, though like with Unreal Engine 3 ya might expect a quality change that always happens when ya loaded a game but then changes back to normal. Basically any PC ya own in and after 2007 will run it.Now the gameplay...The most important aspect in every game. It is amazing! While the ammo and weapons may be scarce you also have another arsenal at you disposal....PLASMIDS! At the cost of EVE you can use them to either shoot lightning which can open locked areas, create a fire to melt the blocking ice or even use the telekinesis to stop an incoming rocket flying to your face and redirect it back to the enemy! There are also other Plasmids that does not require EVE and affects your status in combat or other situations. Almost every weapon can use other types of ammunition ranging from armor piercing to the incinerating ones and ya may find Weapon Upgrade stations which you can choose only one upgrade for each weapon so choose wisely! If you are low on something but have some money you can use shopping ventsto buy stuff but if you think you don't have enough money then you can always hack them! Hacking lets you turn any turret to turn against the enemies, lower the price for shops or change the healing station to hurt anyone except you and you do that by doing a minigame which requires you to place pipes in any order to let the cyan goo reach the end without leaking it or get to the damaged ones. Be aware that the more you progress in the game it gets more harder.If you think that you do not understand the plot in overall then you might have missed a lot of Audio Logs. From the Audio Logs you can find more about what was the life in the city and/or even dig more about the owner and his situation.If you liked Fallout's old styled music then you can find em here as well while sharing the newer ones and pretty much fits the game so perfectly. The sounds are also great and the voice acting is quite great.Overall, if you think about getting the game then....Would you kindly buy and play it? It is worth 20 Euro for it!			"

It wasn't impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else.— Andrew RyanBioshock pleasantly surprises with an original style and entourage, idea, excellent level design and beautiful interiors. Graphics and quality of the painters work deserve a special praise. Beautiful visual effects of water and mist, ironic retro-standard agitprop-like wall posters — it's a really great job. All of this stuff was flavored by tasty 'Art Deco sauce' and sweet-tempered soundtrack in the best tradition of the 'golden age' of Chicago jazz.Literally gentle game interface quickly brings up to date. Audio diaries found along the way (which are the main narrative device of the game) complete the plot with important elements and softly introduce players to the basics of the philosophy of Objectivism. A true masterpiece.10/10			"

												A truly fantastic FPS.  The Narrative, told though voice-logs and a 1-way radio, does a great job in maintaining a good distance for the player; A perfect balance is struck between isolation (being forced to fight off hordes of splicers alone) and companionship (hearing a friendly voice motivate you forward.)  As for the gameplay, barring a few personal gripes (there shouldn't ever be a hack that is 100% impossible, solely due to bad RNG), there are very few things to dislike.  The wide selection of plasmids and firearms allows for numerous playstyles and adds a bit of replay value.  I'd personally enjoy it if you could limit your armory to just the weapons you use regularly (too many times did I over-scroll to the chemical thrower when just trying to take a simple picture), but this is in no way a deal-breaker.  Whether you heard about it back in the day and are just getting around to the classics, or recently played Bioshock Infinite and wanted to know what happened, this game is without a doubt worth a play, even if it may appear a bit visually dated.

 The underwater game flowing with of gameplay This is without any doubt one of the better games I have played. For me it has a lot of the aspects i like in a game. It uses a simple fighting mechanic to play and it isnt that hard to get used to. Pros:  It has a creepy/ horror scene. It gives the oppertunity to explore bit by bit. Doesn't use cheap jumpscares to creep you out. Has a really good storyline. If you die, you can get right back from where you died. Has multiple endings. Cons:  If you're into graphics, this is an older game. Can be dark sometimes. Sometimes you really need to use a hint.But afterall this game is a bit older, it does belong in the games you should have played before you die. "

												*Disregard my steam playtime, I played this on the GFWL version almost 7 years ago for dozens of hours. lol*Bioshock is a critique of individualism and atheistic values of society and Ayn Rand's extremely intelligent works, a videogame trope mockery , a art-deco style level desing mixed with 50's-60's aestetic and music with strong FPS mechanics focused on variety and player customization with some slight horror and survival elements.And despite years of age, it manages to be one of the most strong narrative driven FPS that you could spend a penny on.This was the first videogame that truly stuck with me, this brilliant work influenced greatly in the game enthusiast I love being to this day.Nostalgia alone makes this one of my personal favorites, remove that and I'd still say its one of the best games on Steam. A modern classic.			"

												In my opinion this is the best Bioshock game in the entire series. It almost felt like a survial horror. The setting story is one of the best I've ever seen in a video game, It's like a game and a movie combined but it's not too cinematic. The enemy designs are what makes this game so good. The Big Daddies are fun mini bosses to fight and also challenging on higher difficulties and the splicers are crazy as hell. The first few mins of this game creeped me out when I was younger. This is by far the most scariest Bioshock game in the series. Gotta love the bunnymasks the splicers are wearing. I would say fighting Sander Cohen was my favorite part of this game. Just killing Splicers while Waltz of the Flowers is playing just feels so... you cant get that in any other video game! It's so memorable! Final verdict is that this game is one of the best fps ever and the campaign is Halo 1 status good. Gotta love using tommy guns and electric buck shotguns.			"

												This is an entirely new universe you are going to discover and probably the best story telling ever made.Bioshock tells the origins of Rapture created by the Ryan Industries, and ravaged by the ADAM, a liquid that changes people into monsters.Overall, the game is quite repetitive, you only have to help Tenenbaum to save the Little Sisters but the story is really amazing and will get you into it until the end.If you have already played Bioshock 2 and want to know more about the story, take this one !

												This masterpiece is a lesson that should be taught to every game developer involved in the FPS genre. I could save a few compliments and shorten this rather passionate, but humble, homage. But no. When talking about BioShock, one should let the words flow, just like the essence of its beautiful concept flows richly and vividly through every character's line, every thematic poster hanging on a random wall, every bit of Art Deco reconstruction, and every trace of Andrew Ryan's infamous personality.When I first played this game, back in 2009, I couldn't believe my eyes. The compelling and psychologically deep story that I was witnessing should be in a book or something ""narratively more complex"". Back then, with all my ignorance and prejudice towards the potential of videogame storytelling, I hadn't realised what sin I was carrying on my mind. The way I've come to think is: BioShock should've always been what it is: a story-driven, linear first-person shooter that touches the deepest veins of your perceptions on notions of compassion, violence, regret, love, and themes such as mindless obedience, civil disorder, despotic leadership, dystopian lunacy, transhuman monstrosity, and other rather shocking motifs that this game courageously explores. Images of fear and perdition that make us cringe, but also touching scenes of sacrifice and loyalty. Troubled and oftentimes scary characters are all over the place (including the player-character). It's as though journeying deep into the sea brings a progressive loss of sanity and grasp on common sense in virtually all the individuals involved. Coming back to the surface would be their only redemption (cleansing), not only salvation (rescue).On top of that, there is the addictive gameplay, with the clever and concise variety of weapons that respond directly to specific situations and areas, enemies and game frenzy. The plasmid feature dialogues with the game's spiritual ancestor, System Shock, as do most of the dystopian themes here represented. The enemies and their classes also adapt excellently to the progression in the game, making the contention *difficulty vis-à-vis enjoyment* close to perfection.The emblematic setting, and a unique steampunk atmosphere in the depths of the ocean. It's an eschatological drama in videogame form. The oneiric visions of mankind crushed by its own mental abyss.			"

												Bioshock needs to be experienced from zero. Go in as blind as you can and see the fallen paradise of Rapture with your own eyes. The story is top-notch, the atmosphere is incredible, the music, the gameplay - I can't praise them enough. This is something to be experienced first-hand, a page-turner novel in the shape of a game.			"

												I originally played this years ago on Xbox 360 before I'd been exposed to PC gaming. In those days EB Games was oblivious to how exploitable their return policy was. I'd bought Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, took it home and finished it in two hours. Returned it half hour before the store closed and made a quick uninformed decision on a random game called BioShock. I'd not really heard anything about it and judging by the back cover it seemed like somewhat a first-person horror game.And over the next 12 eye bleeding hours that ensued, my fragile fourteen year old mind was exposed to themes of Objectivism, altruism, communism, horrific violence at the hands of little girls, superb voice acting and world building that rivals anything you've ever seen or read.9 or 8 years later, the Remastered editions are released. They are absolute trash. They crash constantly, the audio is messed up, can't change keybindings and aesthetically they're not all that much better. Do not waste your time with the remasters.The original still looks good. Some .ini file tinkering before making it playable again but I finished it again in two play sessions largely uninterrupted. Everything narratively holds up. Andrew Ryan, Atlas and Tene are voice acted so brilliantly. The game has hardly any cut scenes, which I wish was a trend BioShock set. Lacking cut scenes may seem like a inconsequential point of praise but having the story build and play out directly as you play, creates an immersion factor hardly achieved by video games period. The themes posited by Ken Levine are almost still as profound as the first time I played it. Even knowing how the story plays out, I found myself evaluating every side to the conflicts and finding common ground with even the worst characters. Not that I find myself affectionate toward Ayn Rand and her philosphy but it's thematically something hardly explored in media at all, let alone a video game.Mechanically and gameplay wise everything is still serviceable. I will say the gunplay lacks any impact and I feel like some weapons, especially the machine gun are hardly useful before acquiring upgrades. Largely many of the plasmids i found either uninteresting or not really useful. Telekiness seems to work combat wise for a scripted event but outside of that it's not worth much more than to access items outside your reach. Swarm seems completely usless as many enemies seem to continue on unaffected. And many others I found uninteresting or not at all worth swapping out the shock plasmid for.In terms of the tonics, they seem to provide much more variety and possible ways of playing. Although why you wouldn't go every tonic that makes hacking easier is beyond me. Hacking has no right to be a god damn newspaper puzzle. I guess it's cool they made it more engaging than the typical RPG hacking or lock picking but for gods sake, it can be laborous. Thankfully acquiring auto-hack tools seems to quite easy to come by but the few hacks I had to do manually, I can't imagine doing all of them that way.In terms of minor grips, having you edit .ini files to remedy mouse acceleration and also the fact the game crashes when some key bindings have been changed? This is surely something could be easily fixed with a patch and yet these are problems that persist into the Remasters (making them even more undesirable). The crosshairs and big gold objective marker make the UI ugly and if I'm correct I believe you can at least turn off the objective marker.A major gripe, there's an escort section at the end of the game. An escort section on it's own is bad enough. I wish the industry would do away with them but the fact the AI I was escorting became bugged out and would not move on despite me achieving the objectives. I had to let her die and restart. I remember this happening other times played BioShock years ago, having googled the problem it seems to be a random issue that doesn't affect everyone - just my luck, I guess. A man chooses. A slave obeys.And when it comes down to buying and playing this game, it's not even a choice at all. Play BioShock, right now. Would you kindly?			"

												BioShock is a great classic.Even now, the game can still be considered a good game; it was ahead of its time (technological issues set aside).The setting is probably what made Bioshock what it is now... 2K did REALLY well on that, putting an FPS game in a scary atmosphere. The world feels scary, even being as powerful as you are.But really, Bioshock really is a unique game. It provides an experience like no any other. The story is great and the gameplay still holds up pretty well for a game made in 2007.Sure, there are some issues but that is expected with a game this old. Controls might take some time to get used to; after a while, the game plays just fine.BioShock is one of those games that you just HAVE to have played in your life, above other games.			"

												BioShock is often lauded as one of the pinnacles of FPS/RPGs as well as one of the finest video-game narratives. Although the game is essentially a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, the consensus from journalists and consumers alike is that it's a classic.However, with all that being said, it's interesting how both its narrative and gameplay has not aged as well after a decade, and how fans probably have misremembered its flaws. Don't misunderstand this as some hipster review; BS is a good game. Rapture is one of the most well-polished atmospheres ever made, the level design is very good in spite of its linearity, and its core gameplay is tolerable at best.The problem is none of these qualities elevates the game into greatness nor to ignore its many flaws. Even worse, these problems that plague the first game are only dwelled upon in later games when they originated here.Audio, FOV and Other PC Port IssuesBefore we talk about the game, I do want to mention the PC version. This port is rather terrible; however, it can be fixed. Mostly.

What I don't think can be fixed is any nausea you may feel if you turn up the mouse-sensitivity. I don't know whether it's the art-style, the FOV (I doubt it as I play the game with 90) or some mouse acceleration but I cannot play at anything higher than four (out of ten.) Unfortunately, while some of these issuesed are addressed, the Remastered does not fix everything: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/recommended/409710""Smile for the Camera!""BioShock suffers from two major faults: It lacks the dual-wielding system where you have Plasmids in one-hand and your gun in the other. The other mistake is the unnecessary fluff that takes away from the survival horror experience.The former can be excused for being the first in the series; however, the latter is something that cannot be easily overlooked, namely the crafting system and camera ""research"" system. Both of these inclusions are utterly worthless except when you get less ammo and tougher enemies.However, if you use the camera ASAP you can play two-thirds of the game without it. A better idea would be to throw away the camera and opted for better resource management and fixed enemy damage values. The game would be a better FPS for it, and it would be more honest.Jack of All TradesAlthough this question is more often one of semantics, I think it'll illustrate a point: In what way is BS an RPG other than streamlining the RPG-mechanics from its predecessor? SS2 focused on specializing builds around weapon types, PSI-onic abilities and/or attributes in other skills. You had the ability to shape your character from the introduction, and throughout the game you could change it to suit your playstyle.BS strips all the complexities away with its plasmids and gene-modifications. You will get all the weapons every single playthrough, and the gene-mods are in specialized categories that discourage any freeform experimentation. You're a Jack of all trades; master of all, specialist of none. The system itself is not bad but it is a clear sign of streamlining. With that being said, is BS's system truly an RPG or is it something more along the lines of the Far Cry's perks system? Content is still gated by placing plasmids and mods in specific locations, but the same result is the same stilted growth of your capabilities. It's one of many instances where I have to wonder how influential BS has been on modern games (for better and for worse).The More Things Stay the Same... The More Is ForgottenBS's role in influencing games is undeniable, but what is more interesting is what has been forgotten as to why these aspects are so enrapturing. For starters, the usage of audio-logs. Recorded messages are now the butt-of-the-joke, but their inclusion here was to keep the horror elements without littering NPCs or to bore the player from the lack of interactions. More importantly, they told the player of what cannot be gleamed from the environments as they provide a contrast to what the player finds. They provided something for your imagination to use.Another aspect that holds up is its environmental storytelling. For example, if you were to compare this game to Fallout 3/NV the biggest difference is how BioShock conveys more with less clutter. The developers were able to focus more so on the visual input, and let the finer details (visual or the audio) fill in the rest. And without the simple distractions like a constant UI notification for junk, the player focuses more on the surroundings. Now are these aspects perfect? God no. BS (and SS) is the originator of the trope of hiding key-codes and/or recording information at the worst times like a Lovecraft protagonist. And compared to F3/NV, BS has tighter and more sensible level-design that lends itself to having the time to add more details. However, it's the purpose and execution behind these storytelling methods that I think is forgotten about why they work so well, and when you dwell further on what the game set out to do you find more of its flaws more obvious now than back then.Would You Kindly Listen? (Spoilers)In spite of wanting to keep spoilers to a minimum, I do want to criticize the narrative because that is what everyone remembers BS most fondly of. No matter how many times I replay this game I can't tell you what the game is really about. BS tries its damnedest to provide an objective, apolitical story about a free-market city freed from conventions of morals and politics. The only problem is that it never commits to the idea of, ""Unrestrained societies are possibly bad!"", and instead gets jumbled up in its ""family"" nonsense and blatantly good/evil choice which comes across as being pretentious. (Sound familiar?)It could be argued that Andrew Ryan was right all along—the city fell to parasites like Fontaine—and he was the more upstanding character as he valued merits alone. However, in contrast, the characters like Dr. Steinman and Cohen show that merit is not satisfying enough. Usually I'd be fine with this vagueness of a message, but with the forced good/bad-ending to the game it hampers any middle-ground to be found.It also doesn't help that gameplay can clash with the narrative. For example, why can you leave money on security devices to ""hack"" machines? (How does that work?) Why does Andrew Ryan let his enemies buy bullets to fight him? Is he that committed to his free-market values?  Or, for less pedantic questions, why is the WYK effect on Jack inconsistent? He doesn't appear to remember being ""activated"" (if he didn't forget it after the plane-crash), and he doesn't respond to the command the same way (ex. when you are told to get the radio and when you are forced to lower your weapon). If it was a simple mental suggestion, then why (when he obviously knows) does he not react with speaking like how he talks at the beginning? (Why is he mute anyway?)The obvious answer to these questions is that the developers were too busy making a good game, and that's perfectly fine. BioShock is a great game for what it tried to do, but it's by no means a masterpiece of storytelling or gameplay.Is a Man Not Entitled To His Opinion?I'm under no dellusion that the remaster will address all these narrative issues. I expect the gunplay to be better and for a better performance like Infinite. What I wanted to share is when you return to Rapture to relive the glory days under the sea it won't be same as what you remembered. Games have come a long way from BioShock in both gameplay and narrative, and the only way we get better is to learn where the mistakes were made behind us.			"

												It is a very good game, with very good graphics and an amazing story. It is a game, which we all gamers dream of: Gameplay and graphics are both amazing.+For a game that was made 8 years ago, the graphics are amazing.+The story is very interesting and never gets boring. You always want to keep playing to learn what's going on.+There are different types of weapons, which you can upgrade at special stations. You can only find them if you search enough.+There is a variety of upgrades, which we can apply to our body and help us in different situations.+Your choices in the game effects the end, which is amazingly satistyfing.+The story, have I mentioned the story?-In Germany the game is only sold in German low violence version. I don't know, if there was something important that was cut off or only the gore was reduced but I would like to play the normal version.-There are sometimes desynchronisations in the subtitles.That is all I have to say. I recommend the game with all my heart. It is a game, which every gamer should have played. Buy it, Buy it, NOW!			"

												I had played Bioshock about a year after it had released initially, but stopped about half-way through.  A few years ago I restarted the game with the intent of finishing it, but managed to get about 2/3rds in before dropping out again.  I finally replayed this game in the year of our lord 2015, and for once finished it.  Let me get this out of the way up top: The game is 100% worth playing (or even replaying).Good Stuff:-The setting is super original: an underwater laissez faire utopia filled with the best and brightest, ripped apart by civil war due in part to the discovery of a gene altering substance.-Combat is pretty good.  Tons of guns (that you can carry all at once!) and a variety of magic powers called ""Plasmids"" that vary from shooting fireballs to hacking turrets.-Passive buffs via tonics that you purchase/find and equip allow you to personalize your playstyle somewhat.-Varried enemy design, with thoughts taken into enemy placement in the level itself to provide interesting fights.-Great level design, from the layout to the art design.  Levels are open with multiple branches off the main 'hub' of each level that are typically explored throughout the level via progression towards your goal.  Although there is some backtracking, enemies are usually placed in a way that makes fights fun and interesting.-Water and particle effects are still pretty good.-Audio design is great, from the sounds of water puddling in hallways to the ambient effects your plasmids make when you equip them.  All the work goes into create a stellar atmosphere that lets you buy into the world.Bad Stuff:-The first 2/3rds of the game are a bit predictable in terms of how the game delays your progress narratively. -The last act of the game is a bit more linear than the first 2/3rds, and the final fight really stinks.-Some people think the audio journals are an overused trope, but I personally liked them for how they build the backstory.-Switching between your gun and plasmid is annoying at first, but you'll get used to it with practice.-The hacking minigame got boring for me about 1/3rd through the game, but some people might like it.-Most of the textures have this shiny look to them that makes them look like plastic.Ugly Stuff:-Be prepaired to work a bit to get this game running smoothly. I had a ton of crashes before turning off the steam-overlay and forcing the game to run in DX9 before it ran smoothly.  There are a ton of steam guides to help you fix that stuff up though.-Audio can hitch and cut-out during combat when too many sounds are playing at once.  I couldn't figure out how to fix this one, but luckily no dialogue is cut out.-Physics calculations in the game are played at 30 fps, making them stand out a bit on modern machines.-Options menu is a bit dated and you'll have to do some INI editing to adjust things like FOV and proper sensitivity. Verdict:Bioshock is still worth revisiting, if just for the story and gameplay alone.  It's a decently sized game and took me around 12 hours to beat, with the only downsides being that the final act is a bit lackluster and that the game looks dated and might take some playing around to get it to run without crashing.  But you're rewarded with a good shooter with a fantastic story and world that makes you interested to find out more every step of the way.Tip: You probably want to up the difficulty, the mid game and onwards is pretty trivial on medium difficulty.

Welcome to RaptureBioShock is one of those games that any self-proclaimed gamer needs to have in their inventory. Yes, it is dated at this point, but man is it still a fantastic game. If you can't handle the older graphics, don't fret, BioShock Remastered just came out.Positive:- Extremely atmospheric - you will be sitting on the edge of your seat for the majority of the game- Fantastic original story - I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't played BioShock yet, but it is truly amazing.- Do things YOUR way. Want to go in shooting? Fire away. Want to be stealthy? Sneak away. Want to hack things? No problemo. There are so many ways to handle each situation.- Exploring is rewarding. More ammo, health packs, crafting items, you name it. Also find audio diaries to get diverse insights into Raputure's history.- Difficulty is just right. Yes you will get stronger as you progress, but you will be punished if you make poor choices.- I still want to play this although I have finished it 3 times.Negative:- Graphically the game looks a little old- It is a shame that you cannot equip a plasmid and weapon at the same time - either one or the other (this was fixed in BioShock 2)- The hacking system is laborious and dull (but still worth doing)- If you're easily frightened you will need some clean underwear on the sideConclusion:There really is no reason for you not to give BioShock a try, especially now that a remastered version is out. I guarantee you will not regret playing it. Like Portal, BioShock is an extremely rewarding and fulfilling experience.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Bioshock is interactive art in every sense of the word. From its breathtaking art deco scenery to it's disturbing, deep story, Bioshock succeeds where countless others have failed. It transcends gaming, crafting an ethereal existence on another plane. Part shooter, part horror, part social commentary, all masterpiece.Games like this come around only so many times a year, they need to be experienced by everyone, be it on the Xbox 360 or the PC. A game that is for all intents and purposes, perfect, is a remarkable achievement. Bioshock will take you on an underwater thrill ride that will leave you breathless, shaking and satisfied in a curious, perhaps even morbid way. It forces you to really think about the events and people, even long after you've beaten the game. And any game capable of such a feat is a must-buy in my opinion.			"

Really original setting, and engaging atmosphere.I enjoyed playing it on Hard without using any Vita-Chambers, and even if I find the combat not satisfying enough at times, it deserves the ""thinker's fps"" definition, thanks to all the ways it offers to deal with your enemies.One really good thing about this game is that it continues to add new mechanics regularly as you go on, preventing it from becoming boring.Everyone should play this.

												A brilliant game accurately summed up as ""Atlas Shrugged, underwater"". However, there is far more to it than that. This game doesn't just portray a character with Ayn Rand's philosophy, but also comments on that philosophy and takes it to its logical conclusion, as a society based upon ethical egoism, or basically selfishness, is ultimately self-destructive and cannot survive.The shooting is fun, the plasmids are great, the setting and graphics are simply gorgeous, and the plot is nothing short of unforgettable. I'm only sorry that I'd had the big reveal spoiled for me before I could play this marvellous game.			"

												This game is, without a doubt, one of my favorites. Here, have a list of pros and cons that you are probably gonna skip over. Pros -Good graphics-Fun gameplay -Immersive and spooky atmosphere-Unique combat system (Actually, I know nothing about the combat system since I went through about 3/4 of the game killing everything with a wrench)-You can finally kill drug addicts with wrenches without consequence-Unique enemies, which have their own strengths and weaknesses (None of which I knew. Except that all would die to my wrench)-Fun weapons (like the wrench)-Superpowers (Again, I didn't touch those. The wrench was good enough for me)-Can either brutally murder or gently caress small children (girls) for drugs- The final boss looks like the Missing Link from Monsters vs Aliens  Cons -Can only play 3/4 of the game using the wrench before actual strategy and skill is needed-The only thing the wrench couldn't help with was hacking, which ripped you from the heat of the moment so you could help get the Mountain Dew Voltage from point A to point B-Ghosts-Went to a strip club and there was only one stripper, and she was dead on a bed in the back room-The girls you can caress are protected by large reverse astronauts that can and will drill anyone that tries to get too close-The Big Daddies also don't die to the wrench-Too much waterOverall, this game is easily a  perfect  5/7I would leave a link to my ♥♥♥♥ youtube channel so you can see the full review, but I know no one's going to watch it.Now, would you kindly stop reading my review and buy the damn game already?

												Bioshock, Little Sisters and Rapture...You're thinking of these terms when someone mentions the game. It's probably one of the best games I've ever played. You have a story line that can be expanded with tape recorders or you follow the normal one. Much can't be sayed about the story without a spoiler BUT I can say it's suprising and the end is not what you're expecting ;)You can explore REALLY, really big levels with secrets, many enemies and loot. They are beautiful designed and the view out of rapture....Deep in the sea on the ground with fishes swimming about your head and glowing plants. Do I need to say more?The combat system is..well you get used to it but at the beginning it's confusing. They are so many ways to use weapons or Plasmids (magic  abilities) so everyone can probably find an own system to fight against the thousands of splicers and big daddys.The thing I liked very much was that you choose the end.So tell me will it be good or evil XD???PLAY it, BUY IT it's absolutely worth and it's INCREDIBLE, AWESOME and BEAUTIFUL! <3			"

												Would you kindly?It's Bioshock, what else do I need to say? It's crazy, it's smart, it's intense! The story is amazingly detailed and catching. You play as a man named Jack, who lands in the middle of the ocean, next to a lighthouse after a plane crash. Upon entering it, he gets taken into the underwater-city of Rapture, built by the millionaire Andrew Ryan. After the civil war, the city is not under control of sane people or Ryan himself, but ruled by crazy lunatics and geneticly mutated citizens of Rapture. Luckily you are helped by a man named Atlas, who gives you calls to tell you where to go next and what to do.In the game, you have an arsenal of weapons and power at your disposal. From wrenches, over shotguns and crossbows, to syringes filled with fluids that give you the abilities to shoot fire or lightning from your fingertips, use telekenesis and take control of other peoples bodies. (Just be careful with those Big Daddys!) These so called 'Plasmids' are what make Bioshock a unique shooter with an amazing story and characters, that catch you from start to finish.I highly recommend any Bioshock game to everyone who likes non-linear shooters, which are different from the rest.9/10			"

												A Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe, where you have to unlock the mysteries of a city at the bottom of the ocean. I have to admit, I sort of fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insame. I would recommend not only this game, but the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.			"

Proceed at your own risk.Some games, as with cooking, follow a recipe. The System Shock series prepared a great dish; BioShock took that formula, substituted a few ingredients, and presented a game worthy of being a System Shock successor. BioShock is not only visually appealing, is jam-packed with sweat drenched palms on the pants audio, but also with a great story that unfolds as you frantically meander throughout Rapture. Being violently thrown into the game, you are left with no choice other than to go down the rabbit hole, to enter this submerged version of Wonderland; a place that is as dangerous as it is curious. You are informally greeted by a denizen of Rapture, although they do not appear to be a friendly Welcome Wagon. Much like SS2, you are immediately put on the offensive, and will remain that way for the rest of the game.The inhabitants of Rapture are fighting a guerilla war. They know the terrain, have the weapons, and their leaders will stop at nothing to win. You will pick up weapons and skills along the way that will prepare you for the fight ahead. Being that Rapture is located many leagues under the sea, there will be no fresh supplies, no reinforcements, you'll be lucky to even find a way out of this madhouse. You have to learn to fight fire with fire, in some cases quite literally.Stand by for a Public Service Announcement...""What are you doing, Billy?""""What does it look like Sam?

With genetic modifications, beauty is no longer a goal or even a virtue, it is a moral obligation.Are you repulsed by your own reflection in the mirror? Ladies, are you tired of watching all of the other girls get the fella? Gents, are you sick of seeing the girls swoon for the hunk to your side? Nose too bulbous, lips too thin, brow too prominent? Stop in TODAY to Dr Steinman's Aesthetic Ideals to see what the power of ADAM can do for you.* Stop being the wallflower and become the life of the party.*Individual results may vary. Please verify mental integrity of your surgeon prior to undergoing any surgical procedure. Dr Steinman's Aesthetic Ideals bears no liability for loss of life, limb, appearance, or sanity. Proceed at your own risk.Some games, as with cooking, follow a recipe. The System Shock series prepared a great dish; BioShock took that formula, substituted a few ingredients, and presented a game worthy of being a System Shock successor. BioShock is not only visually appealing, is jam-packed with sweat drenched palms on the pants audio, but also with a great story that unfolds as you frantically meander throughout Rapture. Being violently thrown into the game, you are left with no choice other than to go down the rabbit hole, to enter this submerged version of Wonderland; a place that is as dangerous as it is curious. You are informally greeted by a denizen of Rapture, although they do not appear to be a friendly Welcome Wagon. Much like SS2, you are immediately put on the offensive, and will remain that way for the rest of the game.The inhabitants of Rapture are fighting a guerilla war. They know the terrain, have the weapons, and their leaders will stop at nothing to win. You will pick up weapons and skills along the way that will prepare you for the fight ahead. Being that Rapture is located many leagues under the sea, there will be no fresh supplies, no reinforcements, you'll be lucky to even find a way out of this madhouse. You have to learn to fight fire with fire, in some cases quite literally.Stand by for a Public Service Announcement...""What are you doing, Billy?""""What does it look like Sam?

 ""It was not impossible to build Rapture at the bottom of the sea. It was impossible to build it anywhere else!""  says  Andrew Ryan . He knows what men capable of, after seeing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He believes that world will go into nuclear war and he wanted to build a city away from the clutching hand of the  ""Parasites"" . So, the construction of Rapture began. A city where the artist would not fear the censor. Where the scientist would not be bound by petty morality. Where the great would not be constrained by the small.      A man saw Ryan's utopian society as the perfect opportunity for a long but big-payoff con. Frank Fontaine, he knew what happened with utopias. When this undersea utopia fell apart, he wanted to be there, with a whole society to feast on.    Fontaine raised with the invention of plazmids which are special serums made from processed ADAM which allows genetic mutation , giving the user what some may call “super powers”. Plasmids are powerful, but excessive use of them leads to physical and mental addiction and instability. This was a major factor in the eventual downfall of Rapture society. But ofcourse it wasn’t the only reason, Ryan did lot of mistakes during that time. As he says; “The city... it is collapsing before my... have I become so convinced by my own beliefs that I have stopped seeing the truth? Perhaps”.     And at this point, our game starts. Incredible story specially made for a video game. Amazing voice acting. Combat might get a bit repetetive after some point but not a major issue. Graphics is still acceptable for a game which has been released 9 years ago.     Like Andrew Ryan says; ""A man chooses a slave obeys"". So, would you kindly choose to play this game?			"

A Crack In Rapture  TL;DR Bioshock is an FPS with one of the greatest stories in video game history. Explore the dark and beautiful submerged environments and find the cities mutated citizens. Uncover the dark history of a once great Utopia ,discover who you are and why you have ended up in Rapture. Using inventive special abilities unlock secrets and blow through areas. Using a large arsenal of weapons blow through all the enemies and traps that have been laid out for youFollow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros 
Fantastic writingBeesGorgeous EnvironmentsGreat lorelarge arsenal of customizable weapons Cons Enemies are sponges to damageGame unnecessarily drags onFinal boss isn’t difficult---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayWith your trusty wrench and pockets filled with guns you have fun shooting waves of enemies and turrets through the levels, well at least for the first few levels, enemies just become damage sponges even after you get the camera and get the max rank for a basic enemy you’ll find that they still take multiple headshots without a worry, it makes sense for the big daddy there the tanky sorta-enemies of each level but the not the ones you fight so many of. Exploring the areas will find you some secret loot so I would recommend looking through each level because it’s nothing but a plus. The special abilities you are given can be quite entertaining and having swarms of bees at your disposal is something that should be feared by many. StoryThe story is a masterpiece and holds the game together no matter who you are or what you think of the gameplay. You are gripped throughout the entire game and having the twist be something that makes you think on what happened throughout the game is so mind blowingly good. You can see the history of the game as you explore the levels and see the destruction that was wrought and the madness that consumed the world. Each type of enemy has their own lore on how they have been mutated in such a way Characters While rarely seeing any characters that aren’t mutated each npcs dark past is slowly revealed throughout the game which makes you pity them more than anything while the little sisters and big daddies are the poster faces they don’t have a whole lot of backstory. The enemies have some interesting dialogue when there not shouting about murdering you. Art/Graphics With an Underwater utopia to explore you will find many beautiful visuals, you feel the cold steel interiors crushing you with pressure while being chased. The remastered version of the game makes the game look so much more modern with its updated textures. The steampunk designs give the look of a 1930s theme. The lighting in the cramped environments give a true idea of a maddened utopia.Bonus Notes The remastered version of the game doesn’t really add much, as the classic game holds up so well.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

												Thanks 40sw4rm for giving me this game!I usually do a playthrough of a game before I rate it. Usually, if I don't it's either because I love the game so much it's necessary for me to review it, or I dislike the game. Because unless they're patient (Which I am not) they have completed a playthrough and then put a negative review down. In this case, I chose the former. You've heard of the game. Gotten many nominations for best game of last generation. Obviously, I wouldn't consider it the best game of last gen (Mass Effect 2 and Skyrim. 'Nuff said) but it's quite amazing. I couldn't resist and had to review this now. I already know what happens next anyway. :/GraphicsThe graphics are impressive for a nearly 7 year old game. They still look beautiful, and when I take screenshots, they look great compared to other games. And because atmosphere is considered part of the ""graphics"" section of my reviews, I have reasons to add on. Bioshock is partially horror, but more of a story rich shooter. I won't talk about gameplay or story yet. The atmosphere is perfect. The whole time I've been playing, I thought, ""Please get me to a nice place, please get me to a nice place..."" and then I realize Splicers and Big Daddies are swarming the whole place. The game has an uncomfortable atmosphere, but it's quite amazing.GameplayThe game is a first person shooter. The style is similar to Valve's source engine games, get a few weapons, use scroll to get them, and you can't aim down the sights. Since I've played 400 hours on TF2, I'm used to the controls. Even if I didn't play TF2, I would've dealt with the controls. You can switch between weapons and plasmids, which are special powers run with EVE. It's used for puzzles on occasion, but mostly it's used to weaken the enemy significantly so you can go in for the final blow. The game so far is relatively balanced, none of the enemies really are intimidating until you encounter the Big Daddy. They're intimidating and will stop at nothing to kill you if you touch it or the Little Sister it protects. They're terrifying and monsterous. They also in a way decide your ending. They're probably the most difficult enemies in the game, excluding the final boss. You make decisions and decide Little Sisters' fates. You can rescue them for a good ending or harvest their ADAM and become stronger. One problem I have with the game, though is that it feels linear and it ruins the game a little bit, because I'd love to explore Rapture some more. Overall, the gameplay is pretty solid, along with some quick puzzles and decisions that affect the end of the game, it does not disappoint.StoryThe story is absolutely amazing, but there's a huge event towards the end of the game. Would you kindly make sure I don't go out of hand with this next short overview of what happens? Your name is Jack. The year is 1960. Your plane crashed near a mysterious lighthouse. When you enter, you discover a machine. When you go in and pull the switch, you realize that you're in an underwater city ruled by ""madman"" Andrew Ryan called Rapture. It was corrupted by ADAM, which is a drug that makes people insane. A man named Atlas helps you and started the catchphrase ""Would you kindly..."" which became one of the biggest quotes in video game history. And let me warn you, once you get to ""it"" (Bioshock fans know what I mean) then your mind will be blown. Bioshock's story is one of the best, darkest, stories that ever appeared in the gaming world.AudioThe audio is probably the first weak point of the game, unfortunately. The voice actors did an average job with their roles, but th music fits in nicely. I would say Andrew Ryan had the best voice. He sounded terrifying, influential, and takes the role of the villain well. Sometimes, however, the voice actors seemed careless or it had the microphone sound, like the person was farther away. Unfortunately, it's not all that great, despite Bioshock being an amazing game.ReplayabilityThe worst part of the game is the replaybility, but it's not really supposed to have strong replayability, seeing how linear Bioshock already is. There's two endings, you could play for both, but usually people just play one time and be done with it. Either way, Bioshock is still an unforgettable game.VerdictIn the end, with some pretty serious flaws like it being linear and the average voice acting.  However, based off of what I've seen so far, BIoshock is one amazing game and one you don't want to miss, horror fan or not. I highly recommend the game and can't wait to beat it. Now, would you kindly buy this game?Graphics- 9/10Gameplay- 9/10Story- 9.5/10Audio- 5.5/10Replayability- 4.5/10.:8.9/10:.+Good gameplay+Amazing story+Outstanding visuals+Interesting weapon combos+Amazing quotes and plot twist+Intense Big Daddy battles-Linear-Average voice acting-Little replayability			"

												For people experiencing sound stuttering issues and cannot enable EAX (WINDOWS 10 USERS) , here's a possible quick solution: 1.) Download ""openal"" (google ""openal download"") and install it.2.) Go to windows/system32 map and copy ""wrap_oal.dll"" to game executable location (E.g.: C:/steam/steamapps/common/bioshock) . 3.) Rename ""wrap_oal"" to ""openal32"". After that you can enable EAX in audio options and hopefully that'll fix sound issues for you.			"

												A truly unique experience with fun combat and great narrative. The game's opening sequence is one of the most memorable and immerses you into the world right from the start. The narrative is mainly driven by audio diaries that the player picks up, so there is a lot of exploration involved if you want to learn story of Rapture. Collecting these is optional, but I would definitely recommend taking the time to explore the environment and collecting these audio diaries for a more satisfying story experience.The combat in the game has good variety because of the many different plasmids (essentially superpowers) you unlock throughout the game. The variety in the combat can also be attributed to the diversity in weapons and the different Gene Tonics (powerups) that the player can equip. (The weapons  can be accessed by the number keys/scroll wheel or by the weapon/plasmid menu, so there isn't any swapping/equipping weapons in and out.) My only gripes with the game are the hacking, which can get extremely frustrating towards the end of the game due to RNG, and the gameplay involving the research camera. The research camera felt like unecessary work and was just overall annoying. I would definitely recommend this game if you want a unique FPS with a great story and have the desire/patience to explore the levels of the game. I would not recommend this game if you do not have the patience to explore or if you want a fast-paced FPS. P.S. Play this version instead of the Remastered. Just finished a playthrough of the Remastered and it definitely is not worth it due to the bugs and the ridiculous amount of random crashes. (I am running an i5-6600K and a GTX 1060)			"

One of my very favorite games...Bioshock.This is one of those games that's an experience. The second i started the game i couldn't stop playing it, I marathoned the whole thing till finished and i had played it on the xbox too. Everything i'm saying is my opinion of course, but i truly believe everyone should experience Bioshock at some point and jouney through Rapture and witness this masterpiece, you can't relive the first play through again. So, would you Kindly hear me out?So going into Bioshock my tastes suit this game perfectly, everything about this game is brilliant. I loved everything about it. the very detailed and well written story, the lore, the atmosphere, the city of Rapture itself, the characters, gameplay, and of course the MUSIC!The Score for bioshock is perhaps one of the best soundtracks i've ever heard. It suits the game so much and helps tell the story, it's beautiful, lonely, and haunting, just like the game's atmosphere and story. The sheer tension before a battle where a big daddy and some splicers could be around the corner while a lonley cello or violin solo tugs at your soul just helps complete this masterpiece, it's absolutely breathtaking. Another thing to mention in the subject of music is 40's era music on radios while you explore Rapture, which older music and early jazz i just so happen to love. like this ink spots for example. I think this is a very nice, wonderful touch to, again, capture the atmosphere of this city which is like a character itself. Another addition I love is the song ""Beyond the Sea"" as it occurs in the beginning a very nice touch in deed considering Rapture is underwater. One touch i love is the Fonts! It gives me so much nostalgia because its like the same font used in Batman the Animated series! one of my all time favorite shows. I believe the font is called Plaza, i love it alot it's co classy and has a retro 40's look to it, very nice. I love all of the small details like story telling through items or locations in the game, you don't always need words or dialogue to tell great stories.With the release of the remaster, it seems slightly improved look wise, although i don't know about performance wise i haven't played the remaster enough to see. with the combat Bioshock 2 improved a couple of things in combat like using your weapon and plasmid at the same time was one improvment for example. one thing I always hated was this awful mouse acceleration, it was so annoying, thats one of the only negatives.Depending on your actions you'll get an ending based on what your choices in the game were. NO SPOILERS here, but i will say that I really loved the ending, I usually don't cry that much at the end of games (depending on the game), but the ending made me cry... alot, a happy cry though. This will conclude the review, sorry if it was really long and rambly, but it gets to the point where a game is such a masterpiece, so breathtaking on an emotional level, that i think it's no longer a game... it's a priceless work of Art. Games in General are Art.Thanks for reading my review i Strongly recommend everyone experience this Masterpiece of a game. a true Gem that's unique and different to most shootersI rank it 10/10 Big Boy Review scoreThanks			"

												This is the first time I have played the first Bioshock and I have to say it amazed me.The world, the story and the gameplay is really something special. The story itself takes place in Rapture. This is an Atlantis-like steampunk world where a disaster has happened. You go down into Rapture and have to figure things out to help the people down there, but as you play you will come to understand the character you are playing as and the world around you.At first it will comes across as 'do this', 'do that' but you will come to understand the meaning behind all of it. The story for the most part is told through voice recordings (So no 60 minute long cutscenes).You also find old voice messages left by people before they died, that tell you more about the backstory of the world. The further I got into the game, the more interesting it became to me and after I had completed the game I was searching the internet to find out more about Rapture.The gameplay is fun, the weapons feel nice to use, but occasionally I felt that my character moved too slowly. I played the game on medium difficulty and still found the combat challenging enough. I would recommend that if you play on this difficulty to spam E on every searchable container to get ammo, health, cash etc.This is because medium can become boring as you often don't have enough ammo and keep having to respawn at Vita Chambers.Due to these Vita Chambers, I sometimes got the feeling I was playing a multiplayer game. Because when I died I would just respawn and have to run back to where the enemies were. So death feels like it has little consequence.Many people complain about the amount of hacking you have to do if you don't want to be shredded instantly by the turrets.At first I didn't really have any problems with it and hacked every object that could be hacked, but as I progressed through the game I got really tired of it.As well as guns the game also has Plasmids, which are special powers that you can perform with your characters left hand.These Plasmids, like your guns, can be upgraded.The RPG elements in this game really makes you consider which items should be taken with you and which should be left behind.The world has this great Atlantis vibe. Everything in the world of Rapture is enclosed, which helps the game to achieve no pop-in and have great looking environments. These still look great after all this time because of the attention to detail, time and effort put in to them. You only see some problems when you get too close to certain textures. Because of the narrowness of the environments and the use of audio, you get this creepy haunted house feeling.A feeling that around every corner something strange could happen.I only wish that the game had given us more open environments and that the watery world outside of Rapture was more interesting to look at.The A.I. makes good use of its environment. For example, when they are low on health they will run to a nearby healing machine, or if they are on fire they will jump into water to extinguish themselves.The enemies are well realised with great acrobatic animations and sophisticated A.I. The only things that feel clunky to me are the enemy death animations and how the physics objects react.Like, when you hit an object with your wrench, it flies away jerkily through the air, as if you are viewing it at 10 FPS.Note: I would recommend saving every time before alt/shift + tabbing. The game sometimes crashed, when I did that. ( windows 7 64bit )Final thoughts:This was my first time playing through the original Bioshock and it is amazing.There is really alot of creativity and care put into this AAA game that you don't often see.Even if you own Bioshock 2 or Bioshock:Infinite (Infinite has nothing to do with Bioshock 1 and 2) I would still recommend playing it because of the story and how well the game has aged.

												My favorite game from the 360/PS3 era.  When this came out it was a breath of fresh air in art direction and pacing.  The plot is amazing, including one of the best reveals in gaming when you meet Mr. Andrew Ryan.  You can explore a glorious underwater city that has gone from paradise to madness through the in game characters you meet and the audio journals you collect.  There are some real standout characters both from physical design and voice acting standpoints.  Who doesn't remember Sander Cohen after they play this game once!  The graphics still hold up today (just finished a playthrough 1/9/2014) with both the characters and backgrounds having great detail and art.  Enemies variation is good in the beginning, but repeat a little to often near the end, just as most shooters do.  Of course, the game has the iconic big daddy fights that are a lot of fun and a real challenge on hard difficulty.        I don't think the actual shooting is anything too special,  You get pretty standard weapon choices (Pistol, machine gun, shotgun, rocket launcher, yawn, zzzzz)  but you do get a lot of cool spell type abilities called Plasmids and get to upgrade each weapon and Plasmid twice.  There are multiple ammo types for each gun as well as hackable enemies, so for what the shooting lacks in weight and badass weaponry it makes up for in sheer variety.  You can literally not play this game the same way twice.   Be warned the graphics always seemed a little more glitchy on PC than it did on my dearly departed XBOX.  I've had occasional frame rate jumps and the electric chemical thrower would cause graphical glitches on my pair of playthroughs on PC.  Check the forums as this game can be a real pain to get working on your modern OS.    The game gets my highest recommendation.  You will see this for $5.00 every once in a while on Steam.

												This has got to be one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Gameplay was good, the environment is literally breathtaking, and the story is magnificent.You play as Jack, whose plane goes down in the middle of the Atlantic ocean near a lighthouse. The lighthouse is actually the gateway to the underwater city of Rapture. Or it ruins, anyway. Rapture, the brain child of industrialist Andrew Ryan, was supposed to be a paradise for the common man, but not all was well in paradise. Civil unrest, class warfare, and add unmonitored sciencetific discoveries to the mix and things got real very fast. Plasmids, tonics that give humans super powers so to speak, is powered by a substance called ""ADAM"". But it destroys the mind with repeated abuse and now it's aftermath roams the streets.When you arrive, you seem to be at the tail end of the Rapture Civil War (a war between classes which quickly turned into a game of ""Who Can Splice More"") and you are almost immedietly contacted by a man named Atlas, who promises to help you escape Rapture. Now you must navigate through the city to find a way out. But don't get too comfortable in this city. Not all is as it seems and everyone is trying to get their hands on you.What I loved most about BioShock is that the main story isn't the only story. You learn about the city, it's people, and what caused paradise to literally sink. You learn how far we as humans will go to get what we desire and just what lines some will cross to enhance the human race.Are you a man or a slave? A savior or a splicer? Make your choices wisely, because in the end, your choices make you.			"

												Bioshock has... this unique feeling to it, it doesnt realy feel like a generic shooter with some magic powerups as what the outsider may think when they glance over it. The entire location this game takes place in is impressive and until now rarely done in those times.But the best part is story, yes the story is the most recommendable part. As the story is told via dialogue most of the time and the rare cutscenes are mostly done for the big reveals or intro's. This game was so good, I bought it when it was on sale and before I knew it I was 4 hours in and was far from bored and actualy had to force myself to stop playing to get some rest.If you never played Bioshock.. Well you should ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ change that problem.			"

												Bioshock today is just as good as it was back then.Even by todays standards the story is engaging as you dice with the the loonies of rapture, the freaky children and a brain dead mommy rapped up in a deep sea diving suit.You cant help but enjoy navigating your environment wielding convential weapons in one hand while brandishing jacked up powers in the other. The combos are amusing especially when you start hacking flying bots and chair bound cannons.The graphics are still stylish making the remaster possible the most pointless one ever but either way wont dissapoint. Definitely not a waste of money, a bargin in a sale and a steal if you get the whole bioshock bundle in a sale.			"

The Graphic is still great, The Story is still Twisted, The World is still MAD. The action and control are pretty smooth with laughable violence even though there are blood.

												I pirated this game way back in 2009-2010, of course it was a stupid idea but the unforgettable moments I had playing this game was truly amazing. The first time using plasmids, the first time receiving ADAM. It was amazing.Bioshock is set in an underwater city called rapture, built by Andrew Ryan. The place goes mad, people become spliced and insane craving for ADAM and all hell broke lose. You play as an unnamed plane crash survivor and you swim to a near-by lighthouse, this is the beginning of your trip down into the depths of rapture.The combat is smooth as can be, weapon upgrade stations are far and scarce and are a one use only so you better chose which upgrade you want wisely, the upgrades can range from accuracy increases to damage increases. Splicers use their environment to attack you, weather it be hiding in the shadows or climbing on the ceiling like spiders, they will find a way to get you by surprise. Plasmids are an amazing addition to spice up the gameplay, they're genetic modifiers that can give you specific abilities e.g. electric or fire, with these abilities you can do environmental damage to your enemies, weather it be an oil spill conveniently set under the enemies feet or they might be standing in water.The levels aren't linear but you will have to leave at some point, the levels are huge and you can find all sorts in them. Maybe some extra cash or a big daddy or two, who knows?The sound is great however I did experience some issues when too much was going on, some sounds cut out completely breaking the tense moments.The overall graphics are still breath taking, the first time you enter rapture you see glowing neon lights and buildings covered in sea life. As for the inside the place is dark and secluded. How ever nice and bright in some huge places.Overall, this game is amazing. Can't wait for the  dissapointing  remaster.			"

TL;DR at BottomIf you enjoyed this review,consider giving it a thumbs up!9/10Necessary Purchase ""A man chooses, a slave obeys."" -Andrew Ryan                          Bioshock is a first-person shooter developed and published by 2K games. The game takes place in a sub-oceanic city called Rapture. The city was created by an entrepreneur by the name of Andrew Ryan who created the city with the idea that anyone could be great and do amazing things if they worked hard for it. The city used to be a revolutionary society populated by the best and brightest but now it's filled with splicers,people who have used too much Adam and have gone insane because of it. Adam is a sort of drug produced by a type of sea slug and it functions as a sort of cancer-like disease that replaces native cells with unstable stem versions. Adam is what makes the wheels of rapture turn and you use it to buy new plasmids or upgrade abilities at a gatherers garden shop. Plasmids are basically spells you can use and your ""mana"" pool is called eve. There are so many different kinds of plasmids that they make combat incredibly fun and varied as well. Each plasmid is unique and no two will feel the same. Bioshock also has Gene Tonics, which are basically just passives that fall under 1 of 3 categories: Physical, Engineering, or Combat. Each tonic offers helpful passive bonuses that can completely alter how you decide to play the game. For example, if you pick up the right tonics then you can basically turn Bioshock into a stealth game. The entirety of Bioshock is incredibly creepy but honestly I never got truly scared due to the fact that the developers included only 2-3 jumpscares and opted to use legitimate horror rather than these cheap alternatives.

			Bioshock is a FPS set in the underwater city of Rapture and it also has quite a few RPG elements such as customizable abilities and upgrades.		

As I mentioned before Bioshock is an FPS which means that you're going to be doing lot's of shooting and boy is it fun. The guns in Bioshock don't really feel that good and almost all of them have very poor control and are hard to aim with.  Bioshocks main strength comes from the enemies and the weapons that you can wield. There are loads of different enemies to fight,each with varying strength and you will have a plethora of weapons to slay them with. Weapons from a chemical thrower loaded with napalm to a shotgun with electric rounds every weapon serves a purpose and as you progress you'll begin to find that out. Each weapon has different ammo types that can be loaded in to the weapon such as proximity mines for the grenade launcher or AP rounds for the machine gun. There are U-Invent stations spread throughout the levels and at these stations you can craft various new items such as new plasmids or ammo types. About halfway through the game you get the camera and this will allow you to take pictures of enemies and for taking these pictues you gain bonuses. For example, if you take pictures of the Big Daddies then you can unlock extra damage and loot to use against them. This is an incredibly unique system and really enhances the combat with all sorts of bonuses to keep in mind. This brings me to my main problem with the combat in Bioshock: Its old. Now don't get me wrong I love old games because most the time they're just flat out better games but here the old and dated controls really kills the game in parts. The options menu  is fairly lacking and the graphics options may cause some problems but my main issue is the sensitivity. The sensitivity completely ♥♥♥♥ed me over in combat because it's always too high and there isn't a good scale built into the game. No matter what I did even on the lowest it was still too fast for me and ruined combat half the time. Now,when you die you respawn at a Vita-Chamber with no penalty. This may be seen as too easy but due to how dated this game feels I think it allows people to advance through this amazing game no matter what and not be held back by dated controls and gameplay.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=587209283 ""Plasmids changed everything. They destroyed our bodies, our minds; we couldn't handle it. Best friends butchering one another, babies strangled in cribs... the whole city went to Hell."" -AtlasSo you may know Bioshock as a game with one of the biggest twists of all time and a story to match. Bioshock's story is absolutely phenomenal and borders on perfect with it's deep characters, unique setting, and one of the best twists in gaming history. The story is amazing on it's own but you soon come to realise that every single thing in Rapture has it's own story to it. The splicers have a story, the Vita-Chamber you respawn in has a story, and , most importantly of all, you have a story. Spread about Rapture are audio diaries which are little audio recordings that shed light on what Rapture truly is and how it came to be such a decrepit pit at the bottom of the ocean.Rapture's environments are some of the best I have ever seen, especially for a game thats 9 years old. You experience a variety of levels and environment types throughout your time in Rapture and every one is memorable and unique. You also begin to get the feeling that, contrary to what Ryan says, Rapture is falling apart all around you and there's nothing you do but make it worse. Also the level design in Bioshock is so perfect that you can't help but look around. Each level has loads of little nooks and side areas where you can pick up a new Tonic or type of ammo. Eventually you'll piece together what really happened and then just when you think you have it all figured out, it all gets thrown on it's head as everything around you begins to fall apart.TL;DRBioshock is an absolute masterpiece of a game that will leave you aching for more of it's revolutionary storytelling and creative combat mechanics.If you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to join my Steam Curator Group at  Mudkips Gaming "

												An experience at a level that most games try to reach, but seldom do. This game has it all. A gripping story line, amazing audio, and graphics. For being released in 2007, the graphics are on par with newer titles. With 20 hours of game play you will not be disappointed. Rapture is skillfully designed, and is truly a work of art. The dark environments are easy to get immersed in, and fit nicely in the horror genre. The game is based in the 1960s, and with the music and visuals you are reminded of that, but the game has a very futuristic feel.There are plenty of weapons, as well as plasmids to use. Different weapons and plasmids work best at defeating certain enemies.  But this game is not your standard shooter. With the ability to save up ""Adam"" to boost your skills, weapons and plasmids like a rpg, just not as complex. There's also crafting involved with items you collect throughout the game, again not to the depth of a true rpg. You have freedom to explore the confines of Rapture, and I suggest that you do. Be sure to pick up all the audio recordings to follow the story, as most of the story line plays out through these recordings. You will also find needed information in the recordings. You can replay all the recordings by using the ""M"" if you miss something or simply cannot hear what they are saying do to background noise.The biggest downfall of this game, the originality, the dark and macabre world setting maybe too obscure for the average gamer to appreciate.If you enjoy horror/survival games, then this is a definite must have, as well as a nice addition to any gamers collection.

												What a truly wonderful experience. Genuinely absorbing storytelling, hugely creepy atmosphere, scary and interesting enemies, great weapons, Bioshock is just one of those games where everything came together perfectly. My top ten gaming list was for a long time home to games solely made in the 90s and early 00s (Thief, Deus Ex, Baldur's Gate 2, Half Life, System Shock 2, Morrowind, Planescape etc.), but Bioshock really does sit comfortably alongside those classics. If you enjoy first person shooters with strong stories, you owe it to yourself to play this game.			"

												From what I've read, it's not worth getting the remastered version unless you want the badges. Bioshock shocked me (ignore pun) when I first played it because of how smooth and beautifully it played for a 2007 game. Even without the remaster it stands up to current gen games with ease. I got the remastered version for free, but don't want to taint my God-like view of this game by associating it with crashing and bugs, so I think I'll leave it sitting there for now.			"

												In early 2010, film critic Roger Ebert published an article regarding his position on video games as an artistic medium. Early in the article, Ebert firmly expresses his view on the matter: “Let me just say that no video gamer now living will survive long enough to experience the medium as an art form.” As much as I respect the late Roger Ebert, I have to disagree with this statement because gamers living today have survived to see at least one game rise above the rest as a work of art. The game in question is Bioshock, a first person shooter that combines exquisite storytelling, impressive presentation, and innovative gameplay into one cohesive unit that stands with any novel, painting, or movie as a piece of fine art.	Bioshock begins with the player’s character, a silent protagonist named Jack, surviving a plane crash in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. With nowhere else to go, Jack swims to a nearby islet occupied by a large lighthouse. Jack takes refuge inside the structure and discovers a small bathysphere that takes him to the game’s main setting, the massive underwater city of Rapture. According to a recording played in the bathysphere, Rapture was conceived by a business magnate named Andrew Ryan, who built the city with the vision of a utopian community where one could achieve greatness without any interference from outside forces, such as government or religion. However, upon arriving in Rapture, the player soon finds out that things did not go exactly as Ryan planned. The city now lies in ruin and all of its living residents have become murderous lunatics that lash out at anything that moves. Aided via radio by a mysterious man named Atlas, Jack must now explore rapture and escape with his life. 	What makes this game stand out from others is that the player has full control of Jack during the entire experience. By immediately relinquishing control, Bioshock immerses the player in a captivating tale of freewill and madness that slowly reveals itself over the course of the game. In addition to scripted events, such as the masterfully executed opening, the player can listen to audio logs left behind by the once sane citizens of Rapture. These optional logs give the player deeper insight into the lives of Rapture’s residents and the events that led to the city’s downfall. 	Ryan himself adds philosophical depth to the game’s already rich narrative. He exudes ambition and unrelenting determination to his beliefs with a charisma that makes him one of the most memorable characters in all of gaming. His attitude towards government and religious officials, which he refers to as “parasites,” heavily mirrors the objectivist beliefs Ayn Rand expressed in novels like Atlas Shrugged. The inclusion of these philosophical themes elevates Bioshock above the stereotype that games produce stories with little to no substance. 	Unfortunately, the story’s only flaw, and the main drawback of the game in general, is the ending, which feels abrupt and underwhelming compared to the rest of the game. Luckily, the rest of the story makes up for the lackluster ending with some amazing plot twists that will stick with the player long after their experience with the game has concluded. 	If Bioshock’s mesmerizing plot doesn’t draw the player into its world, then its unparalleled presentation will. Every inch of Rapture is painstakingly rendered with borderline obsessive attention to the tiniest details. Water realistically drips from the walls and ceilings. Neon signs flicker and short out. Cheerful announcements fall on deaf ears over the intercom. These fully realized details add to the idea that Rapture was once a thriving metropolis where people lived happy and fulfilling lives, making its current state of disrepair all the more heart wrenching. Furthermore, Bioshock exudes a distinct art direction rarely seen in games. Rapture’s consistent Art Deco style will generate a sense of appreciation for the artistry required to bring these environments to life. 	While Bioshock’s story and presentation already place it in a league of its own, the game truly shines in its innovations to traditional FPS gameplay. Throughout the game, the player gather’s a diverse arsenal of weapons, ranging from a pistol to a shotgun to a flamethrower. Aiming and firing each of these weapons feels natural and satisfying. Also, all of the weapons can be upgraded to increase their accuracy and damage among other traits. However, Bioshock deviates from FPS norms with the addition of plasmids. These genetic modifications provide the player with a wide variety of powers, such as setting enemies on fire, picking up and throwing large objects, and possessing enemies to have them fight on the player’s side. In order to obtain these perks, the player must collect a gene altering substance called ADAM from small girls called Little Sisters that freely roam Rapture’s halls. However, the player must first defeat the Little Sisters’ guardians, huge diving suit wearing creatures simply known as Big Daddies. These intimidating monsters deal massive damage and will take a long time to defeat, but the satisfaction and rewards make it worth the effort. Once the Big Daddy falls, the player has the option to either harvest the Little Sister, which gives the player more ADAM but kills the girl, or rescue it, which yields less ADAM but promises the player a future reward. These decisions not only affect the player’s access to plasmids but also have moral ramifications that play into how the game’s story unfolds. This morality based choice system not only presents the player with an interesting dilemma with tangible consequences, but also perfectly ties into the game’s overall themes of personal growth and freedom.When all of Bioshock’s elements come together into a singular piece, they form a thoroughly entertaining and thought provoking experience that only a work of art can provide. The story keeps players guessing and presents them with philosophical concepts that other games can only dream of expressing. The presentation engrosses players into a world so authentically realized that it becomes as deep and complex as any of the game’s characters. Finally, the multifaceted gameplay forces the players to make decisions that impact their individual endeavors in unexpected ways. If this is the only time gamers experience the medium as a true art form, I can easily say that Bioshock deserves that distinction. Whether you’re a seasoned gamer or a curious onlooker, you owe it to yourself to pick up this slice of gaming excellence.   "

												A well made shooter with RPG elements. Good variety of weapons/abilities to choose from. I thoroughly enjoyed the ~12 hours it took me to beat it.Pros:-Great combat mechanics. (Telekinesis was always fun)-Spooky environment/enemies.-Overall creepy presentation.Cons:-You are thrust quite abruptly into the story of the game. There's little to no explanation when the game begins as to why you are a machine-gun wielding sorcerer. You'll figure it out as you go.-Difficulty is a little weird. Normal baddies are cake. Big-Daddys tended to wreck me. Thankfully you essentially have unlimited lives.Overall, I'd recommend this game to sadists, serial killers, scuba divers, and sorcerers. I'd also encourage you to 'Rescue' the Little Sisters as opposed to 'Harvesting' them. If you rescue them all, the ending is equal parts satisfaction and horror.			"

												Un gran juego, lanzado por el 2007 e ideado por Ken Levine y sus colegas en Irrational Games. Para el 2007 los shooter no eran mas ir de un punto a otro y con una trama no muy compleja en medio de todo eso. Pero BIoshock cambio y revoluciono todo eso, es un poco lineal si pero te da libertad y con una trama mas que apasionante y atractiva. Con un final mas que hermoso y épico. Sin dudas de los mejores shooter que probe, jugabilidad magnifica y banda sonora y sonidos a la altura. Titulo más que recomendado.9/10			"

												BioShock sets a new standard for FPS games, at least in storytelling quality. If it was half of what it is, it would still be on the top ten. But it somehow manages to surpass itself and to become one the best games of all times, and that’s not a personal opinion, it’s a fact. It proves that a good use of arts and philosophy can greatly improve gaming experience.			"

												The story in BioShock is dark and satisfying, something that will make you contemplate it long after you've put the game down. And though combat takes a back seat to the enthralling atmosphere, it's still extremely satisfying to combine your plasmid powers with traditional weapons. This is one of the finest first-person shooters with a great story and background around and a game that simply should not be missed.			"

												There is truly only one way to say this: Bioshock maybe one of the best shooters ever made. The impact this series had on shooters truly is a wonder. Among the Call of Dutys and crappy Half Life rip-offs it's great when you find an original, story based shooter. That doesn't mean that shooters need to have a great story to be good, Doom barely had one and we still love it to this day, but Bioshock was just perfect. Although Bioshock 2 was a bit of a let down and wouldn't be my first choice of shooter sequel, Bioshocks glory came back in Bioshock Infinite and if I could recommend one of the Bioshock games, it would be Infinite. Still, this game is fantastic and I really do recommend you play it if you appreciate video games as an artwork and shooters as a genre. Bioshock gets a 9.5 out of 10.			"

												BioShock has one of the most disturbing stories ever made in the gaming history. You are basically in a plane, then you suddenly crash and get wrapped up in a war between two factions fighting for power. Make use of Plasmids, powerful DNA modifiers that let you cast incredible skills; pick up the classic guns and kill all your foes. Dislike these methods? Hack, go on stealth, the choice is up to you. One of the best games ever made.+Different ways to approach the same situation+Inmersive dark atmosphere +Moral system that tests players+Rich in both lore and character background terms+Strong RPG touch+Beautiful architecture-Soundtrack could have been better98/100 Masterpiece "

												Review for Bioshock 2: Here.Review for Bioshock 2 Remastered: Here.**Note: This is NOT a review for the Remastered version.If you would like to see my Bioshock Remastered review, please click here.*Excuse the play hours. I've much more on console and the Remastered version.From the very day that it was released, Bioshock was a classic in its own right. It came at the right time, when the over-saturated shooter genre was steadily getting more stale as time progressed. The title found overwheming acclaim due to its fresh gameplay, unique story, and immersive setting. Often called the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, Bioshock is the title that put developer/publisher 2K Games on the road to success. The only real question here is... would you kindly?Even though Bioshock was originally released in 2007, the game has aged remarkably well. Many were surprised to hear that Remastered versions of the first two titles were underway, as the graphics have held up superbly over nearly a decade. While the console versions of the game ran flawlessly, the PC port did come with its share of issues; most notably mouse acceleration problems, but also a handful of glitches that cause one to have to reload their save files. Unfortunately, these problems were never patched out despite how easy they could've been to fix.Welcome to Rapture. The year is 1960. You are a man named Jack, aboard an airplane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The plane goes down, and surrounded by fire and debris you swim to a nearby lighthouse. Upon entering, you're greeted by a man named Atlas via radio, after being threatened by horrendously insane denizens of the underwater city. In a somewhat submarine type of contraption called a Bathysphere, you submerge down what is assumed to be thousands of fathoms under the sea, where you enter the rustic, dystopian, Art Deco style city of Rapture.At first the player isn't given much information on the character that they're playing, nor much of the story for that matter. The story progresses through a series of audio interactions with Atlas, and through collection audio diaries that are scattered throughout each level. Occasionally, other characters present themselves over the communication radio, and there are only a small handful of cutscenes which are placed at very appropriate moments. Without taking the time to explore Rapture and find all of the diaries, one may feel slightly lost in terms of plot and story. If you take the time to find and listen to all 122 diaries, it's easy to say that 2K did an amazing job adding depth and vibrancy to each character.As stated before, Bioshock has a very unique approach to gameplay. Not only do you get six upgradable weapons (shotgun, pistol, chemical thrower, crossbow, etc.), but you get 11 Plasmids to play around with; however, you can only equip 7 at any given time, but you can swap out what Plasmids and Tonics you have equipped at a Gene Swap Station. Plasmids rewrite your DNA, and infuse you with outstanding powers such as Telekinesis, Incineration, Insect Swarms, and even the ability to Hypnotize Big Daddy. In order to use Plasmids, you must have enough Eve, which can be gained through injecting yourself with Eve Hypos. It's the same basic concept as spells and mana. However, Jack's left hand changes aesthetics with each newly equipped Plasmid, and there are also upgrades to find for most of them.Suffice it to say that the game has a lot of variety to offer, especially given its age. The enemies that you will encounter are as equally unique, and they are known as Splicers. People who have been surgically modified to the extreme, whether willingly or forced, by the insane Dr. Steinman. There are a total of five different Splicers, each with their own unique attributes. However, let us not forget the star of the show here, the Big Daddy. There are two different kinds of Big Daddies, Bouncer and Rosie. Their role is to protect the Little Sisters who are harvesting ADAM around Rapture. You must face these behemoths each time that you want to either rescue or harvest a Little Sister.ADAM is another type of currency in Bioshock, although you also have money that you collect for buying items and ammo, and it is used to unlock new Tonics, Plasmids, new slots for each, and upgrades for both Health and Eve. The more Little Sisters you either harvest or rescue, the more ADAM you collect. I should also mention here that Tonics function as your abilities, and they can also have several findable upgrades akin to the Plasmids; there are well over 50 Tonics in total throughout the game. There's also a very limited crafting system in place, so that you can find components and make ammo, new Tonics, and even autohack devices to assist in hacking Turrets, Security Bots, Cameras, and Vending Machines.However, despite everything that has been aforementioned, the real ingredient that makes this game stand out so vividly is its amazing art direction and thick, immersive atmosphere. One really gets hit hard with the authentic 1960's vibe, which is conveyed through the Art Deco style of the game. However, instead of it being a pristine environment, Rapture is decayed, down-trodden, flooded, and rusty. At almost every corner you're reminded that you're hundreds, if not thousands, of fathoms below the surface, and at the same time you're constantly reminded of the time period; whether it be visually or by way of music. There's not a lot of music in the game, but there are aptly placed jukeboxes from time to time that sing relevant tunes from the time period. One of the hardest hitters is looking out of any given window and seeing a neon sign lit city underwater.If you've never taken the time to visit Rapture and delve into the universe of Bioshock, you shouldn't wait any longer. The story is absolutely remarkable, and one that you will not forget for years to come; I haven't played this title since 2007, and its story, influence, and artistic direction have never left me. There is a ton to do in Rapture, and a large amount of places to explore, looking back on it now it's pretty crazy how many mechanics and features that 2K were able to implement into the title; especially being such a smaller team a decade ago. Now, would you kindly go and play Bioshock? ""With the sweat of your brow, Rapture can become your city as well."" - Andrew Ryan.Rating: 5.0/5.0 - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.𐌕𐋏𐌄 𐋏𐍈𐍂𐍂𐍈𐍂 𐌽𐌄𐌕𐤔𐍈𐍂𐌊 Curator | Group 𐌂𐌋𐌆𐌂𐌊 𐌅𐍈𐍂 𐌾𐍈𐍂𐌄			"

												Bioshock is very good game with great storyline, art-style, decent graphics and interesting mechanics. It was fun playing it.You are Jack who survived plane crash and found underwater city, way more technologically developed than other cities in 60's. He have to survive again but now there are mutants (crawling on walls, ceiling, teleporting, tossing fireballs or ice) and security system which could be used against enemies who would like to slice protagonist, it will only happen when the defense system is hacked (hacking minigame is simple/hard depends on how important/powerful turret you want hack, it can be easier by equipping skills/plasmids). You can also find so called sisters down there (little girls who are ADAM producers, it's very important currency to buy plasmids and upgrades as life and mana) you can save them, or harvest them (it will kill them obviously your choice :p ), those girls are almost harmless, but they walk always with Big Daddy who are strong as f*** and won't let you get to sister easily, you have to kill/destroy him, after that you're free to go). original fight system (use weapons, or use plasmids/ spells which will freeze, burn, shock etc. enemy, very useful thing weapons have 3 kinds of ammo (good with dealing humans, armoured enemies, or standard ammo) hack defense system and wait for enemy annihilation ;] you can also hypnotise Big Daddy who will protect you as little sister, but he can accidentally kill you if you get in his way ^^ great graphics of underwater city great storyThere are also cons: fun feature, why protagonist can hold all that stuff and can't hold more than 500$ WTF? Comparing piece of paper or coin to huge weapon? Can't get it -.-  not enough ammo, it was hard to find it, sometimes had to fight with wrench and plasmids if I had mana, there are a lot of shops but with money limit you can't accumulate cash for later and when you need ammo you have no $ or inversely full cash full ammo and you find 90$ ""can't get it"" F****! It's like the game is teasing/taunting you ""remember that nice shining 100$? it would be nice to have it now >:D "" every time I had to change screen resolution options, not sure what was causing that, this game have problems with saving config I was begging every 10 minutes for that the game won't crash (maybe it was caused by Raptr, Steam or Xfire not sure but without those applications (excluding Steam) that still happened and adding turn off Vertical sync made it worse, game couldn't stand 200 fps?) after loading screen mouse is set like from 3200 to 800 DPI i had to jerk mouse for 5 seconds to return my sensitivity settings there isn't any journal, even hint won't help so if you find voice tape and if you won't listen to that because you were fighting you'll miss important password to open lift/door and that terminal can't be hacked, you won't get it any more after picking up new tape => retry mission or search net -.- respawning enemies, yes that thing was annoying back then in NES games so it's annoying in this game, when you die, you get back to vita chamber ""respawn point"", you want go back quickly to place where you died and what? New enemies on way :|Despite those cons it's a good game, fun to play 8/10			"

												Here's my 2nd review of the 'best FPS's of all time', as promised.(Bragging note: dont mind my Playtime of the game on Steam, i played and did 100% on all 3 Bioshock games on the PS3)Bioshock is the most stylish game of all time.While HL2 is the traditional FPS, great in every department, but following previously established archetypes, Bioshock revolutionizes most of those formulas. So i'll also try my best to 'stylize' my 'review formula':Rapture.Truly, this amazing underwater city defines everything this game does well. From the very start, you feel like Alice, going into the rabbit hole, into Wonderland... Except you're late for this one, it's already in ruins.The art style is absolutely amazing, the 20's Art Déco combined with the sci fi / mechanical aspects results in a sense of confusion, not knowing if you're in the past or future, which adds to the mysterious tone of the ruined city.The combat system is also very refreshing, instead of just relying on weapons, they added plasmids, which can be mixed with the guns for fun gameplay, with an added layer of depth. The exploration and scavenging were a nice surprise for me (as an obsessive explorer in gaming), presenting both some RPG elements and the backstory of the city, before it collapsed (metaphorically), through the eyes of its previous inhabitants.Another unique, iconic element of the game is it's enemies, more specifically the almighty Big Daddy, who provides an amazing dynamic to the combat (i was gonna describe it, but i decided it's best to let the players found out for themselves).Finally we reach the Story, praised as one of the best in videogames, proving that FPS's dont have to be mindless with virtually no story (you guys know what games im talking about!), by presenting complex philosophical, moral and political ideas, as an amazing social commentary that should probably be studied and debated by the experts of those departments. All of this, with a limited amount of characters, that you can count witth the fingers in your hands. But even though few, each counts as a hundred, with powerful personalities crashing, which results in the infamous plot twists that catapulted this game into stardom.Now, would you kindly do yourself a favor, and go play this game immediately, if you havent yet (or even if you have!)

												Don't get me wrong, the game itself is great, The lack of an easy fix is what makes me not recommend it though.When games for windows live died Bioshock went on life support.

It really is a good and fun game with an interesting story if you take the time to make it work properly but we need a real fix, it took me 2 hours to find precisely how to make it work and even then I still need to remap my keys and fix the resolution once in a while.

												Shooter games can offer various experience. Bioshock offers mostly emotions of the utopia world that has turned so badly, that is no longer place to live and survive with just ordinary equipment. Unlike other shooters you need not only bullet with various weapons, but plasmids with powers you can barely dream of...  The place where you gonna find your self is unique trip into visionaries mind, who created former paradise below see. The art deco graphic in world full of it stories and rules is just epic!Definetly on my list 10 games to play for non gamers. True magic, amazing experience!  "

			Bioshock is a FPS set in the underwater city of Rapture and it also has quite a few RPG elements such as customizable abilities and upgrades.		

I started playing Bioshock thinking it would be a straightforward FPS with no depth, but I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised by it.Both the setting and the story were really engaging which got me really immersed in the game. Everything from the shooting mechanics to the spectacular voice acting gave the game a really polished feel.The game isn't as linear as I originally thought, some points you're forced to scavenge for ammo and you actually get rewarded for exploring which is really nice.You can also really customize how you play by selecting from a huge choice of plasmids which change your character in interesting ways.One tiny thing that annoyed me is that there's absolutely no penalty for dying, you just respawn at the checkpoint losing absolutely no progress or money. Also, there are very frequent hacking puzzles which broke the pace of the gameplay.Finally, the ending of the game was highly anticlimactic. It spends ages immersing you just to end it all with an escort mission and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a -Beep-, climaxing with a 30 second cinematic.If you don't mind a minigame every now and then, or a somewhat rushed ending then I'm sure you'll enjoy the great gameplay and many plot twists that this game offers. I really enjoyed my time with Bioshock and it's one of the best single player FPS games I've ever played, so it gets a 7 out of 10 on 60 Second Reviews.			"

												Would you kindly read this review and buy this game? If you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.In terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, and the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game. Voice acting is perfect without a doubt, and characters such as Ryan Andrew and Sander Cohen will leave a lasting impression long after you finish the game. Sound design is extremly well-done as well: the whale-like moans from the hulking Big Daddies are very creepy, and the game only uses music for atmospheric reasons, adding an extra layer of immersion that makes the game quite screepy, but never outright scary (which is not what the game is trying to do).The story is the main highlight of BioShock, and presents themes and ideologies that are very applicable to reality, mainly the view of objectivism. Plot twists and unforgetable characters will make the experience a memorable ones, and each audio-diary will flesh out the world of Rapture, especially in events following up to the game. As for the main protagonist Jack, he's the typical silent playable character that every shooter seems to have, but his background information makes him quite interesting. Despite this, the story is damned near perfect, even if it feels ever-so rushed after the games huge revelation and twist.I could end the review here, as the story is something that alone should be able to sell this game instantly, no strings attached. However, how does BioShock sell as an FPS? The game features an arsenal of weapons from a flamethrower to a machine gun, and are all quite standard. The sense of conserving ammo that the game has at first is very intense, however later on you will have more money than you even need, so that feeling is somewhat lost. Gunplay feels slightly ""floaty"" (can't really get my finger on what it is), and later on becomes quite inneffective against enemies that suddenly have increased durability from earlier in the game. Speaking of enemies, you'll encounter Splicer's, humans which are addicted to this substance called ADAM, which grants them superpowers but makes them mentally unstable. Some will teleport around you, while others will have a box of grenades to utilize instead. But most significant of all are the Big Daddies.These hulking beasts present a real challenge, but are neutral if not dealt with. Why? They guard Little Sisters. which are key to the games plot and whether you get a good or bad ending. These altered girls harvest ADAM from dead corpses (and have a creepy sense of innocence to them), and you have the option to either save them or harvest them. Saving leads to the good ending but you get less ADAM, and harvesting them leads to the bad ending but you get more ADAM (and a combination leads to the sad ending). Actually combating the Big Daddies leads to a great deal of planning, and you'll have to acknowledge that you wont come out of the fight without a few scars.Going backwards, do you recall how I noted how guns became less useful as the game progresses? Well, that is because of Plasmids, which are basically superpowers like shooting flames, bolts of electricity, or even a swarm of bees! These are incredibly fun to use. een though you have to switch to your Plasmids and use them independantly from your weapons, making combat feel slightly clunky. The game also presents you with many RPG features, such as a hacking minigame (meh), weapon/plasmid upgrades, shops, ammo types, and plenty of nooks and cranies to add to it all. Overall combat is slightly outdated by todays standards (no sprint or ADS, if such a thing would bother you), but is still incredibly fun regardless.SLIGHT GAMEPLAY SPOILERS AHEADAnd here is a warning to where the game goes wrong. Following the huge plot twist at the end of the second third of the game, the gameplay plummets (pun intended) downhill, even though it may not seem so at first. It places some annoying restrictions on your abilities, but that's where the fun begins. After that you have a boring and confusing (IMO) scavenger hunt, and after that an incredibly dull escort mission before a forgetable (but not as bad as the scavenger hunt) final boss. To be fair, the only part that really stuck out as bad to me was the scavenger hunt: everything before it was annoying but still fun, and after it forgetable. The audio diaries and story will certainly make up for it however, as the games presentation remains consistent throughout.BioShock is a prime example of how video games are art, and is one you should not overlook. Even where it missteps in gameplay, it's story and presentation are grand throughout, and provide a unique experience you will not forget and will come back to again and again. There is no denying that BioShock is a game that will stand the test of time, and I would give it a 9/10 (If it was story alone than 11/10, it's that good). So, would you kindly get it?			"

												Just completed this on straight run on hardcore setting & 27 hrs intensive play.  Played Infinate first & now working through  previous versions, this one apparently being released 2007.Really atmospheric game with good art deco style graphics & excellent sound effects that adds a sometimes dark, chilling effect.  Good gameplay, the added effect of plasmids blending with an aray of contemporary weapons makes this worth playing a few times with different approaches.  Additional 'hacking' that challenge the brain in the early morning hours.  There is the odd clunky scene but on the whole I would recommend for anyone to play this original themed game once. 8.5/10			"

												Pretty much everyone heard about this game back in 2007. It was massively popular for it's intrinsicly detailed world, and it's intense System Shock 2 inspired gameplay.I quite like this game. It is basically System Shock 2 lite, with an immersively new and original setting that cannot be replicated. It parodies and satires both Ayn Rand and much of history at the same time.Wether it's worth your money or not, you'll find Bioshock is a well written game, and it leaves an experience that one doesnt forget lightly.

I started playing Bioshock thinking it would be a straightforward FPS with no depth, but I can tell you that I was pleasantly surprised by it.Both the setting and the story were really engaging which got me really immersed in the game. Everything from the shooting mechanics to the spectacular voice acting gave the game a really polished feel.The game isn't as linear as I originally thought, some points you're forced to scavenge for ammo and you actually get rewarded for exploring which is really nice.You can also really customize how you play by selecting from a huge choice of plasmids which change your character in interesting ways.One tiny thing that annoyed me is that there's absolutely no penalty for dying, you just respawn at the checkpoint losing absolutely no progress or money. Also, there are very frequent hacking puzzles which broke the pace of the gameplay.Finally, the ending of the game was highly anticlimactic. It spends ages immersing you just to end it all with an escort mission and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ excuse of a -Beep-, climaxing with a 30 second cinematic.If you don't mind a minigame every now and then, or a somewhat rushed ending then I'm sure you'll enjoy the great gameplay and many plot twists that this game offers. I really enjoyed my time with Bioshock and it's one of the best single player FPS games I've ever played, so it gets a 7 out of 10 on 60 Second Reviews.			"

												Would you kindly read this review and buy this game? If you didn't know, BioShock is claimed to be one of the most revolutionary FPS's games of all time, and that statement has plently of truth to it. It exceeds in almost all areas, but no gem is without its flaws. Unfortunately for BioShock, these flaws can be quite noticeable when you come across to them. DO NOT let that discourage you from playing this game though; it's an experience you don't want to miss.In terms of presentation, BioShock fails to unimpress. The view of the underwater city of Rapture will amaze you when it emerges on your screen, and the steampunk art style is very unique, while being consistent throughout the game.

												TL;DR: Bioshock is a great game, if you haven't played it you should.The gameplay is fun with first person gunfights and a hacking minigame that goes from easy to insane as you play the game. One problem I did have was that I could not figure out how to turn off the tutorial hints.The visuals were nice, I really don't see why they needed to push out a remaster. Actually the faces of the characters (I.E. the little sisters) looked really creepy and sometimes inhuman.The sound was good except it randomly stopped working and I had to enable some sound driver in my sound devices.The story was remarkable and if you have not played the game: BUY IT NOW AND PLAY IT!I do recommend Bioshock, I loved the boss battle at the end it was very satisfying and one of the very best I have ever played.It takes 12 to 16 hours to beat the game.I rate it a 9/10.

												Bioshock is a great game. It's polished, gritty, tense and sometimes frightening. It's also quite wordy and philosophical. There's a lot to like here. The sound, especially, is amazing, and the graphics are beautiful.The game promises a ""play it your way"" experience, and succeeds, to a point. The many plasmids (think ""spells"") encourage you to try different tactics, but the very first combo you learn is the easiest and most effective: shock your opponent, and then bludgeon him with a wrench while he's stunned. It’s generally easy to identify a best plasmid to use for each situation; although you can explore others. I should also point out that this game is psychologically very taxing. You spend a great deal of time looting dead, mangled, burned corpses. You're crawling through a destroyed city. The game is oppressive and claustrophobic, and seriously depressing. I was glad when it was over, but also glad to have played it. Difficult at the time, but it left a lasting impression.			"

												Bioshock is simply a brilliant game. For me, few games have changed the the way I think about games ; it belongs with those other great and defining FPS'S such as Half Life, Deus Ex, Thief and both System Shocks. All bring something new and fresh to the genre and make you look at them with awe.   With Bioshock, it is primarily all about the story. Its combat can be repetitive, but with the assortment of plasmids with the conventional weapons at your disposal, the game never gets boring; rather the further you advance, the deeper you become engrossed in the story, especially if you take the time to find and listen to all of the audio logs.   Rapture is one of the best worlds i have experienced, and with the Big Daddy and Little Sister characterisation and relationship, amongst many other things,  Bioshock is truly unforgetable.  A classic.			"

												Belated review. Very few games have ever presented a world as unique as that of Rapture in Bioshock. For that reason alone, it is worth playing. But when you also consider the incredible setting is just one part of the eqaution - the game features great gameplay and a cool story as well - it all adds up to an experience that simply cannot be missed. For anyone who has yet to play this classic... what are you waiting for?			"

												Call me late to the party, by about seven years, but Bioshock is a perfect example of all that is good in gaming and stands tall as one of the greatest games of human history.Coming into the game with the mindset of someone who played and loved Bioshock Infinite, I set my mind back to 2007 when the game was released: Measuring it up to the standards back then, the result? I was completely blown away.Bioshock was ahead of it's time with amazing graphics, fluid gameplay, immersive environments and a story that left me on the edge of my seat in anticipation. Taking the role of Jack, a silent protagonist you venture deeper and deeper into the eery and unsettling depths of the underwater city of Rapture, radio contact directs you to your goals and you can find audiographs to learn more about the history of such an incredible city. The environments feel isolated, making the player feel trapped and uncomfortable and sets up for a terrifying setting where you square down with the mutated and insane denizens still roaming the submerged streets.  The balance between environment and story are so perfectly intuned that it is easy to lose yourself in the setting and be completely immersed in the story, sinking hours at a time into unlocking the secrets this modern Atlantis leaves to find, building up to one of the most shocking twists you will ever experience. The story, lore and setting of the entire game is incredible, and when you finish playing through the game I highly recommend going online and reading up more, because the history of Rapture is so well written that I can spend days scratching around to find every little tidbit of information.To defend yourself you are given a large arsenal of firearms and Plasmids (genetic modification tonics that alter your very DNA and give you powerful abilities) that you can use in many ways: Set up traps and take advantage of the environment to maximize the damage potential of plasmids, or you can use your guns to plow through your foes in a very satisfying way, as each and every firearm has a good feel to it and carries a wonderful punch. As you progress in the game, enemies get tougher and tougher, requiring more firepower to take them out. Throughout the game you can collect and combine upgrades to your weapons giving them more damage output as well as numerous other bonuses such as recoil reduction or firing rate (at the same time giving your weapon a visible upgrade, making them look absurdly bad-♥♥♥), as well as gene tonics that you use to give yourself powerful buffs to your combat and hacking expertise.The level design is flawless, being understandable but far from straightforward; offering plenty of opportunites to explore and loot, finding every little scrap of ammo and utilities to give yourself as much of an advantage as possible. Now I have to apologize, but there is one part about Bioshock that wasn't perfect and if I can say so safely: was bad. I'M SORRY I'M SORRY I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT BUT I FEEL I NEED TO POINT THIS OUT.So be advised, mild spoiler alert: Skip this paragraph over if you do not wish to have spoilers.In the later stages of the game you partake in (ugh) an escort mission. One of the types of missions that gamers almost universally despise on a molecular level. The objective is to guide a little girl through a splicer infested area and protect the little rat because she's the only one who can open the doors for you. Now the flaws with this is that throughout the game up to this point you set the pace yourself, you moved, fought and explored as you saw fit, because this was your experience and you experienced it as you wanted: Then this little bedwetter waddles in and sets the pace for you, robbing you of your control  as she struts thoughtlessly into automated turrets and other dangers. But the worst part is that the nosepicker is just about one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen: She repeats the same small handful of dialogue over and over without end, and practically NEVER SHUTS UP. I honestly wanted to shoot her myself, but I seemingly needed her to open the doors for me, to which I wanted to physically pick her up and use her as a battering ram. This portion, although short-lived, felt so far out of place and was a blemish on an otherwise perfect game.Finally, Bioshock was built on an outdated engine, which results in some game-breaking issues as a result of incompatabilites with modern technology, such as inconsistent mouse sensitivity and flat-out broken audio. To which I refer you to these guides on Steam that have both solved these issues:Mouse sensitivity - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=129822360Audio fix - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=178202642With thanks to the creators for their help, without them I would have never been able to experience this beautiful game. So in conclusion: Bioshock is a great experience that has triumphed over the test of time, with an atmosphere, gameplay and story that has earned it critical praise. I do not only recommend Bioshock, I worship Bioshock as a shining beacon to all that is good in gaming.			"

												Questo gioco , è uno dei migliori titoli a cui abbia mai giocato. E ho iniziato a giocare con l Amiga 500 nel lontano 1988 , per poi passare a un 486 sx (ovvero senza processore matematico).Quando ero bambino io, un masterizzatore cd (non dvd che non esistevano) costava circa un milione e mezzo di lire gli hard disk da 100 mb costavano 1 milione di lire e le schede grafiche ancora erano forse nella mente di chi ha progettato la prima. Internet non esisteva e i giochi erano assai difficile da reperire....Parlando di Fps, posso dire che dopo essere stato impressionato da Wolf3d, stupito da Doom (perchè a quei tempi Doom era un passo avanti non da poco), il primo Medal of Honor, per poi rimanere coinvolto nelle ambientazioni e musiche del divino Duca altro passo avanti memorabile nel mondo videoludico..... non mi è rimasto piu impresso niente fino a Bioshock.Per me è la storia Fps piu bella di sempre, un gioco fatto col cuore e non solo per vendere un prodotto. Curato in ogni particolare, con quei nemici malati, divertenti, particolari.... con le sfide a i Big Daddy, la trama coinvolgente al massimo. Voglio dire al giorno d oggi non c è nessun gamer che non sappia che Bioshock esiste, e se avete provato solo l Infinite (per carità bella grafica ma niente di piu) sappiate che vi siete persi LA PERLA DELLA SAGA.Godetevi questo perchè non troverete fps piu coinvolgente neanche negli altri 2 episodi.Capolavoro			"

												""We all make choices, but in the end our choices make us.""Bioshock is a hell of a game I'll give it that. A first person shooter with RPG elements and a knack for scaring you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.+The graphics look beautiful for a game that came out in 2007. Sure the textures aren't great, and the characters are a little cartoony, but everything about the aesthetic of this game helps to fully set the atmosphere. And take my word for it, this is one of the most immersive games I have played in a very long time when it comes to the atmosphere. +The soundtrack is phenomenal. It fits every single scene. It helps draw you into the game. It can make even a bathroom that lacks jump scares the most terrifying place you've ever tip-toed your way into. +The level design is fantastically done, if poorly translated onto a 2D map. The underwater city of rapture has a mild claustrophobic feeling to it, but it makes sense. It fits the setting quite well, and when you need space? You can usually find or make it.+The story is fantastic, Ken Levine does wonders with stories. Draw dropping plot twists and endings that'll leave you speechless, i loved every second of it. There isn't a story in the world Ken Levine could write that I could forget.+Decent-length. Got 21 hours out of the game after getting it for $1 in a bundle. Definitely worth the price. I was partially a completionist however, I explored almost every single room and shelf in Rapture. I also moved very slowly at points since I scare easy.+Since the tags say it's horror, I can tell you it really does horror right. Jump-scares when you least expect them. And a very creepy atmosphere that doesn't rely on jump scares to begin with.-Respawning enemies. Just...ugh. Bioshock as a series is infamous for throwing enemies, and bullet sponges at you. If it bothers you, play on a lower difficulty, you'll become a bullet sponge yourself.-Bugs with Win7 or later. From random crashes (That lead to all of your settings resetting) to the sounds cutting out when too make sound sources are coming in at once. Most noticeable when guardians of rapture (Sounds better than dinky flying robots) are shooting. Especially noticeable towards the end of the game. Immersion-breaking to say the least...but not game-breaking.All in all, this game holds up. I'm very glad I made my easy-to-scare ♥♥♥ finish the game, as it was totally worth it. Keeping its buggy state and flaws in mind, I give this game an 4/5. I think this is a game that everyone who enjoys a good immersive story should play. Were the bugs fixed, I'd give it a 9/10, so maybe a console version might fare better for you. Either way, I have to admit that it is an amazing game and it has defined the standards for the horror FPS genre. Now, would you kindly consider giving it a try? =)			"

												It's the best First Person Shooter I've ever played. Bioshock was released in August 2007 and almost 10 years later it still manages to look and sound better than most modern games. When it comes to its story, characters and atmosphere, I don't think it's been done better before or after. From the iconic Big Daddies to Rapture itself, the entire mythology surrounding this game is a masterwork of science fiction and a watershed moment not only in gaming but in pop culture itself. I'm not sure there's such a thing as a perfect game but if there is, Bioshock should definitely be in the conversation.			"

												I was skeptical at first, since I started the series with Infinite and ended up not liking that game. Fortunately I decided against my bias and purchased this one.One thing I love about Bioshock, is the way it tells or rather shows you the story and events in Rapture. Infinite in my humble opinion felt way too scripted, and it bugged me, how often that particular game took away my control over Bookers' character. Bioshock instead opts for a different way of handling this aspect by letting me, the player decide wether I want to give attention to a cutscenes or not, what I really like. Bioshock also features a very engaging story, that might surprise you.Despite a somewhat ""antique"" Unreal Engine 2, the game is a stunner, providing incredible (and unsettling) setpieces. Unfortunately ragdoll and physic animations are capped at 30FPS which really makes them stick out like a sore thumb. The games' biggest problem however are the low FOV and the ridiculously low weapon FOV, which made me motionsick after 5 minutes of playtime. This can be avoided by using a tool called ""Flawless Widescreen"" which allows the user to customize both options. Irrational Games did a great job on Bioshocks artdesign which still holds up even to this date. The music and soundeffects are well done and provide a good atmosphere.Bioshocks gunplay is alright. The player is given a rather large arsenal of weaponary and plasmids. The guns felt a bit too weak, which turned some enemies into frustrating bulletsponges. My favourites are the wrench and the shotgun, which I found useful for all situations they game would throw at me. Plasmids are integrated well into the gameplay and are lots of fun to use, even though ""Elektroshock"" turned out to be a bit too OP (extremely handy for foighting Big Daddies).I do have an issue with the health system. Even with a full inventory of health kits, I happened to die alot because there is little to no feedback when you're low on health. The bar isn't visible enough due to its rather small size and is in my opinion badly positioned (upper left corner). It would have been nice if the player was given the option to customize the HUD to their likings.The game happened to run very badly on my PC. It crashed alot, never saved my settings and featured horrid mouse acceleratrion issues. The DX10 features are responsible for Bioshock not working properly on newer machines, I advise to set the game to DX9 (add ""-dx9"" to the start options). Fixes for this game can be found on the PCGamingWiki.I had a lot of fun with Bioshock and can safely recommend it to anyone who like to play First Person Shooters.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ich war Anfangs etwas skeptisch über dieses Spiel, da ich Infinite vorher gespielt und nicht genossen habe. Gott sei Dank habe ich mich aber letztendlich doch zum Kauf des ersten Teils entschieden.Was mir an Bioshock sehr gefällt, ist die Art und Weise, wie die Geschichte und die Geschehnisse in Rapture erzählt oder besser, gezeigt werden. Infinite hatte meiner Meinung zuviele geskriptete Szenen, was mich sehr genervt hat, da mir einfach zu oft die Kontrolle über Booker entnommen wurde. Bioshock hingegen verzichtet auf diese Vorgehensweise und lässt den Spieler entscheiden, ob er einer Cutscene beiwohnen möchte oder nicht, was ich sehr begrüße. Zudem wartet das Spiel mit einer sehr fesselnden Handlung auf, welche den einen oder anderen zu überraschen vermag.Trotz veralteter Unreal Engine 2 sieht das Spiel fantastisch aus. Man bekommt sehr schöne (zum Teil auch sehr schaurige) Setpieces geboten. Ragdoll und Physikanimationen werden nur in 30FPS dargestellt, was nicht ins Gesamtbild passen möchte und schlecht aussieht. Das größte Problem des Spiels ist jedoch die niedrige FOV sowie das viel zu niedrige Waffen-FOV. Nach nur 5 Minuten habe ich große Übelkeit verspürt. Das Programm ""Flawless Widescreen"" ist hier zu empfehlen, mit dem man beide FOV-Optionen nach Belieben anpassen kann. Das Artdesign von Bioshock ist Irrational Games sehr gut gelungen und lässt das Spiel auch heute noch gut aussehen. Die Musik und Soundeffekte passen gut in das Spiel rein und verleihen es eine solide Atmospähre.Bioshocks' Gunplay ist passabel. Es wird dem Spiel ein üppiges Aresnal an Feuerwaffen und Plasmiden geboten. Die Feuerwaffen sind meiner Meinung nach etwas zu schwach, was einige Gegner zu echten Bulletsponges gemacht hat. Meine Favoriten waren die Rohrzange und die Schrotflinte, welche sich bei allen Situationen bewährt haben. Plasmide sind gut eingebunden und machen extrem viel Spaß anzuwenden, wobei die Fähigkeit ""Elektroshock"" doch ziemlich overpowered ist (extrem hilfreich gegen Big Daddies).Ein Kritikpunkt den ich habe ist das Gesundheitssystem. Trotz reichlichen Vorrat an Verbandskästen bin ich häufig abgekratzt aufgrund fehlendem Feedback bei niedriger Gesundheitsanzeige. Die Anzeige im HUD ist nicht gerade groß und meiner Meinung nach flasch positioniert (oben links). Wäre ganz nett gewesen, wenn man das HUD umgestalten könnte.Das Spiel hat am Anfang auf meinem Rechner Probleme gemacht. Es stürzte oft ab, hat meine Einstellungen nicht gespeichert und hatte extrem gräßliche Mausbeschleunigung. Die DX10 Features verursachen Probleme auf neuen Rechnern, deshalb rate ich Bioshock im DX9 Modus zu spielen (""-dx9"" in die Startoptionen einfügen). Im PCGamingWiki findet man alle Informationen und Fixes für das Spiel.Ich hatte auf jeden Fall sehr viel Spaß mit Bioshock und kann es jedem Spieler, der First Person Shooter mag, empfehlen.			"

												Calling the setting a character has become a cliché but Rapture, Bioshock's underwater city, is not only a character: it's the game's main character. In my journey through the game I've found myself much more interested in discovering the city's secrets and history than advancing the main plot. It's Ayn Rand's special halloween episode and it's great. The gameplay is a bit clumsy and I felt that were too many clashing systems that don't quite work together well. Still, it's one of the best games from last generation and I feel everyone should give it a try.			"

												Game has a very dark underwater theme but I like the overall visual effects and story line. This game does have a problem with contrast as the default brightness setting is intentional , I have to play this game in the dark in order to see it better. Brightness adjustment just makes the game washed out. Played best having your speakers up loud to simulate a movie theater. Don't have a subwoofer as residents of the mobile home park would go after me for loud noise. Bought during the Humble Bundle. Friend gifted me Bioshock 2 so I will play this next. Works great with the Logitech F310 gamepad in XINPUT Mode.			"

Product received for free
												I don’t know since when PC gamers become this picky and that difficult to impress, but this remastered version isn’t that bad, I feel it receives overwhelming negative reviews like this is not fair.Unlike a large number of steam users out there who have next-gen alien technology powered Titan weapons to fire, my pc is old and can’t launch most of the AAA titles games come out now days(I play AAA titles on console), I usually play some naïve pixel graphics games on my vantage skeleton PC . After reading so many thumb down reviews, I couldn’t stop wondering, ‘is this remastered version that bad?’ So I decided to give it a try myself to see it through. Thought it would not be able to launch since my PC barely reaches the minimum requirements to play. It turned out ironically. I got in game with no issues at all. It runs perfectly smooth on my PC, my key binding was just fine and did not encounter any functional break down. The sensation of the mouse is not at its best but far away from horrible to control. It did not mix up with my controller either. My game did not crash once. I arrived Repture safe and sound. Honestly, I’ve tried to experience any issues players here had raged, but I had met none. The only fair point so far I’ve agreed is: This version doesn’t look that much different from the original. But I wasn’t in the right place to grumble this, since if the graphics were improved to the next-gen level, I probably wouldn’t be able to launch this game by any chance.The developers have my respect and sympathy. They’ve made products for the most of their customers (original game owners including me) for free, now they are rampaging. Their new potential customers now are wondering around because the game got mixed reviews, their decisions are uncertain.Honestly, I’d say: If you don’t own Bioshock franchise and would like to get them, this remastered version is definitely better than the original ones. At least, they’ve added steam achievements for Bioshock 1 and pretty fun museum exhibition mode in game. Of course, if it had trading cards and badges and creepy profile background would be brilliant, but maybe they will add it later, who knows? As someone received these 2 remastered games for free, I thank the development team’s efforts and 2K to bring them here. I am not a fangirl of Bioshock franchise, but I knew it is a masterpiece. I don’t play many FPS games, but it doesn’t mean they are not good because my personal taste isn’t there.Scarlet’s Score: 8.0/10(I haven’t got enough time to play this game till the end, so I can’t give exact the full review of the gameplay. However, for a timeless FPS known as Bioshock, an 8 point is fair to where it’s standard lies)			"

												After hearing so much about this game over the years, I finally caved and bought the Triple Pack, probably one of the best purchases I've made. The narrative is engaging, gameplay mechanics are well-polished and the graphics hold up extremely well for a game released in '07. Would definitely recommend to those who want a great story-driven FPS.Also, for those experiencing issues with the resolution when you alt+tab or whatever, just change it to something else in the options then back to what you want.

												This game was refreshing and different when it came out back in 2007. Playing it for the first time on Xbox 360 back in 2009, it was unlike anything I had played before, and admittedly, since. It made such an impression on me that I jumped on the opportunity to buy it again on Steam and play it on the PC. It is easily the one of best story-driven FPS games I've played. It has a unique and creative atmosphere and story that in my opinion makes it one of the best games of the 2000's.  My only complaint is that it's not the longest of games, although most will likely get a longer play time than me as my steam record reflects my second playthough (most people's first playthoughs will most likely take 15-20 hrs). It's a no-brainer to buy, especially with the current sale price of $3.99. Add this masterpiece to your steam library.  "

												What can I say, best FPS out there in my opinion.This game has such an unique setting and gameplay that it really makes it stand out from other generic shooters. The story is well-written and amazing, and there's so many ways to beat up your enemies with the infinite weapon-plasmid combos that you'll never get bored.This PC port is very good, most people hate it for whatever reason but I'm okay with it. Of course, this game is way better when you play it on a console so if you still have your old 360 or PS3 go get it for that instead. I mean the port isn't bad at all but it's way better on a console.There's nothing much left to say, I'm not really the kind of guy who writes long reviews, so if you want a more in depth review, you should check the most helpful section instead. I'll just say this: what are you waiting for to buy this masterpiece?			"

												To say that this is my first experience with Bioshock would be a lie (I have well over .8 hours in the remaster and about 50 hours per other platform). I own multiple copies of this game for 3 platforms and for good reason: the atmosphere and story are really something to marvel at when it comes to a game. The combat, while after many replays can become somewhat repetative, but the ambiance of a slowly falling city that was once a dome on the rock is really something you have to feel. And feel you will with Bioshock, from excitement, to uncertainty, to fear to rage: you will feel the gamut of emotion while in game. Now, it is not without its faults, there are still bugs in both the original and the remaster so take that for what you will, but know that Bioshock is still a very viable, beautiful, and story rich shooter that everyone must experience it.

												A dynamic-ish single-player first-person shooter with role-playing games' elements, this game has a nice story underwater based on the '60s, inside a city built by man, which looked like it was an underwater haven...until, as the story tells, the ADAM was founded, which had the ability to manipulate DNA structures and give inhuman abilites, which corrupted it's inhabitants. My favorite part of the game is obtaining the ADAM, by fighting against the enchanced giants Bid Daddies (seen in the picture), and they're the guardians of the Little Sisters. Although I've played on the Hard difficulty, the easiest part of the entire game was the final boss.So, 8.5/10 for having the ability of combining logically realistic weapons with inhuman plasmid abilities and gene tonics, to make combos. Big Daddies, which are splitted into Bouncer (drill guy) and Rosie (guy with rifle-ish nail gun), and their Little Sisters, but negative points for easy final boss fight and a play-once game (unless you like to combine different combos).

Formal Rating : 9/10User Rating : Superb plot,INSTABUYDate of the review : 05/26/2014 Bioshock.Well,i played BI first and then i tried this one,and i can clearly admit that i enjoyed this one way more than Bioshock Infinite.Why?Strongest plot,strongest gameplay.I loved every second of my playthrough.I couldn't stop pressing F12,i took like 60 photos,because in every room,there was something interesting.A corpse,a painting,a quote,you know,these kind of things.Plus,this game got its creepy moments too.For example dead corpses which are not really dead,Or rooms with creepy stuff like,toilets with not-so-much-light,or weird statuary.Anyway,lets continue on the details.Plot : 10/101960, and you're flying over the Atlantic Ocean. One mysterious plane crash later, you're floating in the water, apparently the lone survivor, surrounded by the flaming wreckage of the aircraft. But there's a lighthouse on a tiny island just at the edge of your view.Your only chance is to get there.and so you do.inside,you find a submersible called bathysphere,which only purpose is to get you into the void of the sea.You don't have a choice,so you pull the trigger,the door closes,and you get down...down..There you find a secret city,underwater,named Rapture.An underwater city created by Andrew Ryan,with her own rules,her own freedom.However,everything has gone completely wrong.The city is vandalised,destroyed,and deadly lunatics roam the paths of Rapture.Apart from the phreaks,little girls named ''little sisters'' who contain the corrupting substance called ADAM move through the city with their ''protectors'' ''Big Daddies'',some people with a huge armor. Gameplay : 9/10Character Customization.nope,i dont mean you can change your appearance,however,you can find ''magical powers'' which can be shot out of your fingers,elemental powers such as electricity,Ice,fire,wind,even BEES (no,not the bees).Those powers consume EVE(mana).You can use your powers to control your enemies against your other enemies,you can use them to gain control of machines such as turrets.Also,you got a variety of purchasable talents,which variety from Engineering,Physical,and Combat talents.each kind of talents got a different use,for example there's a physical talents which makes you swing your melee weapon faster.You start with 2 slots for every category of talents,and you can purchase more from a Gatherer's Garden .There are 8 types of weapons,1 melee,6 guns,and a camera,which doesnt deal any damage,however it is used to take photographs of your enemies,so you can learn more about them and find new methods of dealing with them.There are 3 types of bullets for every gun,the normals,the armor penetration ones (against machines and big daddies) and the Antipersonnel ones which are useful against lunatics etc. You are also able to find weapon upgrade machines,which will make your weapons more powerful.You can hack vents,safes,or even turrets to help you defeat your enemies.There are 2 types of ''money'' the normal money,and the consumable ADAM which give you new powers or slots or even higher health.ADAM can be used on a different kind of vent,the Gatherer's Garden.You can consume ADAM from the little sister,by either saving them(you will earn less,however everytime you complete a series of 3 ''rescues'' you will earn a surprise),or killing them.Finally,You collect audio logs which help you understand more whats going on.Graphics : 8/10I cant say i went crazy about the graphics,however Bioshock got some nice atmosphere.Controls : 8/10Easy Enough,however at the begining i got a little confused.Audio : 10/10Incredible voice acting,making the game stick greatly with the plot.Great soundtracks,but the thing i loved about the audio,is the music which plays when you rescue a little sister.its both beautiful and cute.

												Never had the chance to play BioShock when it came out until I finally grab it on Steam recently. As far as horror sci-fi shooter goes, this one comes with a really intricate background and very good story telling. The world is absorbing and Rapture as an underwater city seems believeable with the ideology of a capitalist despot during the post WWII era refreshing yet sort of expected from that time. The content is awesome, but the controls is a tad bit clunky compared to modern FPS and the map is just horrendous to look at and use. Mind you, this was published around 10 yrs ago. The metascore on this one is accurate. A very good game indeed and great atmosphere with a compelling story. It is truly a worthwhile experience for anyone who is into sci-fi and don't mind a little bit of horror elements (not ghost, just biomedical mutants).			"

												I'm going to get this out of the way and just go ahead and say that this is literally the best game I have ever played. Yes, I said it. I don't say that about just any game. I saw friends casually playing this game years ago, and I always thought the Big Daddies you see everywhere looked pretty cool, but I never considered playing it due to its lack of hype. When I saw all three games go on sale as a package for 15$ on the Steam Holiday sale I had to do some research, because who can beat three full games for 15 bucks? Upon reading I found that people were upset at Bioshock Infinite's lack of quality compared to its predecessors, and the passion people had for the first two made the deal seem irresistable. I bought it and was instantly captivated by the creepy and atmospheric city of Rapture. I have only just begun playing the second game, but this game here is a masterpiece. P.S., if you play this, SEARCH FOR THE AUDIO LOGS! You're missing half of the game's beauty and story/immersiveness if you completely ignore these recordings that are scattered about rapture. BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Finally got around to finishing this tonight, it really is worth all the hype and acclaim it has received since 2007. Even though I only played through it this week, it still had a lot of jaw dropping moments, great atmosphere and one of the most vibrant and interesting worlds to explore in gaming.Rapture is a haunting and beutifal city with a tortured but fascinating past. The mutterings, screams and genral dialouge uttered by the Splicers adds a real element of mystery and creepiness to everything, and the 30's-50's music that plays on radios in game further adds to the story of a once grand, fallen city, while also introducing a new genaration to some truely great music!!!The ''plasmid'' system is a great addition to the game and has inspired several other games since, including Dishonered! Plasmids allow for a nice change from gunplay, which while fun, sometimes fails to satisfy. Choosing two plasmids to survive at a time adds some nice stratergy to the gameplay. It also stops the game feeling like it is too full of bullet sponges.The story has one of the most genuinely great twists in gaming, one I can honestly say I did NOT see coming, yet it didn't feel forced. The ingame audio logs are all worth listening too (unfortunely, background noise sometimes interfers with these and that is a problem) and add only more intriuge about Rapture's history.I attempted to play this back in July, but for whatever reason, it didn't grab me. I picked it up again this week, and couldn't put it down until I finished. For whatever reason, I complety misjudged this game, I really reccomend you play this masterpeice.			"

												Get yourself in a world of lunatics, in a big dark creepy city fully built underwater.Fight against insanity, claustrophobia, and  seriously crazy tern of events.This is game has very good graphics for its age. A small but sweet amount of weapons and 2 types of upgrades for each.Combine guns and special powers to burn your enemies, electrocute them, freeze them or fill them with holes from your specially crafted antiarmor bullets shot by a crazy looking 24-bullet revolver.Get through the world of Rapture, survive, hide and use hack and stealth mechanics or go on rampage mode and destroy and fry everything.Gather materials, craft stuff, research attack systems and special skills, upgrade your skills and weapons, choose your skills wisely and stay alive and sane no matter what.Beware of the enemy. Well designed AI for its time. Your enemies will seak ways to get wet if you light them up, they will seak places to hide, they will try to get themselves healed. They will swarm around you if you are not careful. And make sure to use any tech available to your benefit (hack turrets and cameras and make them friendly).There's no wonder why this game was so successful. Perfectly combine FPS action shooting with survival horror and a very good and interesting plot.Totally recommended and keep an eye for a complete franchise pack bundle!			"

												New to FPS on PC (so I beat the game on easy mode like the scrub I am)(easy mode is pretty friggin easy)First thing is that if there are a couple compatibility issues with Win10. You have to find the .exe file and run on compatibility mode for Windows XP 2/3. There's a couple other compatibility issues, and certain things will make your game (and computer) bug out, but it's not that big of a deal.The first thing you see when you start the game is an ominous entryway into the city; your plane crashes near some sort of towering structure, and the inside doesn't light up until you enter and the double doors close behind you. You slowly descend, the lights flickering on as you proceed, and eventually you get to the bathysphere and begin your journey to the underwater city.The opening scene is just *twang* mmm, delicious. The initial events set up the expectations for the rest of the game quite nicely. The entire city seems to be the worn-down remnants of some wonderfully fun place, very carnival-esque with all its glowing neon signs and jingles, but teeming with crazy people spiked on 'plasmids,' which I'm going to explain as genetic modifiers that allow you (and them) to use superhuman abilities such as zapping people with lightning, telekinesis, etc.For anyone looking to create a world of their own, play through Bioshock and pay attention - this game gets many things right.As for gameplay, you tend to have to do a lot of scavenging. Money, ammo, other resources, are all fairly difficult to come by unless you scrounge up everything in an area, including searching dead bodies and checking for weapons near recently deceased attackers (seriously, you have to figure out where they dropped the gun before you can claim their ammo). If you really do search everything and you're good about not wasting too many resources, you can end up with a lot of excess, so it's not too bad.The controls are a tad complicated because there are two 'categories' of weapons for you to use and multiple weapons for each category, but there are enough keyboard shortcuts that you can set everything up and be able to manage everything pretty quickly.There are a variety of ways to handle enemies that can be pretty fun - hacking security bots, for instance. Igniting gasoline makes everything catch on fire, water spreads lightning, and other such interactions. The only thing I don't really like is the security camera things. Maybe I'm just blind, but I have never spotted a security camera before it's spotted me, so I have to deal with these security bots for a full minute while the alarm blares, every single time.The story itself was underwhelming, because of its considerable reputation for having an incredible story. No, the story is not incredible. It's pretty good, definitely not bad. But not incredible. What I'm going to praise instead of the story is everything else - the aesthetics of the game are really good. The VOs, the characters, the sounds, the environment, and game progression compliment the story very well.Final score 8/10. Very fun gameplay, great voicework, a wonderfully carnival-esque world of horror, and also very nice music and sound. The song about some lady looking to buy a doggy with a waggily tale is still stuck in my head.btw pro tip - when you're choosing between 'harvest' and 'rescue,' always choose 'rescue.' It'll be worth it.NOTE: I got the entire BioShock collection for 16 freaking dollars, so I'm going to be very lenient about any mishaps.			"

												It's from far my favorite game, the history, the gameplay, the ideia about the plasmids and the whole rupture universe is amasing. The soundtrack is awesome and make the game much more imersive and unique, since the music is produce for this game. For the gameplay, here it's a tip, please pay attention on the history, seek the speakers, look the cut scenes, because it's really really good. I saw some critics about the vita chambers but i don't complain. So, if you like FPS games, with some stealth system, and an incridible history you really need play bioshock, not just the one, but the franchise.			"

												So, would you kindly let me share my thoughts  on this game with you? (informative, objective and spoiler free) - It is an older game, graphics is not great, but still pretty decent.- You will get lost a lot. This may be +, since it is not as linear as most games nowadays, but it can get annoying. - Voice acting is not very well made- Subtitles are different than voice, so if you like to play with subs on, it can get confusing- NPCs have too few lines they keep repeating, which can be annoying... I used to be an adventurer like you... - You will save a lotIf you still keep reading despite those minor setbacks, here is why the game is awesome+ The story, despite being confusing at first, will be explained throughout this game with a few awesome nad unexpected plot twists.+ The world continues in newer games, that I recommend to play, too. So if you like this game, you have more to look forward to+ The atmosphere is well made+ The gameplay itself is great, and quite intuitive. The game mechanics are good, too.+ You choose how to play - melee or ranged? Traps and smart play or full out assault? Kill everything you see or spare some lives? (this is slightly taken into consideration for the ending sequence)+ I did not encounter any bugs or crashes, running on PC win7 64bit.There is one problem with this game when you ALT+TAB that a lot of people complain about. It can get stuck in window-mode. However, this can be easily fixed by pressing ALT+ENTER once or twice. So do I recommend this game? It is too old to pay full price for, but if it is on sale, yes, definitely. You will not regret it.Now, would you kindly make the purchase?  "

This is a long review so if you just want a brief summary of why I recommend BioShock then skip to Results and read from there.2K Games blows my mind with a phenomenal first person shooter that goes above and beyond to provide an incredibly experience. BioShock does something magical, beyond gameplay it the complete and total mind-♥♥♥♥. Story:A plane crashes in the middle of the ocean and you are the sole survivor. As you are swimming from the wreckage you notice a small tower standing. What does the tower offer, but the amazing city of Rapture. The underwater city is completely in ruins and everyone is completely mad, but why and how will you ever escape. As you maintain communications with one other sane person it is up to you to make sure you both can make it out alive. Campaign:The campaign occurs across a variety of different areas as you take pods to go between. Each area even has multiple zones within it which can either be cross very quickly or can take a long time. The difficulty scales brilliantly in this game, and you can go from Easy to Hard depending on the experience you want from the game. With multiple endings, depending on if you save all the little sisters or kill more than one. The campaign puts you to the test with an amazing story, secrets through the game, and multiple puzzles/challenges. The campaign is long and has fourteen levels, which vary in length and even include epic boss fights that put you to your wits. Gameplay:BioShock plays like a typical First Person Shooter in many ways, but mixes in elements of RPGs to give variety. You gain these abilities called plasmids which you can buy with Adam (a type of in game currency) that can give you spells or tonics which give you buffs. There are many different weapons which throughout the game you can upgrade to make the weapons more efficient. There are seven weapons (wrench, pistol, machine gun, shotgun, grenade launcher, chemical thrower, and crossbow) and a camera. Unlike in Dead Rising the camera in this game actually serves a purpose, making you stronger/more effective against enemies as you take more pictures.  I personally played this game on hard and used the wrench almost the entire time without plasmids, so you can really choose the way you want to play with BioShock; either running through guns blazing, or taking your time sneaking around. Results:BioShock is an amazing game that offers a brilliant campaign, beautiful story, and amazing gameplay. This game mixes RPG, Puzzles, and FPS all gift wrapped into one fantastic game. You can have an epic struggle playing the game on hard or just enjoy the story playing on easy. There are loads of secret recordings spread throughout the game that develop the story and keep offering you more. BioShock is completely worth every penny even at full price. If you are frugal like me, then just wait till it’s on sale as it totally will.Pros:+Brilliant story that provides incredible replay value.+Amazing combat system that allows you to choose how you play. (Either melee, guns blazing, or shooting magic everywhere)+Loads of guns that allow you to mix your strategy, each with three different ammo types.+A camera that allows you to increase your character strengths.+A solid campaign with fifteen different levels.+Secret recordings that give you more elements to the story and create a deeper experience+Loads of different tonics which allow you to buff yourself and enhance your gameplay experience+Loads of different plasmids that allow you to shoot electricity, fire, ice, and even bees. Cons:-The volume for the recordings cannot be adjusted, they use the same levels as the gameplay volume. (In order to hear the recordings I had to crank up my speakers and hide in a corner)			"

												If you're wondering whether or not to buy this game, then the answer is this: YES, ABSOLUTELY !Now, I don't normally like shooters and scary games, where your enemies jump at you out of the blue but the trailers and screenshots from BioShock have always appealed to me and I finally decided to go through with the purchase. This turned to be one of my best gaming-related decisions so far. From the intro, the game had me captivated. I immediately loved the atmosphere of Rapture, with its amazing art-deco architecture, and various locations (after all years since its release, the game still looks great), I could almost feel how it must have felt to walk in the shoes of the protagonists. This feeling was further enhanced by the music... Ohh yes, the music. Nothing builds an eerie atmosphere better than hearing a pleasant old-shool song, played as if from a vinyl disc, while exploring a blood-stained, ruined city. The game mechanics? Here, there is little to mention apart from the fact that it's a solid, well-balanced shooter with some RPG entwined in it. You;ll have plenty of weapons, plasmids and genetic upgrades along the game but when all is said and done, you will end up using your three favourites. Hacking mini-games get a tiny bit boring after some time, but you can easily skip some of them with the help of items found along the way.As far as graphics are concerned, I can only say that Irrational Games made wonders with Unreal Engine 3 and even now, even with almost minimum level of details, the game looks great.Storywise, as far as video games are concerned - it's a masterpiece. If you don't play BioShock, you're missing out on a great story. and that's notwithstanding the fact that after the main plot twist (somewhere aobut 3/4 of a game) the plot loses its momentum a little.Quick summary of advantages:+amazing design and atmosphere of Rapture+great soundtrack (music and voiceover alike)+easy to master, entertaining combat with many possibilities to take down enemies+brilliant storyline and memorable characters+the game graphics did not age muchSome disadvantages:-rubbish map, unintuitive journal (although you won't use the latter too much)-if you don't like it - can give you a jump sometimes-only a few types of enemies-some artificial limitations - money cap, no plasmid+weapon combo...One additional thought. If you're anxious that BioShock might be too scary for your tastes: don't worry. Just pluck up the courage and force yourself through the first two locations (like I had to :D) and from there, it will go al lot smoother. There are much fewer scary moments in the further part of the game and when they do appear, you will be able to predict them with ease.So, coming back to the start: play BioShock, enjoy the story. You won't regret it and the memory of Rapture will stay with you for long.			"

												I am starting to write reviews for the games in my library and I declare this one as my first.  I will divide my reviews into three parts and a comments section to keep things standardized.  I will do my best to give candid and brief reviews. Bioshock Review(Story)Do you have a choice?  This is the question Bioshock asks.  The game takes place in 1960, in an underwater city called Rapture.  The city is falling apart as civil war rages among its citizens.  As a nameless protagonist (who winds up in Rapture due to an accident), you meet and help numerous people as you learn more about what happened to the city leading up to the war.  There are good and evil choices to make and multiple endings to the main story that reflect your decisions.  The dialogue is well written and voice acting phenomenal.      (Gameplay)Bioshock is a first person shooter with most combat taking place in close quarters areas.  You alternate between conventional fire arms and powers called ""plasmids"" that allow you to shoot electricity from your hand, throw objects, etc.  The weapons  have multiple ammo types/firing modes/uses that are acquired through upgrade stations.  Likewise, plasmids can be upgraded and all feel unique.  Multiple play styles are available: go in guns balzing, set traps for enemies to walk into, hack turrets so they fight with you, or take a stealth approach.  Ammo, health, and crafting supplies are acquired from looting or use of vending machines strewn about.  One mechanic the first two Bioshock games are known for is enemy research.  In Bioshock, research is accomplished through taking photographs of enemies and filling your research bar.  Every time you reach a new level of research, you gain a damage boost against that particular enemy.  Ammo can get scarce sometimes.(Design)The art-deco/1950's/1960's America decor are very well done here.  The advertisements, record player music, items, even the bottles all fit the time period. The game can get scary at times too due to the atmoshpere and noises you hear as you creep around.  Nearly every object has its own physics.  Glass bottles clink, suitcases float in the water, and fire leaves furniture (and enemies) charred.  The sound design is excellent, though I have an issue when gunfire starts where sounds cut out due to everything going on.                    (Final Comments)    As the first in the series, Bioshock is a great game with good controls, great writing, and one-of-a-kind atmosphere.  The twist of the story is legendary in my mind and the dialogue will leave an impression on you.  Now, would you kindly stop reading my review and dive into Rapture.			"

												I'll entertain you with a short story.I owned a PS2 when I was a kid. I only owned a couple of games, MLB '06 and a couple Guitar Hero games. Not a lot of real game games, y'know? I built my computer, this glorious, 1600 dollar computer that I put my heart and soul into. I got Steam, and my first sale was the summer sale this year.I saw the entire Bioshock franchise on sale for amazingly cheap prices, and of course I scooped them up. Bioshock feels like my first real game. It was my first real foray into gaming, my first real game. It's fantastic. The maps, the enemies, the narrative, the social commentary on the state of the gaming industry...it's all fantastic. It deserves its place on the lists of greatest games of all time.			"

This game is great, easily my favourite in the series and one of my favourite games ever!The gameplay is really fun and this is the most unique FPS ever. Plasmids are these things invented on Rapture and are great fun there are fire, ice, bee swarm and posess, combat is mixed between these plasmids, machines you can hack to help you and your guns and other weapons.It's set in the underwater city of Rapture and it is so beautiful even in the sate it's in. Splicers are people who got addicted to the plasmids and went crazy and you will see a lot of them throughout the game, just listening to them you can see how far gone they are.The story is really amazing about the rise and fall of Rapture, there are audio tapes that are actually really interesting if you take the time to listen and the BIG DADDY fights are great, you are fighting these huge things with drills for hands that just want to protect their little sisters in their eyes, splicers want to drain the sisters EVE to use plasmids by killing them, If you're not prepared these can kill you in seconds.The game lasts over 12 hours and not one part wasn't unique or frustrating.I would give this a 10/10, this is still one of my favourite games ever. Everyone should get this masterpiece.			"

												Bioshock is first-person shooter action game developed by Irrational Games, 2K known as Boston / Australia in 2007.The game takes place in the 60s. The player, Jack survives a plane crash and reaches the underwater city Rapture found in decay. There he must fight against mutated humans and capture the substance called ADAM inside little girls called Little Systers that are defended by powerful Divers called Big Daddies. This substance will let the player acquire genetic improvements .Bioshock was really surprising because it created a whole new world with incredible narrative. history is noteworthy . Despite maps are not huge, they have superlative art and there are so many things to do that you never get bored . Combat is frenetic, there are turrets and machines to be hacked that provide ammunition and resources , there are also hidden resources and tonics to search that provide a remarkable range of combat.Instead of just owning guns, machine guns, etc. , we find tonics fire , electric rays, clouds of bees or many other forms of attack. This mixed mechanism was fairly new and fun at the time and it succeded on a very good game, Dishonored (2012), that took this concept and adapted it well .The game has elements of stealth, survival horror and role. It also has an important political component simulating an ultra-capitalist alternative world in a city where there are no ethical dilemmas and took to end the arts , science and engineering , which led to its decline .It is one of the top ranked games of all time . It has two sequels. The bioshock 2 showing an ultra communist character and Bioshock infinite that develops in an aerial city. In Bioshock infinite political, religious and scientific plot led to the end in a very elaborate story. It´s still a must have game in 2016.The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. The windows version required DirectX 9.0c API.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ESPAÑOL--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bioshock es un videojuego de acción en primera persona desarrollado por Irrational Games, conocida como 2K Boston/Australia en 2007.El juego transcurre en los 60.

Si bien los mapas no son enormes, presentan un arte superlativo y hay tantas cosas que hacer que uno nunca se aburre. El combate es frenético, hay que hackear torretas y máquinas que brindan municiones y recursos, hay recursos ocultos para buscar y los tónicos brindan una variedad notoria al combate.En lugar de solo poseer pistolas, ametralladoras, etc, nos encontramos con tónicos de fuego, rayos eléctricos, nubes de abejas u muchas otras formas de ataque.  Este mecanismo mixto de combate fue bastante novedoso y diria que el muy buen juego Dishonored de 2012 tomó este concepto y lo adaptó muy bien.El juego posee elementos de sigilo, survival horror y rol. Además posee un importante componente político simulando una mundo alternativo en una ciudad ultracapitalista donde no hay dilemas éticos y se llevaron al extremo las artes, la ciencia y la ingeniería, lo que llevó a su decadencia. Es uno de los juegos mejor rankeados de todos los tiempos. Posee dos secuelas. El bioshock 2 que muestra un personaje ultra comunista y el Bioshock infinite que se desarrolla en una ciudad aérea y hay componentes políticos, religiosos y científicos  llevados al extremo en una historia muy elaborada. Es todavía un juego imprescindible en 2016.El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360. La versión de windows requería la API DirectX 9.0c			"

												While most certainly BioShock has a unique style of an Underwater City and that enthralling 50's-60's Jazz and Blues culture, the game is not ideal...   It makes some attempts to include philosphy, allusions and metaphors in it's story. However they meet a dead end. None of them are adequately explained and thus the story lacks a certain emotional meaning, espcially when it comes to the ""dilemma"" of saving the little sisters or ripping their hearts out both of which lead to two rather unsatisfying endings... I fell in love with the atmosphere and the setting, but I can't do more than just feel sad that it's just a shooter - and the shooting part feeling much more like Oblivion, the gunplay representing a very weak part of the game as a whole. Some of the Plasmids were cool, but once again - I found myself using only 2 or 3 for the most part since a lot of the abilities they give are just either ruled out by your playstyle or simply poorly balanced and totaly useless. The difficulty is also another issue. You litteraly have no need to put it on Hard more or Medium because you automatically respawn in a Vite-Chamber after your Hit Points are gone. What that means is that you don't have to use your health pack  -""First Aid Kits""because you can simply kill enemies through perseverance as it doesn't alter their health.  For this reason I found myself just rushing through the game on Easy, as the only thing that Medium and Hard consumes is your real-world time spent on the walkthrough. I definately advise you to try it, but not at full price. And definately don't expect a revolution - it has good voice acting, unique setpieces in it's narative - which seem to be painfully familiar with System Shock 2 and rather intriguing characters - yet it's far from perfect as critics claimed it to be...

My Thoughts/About The Game  This game is beautiful. It's a masterpiece, and I will never forget the happy ending I got when the game was finished. I felt like I couldn't write a review yet until I completed the game. I was actually not going to buy this game since it is a horror game. However, I pulled myself through and I was having a hell of a time. This game is old, but the game feels like it's new.Pros:+ Amazing graphics+ Multiple endings+ Story is compelling+ Have the ability to hack machines+ Arsenal, loads of weapons+ Controls are easy to use+ Upgrade powers and weaponsCons:- Certain plasmids have unfair advantages- Crashes due to Unreal engine, sometimes- Big Daddies become easier to deal with later on because of weapons such as the chemical thrower. It gives unfair advantages- Annoying bug that changes your settings back to normal when you changed them for your desire In Conclusion  What I put in the cons is probably mostly false since I couldn't really find any bad reason to not buy this game. The story, the arsenal of weapons and powers are what kept me coming back to this game. I can't compare this game to Bioshock 2 and Infinite because I haven't played them. Finally,  I recommend  this game to anyone who is new or experienced into shooters.			"

												I LOVED this game! Just finished playing it for the first time, and I have to say, it was amazing. It's about 6 years old, but still thrills to the bone! Rarely do you find such a smart shooter with RPG elements, climactic storytelling and great voice acting. Danger lurks around each corner in Rapture, but you don't feel powerless, just in need of constant survival. I liked how the game forced you into being efficient with your ammo, and made you use each weapon for different situations. I also liked the way the plot unfolded, not with an overwhelming surge of information, but with pieces of the puzzle which made sense in the end. I can't believe it took me so long to play Bioshock, and I can't wait to go through the sequel! Buy it, It's cheap, It's great, It's creepy!			"

												This is a great game. Everything from the combat is fun and responsive, and exploring the dark and wet tunnels of Rapture is awesome. The enemies are great, from the splicers to the Little Sisters and their Big Daddy defenders. But I have only one serious problem with this game. The devs did not joke around when it came to ammunition. The game claims that I need to gather Adam from the Little Sisters, but with what? Those Big Daddies are very powerful. Taking them down chews through your ammo like nothing! . Finding ammo is so difficult, often I find myself constantly dying while sniffing around for health, money and ammo. At least your enemies don't regen health when you respawn. It makes taking them down so much easier. Buying ammo from the vending machines will drain your money faster than you can say ""Screw you Rapture"". Why is the wrench such a pathetic weapon? It does no damage whatsoever. Melee is important in games. I found myself dying countless times because I have no ammo for my other guns, and I only have the wrench. It does nothing, I repeat, NOTHING! (except for freezing enemies, but I'd rather use the chemical thrower for that.)And also, what is up with the boring, tedious hacking mechanics? Why do you have to connect pipes to get fluid to go from input to output. It's so boring and if you don't do it right, you lose most of your health. Regardless, a fantastic game. Great story and narrative. Shooting mechanics need a bit of tweaking.If you want to start a fresh new series, this is the start of an awesome series of games.			"

I recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and games that use creepy atmospheres.  The gunplay is great, but the plasmids take the cake as one of the best things about the game.

												I definately recommend buying this game. Almost everything about this game is very well done, and refreshing. Rapture brings a very creepy and mysterious atmosphere, as well as a huge variety of characters. The story telling is excellent and will keep you motivated to continue. Gameplay mechanics like tonics and optional bosses that allow you to enhance your character work very well with the game, and give it a strong sense of progression. It also allows you develope your playstyle. The replay value is moderate-high.			"

												BioShock is more than just a normal first-person shooter. The combat system is innovative, the game design suits the late 1960s style of the story and the story itself is stunning. By combining classic shooter elements, short to long ranged weapons, and a lot of different skills this fps is quite innovative. The skills enable the player to develope his own playstyle, either forcing your enemies to fight each other, or being center of the combat and shock, burn or freeze them yourself, both is possible. In addition to this every weapon and skill is upgradeable at different vending machines. This brings me to another key feature of the game, hacking. Nearly every electronic device such as vending machines, safes, doors and security bots can be hacked. Nevertheless, the crucial element is the story. The story is set in the 1960s and takes place in the underwater city Rapture, where the player encounters different charackters, one being more crazy than the other. The game creates a dark atmosphere with moments of horror, which underline the plot. All in all, BioShock is still worth its money!			"

												This game is absolutely remarkable, In terms of the emotions you will experience, the plots twists you go through and the bold characters you encounter. It is essentially a morality game and so it forces you to make crucial decisions of which both effect you, the outcome of the game, characters around you and most importantly the power you will possess. Everything in Rapture is destroyed with mere intentions that just go wrong, leaving a dystopian world of chaos and greed. Ever character appears to be what they are because of rapture and their involvement with it, therefore, no one is technically 'evil' just flawed on different levels. Probably the standout element of Bioshock is the ability to modify your genetic make-up to develop new weapons and abilities - for instance, early on you gain the ability to fire lightning bolts from your hands, which can then be used on a simple level to stun enemies, rendering them more vulnerable to a solid whack with the wrench, or on a more strategic level to electrify water and take out multiple enemies, fry electrical devices, or enrage the Big Daddies and goad them into attacking other bad guys. Later on you can adopt more macabre plasmids, like the ability to fire swarms of bees, and passive skills like the power to tap into electronic devices. "

I had no idea what this game was about, just saw FPS and thought Great another shooter that I'll never complete. I was so wrong. The game has so many elements to it - which at first seem tough, but they give such a different playing experience. It's suspense with an edge that just makes you keep playing. After completeing this one I cannot wait to play the other ones! A definite buy to anyone who hasn't.It may sound cliche but 10/10 "

 Could not pass up the Triple Package Deal of all the Bioshock games for $10.00 during spring sale. What a freaking steal! In my book, Bioshock still holds up to other FPS of today and this game was released in 2007!After 13 hours of outragous game play (and still playing), what I say about Bioshock is A Twisted Macabre from the devs of Irrational Games. I expect to see Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney Jr. appear in this game.Creepy sounds. This must be played with a quality head set or booming speakers and yes, turn out the lights when playing.Love this game like a good spooky moive of the 1930's. A Macabre of a game! You must get when on sale.			"

												“Happy we'll be beyond the sea, And never again I'll go sailing.”	Oh Bioshock. What is there I can’t say about it? Arguably one of the greatest games and narratives of the twenty-first century, the game merges all there is that exemplifies the first person shooter, but also mixes in aspects of grandiose utopian-turned-dystopian society with its own unique culture you discover on your own. Because of all of these elements, it’s no question that Bioshock could be easily, and is, considered a modern masterpiece.	Developed and produced by 2K Games, BioShock was released in the summer of 2007 and caused a stir in the industry. Up until that point, first person shooters were a primarily guilty-pleasure game about going online and just shooting people for the heck of it. BioShock, however, changed this system by doing away with multiplayer aspects (until BioShock 2, of course) and instead focused on the player’s environment and the experiences this environment yielded, which were innumerable by the conclusion. By featuring an extensive pseudo-open world environment that slowly explained itself through plot elements and self-discovery, Rapture enraptured you (pun intended) with its beautiful natural surroundings in stark contrast to its crippled ruins of a once great society.	Your character, solely named “Jack”, wakes in the ocean after a plane crash that left him as the sole survivor. After swimming around and out of the debris, you come across a mysterious lighthouse, into which you proceed. You then enter a miniature submarine, which in turn takes you deep below the sea and finally to Rapture. A once grand society that was built upon the dreams of the 1940’s business tycoon Andrew Ryan in order to escape the dangers and restrictions of the Cold War, Rapture is found to be overrun by mutated men and women that kill anything that moves (a result of genetic “splicing”), bandits and thieves, and Big Daddy’s accompanied by their Little Sisters, whom in turn once provided the society with its fueling for genetic experiments. Through twists and turns, fights and discovery, and arguably one of the greatest plot twists of gaming history, Jack discovers himself as a person, his mysterious past, and the dark secrets that lead to Rapture’s inevitable demise. With memorable characters that describe the city and its populous through their actions, BioShock provides lasting memories and thoughts for anyone that cares to explore it.	As for the game itself, the action is consistently entertaining and serves to keep you busy at all times. Through its addicting combat and evolving story one can easily dunk a good four hours into a single sitting and even still not find themselves halfway through the narrative. With several weapons, the action can be dynamically changed with a single button press and create a more diverse combat scenario. Likewise, with a countless supply of genetic powers named Plasmids the player can fully manipulate themselves, the environment, and even their enemies. The Plasmid system itself was revolutionary of the genre, by producing a sense of combat that doesn’t just revolve around blasting people to bits with shotguns and rockets, but instead using your own body to do the same thing, but in a flashier way.	Regarding technicalities and faults, I only have really minor complaints about the game as a whole. First off, the hacking system (in which the player hacks into devices and provides access to machines) is the most commonly addressed flaw in this game. By forcing the player into taking themselves out of the combat and playing a simplistically boring puzzle game the game breaks its greatest strength: immersion into the environment. My only other real complaint is the mission system, where it almost feels repetitive. Go grab this, kill these people first, take pictures of these, kill these people first, etc. While still fun and well executed, the game can slowly get repetitive, but right when it becomes noticeable the story changes once again and restarts this cycle, cleaning the slate and making it fun once again. The Rundown	Overall, BioShock is by no means a perfect game, but essentially there is no such thing. What one finds amazing, another can find boring, however BioShock provides an experience that anyone, even those that don’t enjoy shooters, should give a shot (yes, pun intended again) due to its grotesquely beautiful environment, contemptibly loved characters, and immoral wonders that serve a testament to the human race even now that reigns supreme as my favorite game to this day.Pros: -Amazing story and environment-Wide variety of combat scenarios-Vivid and complex linear/pseudo-open world Cons:-Slowly repetitive aspects-Them hacking games thoughThe Rate: 9.5/10			"

 Great game, for its time I remember when BioShock first came out and me and my older brother were in awe at how amazing it looked as the plane crashes into the ocean and flames engulf your vision in that opening cut-scene, we thought that this was the best looking a video game would ever get.A lot of time has gone by since then, and we were wrong, However this game is still really good and has stood the test of time. This game has a great story that can be progressed even further with the use of the audio logs scattered around the landscape and the game play mechanics are still outstanding and unique to this day, the use of plasmids and lack of ammo makes for some very thought provoking moments.The roar of the Big Daddys coupled with the soft murmurs of dialog from the Little Sisters from another room evoke a feeling of fear as you remember the last encounter that left you with little to no ammo or eve. In this game you definitely feel like you are nothing and could just be destroyed by anything any second, and this is very rare for games to do these days and is a great thing to experience.BioShock excels at evoking feelings whether it be the sadness or regret of harvesting a little sister or the nice feeling you get when you rescue a little sister and she runs off after thanking you profusely. But this game is somewhat unforgiving to you if you are yet to decide which route you want to take. Spoiler-Free Tip If you want a good ending, do not harvest any little sisters. SAVE THEM ALL.I harvested two and I was considered evil by the games standards which is something that I found disappointing as I thought there might be a system that would tally a ratio of harvests to rescues but that is not the case.Just remember: SAVE THEM ALLThere are also a few game-breaking glitches where alt+tab'ing will sometimes mess with the resolution or make it crash, I also came across a bug where the game lost 3 hours or so of save-games so I was forced back, and the game also crashed on the final cut-scene forcing me to replay the last section.Definitely worth playing, even today, you might just want to change some controls but after that you're good to go.tl;dr: Great game, even for today's standards, a bit unforgiving, and a bit buggy. Tends to crash. Still really good!			"

Even though I have beat this game about 3 times now I can still see myself playing it again in the future just for that fun gameplay and story.

												so you wonder if you should buy this? well this is one of those games that defined a generation of games lots of games of the last generation was influnced by this great game. This game has a great story kind of linear but also with certain choices to change the story abit, there is also incredible art direction in this game if you like artwork this game will be a treat for the eyes.It takes place in a city called Rapture free of mans traditional ideals and it's built under the ocean and there are mysteries and horrors that await, you can modify weapons and it will alter the way they look which is cool also you get these interesting power ups known as plasmids they range from fire to telekinetic ability to turning foes against one another,hack vending machines and so on it even has some content you might miss the first time around i highly recommend you kindly buy this game but while it may have rpg elements dont expect something like fallout, if you ever played system shock 2 then you will know what i mean this is the spiritual successor of system shock 2 and a great one at that the story the gameplay and art and sound make this game a treat for those who appreciate a very story rich unique game			"

												I've never really thought much of this game. I bought it to give it a second chance. Let's take a look how good it was.Visually the game is good. The environment looks fine, but models are rather strange. Sounds are average, but the game has some nice songs playing from jukeboxes, radios etc. which fits the setting. Gameplay is quite awkward. Even though it has some good features (hacking, plasmids), the action itself doesn't work that great. Enemies run around like idiots, which makes them difficult to hit. You never have enough ammo, but you can buy that from vending machines. Weapons can also be upgraded, though effectivity of these upgrades is sometimes questionable. Sometimes the game tends to be frustrating, but mostly it's alright. But then comes one part where you keep losing your maximum health. It happens quite often, like every five minutes. Developers probably thought it was a good idea to punish you for exploring instead of rushing towards the goal to stop this health loss. They were wrong. Thankfully, you can explore what you missed later after you find a solution for this situation, and even your health gets back to normal.And the last thing to rate - the story. Hard to say anything about it since you hardly experience it directly. In order to get information about Rapture's past events, you must collect tape recorders and they slowly, like pieces of puzzle, let you see the whole picture. It's an interesting way to tell the story. The story itself seems above average.Even though it didn't get to the list of my most favourite titles, the game as a whole isn't bad. Rapture has a very original atmosphere and the architecture along with music makes the place feel alive. This game's weakest point is the gameplay, but it still is quite fun. Let's just hope the developers learned from some of their mistakes and polished the other two Bioshock games more.			"

												Great little game, full of atmosphere, creepy voices and jump out of your skin moments. I put off playing it for a long time and unfortunately was too far through it to wait for the new updated edition. It seemed a lot longer than the 18 hours I have put into it and that includes me not searching every nook and cranny. There is at least a few more hours you could add to that not including replaying at harder difficulty.A good story with twists and lots of lore items (radio recordings) to fill in the background as you play.A rare gem. I would recommend only playing at night, on your own with some decent surround sound to get the juices flowing.			"

												You play as Jack (I had no idea this was the protagonist's name until I read it later) who never talks except for one line at the beginning intro. Your plane crashes next to a light house and you, for some reason, enter and explore Rapture.The game has too many bugs and crashes. If you look deep into Google enough, you'll probably solve them. But it's a little frustrating when you have to keep trying to find solution to all the crashing. The gameplay is really plain. It's your average shooter in a singleplayer game except you have some magic called ADAM. I found that a lot of the ADAM skills and other passive skills were not needed. I really only focused on just using guns, but that's just my playthrough of it. I felt the ADAM skills were only needed to stun enemies for a second. The real reason why I'd only recommened this game is for the story. A lot of times I was anxious and paranoid for any enemies that might be crawling around, but I also felt sad for them. I kept feeling depressed after hearing the recordings that are left behind by previous Rapture citizens, the Little Sisters, and especially Sander Cohen. Out of all the games I've played, this guy was the craziest yet funniest villains I've encountered.Overall: I have to give this 8/10The whole time I've kept asking myself as the protagonist, ""Why the hell am I doing all this crap?"" It's not until at the end when everything is revealed, which blew my mind. But there are too many pobrlems  with the crashing, the glitchy audio, and the mouse acceleration. However; I'd recommend this game for the lore and the environment. So would you kindly play this game?Also, I'd recommend you look wikipedia the history and story after finishing the game.			"

												A single-player only, story driven First Person Shooter with an imaginative setting and story. It took me 29 hours to beat it on hard, first try, 100% completion. If you're not as... thorough... as I am, then you ought to be able to beat it in 15-20 hours or so.I'd rate it pretty highly.BioShock puts you in the shoes of a survivor of a mid-ocean plane crash. With no where else to go, you swim to a nearby lighthouse but... why is it there?The game was designed for consoles so this is a PC-port. If you use a controller, you'll be in good hands. If you prefer the mouse and keyboard, then you'll probably want to fiddle with the .ini files in order to ""fix"" the mouse control. To do this, run the game once, and close it. Now, navigate to your documents folder and find the ""AppData"" folder. It is hidden so make sure you are showing hidden files in Windows. You're looking for the folder: [username]\AppData\Roaming\BioshockIn there, you'll find a user.ini and a bioshock.ini file. In the user.ini file find/add the following lines: (you can change the MouseAccelThreshold to 1.0 if you'd like some acceleration)MouseSmoothingMode=0MouseAccelThreshold=0.0 In the bioshock.ini file find/add the following lines: (they appear twice each, so make sure to set both to false)CaptureMouse=FalseReduceMouseLag=FalseDoubleBufferMouseLag=FalseIf the game ever crashes on you (which it will if you alt-tab or if you use the Steam overlay too many times), then these two files will be overwritten with a default file (bye bye custom controls =/ )To circumvent this, make a copy of these two files after you set up your graphics/sound/control options. If the game crashes, relaunch it, close it, and copy your backup files over the existing user.ini and bioshock.ini files to quickly restore your settings.Anyways, once your mouse settings are good to go the gameplay is great, and the story is engaging. If you haven't played this game yet then you're missing out. Have fun!			"

 Could not pass up the Triple Package Deal of all the Bioshock games for $10.00 during spring sale. What a freaking steal! In my book, Bioshock still holds up to other FPS of today and this game was released in 2007!After 13 hours of outragous game play (and still playing), what I say about Bioshock is A Twisted Macabre from the devs of Irrational Games. I expect to see Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney Jr. appear in this game.Creepy sounds. This must be played with a quality head set or booming speakers and yes, turn out the lights when playing.Love this game like a good spooky moive of the 1930's. A Macabre of a game! You must get when on sale.			"

												Describing in a few lines this video game is an undertaking really tricky. A masterpiece that manages to renew the genre FPS giving a variety tactic very viable and that can give you a slidable gameplay that leaves you satisfied. But most of the positive evaluation goes to what is typically the contour but that is the real reason that makes this game a masterpiece: the ambiance, the music and especially the wonderful and intriguing history. A game that deserves to be in the library of a gamer and also in his heart.			"

												“Happy we'll be beyond the sea, And never again I'll go sailing.”	Oh Bioshock. What is there I can’t say about it? Arguably one of the greatest games and narratives of the twenty-first century, the game merges all there is that exemplifies the first person shooter, but also mixes in aspects of grandiose utopian-turned-dystopian society with its own unique culture you discover on your own. Because of all of these elements, it’s no question that Bioshock could be easily, and is, considered a modern masterpiece.	Developed and produced by 2K Games, BioShock was released in the summer of 2007 and caused a stir in the industry. Up until that point, first person shooters were a primarily guilty-pleasure game about going online and just shooting people for the heck of it. BioShock, however, changed this system by doing away with multiplayer aspects (until BioShock 2, of course) and instead focused on the player’s environment and the experiences this environment yielded, which were innumerable by the conclusion. By featuring an extensive pseudo-open world environment that slowly explained itself through plot elements and self-discovery, Rapture enraptured you (pun intended) with its beautiful natural surroundings in stark contrast to its crippled ruins of a once great society.	Your character, solely named “Jack”, wakes in the ocean after a plane crash that left him as the sole survivor. After swimming around and out of the debris, you come across a mysterious lighthouse, into which you proceed. You then enter a miniature submarine, which in turn takes you deep below the sea and finally to Rapture. A once grand society that was built upon the dreams of the 1940’s business tycoon Andrew Ryan in order to escape the dangers and restrictions of the Cold War, Rapture is found to be overrun by mutated men and women that kill anything that moves (a result of genetic “splicing”), bandits and thieves, and Big Daddy’s accompanied by their Little Sisters, whom in turn once provided the society with its fueling for genetic experiments. Through twists and turns, fights and discovery, and arguably one of the greatest plot twists of gaming history, Jack discovers himself as a person, his mysterious past, and the dark secrets that lead to Rapture’s inevitable demise. With memorable characters that describe the city and its populous through their actions, BioShock provides lasting memories and thoughts for anyone that cares to explore it.	As for the game itself, the action is consistently entertaining and serves to keep you busy at all times. Through its addicting combat and evolving story one can easily dunk a good four hours into a single sitting and even still not find themselves halfway through the narrative. With several weapons, the action can be dynamically changed with a single button press and create a more diverse combat scenario. Likewise, with a countless supply of genetic powers named Plasmids the player can fully manipulate themselves, the environment, and even their enemies. The Plasmid system itself was revolutionary of the genre, by producing a sense of combat that doesn’t just revolve around blasting people to bits with shotguns and rockets, but instead using your own body to do the same thing, but in a flashier way.	Regarding technicalities and faults, I only have really minor complaints about the game as a whole. First off, the hacking system (in which the player hacks into devices and provides access to machines) is the most commonly addressed flaw in this game. By forcing the player into taking themselves out of the combat and playing a simplistically boring puzzle game the game breaks its greatest strength: immersion into the environment. My only other real complaint is the mission system, where it almost feels repetitive. Go grab this, kill these people first, take pictures of these, kill these people first, etc. While still fun and well executed, the game can slowly get repetitive, but right when it becomes noticeable the story changes once again and restarts this cycle, cleaning the slate and making it fun once again. The Rundown	Overall, BioShock is by no means a perfect game, but essentially there is no such thing. What one finds amazing, another can find boring, however BioShock provides an experience that anyone, even those that don’t enjoy shooters, should give a shot (yes, pun intended again) due to its grotesquely beautiful environment, contemptibly loved characters, and immoral wonders that serve a testament to the human race even now that reigns supreme as my favorite game to this day.Pros: -Amazing story and environment-Wide variety of combat scenarios-Vivid and complex linear/pseudo-open world Cons:-Slowly repetitive aspects-Them hacking games thoughThe Rate: 9.5/10			"

												This GAME!!! I shied away from it for a long time as I detest most shooter type games feeling that good suspense and horror is based on story and powerlessness of the main character.... But I was wrong! Not only is this game thick with well written themes, the gunplay is actually fun and doesnt wreck the rest of the game by consuming it with points, getting kills, or other such nonsense. The main character survives a plane crash only to find himself in some sort of underwater 'utopia' built by a man of science and industry. But as our main character discovers quite quickly, things have gone very wrong down in Rapture and he will be lucky to get out in one piece. Beautifully rendered using Art Deco motifs and music from the 1950s, this game is imaginative, brilliant, fun and I honestly cannot think of a single problem with it. It plays smoothly and without a glitch on my 300$ Del laptop. If you have not had the pleasure of discovering this game, do yourself a big favor and get it! Absolutely awesome~ 10/10 for game play, writing, graphics, sound and overall feel of the game in general.			"

												All the elements of a great game come together here to make Bioshock.  The graphic style is highly creative and distinct from other games.  You are surrounded by an early 1900s feeling with music from the era and architectural elements of the era as well.  The characters are absolutely nuts in a bio-enhanced way and they aren't too stupid either.  They run away to get health, sneak up on you by crawling on the ceiling.  It's actually quite creepy because of the atmosphere and the characters (friend and foe) that you meet through your journey.  The story isn't wonderful throughout the game, but the beginning and the ending (or rather endings) is rather powerful and rewarding.  Check it out, I had loads of fun, though its not for the squeamish, especially when it comes to harvesting little sisters.			"

												BioShock is more than just a normal first-person shooter. The combat system is innovative, the game design suits the late 1960s style of the story and the story itself is stunning. By combining classic shooter elements, short to long ranged weapons, and a lot of different skills this fps is quite innovative. The skills enable the player to develope his own playstyle, either forcing your enemies to fight each other, or being center of the combat and shock, burn or freeze them yourself, both is possible. In addition to this every weapon and skill is upgradeable at different vending machines. This brings me to another key feature of the game, hacking. Nearly every electronic device such as vending machines, safes, doors and security bots can be hacked. Nevertheless, the crucial element is the story. The story is set in the 1960s and takes place in the underwater city Rapture, where the player encounters different charackters, one being more crazy than the other. The game creates a dark atmosphere with moments of horror, which underline the plot. All in all, BioShock is still worth its money!			"

												This game is absolutely remarkable, In terms of the emotions you will experience, the plots twists you go through and the bold characters you encounter. It is essentially a morality game and so it forces you to make crucial decisions of which both effect you, the outcome of the game, characters around you and most importantly the power you will possess. Everything in Rapture is destroyed with mere intentions that just go wrong, leaving a dystopian world of chaos and greed. Ever character appears to be what they are because of rapture and their involvement with it, therefore, no one is technically 'evil' just flawed on different levels. Probably the standout element of Bioshock is the ability to modify your genetic make-up to develop new weapons and abilities - for instance, early on you gain the ability to fire lightning bolts from your hands, which can then be used on a simple level to stun enemies, rendering them more vulnerable to a solid whack with the wrench, or on a more strategic level to electrify water and take out multiple enemies, fry electrical devices, or enrage the Big Daddies and goad them into attacking other bad guys. Later on you can adopt more macabre plasmids, like the ability to fire swarms of bees, and passive skills like the power to tap into electronic devices. "

The game has so many elements to it - which at first seem tough, but they give such a different playing experience. It's suspense with an edge that just makes you keep playing.

												Bioshock is a great game with a great story line. However I find that the steam version, despite trying some fixes to sort these issues out I find the game freezes then crashes a lot, whether this is because of the games age or not I find this makes the game playable for about 10 minutes before having to restart the whole game through steam. Because of these issues the game for me has become more of a hassle to play rather than a fun game to complete. I would recommend the game if you can get it to play without these issues but as I have found no fix yet I can't enjoy the game myself.			"

												Well... Where do I start? The story starts with you, on a plane which somehow crashed into the sea and near a lighthouse.. It seems you're the only one that survives the crash and having no choice, you went inside the lighthouse and found a bathysphere.. Looks good enough, when you came down and found out that you were going to an underwater city called rapture where at first glance looks like an utopia, but hides a more sinister background. Until here, I feel that the game follows the traditional line of FPS games. I have to admit, the graphics, music, and ambience was spot on. While those are factors that helps to improve game experience, I myself gave a higher emphasis on great story and plot rather than just aim and shoot. As the story progresses, you will make choices such as deciding whether to (Spoiler) harvest or save the little sisters. Either one of those choices would impact the gameplay in a way and also (Spoiler) the ending as well. Nevertheless, as you progressed, you realised that what you perceived as the truth... might not be the right one after all. After a quite lengthy process to reach what I thought was the end, instead I was given the shock of my life (Yes, that came out of nowhere). If you paid attention, you could see it happening, but you never thought it would be the crucial factor! Then came what I think is the weaker part of the game which are close to the end.. The boss battles was suprisingly not that difficult and the ending.. Well, even though I am glad my choices are correct, for some reason I wanted more (probably I hope I would get more explanation in Bioshock 2 and Infinite).To be honest, I've heard of bioshock but never had the chance to play it until it was on sale (3 games for 13$). But after I played it, this game basically was an eye-opener. I had played many FPS games and not one game, have such amazing combination of all the factors that made the game not just great, but also potentially I could call a cult classic. The game also introduced the music nicely, which opened my music sense to old songs from the 40s and 50s. Just like GTA opened my ears to spanish, classical, rock, rap, hip hop, and country music, this game allows me to listen and appreciate songs that baby boomers or traditional generations listen to.All in all, I would give this game 9.4 / 10. This was that gem, that rare find in the sea of mud where contrary to popular belief, FPS games can also have amazing storyline and plot while having (during its time) a unique combat system.This is easily one of my top 3 games of all time (which might change as I haven't played 2 and Infinite + the dlc!)Now, would you kindly buy and play this game?

												Bioshock 1, the spiritual sucessor to System Shock and keeping most of the creepyness of its forefather intact. *SPOILERS PRESENT*Lets talk about the first thing we see in the game, the Graphics, the game just oozes with atmosphere and detail, when you walk around rapture you can see how people would live their lives, theres no randomly placed gap which would make you wonder how people got over it or why its there its modeled in a way that you'll walk around a place the same way you would if Rapture was real, and not falling apart, or have crazed looniees trying to kill you.That said there are a few low points about the graphics, some stuff feels VERY Copy and Paste, like i never enjoyed going into the bars because they felt too similar to each other, I might just be oblivious since I don't go to pubs in the real world but I would assume at least SOME differance also while I get this is meant to be a city that is collapsing from the inside but I think there is way too much grey around, its a typical gripe with FPS games in the last 10 or so years bit I still belive it to be a valid complaintNext the sound, Honestly I didn't find the music that good, thats not a bad thing though as the lack of music or the sound of old style music playing from old radios helps add to the atmosphere, I don't know if this is a glitch though but sometimes when there was alot of shooting and such random audio bits would cut off, a prime example would be when I fought the first ""boss"" of the game (not the Big Daddys) I had 2 Flying guns (Buzzers I called them) and a turret shooting at him, with an alarm going off and him shooting my buzzers, during the entire fight the turret and one of the buzzers would be shooting with no sound coming out, other times when grenades were thrown the Wistle sound would keep cutting out and starting back in, as I said it might be a glitch but still, Minor gripe, The voice acting is pretty well done as well though the lines are repeated a liiiiittle too much which can make the fighting a little grating to the earsThe Gameplay is your pretty solid run and gun kind of shooting game I played it on the hardest difficulty and I'm going to say right now, its too easy, the reason is because it is impossible to Game over unless your at the final boss, Got killed by a Big daddy? don't worry you respawned and the big daddy is at the same health it was when you died! it kills alot of that fear the game could have as your being hunter by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off diversuit man and your down to your last sliver of health and EVE, While we're talking about Big Daddys and Difficulty its pretty dissapointing that on the case you have the Driller Big Daddy (Bouncer) but on the hardest Difficulty you face primarly Rivet gun Big daddys (Rosie) it doesn't help when actually the Rosies are easier to kill then the Bouncers, sure you can get two shotted by a Rosie but at least you can keep your distance and snipe them while dodgeing the bullts, I honeestly found fighting the Rosies the worst part of the gameplay and fighting the Bouncers one of the best, because your constantly back peddling from the Bouncer while he is slowing you and charging at you, one of my fondest memories in the game is when a Duel between me and one of the Few Bouncers in the game ended with us both killing each other when we charged at each other in Melee, Fondest memory with the Rosies? eh, taking control of them.So I'll talk a bit about the Plasmids too, to be honest they seem like a mechanic that wasn't fleshed out in time, I only ever used 3 Plasmids (except when the game forced me to use other ones to progress or for plot convinience) Shock, Big Daddy Hypnotise and the Swarm, Shock just so I could hack turrets, Big Daddy Hypnotise because it was fun and Swarm just so I could yell out ""NOT THE BEES!"" The Plasmids are just ""there"" I never had a reason to use them except of course For Fun, Hacking or Quoting Nicholous Cage (all of which worth it in my eyes, especially the last one) Outsid of that I pretty much felt there was no real use for them, No enemies weak to a certain Plasmid no Deus Ex style of using a Plasmid to get through a place. As for the Passive Plasmids again there was no real point in some of them, the only ones I generally wanted more of was the Hacking ones because as the game went on Hacking got so hard to the point where it was literly impossible to hack without a few hacking plasmids.So lets move onto the Hacking...Honestly it stars fun but it gets boring, like REALLY boring This was basically how my Hacking excitement went*Start of game*Sweet! i can hack these Buzzers and turrets to fight for me!*1/4 through the game*Well Lemmi hack this Vending Machine, Cause why not?*1/2 Through the game*urgh.....Boring*After the 1/2 point*Screw this, Autohacking tool!It just becomes so very dull that I was using my huge amounts of cash (Again because the game is too easy so i always had alot of cash) on Autohacking tools, and on the final chapter I just stopped Hacking the vending machines all together because it was so very very dullFinally the Story *AGAIN, SPOILERS*Honestly its a little bit all over the place but in a good way and ends mostly with closure, ok well except one, why the hell did your plane crash? but I digress the game does a good job at pacing the story up to the big Shyamalan style twist and makes Atlus a very beliveable friend which is all the more suprising at the end, Atlas as a character is a rather well developed character...untill near the end when he becomes Fontanie, he then spends the rest of the game mocking you from your com system and to degrade him even worse during the last hour I kid you not about an hour before you face him he suddenly becomes a spliced up looney, Personally that was weak because all it didn't feel like I was faceing the guy who set me up, i just felt like I was facing another Splicer Alibet a newer one, I would of liked a good ol fasion Gun duel and before you beat him he THEN pulls out a new plasmid he made to turn him into what he is to try and get the edge.Overall Bioshock is a well made game and has alot of atmosphere, gunplay, and likeable characters, the things I don't like about it though is how the main villian becomes a Splicer loony like the rest of Rapture, The hacking gets VERY boring and because you can only game over at the final boss its very VERY easy			"

												Enjoyable game. I grabed it a few years after it came out, and it stills holds up under today's standards. I had no problems with it, found it fun to play, and enjoyed the premise and lore. Combining sound gunplay, cool, superhero-esque powers, and a compelling story, this game is very enjoyable. Not mych more to say really, I would pick it up for ten bucks. 8/10 or 9/10, definately.			"

												Bioshock is one the greatest shooters ever. Period. The combination of amazing atmosphere, gripping and intriguing narrative, one of the best settings for any game I've ever played, and varied, fun gameplay make this a truly unique experience, and it has one hell of a great follow up in Bioshock: Infinite. As for Bioshock 2, you can take it or leave it. But seeing as I have Infinite on my Xbox, consider this my recommendation for both Bioshock and Bioshock: Infinite.			"

												If you want a amazing narrative experience and also want to shoot bees out of your hands, you need to play Bioshock!This game is creepy. Many times while I played, I just stopped and looked at the scenery. The game is visually beautiful! Their art direction is so unique - that it's a shame that we still have boring ugly military shooters. My favorite thing is setting up traps to fight the big Daddies (who are these giant walking tanks), and then freaking out when your traps start falling apart. There's a lot of story in this game. But if you remove that Ayn Rand connection, you still have a amazing experience involving crazy freaks abusing psychic fire at you while you fire shotguns that shoot lightning.			"

												Let me tell you a story, I always wanted to play Bioshock but only recently decided to buy them after Infinite came out. I played this one and LOVED it. It's simply amazing one of my favourite games of all time along with Halo in the FPS genre. The story is just plain good and the recordings are a pleasure to listen to. Rapture looks like a living city and the asthetic is amazing with this steampunkish style. The sountrack is really good also, not one of the best I've heard but it really fits the ambience and the atmosphere of the game. I only have one complaint about it, the combat. The shooting and the mouse controls just feel abit clunky but maybe that's just me. None the less I am willing to put the combat issues I had apart because the game is just plain unique. If you ever hold on into playing it, I suggest you do it now.			"

												Bioshock is a first-person, sci-fi, fictional shooter where you take the role of Jack, a normal person at the beginning of the game soon to become one of the most iconic figures in both this game and the entire Bioshock series. You must traverse the underwater so-called ""paradise"" of Rapture, where those who dwell in it are free from religious criticism against their own ideas, free from the restraints of government, and are free to pursue their own ideals, to take down the rebellious tyrant Frank Fontaine.I have to admit, when I first started playing this game back in 2010, I had my doubts. Why? Because for me, violent videogames wasn't so much my cup of tea, in fact, back then I never really played violent videogames; I usually played Mario. But after playing this game twice, TWICE, both on PC in 2014 and PS3 of 2010, this game has made me a huge fan of the Bioshock series because the story is insanely rich, dark, driven, and deeply fulfilling, packed with violence, betrayal, and revolution. And the entire setting in general: an underwater city, who ever thought of that? You can think of Atlantis, but heck, not this one!To start off, the start of the game where you're in the plane seems to bring about curiosity as to what this game really is about, because you can look at the front cover of the game and say, ""Hey. It's a man in a diving outfit, and he's with a little girl. Well that's pretty cool."" However, I usually say that covers can be illusions to what lies behind, and for Bioshock, this is 100% correct. Already do you crash land in an ocean somewhere off the North Atlantic ocean, near Iceland, swim to some very imposing and unknown, yet beautiful and intricate, building, enter inside, go into a bathysphere (a ship-thingy), and already you're in Rapture. What better way to already jump into the dark, underwater ""paradise"" then crash-land, swim, then witness the city first-hand through a metal sphere?Now, aside from that, Bioshock is a first-person shooter, and it does that well. However, what makes this game unique in it's POV is that you fight with genetic weapons called Plasmids, made from a genetic resource known as ADAM, which serve as your primary utility throughout the game. Rather than say, ""Okay, this guy's got magic for some reason,"" you can say ""The guy's a severely altered, genetic freak, so kick your heels and run!"" It's interesting to see a game where the magic is the result of genetic mutations and self-splicing alterations rather than some natural, innate gift because it really brings about that gruesome background of the game... and teaches kids why you shouldn't use drugs.Anyways, the story, damn! I played this game four times and not once did I get bored with the story. It is huge, and while repetitive, it is great, and it never dries up, it never goes dull, and it always stays alive. The whole foundation of the game itself is heavily dependent on its story because it is the story that sets the game in a momentous rhythm that will leave you wanting more. From how Rapture fell during the Civil War of 1959, to the remains and its genetically-altered denizens and future impact is so well woven and produced that I could not imagine a better game story that can compete against this one.The enemies in this game that you fight against are very creative, different, genuine, and, of course, unique. Big Daddies,   altered humans in diving suits who have been heavily spliced and grafted into their suits are a true challenge to face, but enjoyable to fight against. Splicers, possessing different types of abilities through the overdose of ADAM and Plasmids, makes the game more intense as you have to come up with different ways to fight them off or run away.Truly, the best thing about this game is the entire environment and setting itself. When I saw Rapture through my own TV screen for the first time, I thought that this was perhaps the most amazing creation in a videogame I've ever witnessed. An underwater city that isn't a utopia, has a different name, and can no way be related to Atlantis really brings about the unique quality of Rapture and makes it stand preeminent amongst all other underwater myths. While shocked, I was also awestruck by Rapture's own beliefs and ideals set forth by its philosophical leader Andrew Ryan, because normally, people would just create a history for a city, but this is a whole new level of ""history,"" filled with insanity and dark athmospheres.Overall, all I can say about this game is:🐅Snowy's Scorey🐅:10: Masterpiece, highly recommended to play9: Truly brilliant, recommended at its best8: Okay, will recommend7: Decent, will recommend, but within certain limitations6: Average, probably not worth recommending, but at least looking at5: Meh, some things are right, some wrong, but not complete4. Um.., not sure if this game is up for grabs3. Not worth buying2. Not worth looking at1. Quarantine yourself from this gameAlthough the graphics are not exactly perfect, who freaking cares? The game itself is a masterpiece, with a heavily-driven story, cool combat mechanics and environment, and the lavish and beautiful setting of underwater Rapture. Buy this game when HD Remastered comes out in September because I can guarantee you this game will be amazing. The game is definitely worth the price, and it is entertaining all around.			"

~ We all make choices, but in the end, our choices make us. ~I played BioShock once on the PS3 a few years back and I remember not loving it that much. I really liked the first half, but I found the second half to suffer from pacing issues. Flashback to a few weeks ago and my backlog was running dry, so I decided to replay it, this time on PC. And you know what, I'm not sure why I didn't love it the first time around, because this is one incredible game. It nails pretty much every aspect you'd want in a game. The setting is nothing less than brilliant, Rapture looks visually stunning and it never gets old, the atmosphere is absolutely stellar and the creepy 30s music give it a sinister feeling, the story and characters are really something else and the gameplay is very diverse and encourages experimentation. But the best thing about BioShock is how fleshed out Rapture feels, especially when you replay it and you keep noticing new things that you didn't see or hear the first time.  In terms of story there's so much lore in there it's almost ridiculous, if anything it's overwhelming at first. I'm not going to tread into spoiler territory, but only in subsequent playthroughs do things start to make sense, which really adds to a city that already feels so alive.+ Excellent visual design, Rapture looks absolutely gorgeous.+ Haunting and claustrophobic atmosphere with creepy music from the 1930s.+ Very tense and sometimes even scary at points.+ Ridiculous amount of background information and lore.+ Very solid, fun and diverse gameplay, lots of play styles and experimentations possible.+ A lot of memorable and varied characters.+ Pretty much perfect voice acting from everyone involved. - A few technical issues here and there, some crashes and freezes when loading a new area.- I didn't like the last playable level (Proving Grounds. There were barely open areas to explore which made all the other levels so much fun, it was basically a straight line to the final battle.- The endings (both good and evil) felt too rushed and, even though satisfying in a way, it doesn't feel fleshed out whereas the main game definitely feels fleshed out.9/10			"

												Bioshock is my favourite FPS game. I wanted to play it to do a 3rd walkthrough just recently, but for some reason I could not make it run on Windows 7. I know there are some bug fixes, tweaks out there, but eventually, I decided not to bother with them. Initially, I played this back on XP and also on Vista as some of the effects required DX 10.What makes Bioshock a unique FPS game is its atmosphere. The protagonist finds himself in an underwater city called Rapture after an airplane crash which was meant to be a sanctuary, a safe haven from the atrocities of the world by its creator, but right at the beginning you quickly realise something went awry as almost all the inhabitants of this marvelous city want to kill you. And also each other. These residents are all obsessed with ADAM, a substance found deep under water. Or more like a substance that was extracted from slugs found in the dark, cold abyss. This substance grants its user superhuman powers, powers that are just like magic: you can set things on fire, you can grab and throw objects at your enemies, you can control machines etc. Clearly, humanity's greed got the better of it, again, as it seems everybody is set out to grab more and more ADAM to seize power. And what are those huge fellows called Bid Daddies who wonder around in thick armor escorting (protecting) little children (girls) who are characterised by two things: they have a huge syringe in their hands and their eyes are glowing.The game offers you conventional weapons found in any other FPS games but makes it more interesting as you have various types of bullets available at your disposal. And while you hold your weapons in your right hand at the same time you can cast your spells with your left hand. You can also hack things so that you can purchase items at vending machines with discount and in case you hack turrets or sentry bots you can quickly get some allies. In order to use your Plasmids (spells) you are required to get some EVE (similar to mana in many RPGs). It is inevitable  to fight Rapture's monstrous creatures called Big Daddies to get some ADAM with which you can purchase new Plasmids (or the better version of the one you already have).It's worth checking every room, every corner in Rapture as you can find some hidden treasures. Notable are the audio logs that expand upon the background story and you can get to know the main characters of the city better and also understand what their agenda is. The game has morality choices, too: although you fight Big Daddies the very reason you want to defeat them is to get close to the little girls they protect. You extract ADAM directly from them and you can decide whether or not you want to let them live. This means you can have two endings at the game.The game has a superb art design and lovely music. Its atmosphere can be creepy, scary at times and exploring Rapture is a fun experience between fierce battles. This is highly recommended to anybody out there who loves the FPS genre; bear in mind, though, that the game has issues with Windows 7 so it's best to look for the solution beforehand.			"

												Это  интересный, увлекательный шутер. Действие игры разворачивается в таинственном подводном городе Rapture, заполненном неизвестными существами и загадочной субстанцией под названием ""адам"", необходимой здешнему населению для поддержания жизненных сил. Помимо традиционно шутерного оружия,  можно пользоваться  ""магией"". Кроме того, в процессе прохождения помогает система навыков, а также возможность модификации оружия.  Моя оценка 10\10.			"

												I played this game on the xbox 360 when it first came out, and I had an absolute blast.  A really neat and original storyline in a nice looking FPS package.The use of plasmids (elemental weapons) as a change-up from your regular guns was a welcome difference compared to every other FPS out there.For a game that came out almost 6 years ago, it's still one of my absolute favourites.  It can get a bit repetitive with the enemies, and it could use a few more weapons (found myself almost always using the machine gun or shotugn exclusively with the electro plasmid) but it held my attention for almost 30 hours so far and it keeps going.  Some minor glitches happen with the steam overlay but like I said, minor.Do yourself a favour and try out this game.  It's not the most beautiful, but it's a fun and engaging story.  And then go try Bioshock 2 and Bioshock Infinite!			"

												A classic that I've never played before it's steam release and I'm here to say it's still worthy of most the praise it gets.I'll keep it short.GOOD+Story is fantastic. Many hours of gameplay for a single player game. Even has replay value.+The FPS elements are great. Using different guns and abilities to take out your enemies doesn't get stale.+The RPG elements aren't perfect but can really change the way you play, especially when you start upgrading.+ Even though through most of game the tension is high and it can be downright scary at times, it was never grotesque or resorted to jumpscares to shock you.+ Difficulty modes. The game might be a bit overwhelming at first but is actually rather easy when you get used to it. But being able to increase the difficulty on subsequent playthroughs solves that problem.+ Though the visuals might have aged somewhat, I got totally emersed in them.NOT SO GOOD- Controls aren't optimal and is part of the overwhelming start. Switching weapons, powers and ammo doesn't get smooth until you learn to just deal with it.- The Hacking minigame, like in most other games, is too boring and occurs way too frequently. Almost every camera and turret in the game needs to be either hacked or destroyed to progress. And since conserving ammo is quite a big deal, hacking is the best choice but also the most boring one.-Though survival and conserving your ammo are elements of the game, expect to blaze through on easier difficulties after you get used to the enemies and such. (Big Daddies are Big Babies, no really)- The final araes of the game take a looong time. This might be a good thing to some, but it feels stretched and a little disjointed from the rest of the game. Making the ending overall a bit weak compared to all you've done to get there.So step right up and get yourself a ticket to Rapture, because this game is totally worth playing! Especially if you've become a fan of the Bioshock series because of it's more recent installments!			"

The game might be a bit overwhelming at first but is actually rather easy when you get used to it. But being able to increase the difficulty on subsequent playthroughs solves that problem.+ Though the visuals might have aged somewhat, I got totally emersed in them.NOT SO GOOD- Controls aren't optimal and is part of the overwhelming start. Switching weapons, powers and ammo doesn't get smooth until you learn to just deal with it.- The Hacking minigame, like in most other games, is too boring and occurs way too frequently. Almost every camera and turret in the game needs to be either hacked or destroyed to progress. And since conserving ammo is quite a big deal, hacking is the best choice but also the most boring one.-Though survival and conserving your ammo are elements of the game, expect to blaze through on easier difficulties after you get used to the enemies and such. (Big Daddies are Big Babies, no really)- The final araes of the game take a looong time. This might be a good thing to some, but it feels stretched and a little disjointed from the rest of the game. Making the ending overall a bit weak compared to all you've done to get there.So step right up and get yourself a ticket to Rapture, because this game is totally worth playing! Especially if you've become a fan of the Bioshock series because of it's more recent installments!			"

												I played Bioshock Infinite before this, I am not a horror game player (I'm very easily scared) but I knew I had to play this and I was not disappointed. One of the best games I have ever played (only problem being with mouse sensitivity and continuous need to patch game) the story was incredible, the game play was easy enough for a casual player like me, and the music is amazing!Couldn't tell you how many times i pooped myself10/10 would poop pants again			"

												Bioshock is an okay game at best. There are some aspects of this game that I liked and I didnt like about the game.I'll start off listing the positives: + Fun FPS gameplay.+ Good graphics for the time game was made.+ Scary atmosphere that really makes you feel like you are in the game.+ Strong 10 hour story, character development was present.+ Nice variety of weapons and bullet types to keep gameplay fresh.Here are some negatives that come to mind:- Audio stuttering was common for me while playing.- Ragdoll physics were a little glitchy and looked laggy.- Always running out of ammo having to use wrench.- Mouse sensitivity was incredibly awkward in main menu & settings.- Ending didnt feel like it was enough to close the game without confusion.Overall this is a average game and I would recommend it to some.My Rating: ★★★☆☆			"

												I've played this game ALOT before it was available on Steam.Bioshock is a great game with a great story. I do NOT recommend this game to anyone who expects it to be a run and gun game like Borderlands. Bioshock is a great Story-Driven game.In this game you play as Jack, the only survivor from a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean, You make your way to the underwater City Rapture which once was a beautiful city but many things went wrong.Explore Rapture which once was a beautiful Utopia under the sea.I also recommend the Novel from Bioshock, I'm not a reader myself BUT! I recently finished the book and it was amazing! It will tell alot about Rapture, from building the city to how it all went wrong, but more importantly, you will also KNOW who some of the characters are in the game from certain audio dairies, replaying the game after reading the book opens a new view on the game. 10/10			"

												I just now got around to playing this game. I don't know why it took me so long to get into this absolute masterpiece of a game.And I have to say that I absolutely love it.It's a much better game than I thought it would be. I had tried in the past to pick up this game but I ended up quitting before the game really got good.All in all, this is a 11/10; a game that truly deserves all of the praise it has garnered over the years. It's beautiful and runs well on Windows 10. My only complaints about the game is that it would sometimes default to being in a window, or do other odd things visually; and the other complaint being that the next to last mission turns into an escort mission for a Little Sister while she continually talks about ""angels"".

												Overview : i just finished bioshock 1 for the 4th time and i have to say the most iconic part of it for me is  the character of ANDREW RYAN !The smart true fighter who build this wonderfull city called RAPTURE !Game : As of the game it self, i have to say its truely one of the best FPS games you can play.There is only 1 Problem.....!!!The Mouse Sensitivity is Toooo High.....And even if u pull it down to it's minimum, it still has problems....If you are an FPS player then you know its all about the MOUSE, CURSOR & SENS, smooth traction and DPI !And for some reason the guys at 2k were too involved in the story that they forgot to do this right...But the good news is if you twitch your window's/mac's sens from OS + In game settings you can get a good setting...hopefully your mouse supports profiling for games...Story : i Really Really cant spoil the story but two thumbs up ! its GREAT !The Question Is Will You CHOSE or OBEY...?! (inside joke)But For Me The Character ANDREW RYAN was the what hooked me on this game !Remember the most powerfull weapon in this game is the WRENCh if you use all the right combo tonics which will stack .Who's it for : I generally recommend this game to everyone unless you only like realistic games like medal of honor or battlefield...i give this game 9/10reviewed By IMMORTALEADER			"

												I don't know how to write this review without giving out spoilers, but I shall try.I bought this game after playing Bioshock Infinite, of course expecting the same beautiful visuals, story-line and characters.Wasn't disappointed, but... since the city of Rapture is underwater as opposed to suspended in the sky, there were some stark differences, one of which is obviously the lighting and atmosphere, it's all so eerie and creepy, with a decent number of jumpscares.The first 5-6 hrs of the game were an utter bore to me, I was struggling with my Eves and First Aid Kits, kept running out of ammo, it was tricky to switch between the plasmid and your weapon mid-fight, and the freaky atmosphere wasn't doing anything to make me feel better. But after that, it was all uphill, I started seeing the reason why I bought this game in the first place, the story picked up, it was paramount to solve the current mission and move on to the next ASAP.Gameplay wise, it is decent, but what really is the heart and soul of the game is the story and the morality of your choices. I chose badly, thinking there was no other option and will always be haunted by my choices. The ending was quite emotional and a real kick in the gut. The game did crash a couple of times though...The Bioshock franchise has a knack for brilliant story-telling, and now, would you kindly buy the game and see for yourself. =)			"

												This game is a piece of art. It's a masterpiece. However, the gameplay itself isn't what makes the game special to me. What makes the game truly amazing is the atmosphere of the world. The levels are so detailed. You can learn so much about the history of the world just by observing advertisements on the walls and listening to audio tapes scattered across the world. The story is so unique. The lore of this game is what's going to keep me coming back for more. There are many plot twists that will shock and amaze you. The gameplay isn't anything amazing or innovating. It's a first person shooter full of your normal: revolvers, machine guns, shotguns, grenade launhers. But the game also includes superpowers called: plasmids. These really keep the game fresh and exciting as you can do anything from emitting electrcity from your hands or using telekinisis to lift dead enemies and use them as a human shield. Overall, the gameplay is really fun and addictive and is a great complement to the amazing atmosphere, story, and world of Bioshock. 10/10			"

												Who’s the Big Daddy?BIOSHOCK is a fine example of what is achievable through the medium of video games. The developers have managed to combine an engaging story with strong RPG and FPS elements to produce a thoroughly absorbing and memorable experience. The storyline is unusually effective and all the more compelling due to the aspects of morality it addresses. The voice acting is terrific, especially the chuntering splicers that wander around Rapture -- their psychotic ramblings are utterly convincing. The game is also graphically impressive for a 2007 production -- Rapture is a beautiful, art deco wreck of a city. There could perhaps have been more humour, but overall this is one of the best single-player games I’ve played.5/5			"

												What can I say about one of the most thought provoking games created in the 21st Century? One of the Master classes of FPS, BioShock combines exciting FPS gameplay, with a tense storyline, and brutal social commentary. For years I had waited for someone to do a refutation of Atlas Shrugged by the radical nut Ayn Rand. Finally I have been given something of that caliber. One of my favorite aspects of this game is its use of the Art Deco movement to define the architecture of the beautiful Rapture. Art Deco is one of my favorite art forms and to see it in a video game is just brilliant. Ken Levine is a master storyteller who isn't afraid to get his hands dirty in the mud pool that is political commentary. One of the greatest art works of our generation.			"

												This is a fantastic game - a timeless classic that has received numerous awards and accolades. This alone is a testament to the game's greatness.Pros: + Bioshock features a very memorable storyline and quotes. ""A man chooses, a slave obeys.""+ The gameplay is unique and well-polished. There are numerous weapons and also abilities that can be utilized in uncountable ways to defeat enemies.+ The atmosphere is above anything I have ever observed in a game. The way the character and enemies behave, the music - everything is coherent and beyond perfect.Cons:- The gameplay gets a bit repetitive - but other seem to disagree. This is just my opinion among others.- The map layouts can get rather confusing and hence difficult to navigate.Taking everything into account, I give this game a 8/10 - highly, highly recommended. Even if you don't like the looks of it, try it out if you can - you might just love it.			"

												BioShock. What can I say.This game is without a doubt in the running for game of the generation. For years prior to this game, the industry had been slipping out of the fact that games must tell a story, and focused more on how they played and esentailly how much money they can make. Then along game BioShock, the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, a game which would change the way we tell stories in games forever.Packed in with its superb story, comes a uniqe horror-esq experience that I have only felt in BioShock. The atmosphere in this game is so fantastic, you would believe a city could actually be underwater. BioShock correctly displays the corruption of a once bold empire, and the impact it has had on life under the sea. The main character, Jack, is shrouded in mystery for most of the game until ""it"" happens...10/10. The 6th entry in my 10/10 hall of fame. Play the game.			"

												Best of the series. The story line is simply incredible, the weapons and plasmids are so profound. Rapture is a beautiful place, a city is a masterpiece of design and creativity. The Ideaology of the story line is has such a depth to it. This game is easy to play, but hard to understand, the audio tapes scatter around Rapture leave the story to make more sense and give a better picture. Ive enjoyed ever second ive played of this game and i cannot express how much i love this game <3 ^.^			"

												This game just oozes with atmosphere, it's brilliant. So is the storytelling. The graphics still hold up to this day and the sound is awesome. During the game you gain access to special powers and search for items, similar to RPGs. The powers are diverse and fun and switching between them keeps things fresh. The game manages to scare a few times in the beginning, but once you know what you're up against it pretty much stops being scary. Multiple endings give the game great replay value and it already is exceptionally long for a FPS. This should already be in everyone's collection.[Rating: 94/100]			"

												The botched sensitivity really ruins the fun for me. Basically, you get a scale of 1 - 10 to choose from, except choosing 1 or 2 randomly stops the mouse at times rendering it unplayable. Any higher sens is far too high for me as well. The remastered version is even worse, bugs wise. There's a great game hiding behind all the ignored technical problems, but until they decide to fix them I probably won't be touching this game for a while.			"

												One of the greatest games I've ever played, people say all the time Infinite outshines it in every aspect, but I find BioShock to be a more atmospheric game that involves you a bit more. Where as in a game like Infinite, which is still amazing, watches you encounter other peoples fate. This game makes you feel like you're the character. This game is still really amazing, and is only a bit inferior to Infinite. I highly recommend this game.			"

												I first played BioShock on the 360 and hated it. Then I got my hands on the PC version, and I'm starting to see why people like it so much.The world is a massive breath of fresh air from the done-to-death Middle Easts and Europes of the world. But that's not what's best about it. The atmosphere is simply amazing. It's a rare feat for a game to make me *feel* the world around the player, and BioShock does it. Add to that gameplay that's simple, but works rather well (apart from plasmids being a bit overpowered) and a pretty well-written story, and you have a recipe for success.			"

Adam akıllı feels yaşatamadan lak diye oyunun ana ekranına attı, bir kaç dakika ekrana bakakaldım öylece. Yeni bir oyuna başladığımda aklımın sürekli o oyunda olması pek alışık olduğum bi his değil, ama Bioshock ile tamamen bunu yaşadım, oyun bitmesin diye her yeri gezindim, bütün ayrıntılara dikkat ettim. Seslendirmelere ayrı bi bayıldım.

												PORTUGUESE REVIEWBioshock conseguiu ser de longe um dos melhores jogos que já joguei em toda minha vida. Sem dúvidas é um investimento que compensa horas de diversão. O jogo tem uma trama muito envolvente, rico em detalhes e com um ar de mistério do qual deixa o jogador em total imersão. A história de Bioshock é baseada em uma utopia dos anos 60, e mantém-se fiel aos mínimos detalhes da época. Fora todo o contexto histórico da época, o jogador tem de encarar humanos transformados pelo vicio em Plasmids, os colossais Big Daddies e capturar ou libertar as Little Sisters, sem falar que as ações do jogador influenciam no final da história, sendo certo ou errado, caberá ao jogador decidir.ENGLISH REVIEWIn my opnion it is absolutely sure that Bioshock is one of the best games ever due to its rich details, the awesome story, and of course, the suspense involving the whole game. Despite of all the difficulty, Bioshock still such an awesome game no matter what type of gamer you are. You will enjoy it for sure! But be aware, your actions in the game can inffluence in different endings. It is up to you what you think about 'right' or 'wrong' actions. Have fun! "

												I bought this when I heard I would get the Remaster upgrade for free.  I never got the Remastered version to work. Crashed every time, but that's a different story for a different review.I decided to play the original (non-remaster) since the remaster wouldn't work.  Worked well for a while.  Looks pretty good for an old game.  However, all of a sudden the sound no longer works in game.  The main menu sound is fine, but as soon as I load any save file, there is no audio.  No idea what caused it.  I'm sick of battling with all these issues though.2K is terrible PC ports and customer support.  Huge Bioshock fan very unhappy.			"

Positive:Tight story-driven gameplay and narration similar to Half-Life 2 and the likes.High level of detail and thoughtful level design. Some assets are used repeatedly and some special characters could have deserved more individual ingame models to make them stand out from the regular NPC, but all the levels, their layouts and their assets make sense. Everywhere you look you can see something special or unique rewarding those who look closer. There is some nice sound design too - your shoes squeaking on metal surfaces, the moaning of the Big Daddys, the sounds of whales or something like that whenever glancing outside into the depths of the Atlantic. Even when walking completely barred down areas you still know you are in a deep underwater city at the edge of collapse with water constantly leaking here and there, hitting you from above, washing down your vision and distorting it. I don't think an underwater city could be designed more believable and ambiance-strong than in Bioshock.What I noticed positively in comparison to Bioshock Infinite:- Enemies do respawn a bit. It makes the city feel more alive. In Infinite they would never respawn. Had you killed every enemy in the latter all the areas you were in remained empty. Not so in Bioshock. This also encourages playing around with guns or plasmids (special powers). - Enemies react more with their surroundings. Mildly. Like interacting with health stations to regenerate health, or standing in front of some item booths swearing at then to be broken or something. I never noticed anything like that in Infinite.- The Big Daddys and their Little Sisters are not enemies per-se. If you don't attack them they will not harm you either. This is rather unlike to how these straightforward story-driven shooters usually work. There wasn't really anything like this in Infinite either.Undecided:If you play on a too low difficulty, or if you are skilled enough with shooters, you may not find much use in the many plasmids and tonics that enhance your combat powers or that give you passive perks to avoid cameras, sneak up more easily on enemies, photograph them with better scores or whatever. I played on the easiest difficulty. I basically went guns blazing through the game and kept using like only three guns out of six or seven or so, and only two or three plasmids out of nine or so. The tonics I never really cared about too much either. Some enemies are resistent to some plasmids, and the game at one point ""forbids"" you to use some plasmids; while that was explainable story-wise it felt a bit forced. Still, all of these ""gadgets"" felt better implemented than in Bioshock Infinite (where it felt a bit silly at what rate and numbers they were tossed at you). I skipped hacking many booths and safes too because there was no need to buy anything (ammo, supplies, power upgrades) or because I always had enough automatic hacking tools with me.  If one wants to see more sense in the ""whole picture"" of this gadget/""economy""/resource management thing I suggest trying one of the harder difficulties or one may end up ignoring/skipping most of what is there.The same as in the previous paragraph applies to roaming levels for supplies. All items are uniquely placed around, that is part of the ""high level of detail"" I mentioned, and one may find that interesting and fun enough, but if you play on easy difficulty and/or if you are skilled with shooters there is little need to loot all the various containers and look in all the corners to find supplies. You simply won't need most of them. Even if you do it can become a one-button hitting spamfest because you will always want to grab most of what there is anway for the lack of any inventory whatsoever. What you can't grab the game will just leave where it is. I personally decided to just spam my ""use"" button at everything that could have possibly been a container rather than actually pay attention to what was in there. The only thing I genuinely cared about when looting around where the audio tapes from the various special characters in the game that would give insight into the recent history of Rapture. I did search all corners I became aware of just to see the way the devs placed their assets, but that aside there was little point to it.Negative:Characters could have deserved more depth. Some of them at least. Andrew Ryan was the most interesting one, but all the others are rather one-sided and predictable in what they want and do and think.Gunplay felt awkward, or a bit sloppy. I didn't try changing sensitivity or something but aiming didn't feel as easy as in other shooters. Not even when aiming down the sights. On the contrary I found it always easier to fire my guns from the hip. The gunplay didn't feel as bad as for example in Left 4 Dead, but not as great as in more modern semi-military FPS either.Animations of ragdolling character models and items looked odd. Not as ""fluently"" as one may expect. Like when shooting down an enemy from the ceiling he would fall down thanks to gravity and all, and ragdoll along the way just fine, but kinda like in some half-working slow-motion or something. Really hard to explain.There are three endings. I've seen the others on YouTube. I was satisfied with mine, but others may find theirs disappointing or irritating because the choices on which it depends what ending you get may not feel as obvious or logical as they should. Don't know if it's just me, but there were some bugs. Nothing too dramatic, but mildly annoying. I suppose related to the age of the game. I couldn't always hear all sounds. Like when I was shooting around the music would sometimes cut off for an extremely brief moment, the second I was to stop shooting (or my enemies) it would be there again. Then sometimes the game wouldn't always save my control and gameplay settings. The default key assignments in Bioshock felt a bit odd (like running/walking is on CTRL rather than SHIFT) and so I sometimes had to reassign the buttons again when I was starting up the game again. I noticed the game wouldn't quit properly - when exiting it my Windows 7 would tell me about an unexpected error forcing to close down the application. It didn't hurt me directly because quitting the game was my intention, but this half-baken shutdown may be related to settings not being saved properly.What I noticed negatively in comparison to Bioshock Infinite:The protagonist is completely silent and unnamed. I did like the actively talking Booker in Infinite more, I generally prefer a talking protagonist in games more. It just feels odd and irritating and somewhat ambiance-breaking to see NPCs constantly avoid naming such one protagonist all the time or answer their own questions because the protagonist would never raise his own voice to do so.

												Bioshock:Positives:+ There is a really engaging story in Bioshock with a twist that you won't expect. Audio logs which supplement the plotline can be found by exploring the environment and are a welcome addition. The game is set in the underwater city of Rapture and follows two men who struggle for power - Andrew Ryan, leader of the famous Ryan Industries and Frank Fontaine.+ There are quite a few weapons that can be upgraded, like crossbows, shotguns, pistols, the Tommy Gun, grenade launchers and a chemical thrower which fires liquid nitrogen, napalm and electric gel.+ A key part of Bioshock is the use of Plasmids, genetic abilities which can freeze enemies solid, incinerate or electrocute them. Unleash a swarm of killer insects or create a decoy target to draw fire away from you. There's many options here.+ To add greater complexity there are tonics which improve your skills in countless ways. Physical tonics add healing benefits and eve restoration (eve is required to cast plasmids), engineering tonics are crucial to hacking safes, door combinations, gun turrets, vending machines and cameras. Then you've got combat tonics for physical damage resistance.  + The characters are interesting, the shooting is great, basically it's fun which is the most important pro.Mixed:~ Only about 15 hours of content for this FPS, which is not much (played on medium difficulty and didn't really have any issues). It's not the worst I've seen but clearly it's lacking in gameplay longevity. ~ Graphics are not bad considering the age of this game. Average.~ Somewhat linear game. It is not open-world and there are no side missions, it's strictly one area to the next. With that said, it's forgiveable since the developers have put some sort of effort into hidden areas and locations which aren't essential.Negatives:- Very poor map design, confusing to navigate and find out where to go for your next objective. Overall Score: 8/10Very much recommended!			"

												While on the surface it might look like little more than a very pretty first-person shooter, BioShock is much, much more than that. Sure, the action is fine, but its primary focus is its story, a sci-fi mystery that manages to feel retro and futuristic at the same time, and its characters, who convey most of the story via radio transmissions and audio logs that you're constantly stumbling upon as you wander around. All of it blends together to form an interesting underwater world that sucks you in right away and won't let go until you've figured out what, exactly, is going on in the undersea city of Rapture.My only disclaimer is that playing this at night is a heart attack waiting to happen. I'm telling you: those splicers, man...			"

												When I initially played Bioshock, I didn't enjoy it, I didn't really like the whole concept of the diaries for exposition.  I played through the fist third of the game probably 3 times, and I could just never get into it.  Then I got commited, no matter what I was going to beat this damn game.  And  I quickly realized that to make this game fun, you just have to play it the way it was meant to be played.Bioshock is not a game you should rush, you have to explore, conserve ammo, and really get a feel for the creepy atmosphere to enjoy this one. Once the story starts getting crazy, then playing this game is all you'll want to do.  Trust meh this is a good game, even if you don't like it at first like me, you just got to feel it.I give bioshock a 9.5/10 "

												The one thing you learn from Bioshock is that little girls love smelly fat men. So that's why I was ever unlucky...Bioshock is one of the classics for me. Though it has a long down time in the middle the story is really well made and told. I love how all the ""bosses"" are each mad in their own way. One is killing you because you are ugly, the other one doesn't even try to, but sends you to kill some ""bad"" artists for him and so on.It is a new kind of crazy, which comes with a rather small open world with limited ressources to make survival harder.The voice of the Radio is often too quiet to understand during fights, so I missed some of the story, even on my second playthrough.All in all a great game with some flaws.

												Played this series a bunch when I was younger, so when I saw this one on sale I jumped at the chance to relive some childhood memories, but what I actually experienced was something that surprised me quite a bit. I didn't enjoy it all that much. The game's atmosphere is absolutely incredible, and honestly I could recommend the game for just that. It's incredibly immersive and intense, and the characters are freaky and fitting, however, this doesn't make up for the games flaws. Combat in this game feels way too kite oriented. You just kite your enemies into traps, or divert their attention somewhere else and hit them 20 times in the back with your trusty wrench 'til they drop. I would have prefered a combat system that was fitting for the mysterious, gripping setting. This combat system makes the game feel as if it was geared towards younger players, with little comprehension for actual strategy. Now, to talk about the last third of the game, especially the ending..... No spoilers ahead, I'll keep it vague, don't worry. The first 2/3 of the game is gripping and fantastic, but there's a certain moment that makes your heart drop and feels like the absolute climax of the story, and I almost wish the game had just ended there. I rarely want games to be shorter than they are, and this one is already relatively short as it stands, but the last third of the game tried to introduce new mechanics and it just didn't work. That part of the game felt boring. It felt like a chore to complete, which is usually when I just put the game down and never pick it back up. I play videogames for fun, and the ENDING of the game, instead of being something epic, was just flat boring. The final boss fight was... ambitious, if you want to be generous, but was way too cliche. The mechanics ave all been done before, nothing new there, and the boss himself is unrecognizable. It didn't feel like I was fighting the antagonist that I had travelled so far to fight. It felt too easy, too simple, too boring. I wasn't engaged throughout that entire part of the story, which made me sad. Overall, this is a fantastic game that has an unfortunate ending :( I still recommend it highly simply for the unique ideas portrayed, the environment, and the characters you associate with, but don't expect much towards the end.

												I recently played this for the first time, and man...It.  Was.  Amazing.While some games feel like movies with bad graphics, this game feels like a playable book.  The audio tapes in most games are worth skipping, but if you do so in this game you're really missing out.  The combat, once you set your mouse dpi and in game sensitivity appropriately, is actually quite fun.  There were multiple times where I was terrified, heart pounding, and really into it.  Play on the harder difficulties as it's quite easy to max out your inventory and the game can become too easy.  Be aware that there are multiple endings and how you treat the little sisters does matter!There are quite a few annoying technicalities such as mouse acceleration, fov limitations, and 30 fps locked physics.  Thankfully, all of these can be fixed with .ini file tweaks and mods.  I have a 144 hz monitor, and there is a free mod for Bioshock that unlocks the frame rate of the physics to whatever you want to set it to.  Also, I forced antialiasing through the NVidia control panel (every single type at max settings), and I was still able to get way above 144 fps with a GTX 1080.I would recommend doing these tweaks yourself (just type in Bioshock PC tweaks into google) rather than playing the remastered version.  The remastered version, from what I hear, doesn't fix any of the already mentioned technical issues, and it is actually very unstable and can delete all your save files (which you can easily back up, I might add).

												Overall great game with an awesome sense of humour and a very unique enviornment.Graphics:- Graphics are good, a little outdated now, but not bad.- Motion of objects looks strange.- Enemies can cast shadows but I can't?Sound:- Voice acting is superb, and this is especially obvious when in Fort Frolic. The theatrics of it all with Cohen's slight lunacy.- The voice-diaries you collect along the way are a nice teaser that elaborate the story but keep it interesting with characters from different parts of the world, like Germany, Ireland, Australia, China. It also adds to the bohemia that a large metropolis would inhabit.Gameplay:- The AI can be a bit stupid sometimes. In my run-through Dr. Steinman got stuck in a corner and I just blew him away that way. Big Daddies also react very stupidly sometimes.- The humour is so wicked and the imagery is sometimes very grotesque. I thoroughly enjoyed it.- The hacking mini-game is a lot of fun (although, by the end you will be so sick of it).- It much longer than the average First Person Shooter and took me 15.5hrs to finish in Hard difficulty.Environments:- It's all fundamentally down in Rapture, but the use of creativity and ideas never gets boring. I never felt claustrophobic and I really feel like they managed to create this living breathing city.Story:- Story is great, very unique. It progresses well as you learn about the decline of the situation. The voice-diaries add clarity as you go along and are a nice incentive to keep exploring.- The game has 3 endings, depending on some of the choices you make. But really, there should only be two endings, as two of them are pretty identical.- I was disappointed with the moral under-tone of the endings. For a game that had such brutal off-the-cuff humour, they slapped you in the end with a Christian moral indicative ending which left me quite irritated.			"

												How many games, from 2007 I mean, can you honestly say more interested you than an FPS in which you could use various super powers alongside guns in a dystopian city at the bottom of the ocean in 1960 with a retro-punk theme to it? I will tell you, NOT ♥♥♥♥ING MANY. I may have played this game back in 2009 on my Xbox 360, but good games trancend the plat-forms that they are on. From the excelent voice acting, great writing with an intriguing story and unique, engaging characters, the final bosss sucks but that's a minor nit-pick, powers (in this case, they're called Plasmids) are diverse; but you can still find a couple over powered ones, though that is a given for this (then new) concept of gaming not truly fully explored. Honestly, I will tell you what everyone has already said about this game, The ENTIRETY of the Bioshock games are worth a buy.			"

												Should you play the game? Honestly it's all based on opinion. Bioshock was an incredible experience that could even be classifed as a half horror. The jumpscares were there and actually scared me from time to time I was honestly surprised. Bioshock plays as First Person Shooter with a small, very small rpg aspect as you're able to upgrade your weapons and supernatural abilites you get throughout the game. In the small end its a Horror/Thriller Shooter with an incredible story with a great background story you can hear throughout the game with audio diaries that can be collected from random locations.I never played the demo but I think people should download the demo and based it off that + a review.The biggest con that can cause someone to not play/buy this game would be the horrible mouse settings that require some small extra research to fix up. The controller might also give SOME people problems.But In the end fixing your mouse settings is good on the long run because Bioshock is a game that feels great on mouse, keyboard AND controllerThe bioshock series with forever remain as one of my top 10 game series of all time, maybe even top 5.

												Okay, I know my hours don't show it on Steam but this is the game I've played through most in my life. It is absolutely, and mean this a completely non-exaggerated sense, my favorite video game of all time. Ever.I mean I'm not kidding when I say numerous essays can and have been written about so many different aspects of this game. There's a reason it's regarded as one of the best games of the decade (or ever). The story makes you think, the gameplay makes you think, the art makes you think. The whole game challenges your ideas on life, art, philosophy, politics, everything. 8 years later and I'm still finding myself realizing things about this game just driving to school or while at work.There's a great blog (I know, tumblr's trash but this guy's blog is pretty much the only good thing on that site). His link is ""jacksoninblogform.tumblr.com""His essays are long as hell but I promise you they are more than worth a read. Every element in this game is smart. As simple as the gameplay is and as linear the story is, the game speaks so much about humanity, its culture and its purpose.If you've already had the game spoiled for you, it doesn't matter. It will still be an amazing ride because there is so much more to experience. Just, if possible, go into it completely blind and just ride the ride. And no, the demo doesn't do the game justice.To be fair, it took me 2 or 3 playthroughs to appreciate and understand the game. The only reason I played 2 numblingly boring playthroughs was to see if there was something I just wasn't catching that impressed everyone else. And there's so much I missed the first time or two that really hit me after a while.So yeah. Just, would you kindly hit ""Add to Cart"" already?			"

												BioShock is a beautifully atmospheric game, with an excellent 60’s art deco style. The main selling point is the story, which is pretty damn great, and the world of BioShock is developed through Audio Logs and brilliant set piece moments. The guns are the standard setup of Melee, Pistol, Machine Gun, Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, Crossbow and the special weapon this time, the Chemical Thrower. Each of these weapons has 3 ammo types, standard ammo, Armour-Piercing and Anti-Personnel. In the supporting cast are ‘Plasmids’, powers such as Electro-Bolt, Incinerate! and Insect Swarm to name a few, powered by EVE.  Also, for some RPG-esq customization, they’re ‘Gene Tonics’, which you can equip, chop and change to your heart’s content. There’s a reasonable selection of dudes to fight, Melee, Gun wielding, Grenadiers and Spidery ones. The creepy Little Sisters wonder around BioShock, and gather ADAM, a wonder substance used for creating Plasmids and drugged up most of the people in the game. In Game, ADAM is used to buy and upgrade Plasmids/Gene Tonics, and presents the moral choice BioShock has. But first you have to fight Big Daddies, which at first is a big challenge, but then later is too much trouble.However, it’s not without problems. BioShock is in no way challenging, and you get showered with Health Kits and items to recharge your EVE, and ammo. I didn’t really bother with the alternate ammo types, the regular types were just fine. I did go to the maximum slots for Plasmids and Gene Tonics, but I also found I was only using 3 Plasmids and about 4 Gene Tonics in each of the three categories. On the note of Gene Tonics, certain combinations are gross. For example, I was doing increased Wrench Damage, had silent footstep, received 25% less damage from most sources, 100% less damage taken from electricity while dishing out an additional 60%, and I did electrical damage whenever I got hit by a melee enemy. And that was only in combat! I had easier hacking, plus I received additional health from health kits, and an increased to both Health and EVE. ADAM simply isn’t as important as the game would have you believe, especially since how much of an effort it is to fight Big Daddies.The Vending machines for ammo and general items were largely untouched by me, mainly for the reason that I didn’t need them, along with the half-arsed crafting system. I was only making Auto-Hack tools in the end, which brings us onto Hacking. Hacking is bloody awful, as you have to play Pipe Dreams to hack a system.

												This game took me by surprise... I had seen parts of BioShock Infinite game play and the series got my interest. So I wanted to start at the beginning, and I jumped in completely blind. All I knew it took place underwater, that was it. The beginning hooked me right in and I could not get enough of it. One mistake I think a lot op people make is that they play this like other FPS games and they go on rampaging as fast as they can to get through... there is nothing wrong with playing like that BUT you miss so mutch of the story if you don't look in all the corners. Half of the game story is told by whats around you. Never stop playing halfway through because it only gets better. This has become my favorit game of all time and I find it sad that I can't find any other games that are like the BioShock series... Craszy/amazing stories with RPG and FPS.P.S. Don't kill me this is my first review ever...			"

The architecture, the mystery, the deftly immediate creation of an effective antagonist without his first having to attack you or yours, the introduction of the unquestionably iconic, darkly nuanced Big Daddy/Little Sister pairing, the sea-life, and at least two of the finest mid-game moments too – the eventual encounter with the aforementioned antagonist, and the horrifying art installation of Sander Cohen...BioShock is truly a masterpiece!

												Loved this game. It may be a few years old, but I couldn't tell from the graphics, which were still stellar. The story is extremely well done and engaging throughout- you will be searching for every voxophone and going down every side corridor to learn more. Gameplay was also very fun- I played on Normal difficulty, which was challenging enough that I was never bored, while not being hard enough that I was frustrated. There weren't too many weapons to choose from (and to be honest some just didn't seem that effective compared to the standard Wrench) but I never found myself bored or distracted by that fact. Same with the Plasmids (basically, magic spells)- I almost always used the standard Electric Shock, but the others were still interesting and the gameplay forced you to use some of the other Plasmids in order to unlock secret areas or find hidden voxophones which advanced the story. In sum, I would give this game an 8/10, with a recommendation for people who want an engaging story to go with their gameplay.			"

												BioShock is a beautifully atmospheric game, with an excellent 60’s art deco style. The main selling point is the story, which is pretty damn great, and the world of BioShock is developed through Audio Logs and brilliant set piece moments. The guns are the standard setup of Melee, Pistol, Machine Gun, Shotgun, Grenade Launcher, Crossbow and the special weapon this time, the Chemical Thrower. Each of these weapons has 3 ammo types, standard ammo, Armour-Piercing and Anti-Personnel. In the supporting cast are ‘Plasmids’, powers such as Electro-Bolt, Incinerate! and Insect Swarm to name a few, powered by EVE.  Also, for some RPG-esq customization, they’re ‘Gene Tonics’, which you can equip, chop and change to your heart’s content. There’s a reasonable selection of dudes to fight, Melee, Gun wielding, Grenadiers and Spidery ones. The creepy Little Sisters wonder around BioShock, and gather ADAM, a wonder substance used for creating Plasmids and drugged up most of the people in the game. In Game, ADAM is used to buy and upgrade Plasmids/Gene Tonics, and presents the moral choice BioShock has. But first you have to fight Big Daddies, which at first is a big challenge, but then later is too much trouble.However, it’s not without problems. BioShock is in no way challenging, and you get showered with Health Kits and items to recharge your EVE, and ammo. I didn’t really bother with the alternate ammo types, the regular types were just fine. I did go to the maximum slots for Plasmids and Gene Tonics, but I also found I was only using 3 Plasmids and about 4 Gene Tonics in each of the three categories. On the note of Gene Tonics, certain combinations are gross. For example, I was doing increased Wrench Damage, had silent footstep, received 25% less damage from most sources, 100% less damage taken from electricity while dishing out an additional 60%, and I did electrical damage whenever I got hit by a melee enemy. And that was only in combat! I had easier hacking, plus I received additional health from health kits, and an increased to both Health and EVE. ADAM simply isn’t as important as the game would have you believe, especially since how much of an effort it is to fight Big Daddies.The Vending machines for ammo and general items were largely untouched by me, mainly for the reason that I didn’t need them, along with the half-arsed crafting system. I was only making Auto-Hack tools in the end, which brings us onto Hacking. Hacking is bloody awful, as you have to play Pipe Dreams to hack a system. In the end, I was just buying out or auto-hacking systems, as money was largely useless and I really couldn’t be arsed. A lack of inventory is also strange, so you eat food straight away as you pick it up, you never know how much of a weird item you’re carrying for crafting, and not being able to dual-wield Plasmids and a gun is really, really annoying, especially since you have to swap with right click.Oh, and the final boss fight is awful.Overall though, I really enjoyed BioShock, and would greatly recommend it, as all the problems I cited are largely insignificant in the grand scheme. As a final note, the whole 'Moral Choice' is a bit too Black and White, and something in the middle would have been much better.			"

I played through the fist third of the game probably 3 times, and I could just never get into it.  Then I got commited, no matter what I was going to beat this damn game.  And  I quickly realized that to make this game fun, you just have to play it the way it was meant to be played.Bioshock is not a game you should rush, you have to explore, conserve ammo, and really get a feel for the creepy atmosphere to enjoy this one. Once the story starts getting crazy, then playing this game is all you'll want to do.  Trust meh this is a good game, even if you don't like it at first like me, you just got to feel it.I give bioshock a 9.5/10 "

												Played this series a bunch when I was younger, so when I saw this one on sale I jumped at the chance to relive some childhood memories, but what I actually experienced was something that surprised me quite a bit. I didn't enjoy it all that much. The game's atmosphere is absolutely incredible, and honestly I could recommend the game for just that. It's incredibly immersive and intense, and the characters are freaky and fitting, however, this doesn't make up for the games flaws. Combat in this game feels way too kite oriented. You just kite your enemies into traps, or divert their attention somewhere else and hit them 20 times in the back with your trusty wrench 'til they drop. I would have prefered a combat system that was fitting for the mysterious, gripping setting. This combat system makes the game feel as if it was geared towards younger players, with little comprehension for actual strategy. Now, to talk about the last third of the game, especially the ending..... No spoilers ahead, I'll keep it vague, don't worry. The first 2/3 of the game is gripping and fantastic, but there's a certain moment that makes your heart drop and feels like the absolute climax of the story, and I almost wish the game had just ended there. I rarely want games to be shorter than they are, and this one is already relatively short as it stands, but the last third of the game tried to introduce new mechanics and it just didn't work. That part of the game felt boring. It felt like a chore to complete, which is usually when I just put the game down and never pick it back up. I play videogames for fun, and the ENDING of the game, instead of being something epic, was just flat boring. The final boss fight was... ambitious, if you want to be generous, but was way too cliche. The mechanics ave all been done before, nothing new there, and the boss himself is unrecognizable. It didn't feel like I was fighting the antagonist that I had travelled so far to fight. It felt too easy, too simple, too boring. I wasn't engaged throughout that entire part of the story, which made me sad. Overall, this is a fantastic game that has an unfortunate ending :( I still recommend it highly simply for the unique ideas portrayed, the environment, and the characters you associate with, but don't expect much towards the end.

												The one thing you learn from Bioshock is that little girls love smelly fat men. So that's why I was ever unlucky...Bioshock is one of the classics for me. Though it has a long down time in the middle the story is really well made and told. I love how all the ""bosses"" are each mad in their own way. One is killing you because you are ugly, the other one doesn't even try to, but sends you to kill some ""bad"" artists for him and so on.It is a new kind of crazy, which comes with a rather small open world with limited ressources to make survival harder.The voice of the Radio is often too quiet to understand during fights, so I missed some of the story, even on my second playthrough.All in all a great game with some flaws.

												The experience of BioShock 1 for me is up there with the greats, half-life & doom. The game mechanics, level design and graphics are incredible, even in 2015 they hold up very well, esp at 60 fps with all the bells and whistles our GPUs can muster. It's a great story too. A genius industrialist has built an underwater city in some steam-punk type of world and he makes his economy and culture follow the philosophy of Ayn Rand, that the free market is the ultimate tool to a better society. The city discovers some sea slug that oozes a substance called atom, which can change the genetics of a consumer. This creates all sorts of cool abilities in addition to the weapons, such as electricity and telekensis. There's nothing quite like using telekensis to grab a flammable canister the size of a human and then force push it into your enemy causing glorious explosions and death; or shooting electricity into standing water frying all those unfortunate enemies standing in it.A great and fabulous looking labrynith shooter, 10 out of 10.Some tips:If you have a an AMD/GTX card you can increase anti-aliasing and anisotropic filtering to 8x and 16x as well as include AO to this game. It certainly improves the already great graphics.			"

												How many games, from 2007 I mean, can you honestly say more interested you than an FPS in which you could use various super powers alongside guns in a dystopian city at the bottom of the ocean in 1960 with a retro-punk theme to it? I will tell you, NOT ♥♥♥♥ING MANY. I may have played this game back in 2009 on my Xbox 360, but good games trancend the plat-forms that they are on. From the excelent voice acting, great writing with an intriguing story and unique, engaging characters, the final bosss sucks but that's a minor nit-pick, powers (in this case, they're called Plasmids) are diverse; but you can still find a couple over powered ones, though that is a given for this (then new) concept of gaming not truly fully explored. Honestly, I will tell you what everyone has already said about this game, The ENTIRETY of the Bioshock games are worth a buy.			"

												This was possibly my first true FPS experience, and it turns out that it's not a type of game that really works for me - but I can see how this one can be interesting.The steampunk-like, dystopian theme is done in a very apt way. The narrative is interesting, and so is the environmental storytelling. This game certainly presents a unique experience, and I can see why it was such a huge success. I'd definitely recommend it to someone looking for an interesting ambiance for a FPS experience.			"

												Words cannot describe how amazing this game is.But I will try.Firstly, the story. The characters have amazing and well thought out backstories, the story of the game itself is compelling and will constantly twist, without it feeling overused. I don't often like to play a games campaign more than once, but this is definitely an exception. After completing the game once it gives you a completely different viewpoint the next playthrough.Next, the weapons. None are particularly overpowered, and everyone I know who plays has a different favourite gun. They all suit different playstyles in different ways incredibly effectively.Finally, the enemies. Loads of people think Big Daddies are invincible, or that the splicers would be too easy. Yet no, the game is perfectly balanced, Big Daddies can easily be beaten with a little thinking and Splicers are tweaked just enough to make them a slight challenge in large numbers.Overall, this game is probably my favourite of all time, just buy it. There isnt a 96 metascore for nothing! I also highly reccomend the other 2 aswell.			"

												Bioshock is by far one of the most different and coolest games I have played.  I found the world of Rapture to be really creepy and the monsters that I fought as well.  I thought the weapons selection was good and the add ons and upgrades really added spice to them.  I did find myself wanting to get to the end of the game about half way through.  Having to complete tasks in order to advance was just annoying and cumbersome.  When I finally did reach the last boss, he was so easy to beat.  I got all my weapons and ammunition loaded up and ready for the final battle.  The last boss was far easier than most of the monsters I fought throughout the game.  Overall, great game, really creepy, great weapons and decent story.  Every gamer should play this game at least once in their lifetime.  This will go down as a classic.			"

												This isn't your ordinary CoD or BF, this is an adventure. Explore the underwater city of Rapture, a once beautiful landscape. Use a variety of special powers called plasmids. This game has it all.--- Pros --- interesting/fun gameplaygreat graphicsgreat plot--- Cons ---Few bugs/glitchesminor sound concernCompared to present games (2014) might not be the best (this game was released in 2007).---Gameplay---Bioshock allows you many ways to kill: plasmids, weapons, or both. As you progress in the game, you decide if you want to play stealthy (avoid cameras and turrets, secretly walk past enemies) or just go full berserk and kill whatever you fine. The game also has a variety of fun plasmids that let you choose your own way of killing, protection, or just some fun. The weapons, dang.The the game doesn't have like the same ammount of weapons as borderlands, quite a few actually, but they all have a different style and heck, you might prefer burning people, or just beating them up with a wrench, or maybe the classive ""inserting bullets"" with the submachine gun. You might hit a few glitches here and there, but hey, not everything can be perfect right?The whole game revolves around completing missions one by one in an order til you get to the end.There are some fun missions like escort, or taking some pictures, but lots of them are just collect items/get to a checkpoint,  then rinse and repeat. You actually won't get bored since the plot is very interesting but this is a 1 way game. No different missions because of your choices or anything like that. So don't expect freedom such as free-roam... because well... your trapped in an underwater city full of physcos. ---Plot---This is what I think keeps the game going. Like mention earlier, you play as Jack, who survived a plane crash but soon trapped in an underwater city of Rapture. Most of the civilians turned crazy because of the use of plasmids, they are called splicers. You meet a friend name Atlas, who guides you through to escape. Along the way, you will meet interesting characters, allies or foes. In the game, there lies a plot twist. It's actually a big deal, not only does it get you thinking, it also affects your gameplay in an interesting... but annoying way. If you're looking for a good story, this is it.The plot can be very confusing and hard to pick up until about the early-middle of the game or unless you are willingly happy to search around for diaries where you can pick up more info. But just hang it there, your about to be in for a heck of a ride.---Graphics, sounds, and that other stuff---Graphics are AMAZING especially for a game released about ~7 years ago, it'll problaby be on par with the games in 2011-2012, which is darn good for a game released in 2007. The sounds were great, blah blah blah. One big concern was that during radio messages (how you pick up your new missions, etc) and diaries (extra info that can be obtained) which is voiced btw, can be VERY hard to hear with the background noises, footsteps, water movement, gunshots, just VERY hard to hear unless you turn dat volume up so high, even the ceiling can't hold it, then yeah. If this is a concern for you, fear not, just re-read the message in your journal instead of listening to it. This game was surprising playable on a very crappy laptop I used on it, but I had to turn graphics to the lowest, which wasn't really that bad.The game is not really the happiest, bright, sunshine-girl type game. There might be some blood.. gore... or someone being drilled... but eh.... you get used to it. You also might get in some jumpscares that'll get you spamming the guns to kill it... I won't tell you what they are.---VERDICT---So obliviously this game isn't the BEST game in the market right now, I mean if you want, just go play Bioshock Infinitie. But ifi you want the classic, original story, just go with this. You'll have an interestingly fun gameplay while you progress through the story exploring rapture. There are some glitches, and if you happen to dislike the plot in anyway, you might have trouble sticking through the whole game. But that problably won't happen. Yes this game was a great game compared to when it was released, 2007. Now in 2014, there are other, greater, games that problably might even beat this game in everyway. But if you could imagine what games were like in 2007, you'll be surprised by this game.  "

												In my highly valid and valued opinion this game is by far the scariest and most atmospherical game ever. Also it made me interested in the story behind rapture and its inhabitants.

No, says the man in the Vatican; it belongs to God. No, says the man in Moscow; it belongs to everyone. I rejected those answers. Instead, I chose something different. I chose the impossible.

												Bioshock is an atmospheric game that creates a dark beautiful world. The overall story might not satisfy some, but as you continue to play the game you fall in love with Rapture and why was created. The underwater city is not chained by morality and as a result you will encounter disturbing imagery that captivates you at the same time. It is a great shooter that has RPG elements, which increases the variety of gameplay options and allows you to experiment. The choice you make in regards to the storyline also provides another reason to play the game again. Even if the ending is lackluster, the tension and awe you feel throughout the game is extraordinary. Bioshock delivers an enjoyable and immersive experience that should not be forgotten or missed by any avid gamer.			"
