												Fun to play.You can do quests and get new items. Each quest unlocks something new.. Also you can play mini-games. Some kind of survival game.			"

												I had hoped for a simulator of being stranded like a kind of Gilligan's Island the game sort of things, but instead it appears to be a game where you do a lot of building which is all fine, however building takes so long that it is best to play the mini games. Problem with the minigames is you start with only 50 as a cap and many games give you far more than that as a reward.Fun little game and great if you're one of those green-skinned casual gamers too.

												Yes I'd recommend this game. I played this game a REALLY long time ago when I was little, so for me playing it is like going back to my childhood XD! Nontheless i find this game super addictive and I will say you will need some patience for the first couple hours of the game, but once you got probably like 10 - 12 villagers the process in the game speeds up pretty fast!
