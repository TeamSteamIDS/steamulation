												EDIT: Killing Floor 2 is now fully released.I've been playing Killing Floor for years and it is without a doubt one of my favourite games here.+ The combat and carnage is unparalleled: explosions, dismemberment, and headshots look and sound great+ The class and perk system is incredibly robust: classes have unique roles, pros/cons, levelling is addictive+ Huge variety of weapons and maps adds a ton of replayability+ Best free seasonal updates of any game out thereFair warning, this is a skill-based game and it is difficult. Newcomers should start on Normal difficulty to learn the ropes and have fun. Playing on Suicidal and Hell On Earth requires a lot of experience, working as a team, and in-depth knowledge of game mechanics. For many people however - myself included - this is the real draw of the game. If you put in the time, playing on HoE with 5 other experienced players all working together is some of the most fun you can have online. There is also nothing more exhilarating than being the last one alive on Wave 10 knowing your entire team is watching and relying on you to stay alive.Highly recommended.			"

												After playing a total of 126 hrs, I could honestly say this is my favorite zombie FPS style game. The game is incredibly fun and takes strategy to master, especially when attempting to play on the Hell on Earth difficulty. New weapons and free maps come out frequently which help keep the game interesting but being charged to own the latest and greatest weapon packs can be a bit of bummer.. Like all zombie based games, it tends to become repetitious. Luckily, having the option to increase the difficulty, play objective modes, and strive for seasonal achievements gives players more challenges/options to keep the interest in playing alive.  If I had to rate the game, I would rate it a 9.5/10. Would bang.			"

												You find yourself somewhere in the UK, all you can see is fire, dead bodies everywhere and down the street you can hear some idiot screaming for money.Why would anyone ask for money when there are dead bodies laying down everywhere, you might ask?Well, it's simple.We're going shopping.We need guns.Lots of guns.All kinds of guns.Small ones, big ones, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones, good ones, the ones that go boom, the ones that do pew pew pew, axes, katanas, chainsaws, granades, rocket launchers, weird puke throwers (what the hell?!) and some crazy energy guns.10/10 would throw dosh again.""Bloody hell, what's he got on his arms?""*gets minced by a Fleshpound* "

												In my 40 years of video game experience I feel Killing Floor is one of the best FPS games ever made.    The depth of the game is great.  As much as the game focuses on multiplayer  and teamwork and the game shines in those respects.. the solo side of the game is perfectly balanced to make it a great experience also.        As you progress in difficulty the money gets less and it becomes harder to make sure you have the weapons you need when you need them, but as you progress in level your weapons become cheaper and more powerful.  The enemy is varied and as you get in higher difficulties you need to develop the tactics to take the tough ones down safely.  Many tactical skills can  be employed beyond defending one area and who is best suited to kill what depending on choice of class.  Situational tactics like target priority and when to run and how to ""kite"", knowing when you come round a corner to come face to face with a crowd of enemy, just what ones you want to smack once and keep going, kill outright or just keep on keepin' on.   Add to that an active modding community with extra maps, game types, mod weapons, games and modded monsters... free for download.      Not that you have to play it that serious either, many people just find a level they are happy with and just kill stuff for fun... that is one of the great things about the game ... you can play it at any level you desire, but the challenge is there if you seek it.       Things I see as a big plus.             NO PvP  - you will not get ""spys"" or cheaters spoiling other peoples fun.  There is one modded game type GunGame that is Player vs Player, but the normal game dose not.              NO set enemy spawns, in games like some of the ghost recon type games, splinter cell types is that once you figure out a way it gets boring and tedious.  This game is a complete open environment and the enemy can spawn just about anyplace in relation to player position, so even a game played the same way can have different combinations of enemy at any one time.      For reference, other games I consider top notch FPS  -  Unreal Tournament, Quake 3 and Team Arena, BF2142   I consider Killing Floor better than them all.  2000 hours in 6 months speaks for itself.... along with 600 hrs in the free SDK making new maps.   If you like FPS and don't own it, you owe it to yourself to get it.  I have spent $1000's over the years on games that were little better than drink coasters... the money I spent on this game has been the best entertainment value of my life!!edit - as of Nov 2015 3000 hours in game and 2000 hours in the SDK with 36 workshop submissions, most of those original new maps.  An additional 1000 hours on alt accounts for map testing.   Even with KF2 out this game is still well worth getting!Nov 23 2016 Nominated for ""Test of Time"" award.			"

												Don't usually comment or write reviews, but when a game is this old and still brings out free content u have to give them credit, in today's sad monetized gaming industry of Season passes, online passes, launch day dlc, early access, etc.I got into KF pretty late, around couple yrs ago. The first 5 mins I thought this is the biggest pile of crap I've ever purchased. Graphics are ugly, wave after wave in the same smallish map?!?! Why on earth are ppl still playing this game? I put it in my trash list.The following day I had a strange urge to try it again, for whatever reason I don't know. I soon realised this game is not about arcadey run n shoot n regen health bs. This game's depth is about u as a team player and improving yr skills to take on bosses and tight situations. Reading the danger signs, when to run when to hold ground. You won't suddenly level up and get a powerful weapon, u only progress with improving yr gameplay.The weapon mechanics are simply amazing. WARNING: after playing with no aim cursor and using only ironsights all other cursor games will suck.Then there is the community made content. More guns, maps, zeds, bosses.....I have over 1500hrs entertainment time and I only paid $5. I think I bought some dlc just to support devs but its not enough for what they've achieved. I don't usually buy newly released games, the ones I've bought I've regret. But when KF2 comes out....just take my money, take it. Please.TLDR: Buy the game. There's not many devs that care about their product.			"

""Probably the best zombie co-op shooter out there""Temporarly placed between Left4Dead and Left4Dead2 it shows up permanently improved graphics, maps, skins and weapons. It has a great fan community and is still evolving nevertheless KF2 is already been announced.The main difference to L4D is the concept not to fight some hordes, but just a certain amount of 9 different special infected (ZEDs) each of the 10 waves on the same map. Then comes the Boss called the patriarch which is incredible stronger and send some of his children for support. Your character is improvable by long time playing measured in 7 different perks. So you will achieve mastery in many different ways after a while.That doesn't mean your personal player skills are not needed. Instead you must begin to analyze the ZED mechanics in higher difficulties and how the perks work perfectly together. There are 2 ways: Camping  or Kiting to beat the maps. Camping means holdout in a tight place and withstand all over the waves the ZEDs. Kiting means running in circles on a route and takeout one ZED after another. Kiting is more time intense but could be also more fun.The kill animations are absolutely great (at least in the uncut version). Heads are exploding, can be decapitivated. Burning them bodies with flamethrower (firebug) let them coal.  Demolitian has pipebombs and blow up everything that comes to close. On the other side some Zeds have a rage mode where they don't stop chasing you until they killed you. It's totally challenging and depends on the whole team skills if you survive or not.There's a high amount of 280 Achievements atm. Still raising at each seasonal event. You have to await these events to unlock them all. Each map has 4 map achievements from ""normal"" to ""hell on earth"", KFO - interesting objective maps, some kill achievements and special gimmicks, unlockable new character and Tripwire cross game supporting achievement policy. All fun.One little negative is the complex server browser in MP which confuses in the first moment. But after a while you will get used to it.Don't miss this great game that isn't still boring after 1k hours playtime. (helping some friends with achievements). I recommend you to buy somekind of complete pack in order to get a whole bunch of the most important DLC guns and skins included. It just cost you a little more.  I know, some people swear L4D2 is even better and more atmospheric. But you can try to be the master in both games.			"

												The best zombie shooter ever made. Teamplay here really is key, either play together  or die alone in a very very horrible maner.Its wave based with stronger enemies spawning each wave and concludes with a final boss wave. Weapons are perk based and perks can be leveled persistently trough playing. Perks help with lowering weapon costs, higher damage and that sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Weapons are purchasable with money gathered trough each wave (by killing, healing, welding doors, assisting kills...). This combination is what I believe make the game feel great.Most of the DLC are skins and only offer cosmetic changes. The community weapon packs add more weapons (although you can do without). I should also note that the developers still support this game trough frequent free map updates.			"

												I've been playing KF for a while, and from my observations there is a healthy playerbase, especially for a game that released in 2009. 4 years, still strong and Tripwire is still updating the game with new DLC + events. The DLC is optional ofc, usually it's like player skins/cosmetics. Not pay to win.Anyways, to get back to the point; like most multiplayer co-op games you're going to have the experts, vets, average, and the noobs/beginners. I found the community to be pretty friendly, you'll start picking up tips as you continue to play. Of course, if you have a dedicated group, teamwork will be greater as you'll walk into the game with a plan. With good teammates, things go smooth. Sometimes I get randoms that are great, sometimes not. You'll learn more about ""kiting"" ZEDs as you play on Suicidal/HoE (harder difficulties), but camping is much easier in lower-level games.Speaking of difficulty, if you decide to pick up this game today, please join a Beginner/Normal level server and keep playing until you level up to 2 (or 3), then proceed to a Hard difficulty server. Strongly advised NOT to play on Suicidal/Hell on Earth right off the bat. Chances are you'll cause more harm than help as your experience & perk levels are not strong enough for such difficulties (specimens also get stronger by a factor of how many players on the server).This game is simplified down to this: kill b*tches, get money to buy guns/ammo/armour, then rinse and repeat until you get to the Final Boss Level against the Patriarch. He is one of a kind and I will let you discover more about him on your own! (it's more fun that way) Not everybody will have enough money at the trader, so sharing is vital for overall success of your team. Just simple things like throwing a few pounds at your teammate can go a long way.I remember picking up this game like 2 years ago, it's still one of the most played games I own! Didn't know too much and often died getting to the Pat, but every game I played, every wave I beat I learned how to improve. The game has a level system from 0 to 6, so character progression will obviously make KF easier the more you play! A lot of replayability (custom maps + different spawns), the game keeps itself fresh.----TL;DR - this game is still fun after 4 years of release, still getting updates from Tripwire devs. if you enjoy killing♥♥♥♥♥♥with friends in a 6-man environment (much more enjoyable than only the usual 4 person co-op, imo) buy this game! you won't regret it!!!

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Killing Floor Original Release: 2009 Genre Tags: FPS; Coop; Round-Based; Progressive  My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): N/A Multiplayer Aspect: Primary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Multiplayer gamers REVIEWKilling Floor is one of the most fun cooperative FPS games in existence. Team up with up to 5 other players to fight off waves of zombies mutants. Not necessarily groundbreaking, but somehow the concept has been represented in a unique and entertaining way.  If you like cooperative FPS games, this should be a definite pick-up for you.There are various types of mutants. Some are essentially “trash mobs,” but play a role in getting in the way. Then there are mid-tier and high-tier ""specials"" that all have unique attacks. These spawn less frequently, but can wind up overwhelming you if you don’t take them down quickly. And if you make it through all the waves in a match, there is a boss fight. If you play on the highest difficulty and with a full team, then these boss fights are easily among the most exciting and adrenaline-pumping boss fights in all of gaming.There are 7 classes to play as.  You can play as all classes on your account, but only one at a time; and you will permanently level-up each class by playing.  Having higher levels is a must if you want to take on the higher difficulties.  On those high difficulties the true brilliance of the gameplay really shines. You’ll have to play smart and as a team if you want a chance to beat the maps on Hell on Earth. It can be incredibly challenging, and you may go a while without winning a single match. But when you finally do, it can be incredibly satisfying.   Having said that, it should be noted that the game also scales with the size of your team, and you can play solo which lowers the amount of enemies per wave and lowers their stats. Because of this, playing solo is actually easier for some, although if you make a single mistake it is game over because there is no one to pick up the slack. I personally feel the game is way more fun with full teams (and thus full enemy spawns with max stats).Also, there is a lot of DLC, but don't let that turn you off.  I have not bought a single DLC for this game, and have over 300 hours of fun and have nearly every achievement (except for two that I’m not worthy of).  That said, a couple of the DLCs are worth getting as they grant you access to some great weapons that are very effective and fun to use. And anyone who owns any DLC can drop the unlocked weapons in game for someone else to pick up for that match.So if you like games like Left 4 Dead or Payday, this is very much in the same vein. However, it also has a great unique identity. It is a sure bet for anyone who likes cooperative shooters and challenging gameplay.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												Brief summary:Pros:	+Easy to jump into and have fun	+Should be able to run on the majority of Computers	+Huge amounts of replayability	+Workshop support ensures you can always try a new map or mutator out	The game's harder difficulties provide a real challenge to the hardcore	Most of the DLC is purely cosmetic	+The game is frequently updated with newer weapons (This might not happen anymore          as kf2 comes closer)	+Has a SDK if you want to use that. Cons:	Some of the perks you can use aren't as useful as others	The hitboxes can become a pain at times	Some mechanics aren't explained at all	At times, the community can be bad(They're a minority)	Recent DLCs lock some more useful weapons away. Not too big of an issue though	Server browser is a bit annoying at times //Long version//Killing floor is co operative first person shooter where up to six british men can exterminate zeds,an experiment gone wrong.(There are are also a few women and a robot)Graphics: Killing floor's graphics are decent and the art style of some maps in particular are amazing, and give out its atmosphere well. Don't expect anything spectacular though.This game should be able to run on most older pcs just fine if you lower the graphics a lot and your resolution. Any good pc should run this with no worries.This game caters to both casual and hardcore players. The objective is simple, kill all the enemies. It's easy to jump in and understand that you should probably kill all the guys trying to rip you apart. for those who play the game more often, the game can get really intense on the harder difficulties, where an understanding of each zeds mechanics is required to succeed.Since this is a team based game, having friends along can make the experience much more better. Although if you're a solo player like me, the game is still a ton of fun, just a lot more fun with friends. Every enemy in this game feels unique, from the basic waddling clot to that guy with a chainsaw for an arm. Each enemy acts differently, and each have characteristics that separate them from the others.The maps in this game are of a wide variety. Some take place in urban environments, some in factories, others in fictional lands. With the workshop, you can find countless more community maps.The voice acting of this game is both a positive and a negative. It is humorous at first, but when you start playing a lot, it gets incredibly repetitive.The majority of the DLC for this game is cosmetic, skins for your character or a camo for you weapon. There are a few DLCs which give you new weapons. none of them are completely overpowered but some contain useful weapons. I recommend buying these DLCs first.At its price, killing floor is absolutely worth it. It also frequently goes on sale, so grab it during then if you're unsure.// Review end //I rewrote this because i noticed it had become popular, I updated the horrible formatting because it was not easy to read. I cleaned up a lot of the content and added a brief summary. Hopefully this helped			"

Killing Floor  Field Rating Review   Graphics 7 Not terrible, not great. Killing floor is a few years old at this point, but the graphics are still satisfying to look at. The environments are nothing to oogle over, but the game does an overall good job of generating atmosphere.   Gameplay 7.5 A solid, fast-paced FPS. Killing floor does a great job of allowing you to feel like you are, to some extent, surviving an assualt of ""zombies."" The guns are satisfying to shoot, and the interface is clean. The barricade feature makes for great gameplay and intense moments, if you make use of it. The biggest problem Killing Floor faces gameplay wise is the leveling system. It is painfully slow to gain new ranks in this game. Thankfully they are addressing this in Killing Floor 2. Know this also: There are a lot of things you can buy with real money in Killing Floor, BUT, they do a good job of not putting you at a disadvantage if you don't have the DLCs. You still have what feels to be a full, solid game, with lots of maps (not to mention the community workshop), and a couple game modes!   Story N/A There is a story here, but it exists purely to give you a background: ""Terrible experiment gone wrong.""    Multiplayer 8.5 Killing Floor is at its best when you're playing with a group of friends, trying to survive against the merciless onslaught of enemies the game throws at you. You'll find yourselves rushing to a safe place to hole up and defend, each of you watching the barricaded doors as they are slowly pounded down by the terrors on the other side. Or, you'll make the mistake of seperating, and listen as each of your friends dies off, one by one. There is still a fairly active community in this game, so you'll be able to enjoy it even if you pick it up so long after release.   Replayability 7 Killing Floor has plenty of maps to play through, with tons more added by the community. Having owned the game for several years now, I've found that I do keep coming back to this one to have a solid good time with friends. That being said, despite the plethora of maps you are given, Killing Floor can end up feeling very repetitive at times. All in all, you'll keep coming back to play Killing Floor, but it won't be every day or week.   Overall 7.6/10 Killing Floor is certainly one of the best zombie shooters out there, and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a solid FPS. If you're looking to capture the feeling of ""surviving,"" Killing Floor can do the trick for you for awhile. Eventually it boils down to be an FPS with the enemies skinned as Zombies. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you see this one on sale, pick it up. They are constantly updating it with fun new maps and reskinned enemies. It's not a purchase you will regret.

Killing Floor - ReviewKilling Floor is a teambased first person shooter game made by Tripwire Interactive that puts an emphasis on teamwork. The main goal of the game is to work together with a team to kill a certain amount of zeds in each wave in order to get to wave 11 and kill the patriarch. Without working together with your team and forming a plan of some kind, you will die. That's one of the best things about Killing Floor, and one of the reasons why I love it so much. However this doesnt mean it's without its flaws.There are 7 perks aka classes to choose from and they each play a specific role in your team. You'll level up after doing enough damage, getting headshots or killing a certain number of zeds. The higher you level up, the more benefits you recieve such as lower weapon costs and a starting weapon. However this isn't necessarily a good thing since it puts a big gap between newer players and the long time players. The perks themselves seperate Killing Floor from a bunch of other games since each one plays differently.Guns are a plenty in Killing Floor with around 7 or so weapons per perk (more with dlc). Each perk weapon is special with the amount of damage it does, how fast it shoots, and the reload speed. Each weapon also has a different sound effect which really gives each weapon a unique feeling to them as well as making some weapons really statisfying to kill zeds with. This doesn't mean that all weapons are good though, some are unbalanced and are either too costly for it's own good, or not being better than some of the higher end guns. The berzerker perk however doesn't feel as fleshed out as the others since you're basically slapping the zeds while trying not to get hit.Along with the many different guns, maps, and perks this game offers, there's also many different zed types. In total there are 10 different zed types including the patriarch and each of them behaves differently. Because of this, some perks and the weapons they use work well against certain zeds, another thing that makes Killing Floor one of my favorites. However, this requires you to memorize different strategies to use for each of the zeds resulting in a slightly difficult learning curve for newer players. Although memorizing the paterns comes naturally to some people since the behaviors correlate with the sound cues they give, so it isn't too big an issue.Overall, if you're looking for a challenging fps game, you should definitely give this game a try. While Killing Floor 2 is already out and similar, the original Killing Floor feels like a different game entirely with different strategies than the second game. If you know anyone who plays Killing Floor, you should play with them as playing with friends makes this game much more enjoyable. You can usually find this game for $5 during sales, or you can get it in the Digital Deluxe version of Killing Floor 2, but it suffers from a ton of bugs that ruin Killing Floor 2 (Microtransaction drops are bugged despite already being  such a controversial feature, gg tripwire).Pros:► 7 perks / class to choose from► Tons of weapons and maps► Weapons sound great and each kill is satisfying► Difficulty and zed count ramps up as more people join (teamwork is essential)► A nice and fitting soundtrack► Multiple types of zeds that behave differently► Hilarious british accentsCons:► Unbalanced Weapons► Melee isn't fleshed out as it could've been (fitting pun)► There is an objective mode, but it only includes 3 official maps (you can however find some on the workshop)Hit / Miss:► Learning curve requires you to memorized what works against each zed, which might ward off newer players► Somewhat slow startPersonal Rating:Avoid at all costsPick up during a saleWorth PlayingMust PlayEdit: Removed my previous edit, placing it here. Edit basically said to get kf2 digital deluxe, however the game is currently bugged out more so than i've seen in any early access game.			"

												I don't know where to start as a long time player. Killing Floor is sickness, a wicked one at its finest. Teamworking wave by wave your way up to face the horror itself is a great fun. Although, game itself is coated in black humor, which is swirled inside small popular culture and steampunk references. Not everyone's cup of tea at that, but I assure you everyone can take the joy of killing mindless clone armies even it's given in a literature covered in vain and desperation.Game is hard, I'll give you that and it takes time to get used to some patterns, but once you get used to it; they will become habits like the game itself. More you play, more you will seek about its balance and mechanics and it will sink you deeper into it. Because getting better and everything resolves in teamplay.If you're into black humor, survival co-op, hidden popular culture references and mindless killing fest where you are the actual prey; you gotta buy this game and play it. Otherwise, keep playing your tacticool and deathmatch first-person shooters.			"

												Killing Floor is a casual, story-driven game. It's a creative interpretation of current day America and deals with controversial issues such as immigrants, gun control and abortion. Similarly to the Bible, Killing Floor can be interpreted literally or figuratively at any time, depending on whatever point you want to prove. Putting this in the genre of Surivival/Horror is risky as one of the perks removes any sensation of danger or difficulty. This simulator accurately depicts areas like suburbs and packed metropolitan areas in a utopian society. The constant thrill was incredible - something not expected from a turn-based rpg.From looking at the landscape to watching people die right before your eyes, any casual player should take a swing at this team-driven, racing game.I give this real-time strategy game 10/10.

Adrenalive-fueled & addictive // Recommended for those looking for quick tempo & gratuitous carnage+ Leveling system is basic but well-implemented, as are the class perks+ There is a frequently implemented slow-motion ability which, when triggered by a player, affects everyone; rather than proving a nuisance, it surprisingly adds to the experience & makes for some very cinematic moments (also does well you give one a few quick breathers in-between the action)+ Soundtrack is heavy & loud; perfect for the pace of the game, & serves to get the player's blood pumping+ Very helpful & generous community; this is most often demonstrated by the culture of money dropping & weapon sharing that is extremely prevalient (almost uniformly) among the player base+ Voiced quips are comical & entertaining+ Intensely satisfying gunplay & general combat; weapons, even melee, feel as though they have weight+ Vast arsenal of weaponry to choose from+ Steam workshop integration; very mod-friendly, which serves to increase replayability with a little bit of effort+ Impressive enemy mob variation, each with its own, unique characteristics- The amount of in-game advertising, either for DLC or products completely divorced from the title, is very distracting- Declining population; at the time of this review, there were a number of servers available, & several of them were full up, so it certainly isn't a dead game, but it was noticeably less active than when I first picked up the game a year or so ago- Poor movement animations & sub-par textures; presentation is a bit strained by age, though not jarringly soLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

About this game:Killing Floor is a Co-op Survival Horror FPS set in the devastated cities and countryside of England after a series of cloning experiments for the military goes horribly wrong. You and your friends are members of the military dropped into these locations with a simple mission: Survive long enough to cleanse the area of the failed experiments! Features:This game features some hilarious physics, excellent gore and violent gameplays. There are also seasonal events where the game's Zeds will be changed/updated to a holiday themed monster. In addition to that, there are achievements that is only obtainable during a specific season/event. Recommendation:It is advised to play this game with good friends before jumping into public online servers. Because this is a co-op survival based game, teamwork is critical to surviving. One would always meet people that will refuse cooperation due to the human nature of the online community. Always select servers with PINGS under 260. Any online game with over 260 becomes extremely difficult and sometimes even rendering it being unplayable. There will always be people kind enough to show new players the ropes to becoming more experienced/better with this game. So what are you waiting for? GET THIS GAME AND PLAY!			"

												1111 hours on record is as good a time as any to finally write an actual review for this.I'll get the less interesting stuff out of the way first:- The graphics are passable enough, with good customisation options that allow you to buy frames per second for some eye candy (mmm, candy!). I suppose it may look dated but I've never considered myself a graphics snob so it doesn't bother me.- The sound effects are fine for the most part, the soundtrack is hit-or-miss based on what genres of music you like, I turned it off completely so I can hear what's happening around me because I prefer situational awareness to heavy metal.Where the game shines is the gameplay.That is if you're willing to invest some serious time in it as the learning curve is one of the most intricate ones I've seen. This is interesting considering the simplicity of the premise - there are two gamemodes (one of which only has 3 official maps and frankly I've always seen it as a mere gimmick), in the standard one the players fight 4, 7 or 10 waves of zombies (9 types with different strengths and weaknesses, some of which complement one another dangerously well) plus the same boss every time and that's it. That really sounds like it should get old quickly, yet somehow it doesn't - there's always new stuff to learn, skills to improve, weapon loadouts to try... I don't think anyone can honestly say ""I know everything there is to know about KF"".A large portion of the advanced tricks and tactics I believe are actually a result of quirks in the code that weren't intentional but happened to make the game much more complex than it looks on the surface.The downside to all this is that experienced players often have little tolerance for inexperienced ones who haven't figured out the ideal loadouts and strategies yet. It can be difficult to pick the game up now and start learning because people WILL insult you, votekick you etc, but it can be done - there are loads of guides explaining both the basics and the advanced stuff, and some experienced players like coaching newer ones and showing them the ropes. As long as you're willing to learn and don't act like a twæt, you should be fine.So yeah, Killing Floor 1, while slowly growing old, is a gem of the FPS genre. It's definitely not for everyone but if you do get into it, you're in for many hours of good fun.			"

												Which things you should know about Killing Floor?Turn on all your possible sarcasm, please.So,Killing Floor is mutual aid, when a dude from your team screams for help, you run to him but he quickly runs past you and, as a result, leaves the whole party of both his and your specimens on you.Killing Floor is strategy, when all your team camps certain place, while one zerker kites around the map on his own and, finally, focks up all game in its end.Killing Floor is teamwork, when once you ask your team not to kill the last zed during a certain wave to have enough time to get to the trader, shop and come back to your camp spot but some focken fageet ignores you and kills the last specimen anyway. Every. Damn. Wave.Killing Floor is suddenness, when a noob from your team rages a Scrake or the Fleshpound on the other side of the map from you but the rage goes exactly on you instead of this poor retard.Killing Floor is support, when there are just 3 Scrakes left out of an entire wave and your team runs to the trader, leaving you alone on the camp spot. And you're a commando.Killing Floor is mutual respect, when after every your even small mistake during the game you hear: «My granny shoots better than you!..».Killing Floor is fun, when a firebug enters a game at wave 9 and rages 3 Scrakes and the Fleshpound at once with flame thrower.Killing Floor is understanding, when a sudden demo enters a game with 3 zerkers and 2 medics in the team, asks for dosh, dies in first seconds of the new wave and quits game, leaving the team without money but with extra zeds incoming.Killing Floor is diversity, when only you of the entire team go sharp for the Patriarch, while everyone else take medics.Killing Floor is cohesion, when you're the only sharp or demo in the team and all players just freeze and stare at you when you try to kill a Scrake or the Fleshpound, while you're getting eaten by clots and crawlers.Killing Floor is friendship, when you get teamkilled by a dude with a harpoon launcher or a welder.Killing Floor is logic, when a demo from your team places a tone of pipes for the Patriarch and then stands exactly on them.Killing Floor is realism, because 9mm pistol is weightless and desert eagle weighs just 2kg.In conclusion, Killing Floor is grand, GRAND INDEED!

												Excellent co-op game that benefits from good enemy design and varied and high quality map selection. The gunplay feels right and I think it benefits from no artificial crosshair. The heavy emphasis on good smart teamplay to survive further serves to improve the experience.To survive a wave of failed abominations (well are these ever really successful?) after a visceral bout where one mistake might well mean a full belly for these monsters imparts a definite sensation of achievement. The perks system works well and once your skill level improves along with your preferred perk’s level you’ll be able to tackle the harder difficulty levels that are truly “hellish” for the unprepared.Simple design, excellent execution and a tense game that rewards smart teamplay makes for an overall excellent online experience that only improves with friends.

												Killing Floor is a sickness, a wicked one at its finest. There is  a very impressive selection of guns that you get to use to fight the specimens off. The players also get to choose their class. The class system is great, because it allows teammates to specialise, what means that teamwork is encouraged greatly. Requires good tactics and has  great atmosphere. Every class has their own sets of priorities, each have their drawbacks and advantages.The sound effects are great, and the soundtracks made by Zynthetic are phenomenal. Overall Tripwire has truly put so much content and work into this game that it's a must  in your inventory. <3			"

 About Killing Floor	Killing Floor is by far my most played steam game, and was the entire reasoning for me getting a steam account in the first place. A friend sent me the ""guest pass"" for Killing Floor and had me try it out, and then ended up gifting me it for $5 when I enjoyed it. I first got Killing Floor in August of 2009, so 4 years later and I still play this game daily pretty much. The replay value is through the roof, not to mention if you buy it on one of the frequent sales. Will put it under $10 USD. DLCs might have become a little pricey over the past few years, but the fact that Tripwire Interactive still does free content updates for this game nearly FIVE YEARS post release is simple mind blowing. I don't know of any other company that continues support for it's product that long into the future. The few companies that continually support releases that I can think of have all produced sequels to those games. Release Date: 14 May, 2009The Gameplay Now to get down to gameplay. Killing Floor first and foremost is a FPS game. There are a variety of different types of guns, spread around in 7 different perks or classes. These perks have a ""progression system"" that allows a player to get more ""profficient"" with the weapons of their classes and earn more ""bonuses"" such as being able to carry more ammo, do more damage, and other things of that nature. Each perk has a different role which helps a team in it's own unique way. Like making things blow up, then Demolitions is the perk for you with it's LAW, M32 multiple grenade launcher, m79, and others.. Like setting things on fire and feeding the inner pyromaniac in yourself? Then firebug is the perk for you with it's flamethrower, flare revolvers, Husk fireball launcher, and other guns with incendiary ammo. Enjoy the satisfying feeling of blowing an enemies head off? Then pick the sharpshooter perk, with it's assortment of pistols, sniper rifle, compound crossbow, or various rifles. Killing Floor has the most satisfying gun play of any game I've ever played. Excellent feel to the weapons, and they look and sound great.  Game ModeWhen it comes to enemies, there are 10 different types of enemies to deal with. Each one of the ""zeds"" are similar in some ways, but different in most. There are the basic enemies, such as the clot, which can grab any perk aside from the beserkser. Clots don't do all that much damage, but they can make you not able to move and allow the other, more dangerous enemies to get to you and do more damage. Then you get to the more specialised enemies such as stalkers, which can go invisible, bloats, which puke ""bile"" on you which can hurt you and ruin your body armor, to sirens, whose screams can shatter glass, destroy rockets, grenades and explosives, break down the welds of doors, and eventually make your head explode, to the husk, resistant to fire attacks (for the most part) who can melee you when up close but is much more dangerous at distance where they can shoot fireballs at you. The more advanced of the enemies are the Scrake, which is a high health enemy with a chainsaw that if it gets close to you, it will start to saw away at your health. If you are getting attacked by a scrake, don't run, because their full swings and charging attacks do exponentially more damage to you. Scrakes are best left to sharpshooters which can stun it, berserkers which can do the same thing, or support specialists that know advanced ""Techniques"" to deal iwth them,Next you have the Fleshpound, which is a big, hulking enemy with high health and hard to kill. High head damage resistance make it so it shrugs off weaker weapons. Sharpshooters with good aim and fast reflexes can take them out in a number of ways, but can really only do so one at a time. Support specialists get explosives bonuses, which make it a good choice to take out fleshpounds (unless there is a siren nearby). Demolotions is the most polished perk to take down Fleshpounds, as they have a weakness to explosives. All in All Killing Flooris a very nice Survival-Action Game!10/10 From MeSweep	 "

												Killing Floor is a game where you are constantly shooting at the ground.There is a lot of weapons to choose from but the shotguns are clearly the best because you don't even have to aim really.The goal of the game is to kill as many floor monsters as you can.You have to shoot Spider man, Robot man, and even the one guy from super mario.The game gets even better when you put in mods, with these mods you can play as Master Chef from the Halo, and you can play as Issac Clark from Space invaders on the atari 2600.This game is really good and I recomend it to all ages.I give this game a Yes/10			"

												A damned good zombie-killin' co-op game if I've ever seen one. Seven years after its release and this game is still going strong. The gameplay is solid and well-balanced; every class and every weapon has a place in the game. Leveling up can be a pain but it's ultimately worth it.The people in KF tend to be a bit smarter than the typical co-op player; I've hardly seen any trolls in-game and most people at least make an attempt to play well. My only warning is to be careful of what servers you play on. I've been immediately banned from games for poor or nonexistent reasons. Laughably, the admins of KF servers tend to be worse-tempered than the players. Don't be suprised if you get booted from a game. As usual, playing with friends and / or playing on a server you can trust helps a lot.Also the sound the Trenchgun makes still makes me inexplicably happy.			"

												Yet another undying classic.Killing floor is one of those arcade-like shoot em up games. With a mixture of proper FPS gameplay and some wacky weapons. Cause of its age it can run on almost any computer these days. And you will never have a shortage of servers. (Unless its on HoE Difficulty) Never-the-less. Its very challenging on higher difficulties. Which is a big thumbs up from me. As it makes for very intense gameplay. Each class has its role. And some are weaker against certain enemies. And some are buffed for them. Very time consuming to level up each class. Worth it in the end in my oppinion.			"

												Tripwire Interactives Killing Floor is what you would expect of a polished mod, but doesn't exceed expectations as a retail game. It's good, but unfortunately far from perfect. A nice addition to the survival-horror genre though, and it has an attractively cheap price tag.Once a mod now a game on its own, Killing Floor confronts the player with hordes of undead minions threatening his character’s life. While being independent enough of zombie-shooter-king Left 4 Dead with features like sealing doors, character perks and weapon stores, the game itself offers little variety and a flawed AI.It's not the sort of game that future generations will gather to celebrate, linking hands and singing sad songs of fond remembrance. It is, however, clever, boisterous, faintly silly and relatively cheap.Hectic coop multiplayer game offers no story but straight–forward nonstop mayhem in stylish locations. Rich and balanced equipment makes the multiplayer clashes all the fun.Ultimately though, the sort of plotless killing gets old, or at least it did for me.A decent little title, and a testament to just how far you can take your hobby if you but try.

												One of my favorites games!This is in all sales so buy and don't forget: send to friends and have fun a lot!The Perk's system is very balanced so you have 7 perk and 6 levels to up,isn't too easy (support will take hours and hours of your gameplay till lvl 6) but a demolition can up very fast /exemple.About the graphics.. its awesome to 2009 higher and highest is very cool.Characters.... hahahaha the voice is so funny. Some characters like Mr. Foster is well liked by all,i really don't like the female voice but isn't annoying too. This game have characters that you can buy and some character (like Rachel or steampunk fosters) you only can get by achiev,so good luck...Co op.... Of course in this game you can have fun a lot with friends, but to find a team to HoE isn't a easy task.Soundtrack... Really cool i enjoyed it a lot.Yes,i recommend this game.			"

With a powerful and supportive community, the game developers and gamers create this incredible atmosphere of cooperation, challenge, and gore.This game is great to play with friends or to make friends.  The more you learn about the game and the better you become, it is one of the most challenging and rewarding games out there.  It is no wonder players can play over 4k hours on this and still not be bored of it.  I would highly recommend this game, especially if you have friends that play it so you can play it with them.

												Its rough around the edges - a couple of the elements used here are definitely outdated by modern standards - but one way or another, this game is one of the top Co-Op games I have played. I refuse to call it a horror game, though, and getting into the right lobbies and being able to have a fun experience is, at times, rather a game of patience. In case you're interested, though, and are a bit unsure: I can say that you will not regret picking up KF. Maybe KF2 is a better choice for you, but that one I leave up to your personal judgement.

												Let's see here.. A fan of FPS ? A fan of shooting and decapitating zombie heads ? As you can see from my hours, what I find is that the community (or friends that you gained from people you met from public games) is the one that makes this old game worth the time. While there are normal solo and objective mode along with mods, the real value comes from multiplayers as this game's main value is through co-op.This game have 5 difficulties:Beginner (Every zeds drop like flies if you hit them enough)Normal (A bit more challenge, needs slightly more coordination between teams, but spam and pray method still works)Hard (A more difficult challenge, needs better coordination between teams, spam and pray method is not so effective anymore, even level 6s can die pretty quick in hard)Why do I stop here? Because the last two difficulties will be discussed later. Now... for first-timers...You start out knowing nothing, level 0 perks, killing zeds is your priority, getting powerful guns are a chore, people (in pub games) don't give you money when you need that last $20 for an aa12 or m32 grenade launcher, you spam and pray hoping that those big monsters will die. How come my nade didn't work when the siren screams?You went on to play in normal, zeds are harder, that big glowy guy along with that chainsaw dude eat you alive, the patriach kills you like you are nothing. At this point, majority of first-timers went back to beginner, stayed in normal or hard difficulty and very rarely went up to the last two difficulties. Now, this is the point where most players do not continue playing. I have to say that because:- It takes a lot of commitment to be good in this game, a lot of grinding perks (getting those medic heals, headshots, stalker kills), repetitive maps, even the old status of the game does play a part (as it is 5+ years old which in gaming industry it can be considered a bit out-dated) along with KF2 coming out in full release soon.For those that actually stayed and grind those perks, you might finally reach a level 6 which is the highest perk level for one of the perks, finding out you can kill zeds more efficiently, less money to buy guns and ammo at trader, and killing that big glowy guy and chainsaw guy (which now you might know as fleshpounds and scrakes respectively). Nonetheless, the last two difficulties on Killing Floor can and mostly be considered as a 'filter' to see if one does actually have the will and skill it takes to survive. I myself, was a part of these players, spamming aa12 shotguns at scrakes and fleshpounds hoping they will die. But a player and a small number of other players mentioned the ineffectiveness of such methods. At this point as well, some will listen, some won't. Those who don't, will just stay in normal and hard difficulty forever, but they  will be very hard-pressed, let alone to win against the patriach, but just to survive the zed waves in higher difficulties.Then, one day, after you actually meet a player who you considered as very good (or an expert or can even be considered legends) and listens, a whole new world opens up filled with even more stuff and knowledge. This factor along with a solid teamwork (which are paramount) for the last two difficulties:- Suicidal (Even more difficult, as zed's HP and their damage goes up along with other limitations such as you can't flinch lock sc with katana, pray and spray method are detrimental. Most level 6 'eternal normal and hard-dwellers' would wipe a lot here. Some of them would just get frustrated and rage quit. The level of teamwork is a step or two up compared to hard and specific perk roles are a must)And once you spend hours learning from the 'expert/pro/legendary' players on multiple ways to kill sc or fp with different perks, you feel ready to take on the highest difficulty:- Hell on Earth (The highest difficulty, perks with specific roles along with solid communication and teamwork are paramount. Patriach fight is very challenging and damages that the zeds give out along with HP are more painful. One mistake on a critical point could mean an instant wipe even when you have those expert/pro/legendary players)At this point, you learn even more ways and tactics to survive Hell on Earth and beat the patriach. Then you realised... when you went down to normal and hard, it becomes almost too easy and people start to notice you killing fp in seconds before it even reaches the team. Before you know it, you are that 'expert' player. It needs to be noted that the learning curve goes up exponentially from Hard to Suicidal because the multitude of skills, abilities, and knowledge learned to survive there. If you managed to read and keep on going till this point, congratulations because you are part of the top 5% of Killing Floor players.Then.. does it end there? When you finally got all the achievements (looking at you, Schneidzekk kill while falling and the one for FP in the back with dwarf axe) ? No, actually. Because there are lots of methods to kill the big zeds (sc, fp and patriach). When you rejoice at the fact that you are finally able to properly lock the patriach with the katana/machete/knife/welder/syringe and dance around it as it tried to chain guns you, you find out there is actually a tournament... with teams all over the world trying to beat each other with the fastest time!You took the initiative and form a team with your other expert/pro/legendary friends from different countries, you practice, find faster camp spots, certain tactics as you improved your individual and teamwork skills even more. You also find that your teammate's skills as a whole have developed significantly as well, so much that it would not be possible in a normal setting. Strategies are formed, discussions, insults, banters are made. Gathering people for practice is a chore (It really is!), and giving time for yourself to practice locking patriach with katana. And then tournament comes, as you play in the opening rounds which are recorded for anyone around the world to watch, you wonder to the first time you decided to actually start playing this game, the moment you actually listens to advices and how it lead you from a spam-and-pray player to a solid Hell on Earth player to actually play in a very solid team against the best teams in the world. The training, discussions, friendships made, skills learned, I think in the end, it was worth it.If you actually played the game till this point, then congrats... as you are probably a very solid Hell on Earth player.For the others that might not have the same 'eagerness', it is a fun game to play with friends, and hey, burning zeds to death is fun too :PI r8 8/8 m8.

												Killing floor is a horror fps game that is similar to game elements of the Left 4 Dead series.  You go through different maps with hordes of zombies charging at you from all sides where you have to watch your back or else you could be instantly dead.  It is fun to play with four to six people including you. Gameplay: Aiming is lackluster some with the variety of weapons you get to buy after each wave ends and another begins. Once a wave ends the trading shop is open where you spend money that you just got from fighting through hordes of zombies each wave. Your money stacks up once you kill more and more enemies and you lose money when you die before a wave ends. There is a red-line that helps guide you along your way to find the shop; though your usually given only thirty seconds of time to make it there , purchase your new weapon or weapons and buy ammo.Graphics: Graphics are on par with the first Left 4 Dead graphics. Everything is crisp and it is well optimized for various different machines.Community: When I look at steam charts this game is usually high up there still just like the Left 4 Dead series with how many lobbies are open and how many players play at any given time. They also have the community workshop implemented in this game where others can create some cool things.Overall: The game feels more simplistic with its shooting mechanics then does Left 4 Dead which I like. It is fun, addictive like some other shooters like Left 4 Dead series of course and Call of Duty. You can hear zombies moaning, groaning and hear loud noises of a female zombie called a siren that let's out a large squeal before she is attacked.10/10 Time well spent and enjoyed it better than what I have played and seen from Left 4 Dead 2.

												Time for a re-review, since I never gave it a proper one.*Sees Patriarch**Insult Specimen*Killing Floor is a HARDCORE Post Apocalyptic Co-op Survival game, or in other words, Post Apocalyptic life simulator in Great Britain where you have to kill zeds to earn Do$h which you use to buy weapons to kill even more zeds.Emphasis on 'HARDCORE'. It is easily one of the most difficult, hardcore games I've ever played. It makes Payday: The Heist (another co-op game at which I'm really good at) look easy in comparison. Hell I like playing games on the hardest difficulties, but on this game, even Hard difficulty on certain maps (which is below Suicidal and Hell On Earth) can be pretty hard. Or maybe I'm just not good enough.Features 2 different game modes, standard wave-based Survival mode and Objective mode, 7 different classes, a large variety of enemy zeds, each with their own strenghts and weaknesses, a ton of weapons, Instrumental Industrial Heavy Metal, along with some Electronic music, which are both pretty damn nice.Weapons are all really fun to use. Impactful, great sounds, manual recoil control, all make for terrific gunplay.The game can be described as somewhat boring, yet fun at the same time (at least on the standard Survival mode). One 10 wave game can last up to 50 minutes or more. On most maps you either spend the entire match camping one certain spot, or kiting around the map with a certain strategy. To add to the tension, after killing everything in a wave, you only have 60 seconds to get to the trader, resupply, and regroup. If you kill all the specimens while being far away from the trader, you're ♥♥♥♥ed. Killing everything as fast as possible while kiting can trigger far too many enemy spawns to spawn in the direction you're going, which can cause the death of your team (or yourself while playing Solo!)Now let's get to the bad parts. The game suffers from a half broken server browser, in the sense that it is REALLY REALLY slow. The solution to that is to Alt-Tab into the desktop for several seconds and then Alt-Tab back into the game to get the complete server list. There's arguably somewhat better weapons behind community weapon pack DLCs. Then there's the wonky head hitboxes, which can make going for headshots with certain projectile based weapons difficult, preventing them from reaching their maximum potential.Unless you're level 5 or 6 on a class (you spawn with a class weapon at level 5), joining games that are past wave 2, 3 or so is not recommended, and even then, I wouldn't do it on higher difficulties. You won't have the gear to face the extra specimens, or money to upgrade. You might end up hurting the team you join. This is where the leveling system works against the player. Also, the Commando has the worst requirements for leveling up of all the classes. For this class alone, I suggest using leveling maps for killing Stalkers (or alternative better methods)And, trying to play on the more difficult, less played maps can be difficult. The server list is either populated by overplayed easy maps, or custom ones (custom servers can be pretty cringey). BioticsLab (which is a base game map) is ♥♥♥♥ing boring and easy as hell, and trying to get a game on Clandestine or Hell can be difficult. If you do find a server playing on a specific map, it might be already past wave 3 or more, and joining it then is just suicidal.And then there's the fugly event zeds. Ugh. Probably one of the worst decisions they've made is adding those into the game. And those horrible xmax/circus themed soundtracks, what the ♥♥♥♥?Despite all these issues, I guess I still recommend the game.			"

												I only recently have gotten into this game, but I've already fallen in love with it. Each Zed feels unique and threatening in their own way, even clots can mess you up if you get swarmed by them. Many combos and techniques are needed in high level play to take out higher level zeds and you always feel like there's room to improve. Most maps feel well balanced and most weapons feel unique.With a game concept as simple as ""survive as long as you can"" you think it would get boring after a while. But it simply doesn't. This game is just addictive. buy it already.			"

												The Short: Get it if you want an old school FPS that's co-op based. Old game engine, no story really to care of, good gun mechanics, hard learning curve relative to modern FPS's (COD MW, Battlefield); balanced game play, rewards skill over earned perks/guns. The Long:It's kind of weird to have a game with really a rubbish, tissue thin premise and graphics from a decade ealier to have anything really to offer in this COD MW era of FPS.  On a whim and a steam sale, I bought KF just for kicks.By the looks of it I have the guns, the companions and a dumb AI to deal with, this should be a cake walk for an hour or so, and then I'm back to Far Cry 3/BD...well, Far Cry is crying in its lonely corner with Michael Biehn for a while now.... What KF lacks in graphic polish and writing, it has in game balance, this is  where the classes are complimentary towards each other, every shot counts when things get thick and there are no gun/bomb/airstrike/gunship to save you. If you're not playing to the strengths of your class, your team mates will and do yell viciously at you. The real satisfaction is when you play with a good team and beating up the baddies :3Even if you find that it's getting easy to survive then just crank up to Hell on Earth, and you'll find out how old school FPS Killing Floor will drag down your ego. There also is a huge modding community given KF's relative small player pool against the likes of COD and Battlefield. I did play the Halos, COD MW 1+2+BO and BF 2 for extensive amounts of time on Xbox, but this is a good alternative and reminds me of my Unreal 2/UT days :3			"

												I have been playing Killing Floor since not long after it came out and I still can't get enough of it.One great thing about it, is that it's all skill-based. You cannot play the game for the first time and jump to a higher difficulty and expect to do good. You won't. The game has quite a bit of a learning curve. Even for people who have been playing awhile, taking jumps to higher difficulty is tough.The game is very in depth with multiplayer. Each of the 7 perks has their pros and cons, and each has a ""role"" for the team. One of the most fun things is getting a team of friends, working together and owning the Patty. ;) When it really comes down to it, the most important thing about playing CO-OP KF, is knowing your role. What to do, and not to do, and when playing with a team, not knowing what to do can kill you all.There are 7 different perks, or specialists. Each perk has specific weapons for their class. There's also a leveling system for the perks. With each level you gain your perk gets better.The weapon mechanics are great. The wide range of weapons and weapon types is even better. There's everything from swords, to snipers, to flamethrowers, multiple kinds of pistols, ETC. There really is something for everyone.Now, I've read some reviews and some people have said that the game is ""pay to win"" and that you need the DLC weapons. Wrong. You most certainly do not need them to win, and half of them are kinda sucky anyway. The maps are all different and cool, plus there's hundreds of workshop maps to play.And if you find yourself headbanging to the games soundtrack... you are not the only one. It's sweet.I recommend this game 100%. I feel the developers truly care about their product and I have never anticipated a sequel as much as I am KF2.UPDATE: KF2 is garbage.			"

												After reviewing the (crap) sequel I feel oblidged to review this masterpiece.This game came out at the time when the devs still boasted about being modders. Great. This game was fantastic and even though it was not Early Access, the devs kept updating it, and kept releasing amazing free content including some fantastic DLC. Steampunk Weapons Pack and Community Weapons Pack are pretty much essential and I was willing to pay that money because the devs more than deserved it. This game has easily the best firearms ever made for a video game, the sound design is stunning, the satisfaction from killing enemies by a headshot in zed-time is OVER 9000.. There is very little I can criticise this game for, because of how much fun I've had with it over the years. However it is not a a game that will be loved by everyone. It is hardcore in the best sense of the word, there is no melee attack besides the knife, there is no sprint button, the guns have massive recoil, unless you are using the appropriate perk. The levelling up can take weeks, but it is worth hitting that golden star. As a certified addict, even now, 7 years after the release I will still jump into the game every so often to snipe some heads with the Steampunk Musket <39/10*Ignore the sequel*			"

												You wouldn't expect an ex-mod to become a huge success for the shelves, but this game just managed to achieve it. For those of you who do not know.Killing Floor is a standalone mod that was originally for Unreal Tournament 2003, created by Tripwire, the creators of the highly-acclaimed Red Orchestra games and the, unfortunately, terrible Defense Alliance 2. KF has you assume the role of one of several mercenary/soldier/cop/Disc Jockey fellows who are tasked with reclaiming the United Kingdom from an outbreak of ""Zeds""--a zombie-like biological disaster-turned-weaponized mutant series of horribly deformed creatures who's only desire is to see you splattered across the walls like some sort of new-age graffiti Picasso painting from HellKilling Floor is a quality game for anyone with a mouse and keyboard and there are still loads of players who still frequent the game			"

												I wish I had more time to play this masterpiece from Tripwire Interactive. I spent roughly 25 hours with it which is nothing as you need at least 50 to 60 hours of gametime to be able to experience the true challenge this game has to offer.You play with your friends and the 4 of you keep eliminating hordes of zombies. After each wave you can spend your hard-earned cash by purchasing better equipment and, of course, ammunition to the available weapons. You can only visit these vendors for a short period of time. This is what you do and, basically, you keep repeating this process till the 11th wave which is the boss battle.Now, the game has perks (skills) which refer to each weapon category. There aren't that many levels but levelling-up takes quite the time so you should keep killing these infected. Once you have levelled up decently you and your pals can go to a higher difficulty. It is similar to Left 4 Dead in certain ways, however, Killing Floor is not as fast paced. Also, I like how the vendor is placed always somewhere else (on higher difficulties you have less time to do the shopping). In addition to this, the game encourages you to work together. The best example for that is the fact that healing others than yourself works better.Although Killing Floor is outdated in term of graphics, its gameplay can easily compensate you for that. The sequel should be on your wishlist already if you are a KF fan!			"

												A pure joy to play. Great replay value. Highly customizable for those with the skills to do so. A step above L4D in my opinion. Sure the game may not be as ""pretty"" as L4D but it's no ugly ducking either. The games graphics are quite nice but the gameplay is where it steals the show and that's far more important to someone like me. I really can't see how you can't enjoy this game for hours on end. If you are into hardcore Co-Op gaming then you have got to play Killing Floor.			"

												Overall Rating: 9.9/10Review of the main aspects of the game:Controls 10/10Graphics- 9/10 (considering this game started as a mod on a game ~10 years ago)Teamplay- 10/10The weapons 9/10 (could have more variety, but well balanced)Level system 10/10Balance of the Zeds (enemies)- 9.5/10 (still die inside when 5 sirens spawn behind 2 fleshpounds, and 3 scrakes)Mods- 10/10 (Plenty of mods for reskins, more guns, more maps, even making money a weapon.)Background information about the game for those who want to buy it:You, and up to 5 others if you want, are sent into a living hell fighting off zeds, human experiments that have been cloned by the thousands by Horzine as 'soldiers', in the good ol' queen's country of England.  The zeds include clots, bloats, gorefasts, stalkers, sirens, crawlers, husks, Scrakes (SC), and Fleshpounds (FP). You have to stay alive for 10 waves of these horrible creatures that slowly gets progressively worse with/ as a bunch of psychopaths. Until the end of each round where you trade with a... horny? perverted? trader who will take dosh you earn from killing zeds (bounty) to give you more guns. HOWEVER! You can only carry 15kg of equipment (it increases if you're a support). There are 7 balanced classes in the game as follows: Field Medic, Support Specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug, and Demolitions. Finally, surviving all 10 waves you then have to fight the patriarch an evil clone of Horzine's CEO along with some lower class zeds. Killing Floor features 5 difficulties (Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, [HoE] Hell on Earth). These difficulties are built for higher leveled perks in correlation.My personal thoughts about KF:So I've just clocked in over 300 hours and have started to get comfortable on suicidal difficulty. So i figured it was time to rewrite my cheesy review and do a serious review for, what is now one of my favorite PC titles, Killing Floor. I got this game around a year ago after i got a steam account for ~$5 and immediately fell in love with the charm this game has.  Between the cheap one liners, slow motion decapitation, and heavy metal rifts.  Also the leveling is very addicting at first, even when you're grinding for stalkers as a commando.  However, i was just scratching the surface of this game.  Although it has a great controls for a zombie co-op game, addicting leveling, and loads of teamwork on harder difficulties. The one thing not a lot of reviews talk about is the learning curve to this game, and how well situated it feels as you level up your perks you slowly learn more and more tricks and tactics in the game that help you survive until you finally get up to Suicidal/ HoE servers with 6 man teams.  Killing Floor is so well-built compared to most games that start out as mods and has such depth to it that allows you to have fun even after you've played West London 100+ times and you're still not done with it. Not to mention how no matter how many times you successfully 1v1 a fleshpound as a bezerker, uppercut a scrake as a support, etc. you still feel like a bonafide badass.  All in all, this game is worth every penny even if it isn't on sale, or was $60 dollars currently. Why? Because this game grows on you and will give you hours and hours of entertainment as you go from dying on normal due to 1 or 2 sirens to taking down the patriarch on HoE.Summary?: This game is great, no matter if you only want to put 10 hours into it, or hundreds upon thousands of hours into it.

												Killing Floor is in my honest opinion, one of the best survival-horror co-op games.As a child I spent hours playing on Unreal Tournament 2004 servers which had a modified invasion mode, allowing you to buy different weapons and skills while spawing (somewhat ridiculous) aliens, monsters and robots.It's almost as if Killing Floor reached into my fond memories, took the concept which got me playing for hours and hours, and refined it with a slightly more dark and horrific style.The basic concept is very simple; you shoot mutants, you get dosh, you buy bigger guns and shoot more and bigger mutants, then the biggest mutant comes for you and if you kill him you win.What makes this game so great is that this concept is executed very well, the mutants (Called Zeds in the game) actually look as if horrible experiments were done upon them before they turned into what they are, every zed has something that makes it so much more than your standard zombie-horde (There are spider-like zeds that come out of the roof and jump at you, a zed that shoots balls of fire at you and even a zed that has projectile-destroying screams).The zeds have a lot of tricks to take you out, but luckily for you, you have 7 perks you can choose from, each perk grants you certain abilities and a discount on weapons for that perk, as a firebug for example, you get a discount on flamethrowers and other fire-based weapons, and you get a resistance against fire-damage.Doing certain things related to that perk will cause you to level it up, increasing the effectiveness of it, while this is very rewarding, it does take a VERY long time to level a perk up all the way to the maximum of level 6 legitimately. (I'll leave it to you to decide if that's a bad thing or not)So, the zeds are scary and strong, perks are useful, but what about the guns?Tripwire is known for realistic and great sounding and animated guns, so each shotgun feels powerful as you blast something to bits, each rifle has a high-recoil but also a high potentional damage output, but since this is a game with zombies, we have some some fictional guns as well, such as a fireball-cannon, a laser which can also slow down zeds, SMGs that can also shoot medic-darts at allies and much more. (There are 3 dlc weapon packs which unlock 4 weapons each, it's not pay-to-win DLC as the weapons are side-grades, not upgrades.)Oh! almost forgot to mention that there are a lot of melee-weapons too!The game was released in 2009, but Tripwire is still supporting it with seasonal events (Summer, Halloween and Xmas) which give the zeds themed-reskins, new maps (or Objective mode missions), new achievements and sometimes new weapons, most of it for free, but with Killing Floor 2 on it's way, I cannot guarantee that this will happen again in the coming years.So, if you're looking for a fun and challenging survival-horror co-op game that offers you plenty of content and hours of fun, look no further, there is a wave of mutants waiting to be eradicted.. or eradicate you.

All the perks are well made to use them and to level up for a better experience. You're free to try out on solo mode too, will be hard on the first attempts, but you'll get used.You're no need to buy all the DLCs, some of them are just 're-skin' for some weapons, others are new characters to play with and etc.Recommend to buy on sale and try out with friends.

Choose one of seven classes (each comes with it's special perk bonus) and try to survive the waves of mutants. With the Steam Workshop support, Community maps will always give you something new to die on. It's high action, loud metal, blood and gore will make you wanting more.Now stop reading reviews and buy the game. Now.			"

												Кровавый (нестоль кровавый как я ожидал) co-op шутер от первого лица в жанре survival horror. Данную игру воплотили на свет чудотворцы из компании Tripwire Interactive и выпустили 14 мая 2009 года. Адриналиновый экшен, в котором шестёрке выживших предстоит отбиваться от кровожадных и голодных мутантов. Более 16 видов оружия, расчлененка и ураганный игровой процесс прилагаются. Причиной тотального апокалипсиса стала корпорация Horzine Biotech, которая получила от государства заказ на создание идеальных солдат, и профессор  Кевин Кламели, сделавший прорыв в области регенерации (востоновлени), научился клонировать людей и управлять их разумом. Вскоре учёный создаёт огромную и безграничную армию зомби и с ней решает завоевать Великобританию.В игре есте два режима гемплея:1. Выживание: массовое уничтожение мутантов-зомби, несколько волн с сотней монстров, которые нужно пережить вам и вашим напарникам, а также мощнейший финальный босс Патриарх (это и есть учёный Кевин Кламели) для каждой карты. Впаги лезут изовсех щелей и нужно быть внимательным, держаться вместе и по ходу игры выробатывать тактику боя против монстров.2. Прохождение: в игре к сожалению выбор карт данного режима пока что не велик - всего 3. Суть будет в том что вам с вашими пропагандистами нужно пройти карту, выполняя ряд заданий для дальнейшего продвижения группы вперёд и в итоге одалеть Патриарха.В игре есть ещё 9 противников: Зомби — самый часто встречаемый враг, может «хватать» игрока, не давая возможности ходить.Толстяк — толстый мутант. Может как изрыгать желчь на игроков с небольшого расстояния, так и бить ножом мясника, подойдя в упор. (другие твари получают тоже урон от её желочи, наступая на неё).Ползун — интересный эксперемент со скрещиванием гибридов человека и паука. Быстрый, малозаметный, и довольно опасный в больших количествах. (меня всегда бесят).Берсеркер — обладает вживлённым мечом вместо правой руки, передвигается с большой скоростью, но большую часть времени существования он безопасен на расстоянии.Сталкер —  невидимый мутант, но во время атаки становится видимой. (и в принципе её увидеть, когда она невидимая, не составляет друда).Ободранный — противник со встроенной в руку ракетницой, довольно опасен в группах. Атакует огненной смесью на дальнее расстояние, и, подойдя вплотную, атакует врукопашную.Сирена — медленная женщина-мутант, клонированная жена Патриарха, криком снижает здоровье и уничтожает гранаты/взрывчатку/ракеты. (броник не ломает)Мясник — сильный мутант, чрезвычайно опасный в ярости, атакует вживлённой в руку бензопилой. (совет: в ближнем бою (тока не ножём) бейте его на небольшём растоянии и не бойтесь его бить; ваши удары немного его ""контузят"" и в скоре вы его даже одни вальнёте).Отбивальщик — очень сильный мутант, чрезвычайно опасный в ярости в которую он приходит от атак игроков, набрасываясь на них и перемалывая своими похожими на камнедробилки руками (убивайте его сразу же всей группой, иначе потерь не миновать).У вас есть возможность выбрать вам подходящий перк из 7 возможных:Медик — получает бонусы в обращении с MP7M и МР5M. Имеет бонусы к скорости перемещения, эффективности лечения, устойчивости к желчи Толстяка и к получаемому урону в целом. Броня данного перка защищает лучше и стоит меньше.Техник — получает бонусы в обращении с дробовиками, быстрее заваривает двери, не позволяя противникам пройти, может нести больше единиц оружия, большее количество гранат, урон которых также увеличен.Снайпер — получает бонусы в обращении со снайперским оружием, неавтоматическим оружием и пистолетами, урон в голову от его оружия больше.Коммандос — видит невидимых Сталкеров и Патриарха с более дальнего расстояния, нежели другие классы, также видит здоровье противников, получает бонусы в обращении с автоматами.Берсеркер — получает бонусы в обращении с оружием ближнего боя, бонусы к скорости ударов и перемещения, устойчив к желчи Толстяка и к получаемому урону в целом. Не может быть схвачен Зомбами.Поджигатель — получает бонусы в обращении с зажигательным оружием, иммунен к огню. Начиная с третьего уровня его гранаты заменяются на поджигающие.Подрывник — получает бонусы в обращении со взрывчаткой и гранатомётами, устойчив к взрывам.На этом у меня всё. Надеюсь данный обзор окажеться весьма и весьма полезным. Играете тока в ХОРОШИЕ игры.			"

												This used to be a great game until TWI ""updated"" and""DLCd"" it to death.A year ago or so I would have, and did recommend this game, but now it has become something less than it used to be.During the first 2 years or so of having this game I put in 2000 hours, but since all the additions and updates I have quit all together, and have not touched it in at least a year.Very bad community as of late, lots of trolls in game, more the CoD type players that do not care about teamwork, and your standard type griefers that get a kick out of ruining everyones game.DLC is very over priced for what you get. A 4 pack of reskins that for years sold for €1,99 now costs €7. The weapons DLC ranges from useless to under powered and OP, and in most cases players use the OP weopons only.Game no longer has any balance or any real challenge whatsoever as most every class other than the Commando and Demo are OP.Some of it is due to changes TWI made to the core game mechanics, others are due to OP DLC weapons.The higher difficulty servers are all but empty. On a good night I can find maybe 5 populated Hell on Earth servers.Seems most players these days use power leveling maps to get to level 6, and then play on ""hard"", which as a level 6 is so easy it is almost like playing with cheats, that and some of them join Hell on Earth games late on, wave 7 and up, and then proceed to get everyone killed due to not having the slightest clue of how to play the game.Pricing increases are now the standard way of balancing weapons.The M99 was very OP when it was added, so TWI changed the price of the ammo to £250 per single round, and this is now the current system for dealing with OP weapons, at least some of them, other OP wepons are just left as is.Several age old bugs and glitches such as hit box bugs are still not, and will probably never be fixed. Can still be fun if you can find a good team, (which btw, has become more and more difficult), but wait for a sale as the game is no longer worth €17,99			"

												Here is a shooter thats rewarding for the short and long term. You get to level up your perks which can become very effective once you get to high levels, while they take long to achieve, its worth it. For the short term, every game rewards skill play, headshots are very satisfying and effective; hitboxes are a good size so its not too difficult to nail but small enough to require focus and attention. You also have to mind your back at all times as enemies can creep up on you quickly. With different perks there are different tactics to employ and you learn the weapons for each perk and how to deal with all classes of enemies. It makes a game where you never feel cheated, deaths are always clear and you know you could  avoid it next time with a new position or tactic. It can be a good challenge at times but even if you die, its the kind that makes you try again for good, instead of rage quitting.  The coop element of the game adds to the experience a lot as well. The fact that you can share money and weapons, heal each other (with incentive to level up the medic perk), make it so people who are friendly and cooperative can enjoy this game even more. You really feel the difference when the players are working as a group helping each other versus everyone going off for themselves. Most shooters lack this coop spirit and I think its a big reason why I keep playing this game. Another is the great shooting experience. TLDR: very satisfying shooting mechanics, hitboxes are on point, perks(classes) are fun and varied, lots of weapons, leveling takes long but rewarding, social element of game encourages teamwork and is often experienced in game where players share resources and heal each other. 90% of players are nice in my experience, which is phenomenal compared to other big name fps'. Overall I'd get it if you are a somewhat serious gamer who cares to go for headshots, because things like that matter in this game; there is a moderate depth to this game where casual gamers might find it too complicated. extra: runs well on a macbook pro, graphics are not the best but good gameplay certainly overshadows that aspect.  Get it and tag a friend if you like what you see, its much better than the screenshots			"

Genre: Co-op Horde-based FPSReccommendation: Not for everyone, but a must play for zombie FPS fansPlaytime: More than 20 hours if you like the genre, further if you've got friends to play with. Rating: 8/10Review:This game involves being put with a team of up to 6 players (you can play solo) against waves of mutant expirements, until you reach the final wave to fight a boss. You can pick between 6(?) specializations (or classes) that improve your efficiency with specific weapons and skills.There is no crosshair in this game, meaning you will have to center your aim by yourself or use the iron sights properly. Weapons are quite cool and feel nice, everything around shooting feels nice in this game.The DLC this game has is a little *too* much, and mostly it's just skins that don't affect gameplay, except for the Community Weapon Packs which include new, different and mostly fun weapons (that probably could be a bit overpowered sometimes, depending on the user).There is one downside about this game though, and that is the community. Teamwork is rare for this game, and most of the time people decide to be a Berserker (melee specialized class) carelessly or be a Medic and not make use of their healing kit. If you do manage to find friends to play this with, it all might be better then.Overral, as much as the community can be bad, it's a great game by itself. Very interesting and fun, and more with friends.			"

												This game is so much fun. Even though the objective is always the same (survival). The addition of the killing floor Objective Mode just added to the charm of the game, giving us tasks and objectives to complete as per the modes description. What i like about the game is it never gets boring, the DLC is great, and the demands on the PC are low which is useful to those with lower end PC's who struggle to keep up with modern games, i honestly think this is one of the best FPS games to date, and for those of you don't like peer to peer competitive, then this is the game for you! All the fun of FPS, without the competitive nature of the game, just pure Co-Op, team orientated survival. So many achievements to get, lots of levels to be played, and so much fun to be had! - And you can play solo too.I would recommend this game to all players whether you are competitive or not!			"

												Intense non-stop first person shooter based zombie action with you at the heart of it in an often dark, gritty yet sometimes humourous game world atmosphere. Hilarious voice acted command system, impressive weapon and player class trader system to satisfy all, intelligent varied AI that will have you chilled and laughing one moment and serious and terrified the next while pushing your awarenss ability to its limits and beyond - all combining for a most amazing unique online co-op experience where team performance and being the hero both have a part to play when it comes to surviving the onslaught of zombie waves, or falling victim as their next meal. Work hard, and you will be rewarded, survive successfully - and you will have a chance for an epic showdown with the Patriarch.			"

												It is a greatest game machine what I have ever seen!Before when I bought, I have seen many of YouTube videos of this game for I can decide to I need it or not. I couldn't decide, but it was 75% discounted and I thought it is enough cheap for I can't act badly.I told you that little story because I want to know you how I felt before I have bought that game. If you feel so what I have felt, I suggest go and buy the 'Killing Floor'. Give it a chance.About the game.The 'Killing Floor' is almost perfect game it own category.Good things:    -Very optimized. It is good running on low computers.    -Generate random waves (in specified limits), so all plays isn't same.    -In higher difficult levels (if you can bear) most of players are a great team member.Bad things:    -Rarely when I have joined a server, I am moving strangely slow. Only need to do reconnect.    -Some perks experience progress is very slow. Almost annoying. But, if you have a good friend, their can help to you make it easier get next perk level with 'Poundamonium' mutator. That is legal.    -In weaker difficult levels have a few not good or bad players. They close the doors before you in, and they go so-called 'lonewolf'.Overall I recommend buy 'Killing Floor'.			"

												Now that the sequel has been announced I figured I'd write a review for what is perhaps my most favorite game of the past few years.Killing Floor is a brilliant FPS survival horror, and perhaps the best (At least in my opinion) wave-based game out there. The game has a balance of gritty and serious environments and witty and morbid humor. The idea that you are working your way through a horde of genetically engineered monsters to finally go toe-to-toe with the final boss gives you that sense of achievement. And going toe-to-toe with the final boss is an achievement in itself; with traits from all other specimen combined and then some, you'll need a lot of bullets.A key aspect of Killing Floor is co-op. with seven different perks to play as that fill different roles in a team, you're gonna have a hard time doing it alone. Synergy with other players is key; you could just as easily doom another player as opposed to helping them. There is a lot more to the game than it seems at first glance. All of the specimen have different nuances and behavioral quirks that you will need to learn to survive. Fortunately the Beginner mode is very forgiving so you have plenty of opportunity to get some practice in. However, the difficulty curve is like a brick wall; it's not uncommon for even veteran players to fall to the horde on even the lower difficulties.The game is very community-driven. There are a lot of custom content for the game which is fully supported, and even some of the DLC and updates are filled with community-created content. You can expect new maps, weapons, enemies, characters, game modes and mutators.Despite being an old game it still looks beautiful and has an incredible soundtrack. There is plenty of content for this game and the only people I wouldn't suggest this game to are the squeamish.			"

												This game is so much fun! I got it like two weeks ago but already spent about 53 hours on it.It is a fast-paced zombie and monster shooter which can be played both in single and in multiplayer mode. It is advisable to play with others, unless you pick ""easy"". Already on the ""normal"" difficulty mode, it gets pretty tough, especially when you are on a map with lots of small paths and rooms.I like the map diversity which had been created with lots of love for details. They create just the right atmosphere, making it more realistic. The game also allows creating own maps which the modding community enjoys doing, making it even more exciting.Some of the monsters don’t really make sense but given the insanity of the Horzine boss, it isn’t that surprising. I could discuss this aspect longer but I don’t want to spoil your ideas about them.This game is exactly like I hoped the original Resident Evil Mercenary Mode to be: fast zombie hordes and lots of super monsters chasing and swarming you all over!The trader aspect is very useful, and, if we are honest, it is even realistic: people making money from those in misery. Though I wonder how the trader gets around during the zombie attacks. But, of course, you shouldn’t think about how things would work in real life. I surely wouldn’t survive such a mess, if it were real.It is very cool that you can enhance your player’s abilities over the course of time. This gives you the opportunity to try out other abilities with various advantages.The many achievements make sure you stay motivated to play it over and over – clever trick but this game definitely deserves being played often. It is very therapeutic for me, as I do something like customer support (every monster = a customer! :D)I could go on and on but I bet the other reviews already covered everything. This is supposed to present the viewpoint of a new player. :)			"

												Killing Floor is one of the most fun and addicting games I have ever played. The variety of maps, weapons, perks, enemies, and difficulties is immense and provides incredible depth. The characters and their dialogue are hilarious and memorable. I think this game is superior to its sequel in many ways. The gameplay is deeper and more skillful. Fast, accurate aiming and knowledge of combos is essential to becoming skilled at your chosen perk at the higher levels, and attaining these skills is rewarding and fun. You can really feel the improvement as you play more and more. KF2 by contrast lacks the same type of combos and fast, precise aim and replaces it with mad m1 spam at faster-moving hordes of zeds. The game does have its flaws in that its hitboxes are unintuitive and often misaligned with the zed models, but once you learn how the models and hitboxes work this becomes less of an obvious issue. The game also has gritty, outdated graphics, but it doesn't really look all that bad and adds to the charm of the game.Unfortunately there isn't much of a playerbase these days, but there's a lot of content to be enjoyed even for a solo player. Overall, this game is a masterpiece and you can easily spend thousands upon thousands of hours on it. Even though KF2 exists, buy KF1 and put some time into it. You won't regret it. "

												What is Killing Floor, you ask? British People vs Zombies: The game. Complete with Dosh, Heavy Metal, more stereotypical Brits than a Monty Python sketch, and over 32 of some of the beefiest, most satisfying Zed-killing weapons you'll encounter in a video game. There's even 'Loadsamoney' himself, Mr Harry Einfeld, present and accounted for to wreck the Zed menace. This is a game where you need to play on a difficulty higher than 'beginner' to experience. The fun of this game comes from it's challenge, and while I can understand people liking their games as easy, simple fun, the real 'survival horror' elements of this game come out when you're up against tougher enemies. I personally don't find this game scary due to the undertone silliness from all the characters models and event Zeds, but I still have a lot of fun with this game.Despite coming out back in 2009, Tripwire Interactive have been supporting this game for the last 4 years, and with each update, event and DLC pack they've added, the game's got better and better! So go ahead and pick up a copy of this now! Hell, get the 'bundle' copy which contains 90% of the game's DLC for only slightly more (trust me, most of it may be character models, but by god are they worth it).If you ever wanted a video game equivalent of Shaun of the Dead, you need to play this.

												In killing floor you fight limited waves of zombies to earn money and experience, and after each wave must visit the trader to refuel for the next wave.This game is a little difficult to start with (coming from a L4D's background), but as you and your character gain experience at it, it will become easier. there's lots of weapons to choose from and categories of proficiencies to level up in different ways.the default maps are very well done and most of them very big and detailed (but you dont have to use the whole map, you can stay in one place if that works for you).LOTS of fun in co-op, and glad it supports six players in co-op instead of just 4 (yey!) !!SO GLAD it supports local LAN play!!!!!!!!!! and you can configure map order, game style, etc easily.i dont like the in-game bullet time much and wish you could turn it off (although, it is a tiny bit helpful when you are impossibly surrounded, but that is not often enough to like it). it dirupts the flow of the game for all players.there are a few small bugs in the game that are minorly annoying and end up being the death of me sometimes, but I wont go into those.For the most part this game grew on me and I like it a LOT for now. As I level up, I increase the game difficulty to keep it challenging.			"

												This game... I've put almost 2000 hours into playing this game so you'd imagine that I would love this game. To be honest, I don't. I appreciate this game for what it is but it's boring and repetitive. There are maps where you can have fun camping and there are maps where you can have fun kiting but all in all, it's boring and repetitive (as with a lot of other games too).I used the word ""fun"" there... I use that word not to describe the game itself but the describe the experience you have with other players. It's the community that makes this game fun. The majority of the people on my friends list are people I have met through Killing Floor. There are a few who I have never spoken to outside of the game, there are a few that I speak to on a daily basis and there are a few who I have actually met in person.Would I recommend this game? Probably not. I would recommend the community. It's the people you meet, even if it's just for one game, that make this game an awesome experience!			"

												Killing floor is amazing. You get sets of perks (Sort of like classes) That you get to build up on, For example, Feild medic, And sharp shooter. Although most servers are on either Normal or Hard and above. You get used to how the game plays really quickly. It uses source engine. if your computer can handle any other source game such as hl2, dod, css, csgo, tf2, this game will run really easy for you. The team play is great, i've never encountered♥♥♥♥♥hole players who just leave you behind, there are always players to heal you, give you money when you need it, etc. Not many players use their mic, but the voice commands are very, very, very helpfull. I rate this game 10/10. It's really fun to have and play with friends (Or without) I've made some new friends playing this game aswell.			"

												Probably the funnest game that involves killing hordes of undead~The game has a neat perk system so you can choose a particular class and work your levels up, this makes allies being much more important with each individual role. The game has a wide variety of guns to choose from as well, and each map is highly detailed and can contain secrets/mini easter eggs for you to find.Also with the end of each wave you have to venture out to wherever the trader will be this time around, thats right, no camping until the final wave comes.. My only complaint however is how DLC is advertised and there is so much bloody DLC. DLC for gun variations? No thanks..(You can actually replace the DLC advertisement video with mods.)Overall though, a fun co-op game with a decent soundtrack to fight the hordes alongside. Map design is amazing too.8/10 for it's purpose.			"

												Killing Floor is an online horde-style cooperative first person shooter that places you and other players in a map and forces you to fight waves of enemies. Your objective is simple; survive. Between each wave, a shop will open up somewhere on the map and an arrow will guide your path to find it. The trader has several weapons you can purchase and you can restore your armor and ammunition for a price.The game calls itself cooperative survival horror and while the objective in every game is survival, this is straight up in your face action horror. The monsters just come at you. There are still times where you can turn around to find half a dozen monsters trailing you. It keeps piling on the mutants and raises the intensity wave after wave.The game plays smooth, the controls are what you’d expect from a first person shooter using a mouse and keyboard. There are buttons for firing, iron sights, alternate firing, jumping, crouching, throwing grenades, reloading, running and changing your weapon. While the game lets you chose controller input, there are no native controls for it. You need to set everything yourself.While the game excels in being just a horde-style game with waves of enemies, it is just that. The maps might be different, but you will run through the same enemies depending what wave you get to. The game is devoid of objectives outside of your own survival. The maps are large, so they do offer a variety of spaces, but you can fight in the same area of a map over and over again, even if the shops opening across the map encourage you to find a different place to do battle.For anyone that chose to play offline, Killing Floor does offer a single player experience where you select a difficulty and face your foes alone. Your inventory consists of primary weapons, secondary pistols, melee weapons, a med kit and a welding torch. The torch is to seal doors shut to make it tough for enemies to get in. It also might keep you from getting out if a room fills with enemies, but leaving one door open and guarding it is a good enough tactic. Enemies will still drop in from the ceiling or jump off rooftops. You have health and body armor, both deplete when taking damage, but your health can be restored with some self stimulus while the armor needs to be purchased in from the trader.To reward you your play style there are perks that you can select between waves or games. These seven perks work like classes to benefit certain styles. Each perk starts you off with a different set of weapons. These benefits are things like faster welding speed, more damage, more health, discounts on combat armor and so on.The support specialist is good with shotguns. The sharpshooter is geared for crossbows and sniper rifles.The commando uses assault rifles and grenades. The field medic will heal others. Berserkers prefer melee weapons. Demolitions make things go boom with big weapons and firebugs make fires. The game still allows you to purchase any weapon from the store and you can get experience for any perk just by killing enemies with weapons from that class.The graphics are great and they really add a beauty to the macabre ugliness of the gore and gruesome monsters. You’ll be exploding heads with every head shot and throwing the game into slow motion for improved accuracy. The maps have a lot of lighting effects, dreary lights, blue hues in rainstorms and a whole series of cheerful lights turned haunting by a creepy atmosphere.The maps offer a vast variety of horrific playgrounds. Dark, sleek nightmarish landscapes. The game started with five maps, but it continues to grow. Abandon shools, hell, a creepy amusement park, ice caves, moon bases, even santa’s workshop was brought out for Christmas. New enemy skins have been produced in the game’s long existence. Its a real testament to how the developer has supported Killing Floor for this long.The maps are free, because they need you to come back in order to purchase optional downloadable content. Everything from weapon packs and character skins. While it is a way to keep the game going to produce new content and keep you engaged, a lot of people might see it as a cash grab. Since you’re all fighting cooperatively against monsters, no one will ever be better than you, but they will just look different than you.With that being said, there are a lot of free mods that you can download from the Steam Workshop to make your game look different and offer interesting ways to change the game. So for everything that you can purchase, there are still free things made by fans. Usually content taken from other games and franchises such as Doom 3’s monsters and Xenomorphs from the Aliens cinemas.In terms of character customization, there are several character skins to chose from. They do nothing other than change the look of your character to other players. There are no mirrors to admire yourself in game when you’re grenading monsters to death.Killing Floor is still a fun game and its been dirt cheap in the past. It still has a booming community, but there are other games that offer horde mode and so much more.			"

												Pure carnage happens on this game. Teamwork and skill is a must to survive, as the enemies in this are no joke. A lot of weapons are available for you to engage in the massacre, in conjunction with a very well done perk system. The amount of awesome maps to play increase the game's replayability. Slow-motion specimen kills are cool to watch too. It's very exciting to be at the last wave with friends and feel hopeless as your teamates start to die and your ammo to run out, then beating the Patriarch by a close shave, feels beyond rewarding and satisfying. The graphics, while dated, are appealing. The downside is that new players might be pushed away because of the game's difficulty, since it takes a little of time to level up and get used to, even on the normal difficulty. The PVP servers are also very engaging and enjoyable to play with friends with/against each other, not to mention that it's a refreshing departure from the original survival mode. It's a blast to play, get it and enjoy it with your buddies. 8.4/10.0 "

												This game is no longer worth the money. I would've recommended it quite some time ago, but TWI has been bogging the down with DLC for for too long.When it was kept to cosmetic-only DLCs, I didn't mind. It's just characters, so who cares? Then there was the IJC DLC weapons. Pay money to get overpowered weapons. It became a pay-to-win game. People WILL try to dismiss this with something like ""Oh, it's co-op, who cares? It's helping you!""Yeah, that doesn't change that I paid to play the game, not to watch someone else play it. Why pay $20 so you can watch the melee class with one of the most powerful ranged weapons clear out entire enemy waves in seconds?Ever since, they've just been pumping out more of this as to try to pull as much money as they can from the game. From what I hear, they've done this with previous games as well.Truly unfortunate that such a good game was ruined like this. All I can do is not buy anything else from them and hope that others will do the same.			"

												Really awesome, I'd say better than CoD Zombies.Alrighty, time to update this review:I've been playing this game for the majority of almost 3 years now, and I still enjoy playing it. For beginners, it has a lot of replayability value (since obtaining level six perks takes quite a while) which can take from 100-200 hours. After that, due to the Steam Workshop, there are a lot of options of playing with modded content. There are also dedicated custom servers with custom skins, perks, levels, weapons and more! (I recommend International Gaming Community btw ;) ) The gameplay isn't something to write home about, but there is something about that hooks you on. It's not as team intensive as L4D2, (as in, when there's only one person left, they're basically dead) but it does get close to that point. It's harder to understand the mechanics than L4D2 (since different weapons at different levels for different perks do different thigs to different enemies on different difficulties at different.. see what I'm getting at here?) BUT, once you get the hang of it, the game is tons of fun to play! Get a friend or two, (or three, or four, or five!) and get into a server and go spend hours and hours leveling up! :DIn conclusion, want to shoot zombies with your friends while having a level up game mechanic with different kinds of enemies and perks? Go buy this game! You won't regret it ESPECIALLY since it goes on sale all the time for as low as 5 dollars!			"

												I had done a short/quick review on this a while back, but now with the introduction of the steam reviews system, I figured I might as well take the time and do a proper review for this game.  Killing Floor is by far my most played steam game, and was the entire reasoning for me getting a steam account in the first place.  A friend sent me the ""guest pass"" for Killing Floor and had me try it out, and then ended up gifting me it for $5 when I enjoyed it.  I first got Killing Floor in August of 2009, so 4 years later and I still play this game daily pretty much.  The replay value is through the roof, not to mention if you buy it on one of the frequent sales (I've seen Killing Floor more than 50% off at least TEN times in the year 2013 so far) will put it under $10 USD.  DLCs might have become a little pricey over the past few years, but the fact that Tripwire Interactive still does free content updates for this game nearly FIVE YEARS post release is simple mind blowing.  I don't know of any other company that continues support for it's product that long into the future.  The few companies that continually support releases that I can think of have all produced sequels to those games.Now to get down to gameplay.  Killing Floor first and foremost is a FPS game.  There are a variety of different types of guns, spread around in 7 different perks or classes.  These perks have a ""progression system"" that allows a player to get more ""profficient"" with the weapons of their classes and earn more ""bonuses"" such as being able to carry more ammo, do more damage, and other things of that nature.  Each perk has a different role which helps a team in it's own unique way.  Like making things blow up, then Demolitions is the perk for you with it's LAW, M32 multiple grenade launcher, m79, and others..  Like setting things on fire and feeding the inner pyromaniac in yourself?  Then firebug is the perk for you with it's flamethrower, flare revolvers, Husk fireball launcher, and other guns with incendiary ammo.  Enjoy the satisfying feeling of blowing an enemies head off?  Then pick the sharpshooter perk, with it's assortment of pistols, sniper rifle, compound crossbow, or various rifles.  Killing Floor has the most satisfying gun play of any game I've ever played.  Excellent feel to the weapons, and they look and sound great.  When it comes to enemies, there are 10 different types of enemies to deal with.  Each one of the ""zeds"" are similar in some ways, but different in most.  There are the basic enemies, such as the clot, which can grab any perk aside from the beserkser.  Clots don't do all that much damage, but they can make you not able to move and allow the other, more dangerous enemies to get to you and do more damage.  Then you get to the more specialised enemies such as stalkers, which can go invisible, bloats, which puke ""bile"" on you which can hurt you and ruin your body armor, to sirens, whose screams can shatter glass, destroy rockets, grenades and explosives, break down the welds of doors, and eventually make your head explode, to the husk, resistant to fire attacks (for the most part) who can melee you when up close but is much more dangerous at distance where they can shoot fireballs at you. The more advanced of the enemies are the Scrake, which is a high health enemy with a chainsaw that if it gets close to you, it will start to saw away at your health.  If you are getting attacked by a scrake, don't run, because their full swings and charging attacks do exponentially more damage to you.  Scrakes are best left to sharpshooters which can stun it, berserkers which can do the same thing, or support specialists that know advanced ""Techniques"" to deal iwth them,Next you have the Fleshpound, which is a big, hulking enemy with high health and hard to kill.  High head damage resistance make it so it shrugs off weaker weapons.  Sharpshooters with good aim and fast reflexes can take them out in a number of ways, but can really only do so one at a time.  Support specialists get explosives bonuses, which make it a good choice to take out fleshpounds (unless there is a siren nearby).  Demolotions is the most polished perk to take down Fleshpounds, as they have a weakness to explosives.  After you finish the ""waves"" of enemies, you then have to prepare to fight the boss of Killing Floor, the Patriarch.  The patriarch has some vicious melee attacks, and also has an arm with a rocketlauncher/chain gun combination that can and will kill you quick. Defeating the patrairch requires good teamwork and communication generally.Lastly, but not least, is the fact that Killing Floor comes with a free to download SDK system that allows for modding of the game and creation of custom content.  This also comes with a community workshop area dedicated solely to Killing Floor.  So check out the steam workshop and try out some of the amazing modded content there is to offer.			"

												Incredible zombie Coop-Survival. Offering a great variety of maps, weapons and (gruesome) enemies, Killing Floor truthfully enriches the genre. The best and most funny way to play this game is with 5 friends - teamplay is a MUST. Otherwise you won't survive, especially not on the higher difficulty levels.There are 7 different classes in Killing Floor:- Field medic (explains itself)- Support specialist (can wield doors, is best with shotguns)- Sharpshooter (deals extra headshot damage with pistols/rifles)- Commando (is best with assault rifles, can see enemies' health)- Berserker (slashes specimen with melee weapons)- Firebug (excellent BBQ-skills)- Demolition (is best with all kind of explosives)With each class you can get up to level 6. Each level grants more bonuses like discount on weapons for every round, higher precision, and more.The enemies are really strange (in a good way!), and there are a lot of different ones.There is a lot of DLC for this game, luckily you do not need it - the DLC is only for cosmetical reasons.WARNING to players from Germany: The game is censored here (of course). I only recommend this game uncut; Playing a zombie shooter without gore totally destroyes the atmosphere.			"

												Don't know how populated it is currently, but when i played it it was great. The level design is honestly the best I've seen in a multiplayer game.Downside is being matched with people who are maxed out and are able to survive on their own much easier. They end up taking all the kills and money you could've earned, and you are left with a feeling of being a non-factor in the game.			"

UPDATE: I nominated this game for the write-in Steam Award as ""The Most Overtly British.""Dosh! Grab it while you can, lads.Killing Floor is a wave-based co-op survival shooter. You n' yer mates choose from several different classes (called perks) that focus on different weapon types and playstyles. At the beginning of each game, you start out with nothing but a combat knife, a basic pistol, the welder, and the health injector (unless one of your perks is a high enough level and gives you a bonus weapon at the start). You gain dosh (money) by killing the Zeds (zombies, except they're actually just skinless mutant clones). After each round, the trader opens the doors to her store, and the team is able to use their dosh to buy new weapons, stock up on ammo, grenades, ammo, etcetera. I will be honest. Killing Floor is absolutely my favorite co-op game. The gunplay is fantastic, the multiple different perks allow for great teamplay, and the game has a great sense of humor.Strategy is key on the higher difficulties. If you're not careful, squadmates can easily die within seconds, and the whole team can end up getting swarmed. Team composition is absolutely important. If you don't have a demo laying pipe bombs, a commando/sharpshooter running interference with the regular zeds, a medic (or two) for healing, and a support for straight-up DPS, you're not going to be able to beat the boss on hard or higher.Get this game when it and it's DLC is on sale. The DLC isn't necessary (it's pretty much all cosmetics, and while some of the DLC weapons are completely unique, the achievements that require the unique weapons can be accomplished with base weapons as alternatives), but it's all really great.Wayne Rooney's smarter than you!

												It's an okay game, but Tripwire did a few things I don't like.First of all, when I bought the complete edition a while back, it said I'd get anything added in the future. I did not.Also, they said they'd never make items which change gameplay cost real-world money, which they did do in almost every major update since the game launched (varying skins, harpoon launcher, Tommy Gun, Buzzsaw Crossbow, and many, many, MANY other examples).It's not so much that the weapons cost money, it's that they said the weapons wouldn't and then fell back on that almost immediately.

												I can say Killing Floor is better than Left 4 Dead 2, all kinds of weapons available in the game, from Desert Eagle to M4 to AK-47, to the bigger weapons like RPG and the Grenade Launcher!!! This game is able to play Co-Op with more than 4 people, and epic badass heavy metal soundtrack starts to roll when a new round starts!! You can play this game for several hours and not getting bored with it, I'm just getting started of killing those infected creatures!! Anyone who doesn't have Killing Floor yet...they definitely need to get this game when the game goes on sale!!			"

												Killing Floor is a co-op survival game wherein you are dropped off in an area full of zeds. A complete round is played on a single map divided with multiple waves with the number of zeds growing as you successfully complete one. After each round you are given a chance to go to the trade and stock up your ammo or buy new guns.Controls[+] What's more to say? WASD and mouse is the best controls for any first person shooter game.[+] Hotkeys for additional actions such as dropping money or a gun for the purposes of giving them to your allies.[+] You can set your own set of hotkeys if you're more used to unorthodox controls.Atmosphere[+] The game is dark. You'd see people hanged themselves and some stabbed on various maps.[+] 'End of the world' feel on the environment.[+] There will always be a time in a round wherein you'll panic because of the zeds coming out of nowhere and suddenly near you.[+] What else could make you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants than a zombie holding a ♥♥♥♥ing chainsaw, zombie that can turn invisible and heal himself for injuries, a small crawler that's so hard to see in dark areas and would suddenly jump to you? This game have it all.Sounds[+] Soundtrack that will give you chills.[+] Characters actually talks. Most people would get bored from hearing just random noises and background music.Graphics[+] Despite the requirement being so low-end that it could run almost on any kind of laptop/desktop and being so old. The game still has a very good graphics and even on lowest video settings at that.[+] The zeds are well-made. They give an eerie feeling than most creatures from other games that's supposed to be a horror.Gameplay & Balance[+] The game is challenging and not something you could just play-through casually. The game has different set of difficulties from 'Beginner' to 'Hell on Earth' and the length can be set from 'Short' to 'Long'.[+] The number of zeds scales with how many players are playing on that wave.[+] The maps are designed so that there wont be many safe spots and zombies could literally appear in front of you, to your left/right, and even behind you.[+] The Patriarch, the boss that appears after you successfully finish the last wave. It is really challenging and requires more than just rapid tapping your mouse. He could turn invisible to heal himself and hes hard to beat regardless of the distance since he could attack with both melee and range.[-] It becomes repetitive afterwhile. You just kill, kill, and kill. There's a mission mode wherein you are to complete a set of given objectives but even that won't make up for the repetitiveness of the game. However, don't mistake this statement as to the game not having any replay value. The game has HUGE replay value it's just that it gets repetitive to some after awhile. [-] The game's mapping is too simple. Some small structures like the barrels cant be jumped on.Contents[+] Perks! there are six perks to choose from and each have their own level which you need to work on separately. Different perks provides different bonuses and a different role to take on the party.[+] Different kinds of zombies. Each with different strength and weaknesses.[+] Decent amount of guns classified on their corresponding perk. (More guns when you get the DLCs)[+] Huge selection of characters. There are some that would require you to complete achievements or buy a certain game in order to use them. They provide no boost in your stats just merely appearance. (More chars when you get the DLCs)[+] A lot of maps you could play from and it's wide enough to contain big amount of players and zeds. There are also some spots that were designed to give you a strategic advantage over the mindless zeds.[+] You could get more content from the community members since Killing Floor has its own Steam Workshop.DLCsI want to give a thumbs up for the game developers for making a DLC that would actually increase the game content and provides more fun and eye-candy unlike the DLCs nowadays wherein the game wouldn't be fun unless you get them.

												A game that forces you to work together with your team in order to win, especially on the harder difficulties. Seven unique perks allow you to take over a special role in your team.Even after hundreds of hours the game is still interesting due to dynamic gameplay, as you will always hit at new situations.This is not a superficial game at all, you actually have to spend time (very fun time) on it to become better in the end, unlike most games nowadays.Totally worth the money if you seek for a challenge and teamplay, especially when the price is low during events.

												What can I say about this game, with many hours played I have to say this is the best coop survival shooter I ever played. There is just no other game out there with the same charm andsatisfaction as this one right here. I've met many people through this game and established great relationships with them, I got more out this game than what its worth.One downside is, this game is very old. Released in 2009. The population isn't that huge at the moment, mostly the dedicated veteran players roam and new players on the lower difficulties. Things like this cause a few problems between players who know how to play and those who are unfamiliar with the mechanics.			"

												Incredibly fun and challenging co-op game. It takes a lot of teamwork to thrive here and feels really rewarding when you survive a wave because your friends had your back. It might be showing its age, both graphically and interface-wise, but it still holds up pretty well because it's well designed and have been continually supported with new content by the devs and community. It can even be legitimately scary at times. I recommend taking your pick of DLC and mods at the workshop, there's some great stuff. I'll tell you: I'm much more excited for Killing Floor 2 and the potential Left 4 Dead 3.			"

												Actually...I have nothing else to say than: if you love Zombies you'll love this game. It's a really nice co-op survival game specially to play with friends. This game is every cent worth it including Dlc's. I personally bought 3 weapon Packs and 1 Character Pack I did not regret it.So Killing floor is wave based you can choose between the following 3 lengths: 4 (5 killing the patriach), 7 (8 killing the patriach) and 10 (11 killing the patriach)The game is mostly about teamwork to kill certain amount of zeds to get to wave you've been choosing and to kill the patriach at the end.It's not that, you wouldn't survive without your team depends on your skills and may be the difficulty but there's a high percentage you'd die without them. By every kill you get some money (by healing your mates as well) what's most important to buy better weapons. Anyway there are 7 classes to choose, you got to level up. Max level is 6 (unless you play on fun Servers)The more you level up the better you start, the less you pay for weapons, if you reach max level some classes start with Armor then, you do more damage and so on.By the way Killing Floor got lots of maps you can play on, depends on what Server you play.There are missions available (KFO) And like I already mentioned fun Servers. This game is an addiction ....			"

												Do i recommend Killing Floor? Hell yeah!Starting out in KF was daunting for me, since i rarely play FPS games and my only previous experience was in Counter strike.To top it off, i found that i didn't have on-screen crosshairs!Needless to say, the first couple hours of playing this game usually resulted in me dying rather quickly to simple enemies like clots and gorefasts. Damn those buggers are fast..As i continued playing the game, i learned about ammo conservation, and how to make shots count.On lower difficulties you don't really need to worry about ammo too much - unless you're demolitions and shoot off a grenade at anything that moves.On harder difficulties though, you really need to make your shots count, since there are more enemies, they take more shots to kill and you get less reward money for killing stuff.I have bought this game as a gift for several friends and had a absolute blast playing it.Grab it on sale or something, its really cheap and there's really no excuse why you can't afford it.One of the best purchases i made on steam.

												Just one Word: WOW!!! best game ever. This is my special Favorite game since 2010. Bought this game on january 2010 and thought that this should be a normal Zombie game like L4D. All in one i was right. BUT (and here it comes) i missed the teamplay on L4D so much that i decided to do not play this game again. So i cam to this game called Killing Floor. I was something like enchanted from the beginnign of the first few hours i played this game. So much investigated potential. This game absolutly woths its price. Definetly. I never saw a better one. Believe me! 3000 hours playing time ad more cant have a wrong view on this game.  And if you get bored, try some mutators, mods, other maps, mosnters, other modded servers. I played so much mutators and i still dont know every mutator which is playable. There´s so many workshop stuff. In short form: BUY THIS GAME! thousands of Happy gaming hours are waiting for you ;)			"

												Oh, what to say about this game. Its hard to recomend it outright, because its a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. But its one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games that keeps dragging you back into it.Do I recomend it? Yeah, I suppose so. Over 1000 hours I'd better recomend it. Is it for everyone? No, its not. Its kinda of a cult hit. Most people will get it when its on sale, play a few games of it, and then never touch it again. Others will play it for a few hours, and come back in a few months. But everyone that you see playing Killing Floor year round (not during the holiday events) is a true Killing Floor player.So, pros? Well..-Its got a great modding community; the workshop, Tripwire Interactive forums, and many other sites host great mods and maps, which add to the game.-Great players; on the whole, most players are pretty good. There are some aimbotters that get away with it, some rude people, trolls, the usual. But most people tend to be pretty good.-Modded servers; this is what really gives the game value. Modded servers are the main reason that anyone even plays this game anymore. Without them, this game would be retired.-Lots of custom weapons, skins, and specimens; keeps the game interesting.Cons? Yeah, theres a bunch..-First of all, this game is ancient. Its a mod for Unreal Tournament 2004, using the Unreal 2 engine. So there are some major engine bugs. -Crashes; since its an old game and older engine, the game has trouble handling more than 2gb of ram. On modded servers, often the clients will crash because the engine wasn't meant to handle this. Happens on regular servers too.-Server limitations; dedicated servers have some pretty bad limitations on what you can and can't do. There's a general limit to how many files the server can load at one time, if you exceed that, then the server will hang. -The server also hangs if a weapon/mutator gets added that isn't compatible with a certain map or game mode, thus rendering the server unusable until the admin fixes it.-The voice acting is bad. Like, at first, you're going to think its awful voice acting. 1000 hours later, you want to shoot the voice actors for the obnoxious game speech.-The DLC weapons are community weapons, reskinned and sold by TWI. The player skins are nothing to write home about.-Frameloss; the game engine can't adequatly handle the game itself, and even in a regular solo game, your FPS can go from 100 to 5. Online games? Ha, good luck. Try turning off ambient lighting.-Tripwire doesn't actually fix anything. They push out updates every holiday, maybe a new character skin or map, but thats it. They make intentional changes to break mods and just generally do nothing productive. No fixes to the engine, the gameplay, the menu system, nothing.What DOES tripwire do, though? Break things. Break all the things. This past winter event, they broke the workshop, so every time you launched the game, Steam would download your workshop content. Again. And again. And again. I had 75GB of temporary files that kept increasing in size. It took Tripwire a month to push out a fix for it. An ever-growing list of things they broke~The only reason this game is still alive is because of the modding community and the admins of modded servers. They are the ONLY reason this game is still alive, still being played. And even still, there is no point to this game. This is just a wave based survival game, with the same specimens coming at you, the same bad guns, and the same awful voice acting, over and over. Killing Floor is nothing without the mods. Killing Floor would be better without Tripwire Interactive. There needs to be a Killing Floor 2, or a Killing Floor HD Edition, with-AT THE VERY LEAST- a new game engine, maybe something from the same decade the game was made in.			"

												Bloody and Brilliant! After putting a 1000 Hrs Straight on it, I can safely say that this is indeed my preferred and great personal favorite on Steam. Its replay value is endless, with seven different perk classes to survive waves of monsters alongside others. Across many maps and custom content that keeps this game going. To all you haters - This game is never boring. (You just can't win is all...) Out of all the main games you can play on here, this game is worth the 20 bucks. And also has lots of cool DLC skins, weapons and maps that keeps you in check. Game can be challenging and unpredictable at times, loading and lobby searching can be tedious, and the steps to host your own lobby is not worth the effort and headaches. Other than that I cannot mislead you because many find this game Bloody and Brilliant. >:D			"

												As it is know to all ,Killing Floor is a fantastic co-op game ,however ,if you never play it or just watching video of others' playing video ,you won't under the joy of cooperation and the fighting skill which you have to use in this game .   Many remarkable reasons contribute to how hard the game is which lead to some people direct their eyes upon this wonderful game and step back ,yes it is,it very unfriendly to new players.If you play with 0-1 level ,even Easy Mode will get your goat,especially when you play with other 5 players and all of them died left you alone to fight agaist 100+ monster ,even most of them are clot while 5-6 Bloat among them,what make it worse is that the space so small that it suddenly become a very horrific experience.Due to this fact,I give a suggestion to new player:play solo at first to promote your level,because in solo Mode monsters have less health than multiplayer Mode.Beside, the best solo map ,in my opinion ,is KF-farm for the map is the most broader one, workshop has a map whose name is KF-farm-day,which change the time from night to morning and the environment become  lighter so you won't feel very horror.   Judging from the evidence offered, we might safely draw the conclusion that this is a great coop game that you shouldn't miss(patients with 3D vertigo is another matter ):  1:multiple monsters,maps and weapons.You wont get bored with such abundant elements while play with your friends time and again.Each wave you will meet different collocation of monsters,some time in 7 wave you will meet one FleshPound with  several SC,just attack the FP shoulder to shoulder for the first,later for the SCs, a sharpshooter with a crossbow is enough to deal with them,however ,once we met 5 FP,the game became harder within a while,fortunately,we succeed in wipe out all of them finally,or we would be wiped out.If you get bored with the official maps,many fantastic maps in workshop is waiting for you.So there is no wonder that many people play this for over thousand hours.   2,high requirement to cooperation.If anyone dead  after the wave come no long will be bad for the whole team.So cure your teammates timely and shoot the monsters which attack your mates from the back.whatever happen you should stick with your teammates.Guard a point which easy to attack monsters is a good idea but CANT DEFEND TO DEATH,the team should move according to the situation,or the whole team would be wiped out.Above all,as far as I'm consider,though KF2 is released,there would still have many newplayers for KF1,if he/she makes mistakes you should tolerant them for you were also a  noob like them,think about the others' tolerance let you love this game.It's a coop game not a competive game,you play it just for fun,so whatever happen not let you unhappy and others' player unhappy,Of course,I don't mean you can use cheat tool ,if so,VAC is waiting for serving you.WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO EVERY COOP GAME FAN WHO DON'T OWN THIS GAME  IS:If this game on discount,don't hesitate,just BUY IT!

												A very simple co-op horde shooter with surprising depth and replayability. The premise is pretty simple; bad stuff happened at a biotech lab somewhere in the UK and you've got to fight them, the story doesn't actually matter except to explain why you're fighting what you're fighting where you're fighting them, though. The vanilla game consists of several waves of a set number of enemies (Zeds), the composition of these waves increases with difficulty as you go along, and the game also scales in difficulty (number of enemies and their health) depending on the number of players and, of course, the difficulty you set. Generally speaking you can finish a Normal round with a disorganised team of randoms, but by the time you get to Hell on Earth you'll need a well-rounded team who know what they're doing, so there's a lot more to the game - in an 'emergent', sort-of-exploity kind of way; things like how hitboxes aren't synced to clients so you can't always get a headshot by aiming for the head or how if you jump and look down while shooting certain enemies at point blank range the bullets can hit more than once, thereby saving you ammo - than you'd ever figure out for yourself.All in all, if you have a group of people to play with, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this. If you don't and you just want to play with randoms, you probably won't ever experience the game at its hardest. The community, like many others, is a mixture of people who will accept new players and try to teach them and others who will kick low level players on sight. Which, honestly, is kind of justified; low level players physically cannot keep up with anything harder than Normal difficulty.			"

												I never thought I'd get so hooked to a game this suddenly and this quickly. With the different perks, different 'classes' of ZEDs and countless amounts of (custom) maps (in either mindlessly-slay-'em-all or Objective modes) - Killing Floor never really gets boring, and sometimes even though you think, oh I played so much this week, I might not want to anymore ... hahaha, well, YOU'RE WRONG. Leveling up is quite easy in the beginning and later on takes a lot of determination (it takes quite some time to collect all the required kills/headshot/damage points etc) - but it still is fun and gives you even more purpose than just freeing a district, abandoned warehouse, or farming area one ZED at a time. The added advantages you gain with each level up are also great (and another incentive)! The whole thing of earning money to buy your weapons is really cool. It's especially nice to see  when people really play as a team and help each other out when cash is short, or when they pick up an expensive weapon, after you tragically died defending your squad's core existence, to faithfully hand it back into your respawned hands. Of course, playing experience always depends on your co-players, and maybe the difficulty too (Normal is actually quite challenging already), and depending on the moon phase and the godesses' benevolent minds it can be quite a frustrating experience or the most fun you've had in a long, long time - so long ago, it's such a distant memory it doesn't quite come washing to the surface but just tickles your metaphorical gamer-nose with a satisfying, nostalgic odour. Personally I've made some great gaming friends just by excessively indulging in playing Killing Floor. With some I talk and laugh a lot, and I adore them, and others, well ... we might not talk much, but when we're facing the ZEDs side by side, wave after wave, you can just feel the bonding experience hanging thick in the air between us. We do not need to talk. We just wordlessly decapitate together. It's great!I am very much in favour of this game and I am already anxiously looking forward to the successor - hoping that they are going to surprise me delightfully with more female playable characters. Because in Killing Floor there is the Traders, a people of monovular sisters ... clones, even? Who are in ownership of all the weapons available in these godforsaken places. No matter where you go, the ZEDs are there, the Traders are there (coincidence? I think not).In terms of female playable characters, they are two that I am aware of. Two.Two? Really? TWO? (And you have to buy them. You do not even get to play a default female soldier or ANYone like that). Biggest booing!			"

												This game is by far the best first person shooter i have ever played. I own alot of games such as far cry,tomb raider,saints row and many others and yet I'm still attracted to this game. Sure this is a normal FPS game which is very common but this game is very different in it's aspects,gameplay,team cooperation and mechanicsFirst thing out,this is a team HORROR game and trust me it's a very good horror at that. I usually get scared by the spawns of the ZEDs as they spawn infront of me or worse,I walk into the middle of the group spawns. Sure it's annoying but that will teach me a lesson for wandering about. The ZEDs themselves have an amazing and terrifying design,from the small and puny clots to the godly fleshpounds. The design of the maps is very dark and gloomy which adds to the ambiance and scenic of the game. It gives that extra spooky effect. And if it is too dark for you,turn up the brightness. But beware if your playing on low brightness hehehe, that glowing yellow object? Stay away from it.Second things is by m far my favourite and that is teamwork. Wait you don't know what team work is? Well stopping running around the map quuick-scoping people. But seriously this game really recommends teamwork to aid in your survival. This however still depends on your team mates. Bad and selfish team? Instant death. Good and caring team? Instant win. I should also touch up on the perk system. There are seven main perks which are Field Medic-Focuses on healing team mates and keep them alive as well as your self. Your the most tankiest class so its good if you take the damage for your team.Support specialist-Focuses on taking out the big guys mainly.Sharpshooter- Clears thrash (Small ZEDs) and big guys too.Firebug-Not the best class, it is good for thrash clearing but if you love fire,then this is one for you.Demolitionist-BOOM BOOM BOOM!!!! Who wouldn't love this class? Explosive and focuses on killing big guys as well as BLOWING EVERY SINGLE LAST ZED TO PIECES!!!!!Berzerker- The melee guys for those who like it up close and personal( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Your sword is your friend, guns? Ew who wants that. You will love running around the map and kill the ZEDs and most fun is when you tackle on the big guys.Commando-another meh perk but i wouldn't say it is that bad. Their main focus is clearing thrash and being A ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AND STEALING MY ♥♥♥♥ING SCRAKE AND FLESHPOUND KILLS!!!!!! But if you love rifles then knock yourself out with this one.These perk have a max level of 6, wait 6? That's it? Don't worry pal,the way to level up is so hard you rather play the game then focus on leveling up. I have 200 hours on this game and i only have 3 level 6. That's alot to learn from that statement.Lastly,ay ay don't sleep on me yet man. This is the last point. The last thing you can do on this game is solo and earn achivements. WAIT,WAIT!! DON'T COME NEAR ME. I KNOW I SAID TEAMWORK IS IMPORTANT HEAR ME OUT FIRST! Solo is very fun and very scary. The reason being is because YOUR THE ONLY ONE ALIVE. And if you die well,game over man you gotta start a new map and from scratch again. But hey thats the fun part. Dying over and over again is annoying from my experience but that is the best part. You'll die and think maybe if i had done that i would have survived. Or maybe if i done that i would still die but killed most of the ZEDs. So when you die you'll think of what you could or could not have done to survive. And there are tons of achivements so you won't feel bored and you will have something to do. Uh one more thing hehe. SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP I'M ALMOST DONE! The one bad thing about this game is the servers. THERE ARE TONS OF THEM. But good luck finding the one in your region hahaha.Also one more thing to point is the DLC. Yes i know they are very expensive but don't worry. There are mostly gun and weapon DLC and won't affect the gameplay at all. I only own the neon character pack and no weapon DLC and the game still feels the same. (I'm getting more DLC in the future so stfu)So in conclusion killing floor is indeed a very good game. And horror game. I highly recommend the game to those who are considering to get it. The graphics may not look good but trust me the gameplay is fantastic. The community is honestly dying and i don't want this to be a dead game. Most of the members are moving on to killing floor 2 because it is more ""MODERN"". So I'm saying this again, this is a wonderfull 2009 game and you will love it if you out your heart to it.Thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy killing floor the same way i do. "

												Killing Floor is a wave based, co-op, zombie survival game. Its addictive perk leveling system will keep me playing for days and days. This game is often compared to the Left For Dead series and while it is similar, the gameplay is very different. L4D is going from point A to B while KF is to try to survive each wave until you meet the boss. You have 7 perks/classes to choose from. Each perk has a role to play during the game and it's here that teamwork is needed to survive as the higher you go in difficulty the harder the game becomes for the entire team. You have a number of weapons to choose from depending on your chosen perk too. The game is quite easy to learn, survive each wave of specimens and go to the trader to buy weapons, armour, etc.  You'll then face the end of game boss, the Patriarch and he will take some skill to take down. He is heavily armed, and also very fast. Furthermore he can cloack making him even more of a threat as you'l often find him appearing in the middle of the team without any warning. The maps are very big and well designed too. A great team based game and i highly recommend it!			"

Killing Floor is a fantastic family game, which combines aspects of team building, puzzle solving, and perception. It will surely give you hours, or maybe even days of fun. When you start the game, you have the option to play by yourself or cooperative. Since this is a family game, playing solo is not recommended as it will not give you the full experience of Killing Floor. The co-op games can have up to 6 players, that means you, your brother or sister, your parents, maybe your favorite grandparents and your pet warthog. The goal is simple: Have as much fun as possible! You and your teammates will be put in classic maps like kf_abusementpark and kf_hellride. Before you can play, you will have to select a so called ''perk''. It is recommended that all players play field medic, because their special funbombs have a lovely green glow when thrown, but I'll come to that later. After everyone clicked on 'ready up' you will spawn in the chosen map. Take a moment to look around in these beautiful places, because there are many things to be seen. I myself have found a sleeping horse, a dancing robot, a man with a television head, and a mini caravan. Soon you will realize that you are in fact, holding a gun. This is a glitch that should be fixed by the developers, because people might get a wrong idea from what this game is about. It is recommended that you press ""5"" to switch to your love dispenser. Soon you will hear the joyful cheers of the npcs in this game. There is the Clot, a little elf that will hug you *with force*, the delicious Gingerbreadman, the beautifully constructed snowman called ''Husk'', the Siren (who will sing for you) , Rudolph the crawling reindeer, the Scrake (I think he's made out of ice cream :3), the Bloat (Santa Claus), the Patriarch (Bigger Santa) When these npcs hug your or give you colorful flying thingies, your screen will get red from ketchup, it is really fun! Oh and.. ahem.. the Stalker.  I'd like the developers to delete this npc, as it is inappropriately clothed. It does NOT belong in a family game like Killing Floor. I hope it is just a bug like the guns and other weapons in this game. Overall this game is fun, and you (or a family member) should defenitly get it, but the developers should really fix the various bugs in this game. pi/5 would play again. "

												Please read the whole review.This game has similarities like Left 4 Dead with a weaker engine ( Unreal Engine 2.5 ) but is as fun as Left 4 Dead. Enemies are called speciments , and they look much more bloody than those in Left 4 Dead. This game has things that Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2 does not have. Anyways, detailed review starting on 3rd paragraph.First, No friendly fire. You may argue with the truth that it can be manually activated with scripts or settings on a server , but on default and many servers,  it is off. So even if you accidentally shot your teammate , hit your teammate with melee,  or even exploded something around him, blablabla, your teammate still won't get hurt. So you dont have to be afraid of starting a friendly fire brawl like people does in Left 4 Dead 2.Second, Perk and leveling. You can select a peek which suits your playstyle the most. Good at being a sniper ? Sharpshooter. Bad at spotting invisible enemies? Commando. Loves to help teammate ? Medic. Want to be the guy who kills all the zeds? Support Specialist. Want to be the saviour who bomb the boss into pieces? Demolition.Third, instead of having Half-Life 2's game aspects, Killing Floor has a mostly linear level concept. Stay together, do your job, shoot everything that attacks you. This makes the game more enjoyable for those who don't want to care about strategies or Friendly fire ( Although you will need some strategies on Hard mode and up ) or those who are tired from all the thinking at work.Fourth, Enemy body deformation. In Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2, only Common infected deforms. In Killing Floor, you get to destroy any part of any kind of enemies. Recommeneded for those who like Gore / Mortal CombatFifth, servers. It has more servers than Arma2 OA and Left 4 Dead 1, which is what makes this 2011 game still alive .However, the game engine is quite outdated and not capable enough for a large amount of NPCs to appear suddenly. The game will freezes for few seconds when the shop closes or zed spawns , no matter how strong your PC specs are. But it is not very game breaking.I rate this game 7.5/10.			"

												The negative reviews all seem to be based on the fact that this game has entirely optional DLC weapon and skin packs - the truth is the developers constantly update with free maps and now gamemodes too and the weapon packs should be seen as a way of supporting the developer. The game is so much better than the sale price it so often is so there are weapon dlc packs that in no way at all hinder your enjoyment of the game and can be bought if you think the developers deserve a little extra.I've typed this quickly in basically disbelief at some of the negative reviews - I mean for gods sake giving a game a negative review because you've only played 150 hours in the last year just beggers belief.One of the best games i've ever played with probably the most loyal developers.

												Aside from all the le money simulator maymay jokes this game is actually great.The money is required to upgrade weapons(like all games) but like zombie defense games should be you earn money from every ZED you kill. Depending on the difficulty you are playing you also recieve a a set amount of cash at the end of each wave. It's always important to upgrade your armor first.They have classes that require more money to use the required weapons, and a class that requires almost no cash.Everytime you level a class/perk you pay less for required weapons.If you put in the effort, you will not be paying much for any weapons at max perk level.Very good structure the game is set up by.Highly recommend, better than CoD and Left 4 dead.

												If you like wave-based FPS games where you can purchase better weaponry between rounds, Killing Floor most likely has your name on it. Besides having a solid arsenal, there are some fearsome and gruesome enemies to be fought. Killing Floor takes place in England. Some scientists were toying with human tissue and ended up by mistake making zombie specimens. There are two types of modes in Killing floor : Killing Floor and Objective. Killing Floor mode is a horde defense type game. After every successful round, the player is allowed to upgrade buy more ammo for their arsenal. Every kill will equal more money for disposable income. Every new level becomes more difficult until the final boss appears. In objective mode, there are specific challenges that players need to pass against certain zombies. To win a round, at least one player needs to remain alive to win. There are a lot of categories of weapons (or perks) to choose from as well as specific weapons. The categories are melee, pistols, support, commando, sharpshooter, firebug, demolition, field medic, berserker, perk neutral, and non-damaging. Melee weapons range from knives (almost spelt knifs), machetes, fire axes, katanas, chainsaws, claymores, sytches and a dwarves axe. Pistols range from regular 9mm to dual handcannons. Support comes in the form of shotguns, impalers, a ""zed"" thrower and a AA12. Commando weapons include bullpup, AK-47, M4 carbine, tommy gun, MKb and SCAR's. Sharpshooter weapons include lever-action rifle, single piston long musket, compound crossbow, M14 EBR and M99 AMR. Firebug guns include Mac-10, trenchgun, flare revolver and flamethrower. Demolition weapons include L.A.W, grenade launcher, seeker six, M4 203 with grenade attachment, Harpoon Bomber, m79 grenade launcher, orca bomb propeller, pipe bomb and grenade. Field medic weapons include Mp7, Mp5, M7A, Schneidzekk and the blower thrower bile launcher. There is a single berserker weapon which includes a buzzsaw bolt. Neutral perks include a zed eradication device as well as a MKII version and finally, non damaging weapons include medical syringes and a welder. You're probably wondering what the heck is a welder doing in the game? The welder can sort of ""lock"" or weld doors shut in the game. The AI is smart though and will take a different route in a certain door is locked. To un-weld a door, simply press alt+fire. Each perk is selected at the beginning of the round and can level up. Graphically, the engine is nice and the dismemberment of the hordes is awesome. Sounds are pretty decent and provide for a nice ambience. Some of the screams that come from the infected specimens is quite chilling. Overall, a pretty good game if you're hardcore into FPS, zombie and horde type genre. I have quite a few friends that do not like the game due to it's type but the mods can keep you coming back for more.

												Pros:Good gameplay loop.Amazing weapons.Cons:Repetitive, bound to lose your interest eventually.Holy hell does this game have one hell of a grind. Not only will it take hundreds of hours to unlock everything, but the grind holds you back from playing on higher difficulties. Unlike other games where a grind will usually just unlock new gear that is at least arguably a sidegrade, you get a bonus to every stat for each perk (class) that gives higher level players a direct advantage over lower level players. There's no good reason for it either. Lower level players can still play on higher difficulties, so it doesn't prevent new players from joining harder difficulties than they should, it only makes it even harder to win when they do join. The levelling might be fine if it was shorter, but for each individual perk it takes probably a little less than 50 hours to grind out on average. (Things like sharpshooter and medic level up relatively quickly, things like Commando or Support take absolutely forever and frankly skew that average to higher than it probably would be otherwise.)Conclusion:I would still recommend it in the end, but keep in mind that it's probably going to eventually become something you lose interest in with the repetitiveness. Just keep in mind that while it is a gem, it is greatly flawed gem.			"

												Killing Floor is a co-op game, where you can play alone, about experiments gone wrong and invading London (and the world too as seen in KF2 and as seen on some KF maps). Your goal is to survive 4,7 or 10 waves of enemies, while earning money by killing them (or by healing your teammates) so that you can buy powerful weapons during the minute of calm at the trader between the waves. After, you'll have to defeat the Patriarch, who is the sole responsible for the chaos. You can choose different difficulties: Easy (which is really to learn the game), Normal, Hard, Suicidal and Hell on Earth.Enemies are thougher depending on the difficulty but you too can evolve and acquire advantages like spawning with a better weapon than a pistol or armor thanks to the level system. You have 6 of them and it takes time. However, you have different classes: medic (no powerful weapon but more resistance  and better health), commando (rifles and can see stalkers from apart), support (big guns and better welder), demo (everything that is explosive), berserker (melee and also can't be grabbed), sharpshooter (sniper and headshots more efficient) and firebug (flame everywhere).Enemies are varied: from the simple Zed to the infamous Fleshpound that can kill you quickly, without forgetting the Scrake and the chainsaw, the Gorefast that cuts you in pieces, the Crawler that loves your feet, the Stalker who is hidden, the Husk that launches fireballs, the Siren that is hurting your ears (and your health)....Anyway, the game in its actual state contains many maps (some are official, others done by modders) and mutators with Christmas-themed or Halloween-Themed or Circus-Themed enemies (because they were parts of special events). The maps are very varied: fair, tunnel of love, Santa's workshop or cave, asylum, Horzine labs, urban town, mountain, hospital, etc..But you'll ask me: what about the DLC? Well, all the DLC are cosmetic. True, you have new weapons in them and they can be used for achievements. However, you can do them with the standard weapons, that are enough like the AA12 for example. And you can unlock avatars by playing with themed mutators for example or owning other games. And that's how you own two Mr Foster (the normal and the steampunk).Killing Floor in solo holds interest if you want to level without having a team to check or to win map achievements in Normal/Hard. An higher difficulty is better with a team, however, keep in mind that some of the players aren't using the perks for the team but for themselves. I've seen many medics choosing this perk for the advantages it's giving in terms of resistance or health but not healing at all the team for example. It's annoying as hell and if I seems to be upset by this kind of behavior, it's because I'm a medic first in this game, because I feel more useful by healing my teammates than beginning to put pipe bombs, welding the right doors or being a specialist of the crossbow. Healing is important in that game and if a medic is there, he's more powerful for the heal than the rest of the team. Not using of that fact can result in premature death on high difficulty.Anyway, with Killing Floor 2, I don't know if there are still a lot of players there. I still need to win Suicidal and Hell on Earth achievements, as I've all Hard and Normal and that all my perks are lvl5+. But it's still worthy to play. As long as there are servers and as long as the solo mode is there, Killing Floor is really a very strong co-op game. However, make sure that you're not discouraged when level 0. By patience, by learning and by leveling, you'll find more and more pleasure to survive these waves.			"

												It's a great game with:- Much gore.- Slow motion time (Zed Time).- A great Sountrack (Metal / Rock soundtrack).- A great variety of weapons.- A great variety of enemies.- The game has a slight cinematic touch (that I loved).In my opinion this is a great game, with the requirements you can run it in an old pc, highly recommended for those players looking for this type of PC games.10 / 10			"

												I got this game during the Halloween Sale after being interesting in it after watching Roosterteeth do a 'Lets Play' of it, and I must say that is a very fun game to play either by yourself or with friends as a team.This is a wave based game pitting you and/or a team against 10 waves of ever increasingly diffcult monsters, each with thier own unique way of making surviving difficult for you. After beating the 10th wave you and your team are pitted against the 'Patriarch' who will test you and your teams skill and ability to work together to the max.+ Fun and simply gameplay to learn.+ Huge arsenal of weapons to destroy your enemies.+ Very creative set of maps with the game constantly including new maps created and recommended by the community.+ Funnest game to play with your friends.- Can be cruel if you die during a wave as you lose your weapon and some ingame money.- Whole team dying except one on wave 10 can make respawning and then fighting wave 11 almost impossible.Overall this is very fun game to play, with developers who respect the community by importing custom made maps in, and also custom made weapons offcially imported, also more awaits in the Steam Workshop.Overall Score: 7/10			"

												One of the best survival co-op zombie games I've ever played.A lot of action & money, blood & money, chaos & money, zombies & money, did I mention money? All that and more money to a ridiculously high and absurd level .There's never enough money, ammunition & enough enemies to kill, what makes you always wanting to play more & more. There's no background/story. There's no reasons, you don't need it. Just weapons & zombies.So if you like being a philanthropist & kill zombies at the same time, this is your game.Killing has never been so satisfying and lucrative for your pocket.			"

												This game is pure fun! I'll tell you why :1. No need to worry about the numbers of people playing the game : you'll always find a lot of servers, even though this game is 7 (!!!) years old!2. Zombies (zeds as they call 'em) everywhere!3. Slow-mo so you can see all the details when blowing someone's brains off.4. Polished co-op so you're going to need some communication and strategy in order to beat the game.5. Great dificulity scale! You can play a short casual round just for fun, or if you want a challenge you can try an long expert playtrough which will surely put you under pressure!6. Many maps, weapons, a lot of customization ( Workshop is also included )7. Different game modes , including sandbox and a mutation bar if you wanna take it to another level...8. Bloody as hell xDCONCLUSION : Buy this as fast as u can! I'm 100% sure u won't regret it ;)			"

												Killing Floor is an incredible co-operative survival shooter. You can play solo, or join up with up to 5 other players to face waves of specimen trying to kill you. The specimen are enemies with big variety. Some are weak but can be tough in groups. Some are tough and can kill your whole squad single-handedly if you're poorly prepared.After each wave the game will progressively become harder, and tougher specimen will spawn. Between each wave the trader will open up her shop and you will be able to purchase a variety of weapons. You all have a perk that gives you bonuses and makes you more effective with certain weapons and levels up as you play. For example Support specialist are good with shotguns, commandos with assault rifles, berserkers with melee weapons and so on. After all rounds are complete you will face the final boss, the patriarch, and your teamwork will be put to the test.The game can get rather difficult. One big part about this game is the progression and the long learning curve. You won't be able to beat every map on the first try. You will learn about the enemies, the maps, the perks and the weapons as you play. And after mastering a difficulty you can move on to a higher difficulty and the rules will change. You will need new spots to defend at, new weapons to use and new tactics. This might be a drawback to some, but to somebody who likes long learning curves, it's perfect.The graphics are very good but not the latest. The game is from 2009 but still has impressive graphics. It's well optimized and can run well on decent hardware. The maps varies in quality but some are very well made and makes for a very good atmosphere. The game has quite some gore. It is well made and can be enjoyed during the Zed time. Zed time is when the whole server goes slow motion for a few seconds. Watching a Fleshpund blow to pieces right before you just as he about to shred you to pieces in slow motion is nothing short of awesome.The audio is also very good. The sound effects and the music are well made. The music changes from map to map and really adds to the atmosphere. It's fast-paced during the waves and makes shooting specimen a lot more fun.Killing Floor also has season events, three times a year. Every summer, halloween and winter all skins of the specimen change  during the event. New maps, weapons and achievements are also introduced. It keeps the game constantly fresh and always fun to come back to.Killing Floor is a really great game. It has improved a lot since it was released and still does wth constant updates. I highly recommend it.			"

												great game. i think i got it for free when buying red orchestra 2 (which is also great) or as a gift when buying kf 2 (which i havent played much yet, because it was beta then and i wanted to complete kf 1 first). so i started playing it in 2015 when it already was old. what i like about it, is the great balance in classes and enemys. at first i thought the wave breaks are also immersion breaks, and they somewhat are, but they bring in a tactical element, which can be crucial in higher difficulties, that is nice. its pleasing that you can hunt down so many achievements, i really like to do that. and that its a growing challenge to beat the higher difficulties, but still in a fair manor. personally i enjoy the solo mode for this game, havent played multiplayer too much and whitnessed quite a lot of lag there, but that might not be representing. the maps are also pretty creative and community works are implemented heavily. you get so much content and playtime in a well thought out game. it still does not feel old today, in fact it feels better than many modern products. respect & love for that.

Unlike L4D, there is a really feeling of accomplishing something when you finished a level. There are also tons of fun weapons, wich all ""feel"" somewhat different.

												Initially a very two dimensional game that while fun, lacked proper staying power, Killing Floor has grown as it's gone on.The seasonal events and the relatively recent addition of a campaign have helped keep the game from stagnating and kept people obsessed with achievements coming back.Not really a fan of their more recent DLC, adding weapons that tip the balance to favour players who buy DLC is not something I can agree with.The game is only truly fun when you're playing with people who know their stuff, and who communicate and coordinate with one another.  Friends with microphones and reasonable Internet connections are what you need to make this game really work out well.With the afore mentioned companions, it can be a fun game to throw yourself into from time to time, though a less tactical one than Left4Dead.

												Killing Floor is a decent game.  The gameplay feels slightly choppy like everything else tripwire has to offer, but the atmosphere and variety of weapons/scenarios makes up for it.  As far as horror games go, it's fairly enjoyable, with the monsters being visceral and haunting.  One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of an intuitive menu system, one which also makes quickly selecting a weapon in the heat of the moment difficult.  Overall, it's a better-than-average horror game that any fan of the genre should try out.			"

												Choose out of 7 different classes fighting various types of zombies and at the end of the game fight a boss. It's not your typical zombie type game each zombie has a unique ablitiy and doesn't rely on melee alone. There are tons of maps to play on and custom maps making the game almsot endless fun. For $20 this game is fun enough but for $50 you will get all the dlc getting, most of the characters and majority of the weapons which are boss. The game is a game that goes on sale often and you can always buy it then with all it's DLC.

												A simple concept with surprising depth, survive a finite number of zombies in each wave, and try to make enough cash to buy better weapons for the next one, All the while hoping to end up with suitably powerful weapons for the end of game boss. The different perks(classes) provide a great variety in the way you play this game, and an RPG like upgrade path. Different environments require different strategies as well. If you just try and blast everything, you will probably fail, so learning the different abilities and weaknesses of the Zeds is important. The different game difficulties require you to master new tactics and tricks in order to be successful. The achievements make you want to keep playing and the social aspect of working with friends is very satisfying. Single player also requires different tactics to multiplayer coop. I have been playing this for a long time now, and still get surprised at how unique each game can be. One of the all time best coop games ever. The setting can be a bit macabre, so not for younger kids though.			"

												Killing Floor is one of those solid historic PC games that i'll always love to play. It never gets old or boring for me no matter how many times i play it. It's difficult and the igher rounds can become a real challenege if you don't prepair in the right way early on. I still have issues with the game itself at times. It's pretty frequent the issues i run into this game. The weapon dlcs are also a great buy as well, i normally don't pay for dlc on steam but KF i've bought almost all of the weapons ones. Playing by yourself is a great way to kill time, but plaing online is a real challenege and defianatly a blast to do if you have the right teammates. You have a set of about 6 different classes all of which you level up by using weapons and sometimes equipment in their field. The higher the level of the class the cheaper you can buy the guns for it and the more powerful they become, faster you can reload, and also different perks depending on the class. The enemys are pretty well balanced with a good mixture of powerful enemys and weaker ones. You can also use different enemies for your advantage and get them to kill the zeds for you(Fleshpoun and Bloater).The workshop for this game is also really good. You can find all sorts of things in there to enhance the gameplay. Adding new guns to the game(LMG, Snipers, Assault Rifles etc) you can add maps made by the community that are well done and balnced out, and also get different game modes and also some pretty cool mods to change the whole game up and give it a different field (Aliens mod)As much as i hate dealing with a game that has issues i still love Killing Floor becasue it's iconic to me and one of the best PC games i've played. It's a game that sticks out there from all the rest and it's one that's fun and challenging all at the same time.(os being used is Mac)			"

												I know KF2 is out soon but i had to write this just to hail this astonishment called Killing Floor! I played it nearly 500 hours and sometimes still coming back just to have a good hour. I'm a hardcore singleplayer guy, avoid MP as pest and guess what, this is the only multiplayer game i played continously in the recent years. I actually tried L4D but there was so much hate towards me as a newby i quit it. So Killing Floor. At first it looked like a trash. Then dunno how it sucked me in. Few enemies, all the maps has the same goal to kill everything (objective mode was came much later, still only applies to a very few levels), the weapons looks good though. So that's all? Yes! Try it! Not once but try it 10 times and you will start to feel the same thing, a fonding, a calling word 'Come back to mommy and pappy and kill us . . .if you can!""No matter how experienced i am after 500 hours if i'm not carefull enough even the singlest Clot can kill me. This everyday challenge, the weird-scary enemies and level design, the parodical amount of gore, the unbelievable good weapon system and the actual weapons and the teamwork is what makes this game one of the best games ever, and for me, the absolutely king of the multiplayer FPS genre.

												When I first got this game I didn't really know what to expect, assuming it was similar to L4D2 which I'm not fond of. Have to say I'm glad I gave it a shot, KF has become one of my favorite games. Plenty of maps and perk/weapon options. Mod support, custom maps, events, etc.. it has tons of content to explore and master. Very difficult game in the beginning, until you start to learn the mechanics of the Zeds and can start to strategize. Fun both solo and multiplayer. I've spent hundreds of hours playing this game now and I don't see that stopping until KF2 comes out.			"

												Killing Floor is one of the greatest cooperative game to ever come out on Steam. Is it really? Definitely. Since the game was debut in 2009, Killing Floor evolved with many seasonal events, free weapons and maps, and small cosmetic downloadable content to support Tripwire Interactive's longevity to Killing Floor. One would ask: What is Killing Floor? Well, Killing Floor is a six player multiplayer cooperative survival game that takes on against various ""zeds"", ranging from the clots to the rage-meter Fleshpound that will grind your body into giblets. There are seven perks that you can select that varies from the Support Specialist with its ultimate shotgun barrage to the fast running Berserker that you will probably become the ""ultimate ninja"" if you play long enough (Berserker is my favorite perk to use; it's really fun). The game may become a bit repetitious, but the maps, playing with your friends, or meeting (and making friends) with other players in the Killing Floor community will make you come back and enjoy killing those zeds. Did I mention zed time (or slow motion)? There is and seeing zeds being decimated is an appeal to the eyes. The last question remains: Do you have this game in your Steam library? If not, go get this game..now! If you already have KF, go join in a server and have fun. For those who are waiting for Killing Floor 2, I will see you there when it comes out on Day One. Get this game and enjoy it as much as you can before the Patriarch attacks again in Killing Floor 2.			"

												Kinda like Left 4 Dead, but minus the brains (post-post-modernist zombie reference wholly unintended).     If you like shooting ducks in a gallery, but prefer your ducks to look like monsters, then this may very well get you hot and bothered. Stand in a group and shoot things, run to the nearest ""shop"", spend money on better equipment, then run to the next shooting gallery and take down yet another ""wave"" of critters slightly different from the last.  Repeat about ten times, then get a Boss.     No strategy or semblance of a plot or journey like Left 4 Dead, and virtually no significance at all to the fact that you have anyone playing with you (at least where the gameplay's concerned; but I suppose you can always have a nice chat about the weather or the football or something).     Oh, and you can buy silly chicken suits and other inane♥♥♥♥♥♥ a la Team Fortress, etc.  Who needs remotely varied or challenging gameplay when you have silly chicken suits?  Damn, I hate it when I argue against myself and win...Verdict: 6.5/10.			"

												This game is purely amazing! The game is about you and 5 other people trying to survive and fight off the oncoming horde of specimens. The specimens I guess could relate to zombies in a sense, for most of them are slow and looming towards you. There are other specimens, and some are extremely difficult and take technique to take down. The game adapts in difficulty as more players join, by giving the zeds (specimens) more health, and they appear in more drastic numbers. This makes the game challenging. There is not running away strategy, you need to stay and fight, which gives you a sense of peril or danger, knowing that many of the zeds could easily outrun you leading to your ultimate demise. The gun mechanics are very satisfying and the gore system works perfectly with it. You can pick one of (8) classes to use, each with different stats and weapons to act with the class. The game might not be the BEST game on steam, but it's certainly up there! Hope this helps with your next purchase!			"

												An amazing survival game overall. It combines great gameplay (classes, levelling up said classes, wave-based really intense combat) with some fun thanks to the British voices and overall silliness.You can really have a lot of fun in this game thanks to it having a lot of maps (and you can get even more with the workshop!), the ability to play them with different classes gives a different feel, the different difficulties as well. Honestly this is just the kind of game you can put 1000 hours in and still feel like playing it, the class-leveling system contributes to this a lot because you'll always want to get that damn level even though it's going to take ages getting there.You think you're done? Hell no, say hello to the halloween/christmas/summer/whatever-they-come-up-with update, because this game gets updated so often you'll always come back to it even if you left it alone for a while.In short, BUY IT.

												The best co-op game I've played!KF is basically waves of different zombies coming to get you and nomnomnom you to death.It doesn’t sound too complicated and it’s not. Don’t mix up simplicity with fun though – I don’t see any dependency here.Everything depends on who you play with and everybody’s play style. This is the factor that could make you rage or laugh or chill during the whole game. I’ve experienced one and the same map and difficulty to be easy, extremely hard, annoying or raging, all depending on who I play with. What the game is like? As I said – waves and different zombies. There are also 6 classes you can play as and all of them have different strengths and weaknesses, as well as different nemeses in the face of the different zombie types. There are no skills that you can choose from, so all who choose to play a certain class are equal (at least until the point when it comes to skills, situation assessment and general play style). Weapons are also divided in classes, but there is no restriction if you feel like buying a weapon meant for a class different than yours.			"

Amazingly, I don't have such a great computer yet on lowest settings 16:9 1280x720 I can run the game smoothly just barely getting around 90 FPS. PC SPECS:CPU (API): AMD A4-5000GPU (CHIP): AMD 8330 HD GraphicsRAM: 8.00 GB DDR2/DDR3 (can't remember)I love this game so much, I'm sure I'd probably have frame issues if I bought Killing Floor 2, but I can easily upgrade to a different PC. The rush I have getting into a level is amazing. Hardly any games I play now-a-days give me the rush this game does. I can't wait 'till I get better at this game so that I can play on a harder difficulty and get an EVEN BIGGER adrenaline rush.Thank you so very much for creating this game.

Purely based on enemy damage inflicted/kills (apart from the Field Medic) which is based on healing to make your character (7 different perks) stronger. A great range of melee weapons, guns and nads to use. Lots of different enemy types. The Patriarch (The Boss/Creator) is on the last wave he is as tough as nails. Blood-thirsty stuff. Highly Recommended.			"

												The best co-op game I've played!KF is basically waves of different zombies coming to get you and nomnomnom you to death.It doesn’t sound too complicated and it’s not. Don’t mix up simplicity with fun though – I don’t see any dependency here.Everything depends on who you play with and everybody’s play style. This is the factor that could make you rage or laugh or chill during the whole game. I’ve experienced one and the same map and difficulty to be easy, extremely hard, annoying or raging, all depending on who I play with. What the game is like? As I said – waves and different zombies. There are also 6 classes you can play as and all of them have different strengths and weaknesses, as well as different nemeses in the face of the different zombie types. There are no skills that you can choose from, so all who choose to play a certain class are equal (at least until the point when it comes to skills, situation assessment and general play style). Weapons are also divided in classes, but there is no restriction if you feel like buying a weapon meant for a class different than yours.			"

												Bought this game when it went on sale and was not disapointed. Got the bundle for a pretty good deal and it came with over 15 maps. This is a game you want friends to play with because I find that solo play gets boring. The game also gets easier as you level up your perks so grind them out one at a time. The settings are limited but that can be expected from a 5 year old game. The game has much community involvement and the community is still active. I recommend this over any call of duty zombie game and would reccomend it to anyone deciding to get it.			"

												Kinda like Left 4 Dead, but minus the brains (post-post-modernist zombie reference wholly unintended).     If you like shooting ducks in a gallery, but prefer your ducks to look like monsters, then this may very well get you hot and bothered. Stand in a group and shoot things, run to the nearest ""shop"", spend money on better equipment, then run to the next shooting gallery and take down yet another ""wave"" of critters slightly different from the last.  Repeat about ten times, then get a Boss.     No strategy or semblance of a plot or journey like Left 4 Dead, and virtually no significance at all to the fact that you have anyone playing with you (at least where the gameplay's concerned; but I suppose you can always have a nice chat about the weather or the football or something).     Oh, and you can buy silly chicken suits and other inane♥♥♥♥♥♥ a la Team Fortress, etc.  Who needs remotely varied or challenging gameplay when you have silly chicken suits?  Damn, I hate it when I argue against myself and win...Verdict: 6.5/10.			"

												Left 4 Dead Ain't got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on this game!-The melee action in KF is WAY more entertaining than in L4D2KILLING FLOOR is one of my favorite games! A Variety of Zombies, Different Weapons, Maps, Player Models & Perks. It also has Teamwork, Survival and Horror E.T.C. AND it has different events like Summer Sideshow Event (Clown zombies and Carnivals) Christmas Event (Santa last boss, elves as zombies) Halloween Event (Wierd♥♥♥♥♥entertaining funny♥♥♥♥♥♥♥EVERY TIME!) -love this gameThe wast majority of both Pistols, Shotguns, Machineguns, Explosives, Pyrotecs and even Melee weapons gives each perk a role to fill perfectly, and the best thing about using perks instead of classes: THERE IS NO WEAPON RESTRICTION! -You are a Support specialist who uses shotguns? Got space and cash for a 50 cal.? BUY IT!-Includes Custom maps, ask me for a Map! -THIS GAME ROCKZ!-New ""Objective mode"" added in last patch! (as of the date on this review) adds Missions, Objectives and small tasks to the game!			"

												Very good game. The atmosphere is very good, it got me interested all the time. Too bad there is no story mode however, since the lore seems really interesting.You can choose between 6 classes, each of them have bonuses on certain weapons and equipment, such as, Medic has more ammo on Medic guns and recharges the health syringe faster.Different classes are good against different enemies. Some classes can take out a whole bunch of lower enemies, while others can take single high enemies easily,  the classes are well balanced.Only thing i disliked about the game is the DLC. There are several skin packs as well as a weapon pack, and a lot of time people online are running with these skins on. At times some may even want to kick you for not having them. In the end, it's a good Co-op survival horror game. I highly recommend to anyone who likes to slaughter an army of zombie like creatures.			"

Most of the time, players will actually help you in this gameC. Amount of Characters are endless and growingD. Weapons are also endlessE. There are 7 classes, that take several months of playing to fully level upF. The enemies are brutally tough, but trust me, this is a good thing.G. You can play it on high graphics with just about any computer.H. Every holiday, the enemies change appearance and more achievements are unlocked around killing the new enemies.I. (Using Steam Workshop and downloading the song ""Boss Wave"" to play during the final boss. Love hearing that song when fighting the boss.)Bottom line is, I freaking LOVE this game and I always manage to come back to it and wreck more havoc in it.

												I'm not good at writing reviews, but it feels criminal to love a game this much and not leave a positive review on it, so here's' a simple pros/cons listPros:+Great soundtrack+Weapons feel powerful and satisfying to fire (a feature somewhat lacking in KF2, in my opinion)+Gritty, sinister 'apocalyptic' atmosphere to the maps, as opposed to the oddly clean, shiny and futuristic feel of KF2+Full of personality+Fast-paced+Challenging, assuming you're not playing on lower difficulties. Not a hand-holding game.+Many different weapons and perks to try+Easy to sink countless hours into without it becoming 'stale' or 'old' (somewhat subjective)+Many different official and community maps+Not at all demanding and can be played on low-end systems, but at the same time, the graphics really aren't bad for a 2009 gameCons:-Likely to become less active with KF2 being out-Progressing in perks can feel grindy at times, but is well worth the effort-Very minor bugs existOverall, Killing Floor is still vastly superior to KF2 (though KF2 is not a bad game by any means), and is well worth the money for anyone who enjoys co-op survival or horde shooters.

												My favourite zombie game on steam so far. I'm addicted to all the guns, game modes and mods and all that jazz within this treasure. Plenty of DLC to relish in and for only $19.99 another fun, zombie slaying, arcade stylish sort of game that I give a 9/10 for the good quality of never getting bored of it.			"

												It's challenging and rewarding and loads more fun than KF2.There is a wide range of weapons to use on all perks which allows for various strategies and playstyles. And after you've become tired of the base game weapons, you can purchase more weapons via dlc packs. And the dlc weapons are either reskins or whole new weapons, so it adds even more variety. I've been playing with just the base game weapons, if I want to use the dlc weapons, I can trade them off someone and paying them dosh for it (in-game currency). So, no real money is really needed to use dlc weapons as long as you play with someone who has them!Zeds are interesting and challenging, it will take practice to understand various strategies on killing them. It's not always as simple as shooting them, some bigger zeds might require specific strategies to kill effectively. And if you get bored of base game zeds, you can play against 3 reskinned themes including halloween, hillbilly, and christmas zeds. If that's not enough, there are custom mod servers out there with brand new zeds and weapons. You need only join these custom servers and the game will do the rest for you (downloading them and such).The music is metal and it's nice to listen to. Personally, I turn the music off when I play because it's easier to hear zeds behind you without screaming metal blasting in the background.Pros:Lots of weaponsChallenging enemiesFun teamplay elementsMoney managementChat commands are often funny or informative (i.e. Insult Players)You can get dlc weapons off other players (no purchase of dlc required)No sprint (some people say this is a con but I think it's a pro because it adds desperation and challenge to a given situation. I think sprint in KF2 ruined the experience.)High recoil on weaponsCons:Metal music can be distracting if you're not watching your backLobby ads can get really annoying (there are mods to change/disable them)Menu buttons are sometimes a little wonky (requiring a second or third click)Neutral:Dark filter makes colours seem dull but it increases the gritty atmosphereTrader dialogue gets on my nerves sometimes (personal preference so not a con)Modding sounds or music will change it for singleplayer but not onlineOnly one boss but his diologue is funnySome strategies are kind of cheesy but fun to do yourself (i.e. blowing up boss with a few dozen demo charges)I can't think of anything else to add but it's definately a golden title of a game, I highly recommend it. 10/10			"

Of course, it all depends on the team you're with, as if you have people constantly screwing up (LIke people going off on their own a lot and constantly getting killed), it can really hurt your team, but.. The game is still really fun to play. I personally think Scrakes are hilarious to kill. =3=Just don't be a scrub by playing as a level 0 on any mode tougher than beginner.

												KillingFloor is a game in which the most important is to kill and play. Teamwork is fundamental to the highest levels but still the game does not let you know that really is a game and you enjoy it with friends or not. A game that despite years and has over has not lost its essence and its weapons are the best realistic and very well designed. Only one bad thing are constant with overpriced DLC!(Killingfloor es un juego en lo que lo mas importantes es matar y divertirse.El trabajo en equipo es algo fundamental en los niveles mas elevados pero aun asi el juego no deja hacerte saber que en realidad es un juego y que lo disfrutes sea con amigos o no.Un juego que pese a que ya tiene años encima no ha perdido su esencia y sus armas son de las mejores realistas y muy bien diseñadas.Solo una cosa mala y son los constantes Dlcs con un excesivo precio!!!)

												Tired of the usual FPS games that get too boring after some 10 rounds? Look no further than to playing this FPS-Horror Shooter that is Killing Floor. Movement may not be as fast paced as the other FPS games out there but this one resorts to the shooting mechanics and a bit of teamwork to survive hordes upon hordes of enemies. From WInchester Rifles, to AA-12 Shotguns, Flamethrowers, and M32 Grenade Launchers; this game prides itself as one of the best games in the 21st century.			"

												Basically about 2 to 3 years ago I thought, in fact I was 100% sure that I will never ever play this game. Boy, was I wrong or what!? :D Now, I have played it almost half a year, not quite, but almost and I must admit that when I first played it, I was so incredibly surprised about the fact that I was actually enjoying this game as much as I did and still do. I can't say that I've completely grasped every aspect of this game yet but I sure am having fun shooting those zombies heads off hahahaaa... Anyway in all and all I think that this game is so successful for the simple fact that it can be such a stress reliever. Don't get me wrong, in many cases(and levels) it can be the opposite-stress creator-but without a little scare it wouldn't push you to improve yourself and it's more than likely that next time you will do a lot better. I recommend that game to everyone, honestly. You can't go wrong with this one. I also like how there's so many achievments you could get during playing this game. And what's most important, when you get a good team together, you will gain many great friends from that game as well. 10 out of 10 from me :D Thumbs Up!			"

												Самая распрекрасная игра на свете, в которой есть все: и забавные, подчас смертельно опасные, жертвы генетических экспериментов, и харизматичный лидер армии этих жертв - в прошлом интеллигентный профессор, в настоящем сохранивший от прежнего облика только изящные очки монстр ада - Патриарх, и разнообразные перки, в которых любой найдет себе что-то по душе (от калаша до катаны, от дробовика до уничтожителя монстров), и волнующая атмосфера для любителей постапокалиптической разрухи и трэша, и великолепный саундтрек...

												I've played this game for about 6 hours total and it's enjoyable. It certainly doesn't stink but nothing incredible either. It's excellent to kill time but I'm not bummed if I dont have a chance to play. Exceptionally Mediocre? How's that? Oh, and it says I've played for 44 hours or something like that ( at the time of this posting ). For whatever reason either the game or steam never bothered to log me out. So you may wanna check on that when you quit playing the game. I wish I had 44 hours of free time.			"

												Killing floor was released in 2005 and was developed and published by Tripwire Interactive. There is also a sequel to this game comming out in 2015, there are also various trailors for Killing floor  but talking about that would be going off topic. I will be talking about alot of the game features and you may not have time to read all of it or you might just not want to, you can skip to the final paragraph to read the final verdict. Killing floor is a zombie wave base survival game. You can play solo, or co-op with up to 6 other players. There are 5 difficulties you can play on - Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal and finally Hell On Earth. There is a large variety of maps to play on, and you can also download many more maps on the steam work shop. There are seven different classes you can play as, as you play the game there are different challanges to do for each perk, which when completed will level up your perk. The highest level you can get a perk to is level 6. At a level 5 and 6 perk, you spawn with a weapon unique to the class you as. For example if you are a berserker you will spawn with an axe, where as if you were level 1-4 you would spawn with what everyone else who is level 1-4 spawns with. Some classes even allow you to spawn with a protective vest at level 5 or 6. The seven classes you can play as are the Field Medic, the Support Specialist, the Sharpshooter, the Commando, the Berserker, the Firebug and Demolitions. All these classes play in different ways.The gameplay is based around surviving waves on enemies, and each wave there are more enemies, and at some higher waves better enemies spawn. After a wave is completed you have a minute to a minute and a half (depending on the dificulty) to get to a trader and buy weapons or ammo. You can change the number of waves from short, medium, long or custom. Short game consists of 4 waves on enemies, and then a fifth wave which is the boss wave. A medium wave has 7 waves of normal enemies, and then an 8th wave which is the boss wave. A long game has 10 rounds of normal enemies and then an 11th wave which is the boss round. After you kill the boss on the final round you will be awarded with an achievment (if it is the first time you have completed that map on every difficulty exept beginner) and even if you are dead you will still get the achievment. The graphics in this game are not the best, but these graphics were good for their time, let me remind you this game was made in 2005. You can alter the graphics with various options from the menu which do improve the looks of this game. There are 10 enemies in this game. You may think they are zombies but they are in fact specimens, they are failed experimental clones. The 10 specimens are called the Clot, Crawler, Gorefast, Stalker, Bloat, Husk, Siren, Scrake, Fleshpound and the boss from the final wave - The Patriach. The clot is the easiest of the enemies but has the ability to grab you (unless you are a high level berserker), this can be bad in close quaters situations or when you are being swarmed. The crawler (as you can imagine it crawls) is a small black thing with multiple legs and its main attack involves it jumping at you, making it a hard target to shoot. The gorefast, is a red enemy who has a blade in one of his hands, if you let him get to close to you, he will rage and run at you super fast and he can do some serious damage. The Stalker is a female enemy who goes stealth and strikes you from behind, if succesful it can do alot of damamge. The bloat, is a big fat green/yellow guy and one of his attacks if vometing, this poisons you and deals you damage over time, not a long time but it can still be dangerous, he also soaks up quite a few bullets but if you get head shots on him and can be a quick kill. The husk has a husk fireball launcher (a weapon the pyro can buy), he shoots at you from far, but he still tries to walk close to you, if he gets close to you, he will use his melee attack and hit you. The siren is a female enemy who walks fairly slowly but get close to her and you wont hear the end of it, her main attack is screaming, this muffles you visition and does you alot of damamge at higher difficuilties, she should definity be one of the first enemies you try to kill if you are kiting. The scrake looks like a butcher with a hockey mask, he has a chainsaw and if you get to close to him, he will go into a rage mode and run really fast, he can be really deadly if you dont stun him. The fleshpound is the hardest and most deadliest enemy not including the final boss. Up to three fleshpounds can come at once which is really bad. Fleshpounds are much like scrakes or gorefasts, if you get to close to ther fleshpound he will go rage, he will go from the colour yellow, to the colour red and he will charge at you really fast, he also has alot of hit points. The final enemy is the Patriach, he is also the boss for the final round (other monsters also spawn on the final round while the patriach is healing). He has many attacks, he can shoot a rocket at you, he can shoot is arm gun at you, he can melee you and he can also go stealth (which he does alot). He will be in stealth alot but if you damamge him with a fire weapon you can see the flames moving around in the shape on him, which indicates to you where he is. He has alot of hit points and the best stratgy to kill him is to be the demolition class and place pipe bombs at the entrancers to doors, but make sure he cant see you are he will shoot and posibily detonate the pipe bombs. Co-op can be played with up to six other players, but if you play on modded servers i have seen one with up to 32 players. If more players join the game more enemies spawn and the enemies get slightly harder, but if you want to win some games and are not a very experienced player, i recomend to look for a server and play co-op to get use to the game. In co-op you can share guns with team mates and share money, by share i mean you drop them and then your team mates pick them up. You can not revive team mates so if you die you will spawn at the end of the round. Weapons are class specific, but you can find weapons scatered around the map along with ammo and if your lucky a vest. The weapons you buy will be cheaper if you are a higher level in the class you are playing as. Some weapons have an alternet shoot. For example if you have a medic gun you can shoot uneing the alternate shoot mode and if you shoot at a team mate you will heal them. Or as a berserker with melee weapons you can stun enemies, for exaple you can stun a husk by using the alternate attack. My final verdict for this game is a 9/10. It has amazing co-op, a deep class/perk system, a wide variety of enemies and guns, so many maps, maps on the steam workshop, the ability to play solo, 5 different dificulties, lots of achievments, a challanging boss (on harder difficulties), collectibles hidden within maps, different skins which you can buy or get from achievments, custom servers. All in all it is a great game and i totally recommend you buy it, or atleest watch a video to see if it peaks your interest :)			"

 Killing Floor Review  Short Decription  Killing Floor is truly a masterpeice of a game,a simple but yet fun and addictive game to play with yourself and with your friends!. Killing Floor is a 6 player co-op horde shooter where you battle it out with waves of mutated genetic freaks and earn money for oblidorating them and using that money to buy better gear between waves at the Trader.Killing Floor also features a Perk System which has 7 diffrent perks to pick from  ( Field medic, Support specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition.)  with each level you earn, the higher the benefits of your perk will be, getting you more discounts on perk specific weapons and more damage for those weapons and other perk related attributes of the sort. Run down of the Game  Multiplayer The comunnity for Killing Floor is large and healthy, many active players and active servers to join and play injust make sure to play on servers appropriate for your level of skill and perk, playing on Hell on earth servers is not exactly where you wanna start your game in. Mod support/Developer support Killing Floor has been supported by the developers ever since 5 years ago when it came out on Steam, giving a large amount of patches and fixes for the game along with a ton of Weapons that were added in during special events (Christmas, Halloween, ect) also re-skinning the zeds to fit the theme of the holiday.in terms of mods Killing Floor itself was originaly built off a Mod for Unreal2004 so it would be no suprise to see the game have very big mod support, a ton of community made maps and other mods (Weapons, Charaters, Zeds, ect)i would recommend to play a bit of Killing Floor Vanila before trying out the mods so that you will not be confused what is a regular part of the base game. Performance  For a game running on an outdated/aging engine, Killing Floor is quite amazing till this very day.using the old unreal engine to its limits and allowing huge mod support with the SDK.Running Killing Floor should not be a problem to anyone with a low-end PC, (unless you are trying to run the game with a Potato of a computor) Gameplay Killing Floor is quite a solid and polished FPS, having some of the best gunplay i have ever expirenced in a gamegiving the player a large amount of options and guns to use.Teamwork is a very important part of the game when playing on higher diffculties or playing in general with other poepleeveryone in the team has a responsibility to take and can contribute to the team with the skill set they have(Field medic healing poeple (duhh). Support keeping doors welded and crowd controling zeds with his shotgun, Demolition blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up, ect ect) Final notes Killing Floor is definetly a must have for any fan of horde shooters and cooprative games, you will be playing for hours and might want to get a group of friends to enjoy it twice as much!like i said before, please know what you are doing and dont go running off into Hell on Earth servers at Level 0you also might wanna pick up some weapon DLC, (yeah we all hate buying DLC but this DLC is realy good and the developers deserve the money for this!) there is also alot of cosmetic charater packs you can pick up to add a bit of style to your charater, but they aren't essential nor do you get any special benefits from them.I can't wait for Killing Floor 2 and i bet you can't wait aswell, so hop into Killing Floor and have a blast and prepare your♥♥♥♥♥for Killing Floor 2.UPDATE 11/18/2016kf2 got out of EA, sucks♥♥♥♥♥♥not going to elaborate, play kf1 instead			"

												I find this game much more compelling than LFD2. The combination of XP, classes, and a greater variety of weapons and enemies to be a big plus. However, the hosting and joining of games, which should be automatic in any recent game now, requires you to summon years old port forwarding and firewall knowledge to solve. It's worth it though. The game is a blast.			"

												I don't even know why I haven't reviewed this game yet, despite having (Probably) spent more time in it than any other game in my library. Really, what else is there to say than, it's fun! Not just the game is good but so it it's community, in most cases. I recalled plenty of moments where after a wave I was short on cash, only to feel a smile tugging at my lips when a random person ran up to me and started throwing dosh at my face while yelling the game's characteristic “Loadsa moneh!”  There's beginner mode which is easy and can help any starting player learn the ropes, getting their first perk levels while chopping off specimen heads left and right, is there's one thing bad about it, is that from beginner to normal is such a huge jump, making the game suddenly feel rather, difficult for new players. It does however do well at making the players work together. Two people working as a team can wreak havoc in hard mode whereas six people that don't will only end up failing in normal. I like that.Every match can last anywhere from 3 minutes (If you die early) to 45 minutes (On long games) and whether you win or not, you'll still most often know that you made some progress levelling towards your next perk level.It will probably go on sale again this winter, and the monsters will all look their christmassy best again (They already do!) so if you have a bit of dosh. Get it, bring some friends, and get hunting!			"

												This game is pretty fun. Unfortunately, the fun ends when you aren't playing with friends, and the game doesn't have a lot of new things to offer after you've played it for a while. Of course, the implementation of special content, such as the recent 'Twisted Christmas Event' adds a bit more amusement, and refreshes the experience somewhat, but this isn't really a huge thing. Similarly, character pack DLC is a novel thing, but not enough to make the game 'refreshing.' Still, it's a nice little shooter, worth playing, and it's certainly grown since its humble beginnings as a UT2004 mod.			"

												Definitely recommending this game. Grab a few friends, hop in to a same server and just start shooting everything that attacks you.Killing floor offers a Great deal of fun in the shape of killing a lot of different types of mutated beings.It has a wide variety of weapons and classes, leveling up a class requires you to do certain things (eg. Sharpshooter needs to get headshots, Medic needs to heal), classes are well varied, every class feels unique and has their own weapons (Every gun is still possible to buy even if you're playing a certain class, but the class bonus' do not apply to other classes weapons).Game feels good, overall the movement is fluid, and getting that headshot on a bloater to blow up it's head feels awesome.Difficulty is easily adjusted, easy feels easy, and Hell on Earth offers a great deal of challenge.The game is also very well modded and it offers a lot of content on top of the classic game's content,DLC's are also a thing, they offer more weapons, if you're not satisfied with the defaults. I myself don't own any DLC, so I cannot give a proper review on that, but as far as I know, they are not considered overpowered.Overall, I prefer the First Killing floor over the second one, if you're not too bothered by ""lower"" graphics, I'd definitely give it a go.

												Great game to kill zombies in a coop mode with your friends, you have variety of zombies, you play in different rounds ""waves"", increasing the difficulty (between waves you have time to buy weapons)even a last level with the ""Patriarch"" who starts saying ""what have you done to my children"", very funny hahaha. There are also some other modes.From time to time, while playing it makes a slowmotion effect that is very exciting.And the maps are good too, I really like westlondon and steamland (steam-punk style). I don't kno why, but i never can find my friends who are playing the game in the friends list on the menu, i have to follow or invite them via steam.Wish it had also female characters for free for i always have to choose one with a mask because i like to play as a woman.I do recommend this game : ))))			"

After you kill the boss on the final round you will be awarded with an achievment (if it is the first time you have completed that map on every difficulty exept beginner) and even if you are dead you will still get the achievment. The graphics in this game are not the best, but these graphics were good for their time, let me remind you this game was made in 2005. You can alter the graphics with various options from the menu which do improve the looks of this game. There are 10 enemies in this game. You may think they are zombies but they are in fact specimens, they are failed experimental clones. The 10 specimens are called the Clot, Crawler, Gorefast, Stalker, Bloat, Husk, Siren, Scrake, Fleshpound and the boss from the final wave - The Patriach. The clot is the easiest of the enemies but has the ability to grab you (unless you are a high level berserker), this can be bad in close quaters situations or when you are being swarmed. The crawler (as you can imagine it crawls) is a small black thing with multiple legs and its main attack involves it jumping at you, making it a hard target to shoot. The gorefast, is a red enemy who has a blade in one of his hands, if you let him get to close to you, he will rage and run at you super fast and he can do some serious damage. The Stalker is a female enemy who goes stealth and strikes you from behind, if succesful it can do alot of damamge. The bloat, is a big fat green/yellow guy and one of his attacks if vometing, this poisons you and deals you damage over time, not a long time but it can still be dangerous, he also soaks up quite a few bullets but if you get head shots on him and can be a quick kill. The husk has a husk fireball launcher (a weapon the pyro can buy), he shoots at you from far, but he still tries to walk close to you, if he gets close to you, he will use his melee attack and hit you. The siren is a female enemy who walks fairly slowly but get close to her and you wont hear the end of it, her main attack is screaming, this muffles you visition and does you alot of damamge at higher difficuilties, she should definity be one of the first enemies you try to kill if you are kiting. The scrake looks like a butcher with a hockey mask, he has a chainsaw and if you get to close to him, he will go into a rage mode and run really fast, he can be really deadly if you dont stun him. The fleshpound is the hardest and most deadliest enemy not including the final boss. Up to three fleshpounds can come at once which is really bad. Fleshpounds are much like scrakes or gorefasts, if you get to close to ther fleshpound he will go rage, he will go from the colour yellow, to the colour red and he will charge at you really fast, he also has alot of hit points. The final enemy is the Patriach, he is also the boss for the final round (other monsters also spawn on the final round while the patriach is healing). He has many attacks, he can shoot a rocket at you, he can shoot is arm gun at you, he can melee you and he can also go stealth (which he does alot). He will be in stealth alot but if you damamge him with a fire weapon you can see the flames moving around in the shape on him, which indicates to you where he is. He has alot of hit points and the best stratgy to kill him is to be the demolition class and place pipe bombs at the entrancers to doors, but make sure he cant see you are he will shoot and posibily detonate the pipe bombs. Co-op can be played with up to six other players, but if you play on modded servers i have seen one with up to 32 players. If more players join the game more enemies spawn and the enemies get slightly harder, but if you want to win some games and are not a very experienced player, i recomend to look for a server and play co-op to get use to the game. In co-op you can share guns with team mates and share money, by share i mean you drop them and then your team mates pick them up. You can not revive team mates so if you die you will spawn at the end of the round. Weapons are class specific, but you can find weapons scatered around the map along with ammo and if your lucky a vest. The weapons you buy will be cheaper if you are a higher level in the class you are playing as. Some weapons have an alternet shoot. For example if you have a medic gun you can shoot uneing the alternate shoot mode and if you shoot at a team mate you will heal them. Or as a berserker with melee weapons you can stun enemies, for exaple you can stun a husk by using the alternate attack. My final verdict for this game is a 9/10. It has amazing co-op, a deep class/perk system, a wide variety of enemies and guns, so many maps, maps on the steam workshop, the ability to play solo, 5 different dificulties, lots of achievments, a challanging boss (on harder difficulties), collectibles hidden within maps, different skins which you can buy or get from achievments, custom servers. All in all it is a great game and i totally recommend you buy it, or atleest watch a video to see if it peaks your interest :)			"

												Killing Floor has easily become my favorite game. While I've been playing it for awhile now, for me there is always something new to learn in respects of how to efficiently kill and yet also have fun. It's even better with friends to make the experience more memorable and enjoyable. Friends that kill together, stay together.			"

												   The point of the game is killing experimental monsters which takes place over many floors, so you could say the name says it all. But even with its lack of plot, I find Killing Floor to be a fun and challenging game.   In Killing Floor you play in first person, possibly with friends, fighting nine different kinds of specimens that roam the map looking for people to kill, becoming more numerous and releasing different specimens as the waves go by until waves 10 (if you are playing a full game) you encounter the boss, the Patriarch, who has the combined abilities of all the other specimens. Most of the regular specimen are easy to kill, with either a head shot or a shot close up with a shot gun blast to one shot them, but if someone yells Flesh Pound (FP), get some ground and prepare for a grinder.   There are seven different classes (called Perks), Field medic, Support specialist, Sharpshooter, Commando, Berserker, Firebug and Demolition which all specialize in different weapons and abilities. Also, The game has a leveling system, which varies between the different perks, mostly based off the weapons use. Such as the Sharpshooter building levels on head shots with pistols, rifles and crossbows. Having a higher level brings down the cost of weapons and increase their efficiency, which makes you start at the lower difficulties to work your way through the level to beat the harder difficulties.   Over all I love playing Killing Floor with friends and will keep playing for years to come.			"

												I don't even know why I haven't reviewed this game yet, despite having (Probably) spent more time in it than any other game in my library. Really, what else is there to say than, it's fun! Not just the game is good but so it it's community, in most cases. I recalled plenty of moments where after a wave I was short on cash, only to feel a smile tugging at my lips when a random person ran up to me and started throwing dosh at my face while yelling the game's characteristic “Loadsa moneh!”  There's beginner mode which is easy and can help any starting player learn the ropes, getting their first perk levels while chopping off specimen heads left and right, is there's one thing bad about it, is that from beginner to normal is such a huge jump, making the game suddenly feel rather, difficult for new players. It does however do well at making the players work together. Two people working as a team can wreak havoc in hard mode whereas six people that don't will only end up failing in normal. I like that.Every match can last anywhere from 3 minutes (If you die early) to 45 minutes (On long games) and whether you win or not, you'll still most often know that you made some progress levelling towards your next perk level.It will probably go on sale again this winter, and the monsters will all look their christmassy best again (They already do!) so if you have a bit of dosh. Get it, bring some friends, and get hunting!			"

Grab that dosh of yours and purchase KF! Of course, it all depends on the team you're with, as if you have people constantly screwing up (LIke people going off on their own a lot and constantly getting killed), it can really hurt your team, but.. The game is still really fun to play. I personally think Scrakes are hilarious to kill. =3=Just don't be a scrub by playing as a level 0 on any mode tougher than beginner.

												This game is pretty fun. Unfortunately, the fun ends when you aren't playing with friends, and the game doesn't have a lot of new things to offer after you've played it for a while. Of course, the implementation of special content, such as the recent 'Twisted Christmas Event' adds a bit more amusement, and refreshes the experience somewhat, but this isn't really a huge thing. Similarly, character pack DLC is a novel thing, but not enough to make the game 'refreshing.' Still, it's a nice little shooter, worth playing, and it's certainly grown since its humble beginnings as a UT2004 mod.			"

												I really love this game. Is it kind of a grind? Yea but if you really hate the grind, you can easily DL a perk leveler map and train your stats if it bothers you that much.Is this game repetitive? Sure but that's also a key factor which makes it great. You know what is going to happen but on the harder levels, the antsy feeling of running away and shooting or barricading yourself in somewhere never goes away and that's awesome.Really just a big sandbox game. A lot of fun without friends but if you have friends, it is way more fun. The teamwork you get on some servers to stick together and watch everyone's backs is awesome and hilarious. I put this game down sometimes because of how repetitive it is but I always come back for more. Hopefully Killing Floor 2 will just learn from the few mistakes this game had and make a better version.If i were to recommend a game that's wave-based, shoot-em-up with twenty-five or more guns that you use efficiently against armies of failed experiments that give you bounty cash when you kill them, so you can kill that in horrifically more brutal ways with better guns, as they slowly upgrade their army with bigger baddies until you fight an all-mighty boss that could rekt you without blinking, I'd recommend Killing Floor. Seriously, this game is my TOP FAVORITE, just because of how enjoyable it is. Yes, it may be old, and yes, it's not graphically impressive, but it's a damn good game. It has me STILL playing, even after hitting rank six with every class and gaining every annoying ♥♥♥♥ing achievement.Why do i keep playing? Because it's fun, and because my friends have/love it. Playing by yourself on Hell on Earth, doesn't compare to the simple mayhem of playing with 6, or 64 other players (depending on what player-based mods are installed.) And, if you don't like the original ZEDS, you can re-mold them with extremely well-done mods like the Killing Floor: Dead Space mod, or the Aliens mod, to fight more horrific creatures. Hell, they even have mods to make the game ALMOST like DOOM. There is weapon mods, character re-skins, maps, VEHICLES, and so many other amazing things. This game gets a 10/10, no matter how people string the BS. It's a great game, and has some amazing re-play value when you're trying new things out. Multiplayer is fun, single player is fun, and PLEASE don't say that popping a ZED's head of with a M99 ISN'T satisfying. 10/10 best zombie shooter genre game of 2009-2015 (KF 2 EA in april of 2015)			"

												This game is pretty fun. Unfortunately, the fun ends when you aren't playing with friends, and the game doesn't have a lot of new things to offer after you've played it for a while. Of course, the implementation of special content, such as the recent 'Twisted Christmas Event' adds a bit more amusement, and refreshes the experience somewhat, but this isn't really a huge thing. Similarly, character pack DLC is a novel thing, but not enough to make the game 'refreshing.' Still, it's a nice little shooter, worth playing, and it's certainly grown since its humble beginnings as a UT2004 mod.			"

												Killing Floor is one of the funnest games on Steam. I first played Killing Floor on a coworker's PC (Windows 7) ALOT, and recently played it on my laptop (Linux Mint 17.3 64 bit).PROS:+ Fun and frantic wave-based FPS action.+ Co-op mode stands shoulder-to-shoulder with L4D2.+ COD-like weapon load outs with the ability to trade off between waves.+ Tactical, squad based combat. Pick your class and be ready to aid your teammates in battle.+ Modest hardware requirements. Played KF on a ThinkPad T410 with Nvidia 3100M graphics and it runs smooth.+ Windows, Mac, and Linux versions all included.+ A steal at $20 and often on sale for far less.CONS:None that I can think of. The only microtransactions are for cosmetic stuff, a'la TF2.			"

												Killing Floor, to me, is one of the best co-op designed games I've played to date. The game brings out all the classic, well-known weapons of shooters into the mix. Killing Floor revolves and works around how many players are in the game (1-6) and each wave of enemies increases in numbers the further you get. The more people that are in the server, the harder the final Patriarch boss is to kill.The game has many classes and plenty of characters to choose from and you can level them up from 0-6 as you play them more frequently. If you're looking for a game that has all sorts of classes that master in almost any type of weapon out there, Killing Floor is the game for you. Perfect for when your only objective is to just kill things with your friends!			"

Intro Killing Floor is a Co-op survival Shoot 'em up were you have 10 waves of specimens (zombies) and you and your team have to simply survive and kill all the specimens. This is the hole game which seems like it will soon get boring after while but because its done so well you can play the game for hours at a time.Good Points One of Killing Floors best things is the replay value since you can play for hours at a time. There are a massive amount of maps to choose from, events such as Christmas and Halloween, 100s of Achievements and a massive amount of fun. These things put together makes great replay value. Guns is a big part in Killing Floor because you will always use them to shoot and kill every specimen you see. Its very satisfying and never gets old, there are loads of weapons to pick from so you cant get bored of them. The controls are simple in a good way, they are not very hard to get used to and you will know everyone after an hour. Specimens are really unique and they all have there own special abilities, there are 10 different types of specimens and thats not including the boss at the end. This always keeps the game play going and makes each game feel different. Killing Floor is a very challenging game to start off with, but as you play you will get better and start playing different difficulty which can be really hard. You will die a lot but that gives you more reason to keep playing because you want to beat the level. The length of the game depends of how long you want to play it. You can keep playing for a long as you want and most of the time you wont get bored. Some people manage to put 1000s of hours into Killing Floor and still play to this day. The price it worth it but its always on sale every couple of months so I would recommend waiting a little bit since you can save a bit of dosh. There are six different classes to choose from such as Sharpshooter to Firebug. There is a class that suits you which you can level up to get better at the class, this helps and keeps you playing. The Killing Floor community are really nice and will help you get Achievements as well as helping you in any other way they can. The game is over 5 years old and people are still playing in the thousands which is rare for most games.Bad Points As I said about the game being over 5 years old, this means the game may soon die within a year of two. As well and Killing Floor 2 coming out this means it will never be as big as it was. But its still worth the money for now since you will get enjoyment out of the game.OverallOverall I think that Killing Floor is a great fun game to play with friends and wont get boring, its considered a classing for PC gamers and is still great fun today. I would recommend this game to anyone who has Steam. I would give Killing Floor 9 out of 10.			"

												Killing Floor is an addictive (optional multiplayer) horde survival game, in which you are placed in an area either by yourself or in a group where you must kill a set amount of ""Zeds"" in a wave. Zeds are this games version of zombies, humans (the majority of which are actually clones) who have been experimented on in an attempt to create super soldiers. Although this is fairly cliche, what this game lacks in its story it certainly makes up for in gameplay, especially online. The game allows for a large amount of variation in gameplay, with different levelable classes/perks (of which there are 7) and different types of enemies (9 excluding boss) allowing the player to learn to use skills andenemy weaknesses wisely. This also allows the team to work together better, something which is required to survive in harder games. The game features some amazingly gory zed deaths, where you can explode zeds into tiny giblets with grenade launchers or pipe bombs, burn them to a crisp with the flamethrower, or slice their limbs off with a giant claymore. The real highlight of the game though is the zed-time, which allows you to view particularly grisly or skillful kills in slow motion. This is triggered through set kill types, or randomized ones if it doesnt happen for a while, and not only does it look cool but it also gives the team a few seconds to place better shots and therefore kill more zeds, giving the chance to extend the zed-time. The community for this game are also still very active, with steam workshop integration, and new items added to it all the time. This adds even more spice and variety to the gameplay, allowing you to do basically whatever you want. Overall, this game offers amazing gameplay, especially online. However, if you want to buy this game for achievements, look elsewhere. This game requires lots of playing hours to earn the majority of the achievements, which revolve around beating specific maps on certain difficulties and lengths. For anything else though, this game is top notch :)			"

												It's pretty good. Some protips.- Dual Handcannons are objectively the best weapon in the game.- The easiest difficulty is Hell on Earth, despite the scary name. If it is your first time playing look for the red skull emblem.- There is no benefit to levelling your perks, and using off perk weapons is not only better it's advise.- You should always attempt to 360 knife decap bloats, as any perk. Brownie points if Demolitionist.Using these tips you can go far!			"

												About Game:Killing Floor (abbreviated as KF) is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed and published by Tripwire Interactive. It was originally released as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod in 2005Gameplay:Killing Floor is a first person shooter, allowing each player to move through a 3D environment. Gameplay consists of two game types, in which the player fights waves of zombie-like specimens, with each wave becoming successively more difficult, until it concludes with a battle against a ""boss"" specimen, called the Patriarch. Players earn in-game money for each kill, as well as for surviving to the end of a wave. In the time between each waves, players can visit a trader to buy and sell ammo, armor, and additional weapons, such as katanas, pipe bombs, flamethrowers, shotguns, and so forth; the Trader's location on the level varies at the end of each wave, discouraging players from camping in one location. Weapons may also be found randomly across the level. Players are encouraged to work together; they can trade items and drop money, healing is more effective on other players than on oneself, and the team can strategically weld doors shut to provide a temporary barrier from the oncoming horde while funneling the other creatures to specific areas.Players select one of seven perks at the start of a match and between rounds. The perk, similar to the idea of a character class, provides bonuses towards certain weapon types, armor, movement, and other factors. Players can level up each perk to increase the benefits it offers. For example, the ""Sharpshooter"" perk, which provides accuracy benefits when using scoped rifles, can be raised in level by completing a number of headshots with specific weapons. The player does not need to play with that perk to raise its level; for example, the Field Medic perk requires the player to heal a number of points to level up, but this can also be done while playing any of the other perks.Players that die during a wave will drop their current weapon and re-enter the game at the start of the next wave, as long as at least one squad member survives. If the entire squad is wiped out, they will have to restart the game from the first round.Each game can be configured to alter the length and difficulty of the various waves. The number of creatures in the enemy waves are based on the number of players in the game, increasing in numbers if more players join the game in progress. All but the weakest enemies have some special attack that can inflict significant damage on a player. A feature called ""zed time"" awards particularly gory kills, such as headshots, with slow-motion, even in multiplayer mode.Plot:The game takes place in London, England. Horzine Biotech, a biotechnology company, is contracted to conduct experiments of a military nature involving mass cloning and genetic manipulation. Something goes horribly wrong during the process of the experimentations, and human subjects begin to exhibit grotesque mutations and disfigurement. They become increasingly hostile, and eventually overrun the internal security forces of the corporation.Hours later, the first waves of the specimens break out onto the surface, disrupting a peace protest outside the well-known military contractor. Despite the best efforts of local police, the civilians are quickly overwhelmed and consumed by the seemingly endless supply of clones now streaming from the gaping maw of Horzine Biotech's headquarter. Having escaped their sterile prison, the creatures began to fan out to neighboring areas, devouring the helpless citizens of London while the Metropolitan Police bravely but fruitlessly attempt to stem the tide of mutated flesh now spreading across their city.Desperate to contain the outbreak from reaching overseas as planned by the now mutated and cybernetic-enhanced scientist Dr. Kevin Clamely (which is now the Patriarch), the British government quickly begins to organize ragtag teams of surviving British Army soldiers and Special Branch police officers to fight back against the hordes of mutated ""specimens"" now running amok throughout the capital and its outskirts. The player takes the role of a member of one of these teams as they partake in a variety of missions in and around the city of London.My favorite and one of the best coop based multiplayer game ever! Make sure that you play with friends, fun is guaranteed!. Tripwire Interactive has done a great job with this game.Few events in year which include free maps is something that is rarely seen and a developer that is loyal to his fans!Loadsamoney!Money, money, money!Take some dosh!Money simulator 11/10Cant wait for Killing Floor 2 ^^			"

												Very fun, addictive and challenging wave survival game.The better your team, the better the fun.In Killing Floor, you band together with up to five other players to survive wave after wave of ugly clones who want to rip your face off. Pick one of the seven player perks (you can change yours per wave) for bonuses to things like healing and damage done. Buy weapons that will help fend off the fuglies. Weapons are 'aligned' to perks and will be more effective when playing that specific perk!Killing Floor is regularly updated by Tripwire Interaction with new maps, weapons, achievements and player models in the holidays, to give people a reason to keep playing.

												Personally, when I started this game I expected more, based on its sample images and opinions I had heard: graphics, environments and monsters feel outdated for today's standards and not in a good way as with cult-classic games like Doom (it does originate from an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod after all), however the more I played it the more it grew on me!If I had to say what makes this game good, since I still stand my ground regarding what I said above about its overall feeling, I would name 3 things: weapons, achievements and online co-op fun!The variety of weapons in this game is amazing, maybe the greatest I've found in an online game, you can really find many kinds of modern and old, existing or non, weapons (maybe it's a bit lacking if you are expecting many futuristic or alien-like weapons, like the ones in Halo, Doom 3 or Unreal Tournament, but its array of ""traditional"" weapons is really impressive), with new weapons being added each year as DLCs.The achievements, much like the weapons, are not only many and fun to obtain, but increase each year with the so called ""events"" (there are mainly 3: summer, halloween and christmas), periods in which specific achievements can be obtained, adding to the replay factor.Last but not least, at heart Killing Floor remains a fun co-op game, while maybe not as fun and popular as the Left 4 Dead games, killing monsters with other real players is always a nice experience!

												Very fun, addictive and challenging wave survival game.The better your team, the better the fun.In Killing Floor, you band together with up to five other players to survive wave after wave of ugly clones who want to rip your face off. Pick one of the seven player perks (you can change yours per wave) for bonuses to things like healing and damage done. Buy weapons that will help fend off the fuglies. Weapons are 'aligned' to perks and will be more effective when playing that specific perk!Killing Floor is regularly updated by Tripwire Interaction with new maps, weapons, achievements and player models in the holidays, to give people a reason to keep playing.

												My friend gifted me the vanilla copy of this game two years ago. And I still play it to this day. I love this game; And I love this franchise. This game has meant the world to me. I've made so many wonderful and lasting friendships with this community, and various players I've met through my two years of service. :3 With over 683 hours into this game. I still find myself wanting to come back for more. The gameplay is simple to understand. You fight through ten waves of enemies; with each wave, increasing in enemy population, and difficulty. Then the eleventh wave is the boss wave. You are given a wage for every enemy you kill, and for each wave you survive. After each wave, you are given a minute or two to run to the trader, and procure more crucial supplies like ammunition, body armor, and progressively better weapons. There are 7 playable classes (or perks as the game refers them) with their own tactical advantages, disadvantages, and tier based weaponry. They all play a part in aiding the team in surviving the hordes of zeds that you will be facing. There are 10 (11 if you play on custom servers) different enemy types with their own advantages, and disadvantages. After a while, the enemy scripting becomes REALLY easy to exploit. But this has never bothered me. I've always enjoyed cutting a bloody swathe through hordes of zeds with my guns, and my friends :3 The graphics by today's standards arent enough to really wow anyone. The gameplay and community has always been this game's strong suit in my mind.This game has always been a staple in my library ever since it was gifted to me. And it recieves my personal seal of approval.  I hope that this review has helped you in your purchasing decision, or reassured you of the purchase that you have just made. Thank you for your time, and I hope to see you on the Killing Floor!!Iajibagoa; Signing out.//Edits made: Removed emotes that didnt show up in original version of review.			"

												Definitely recommending this game. Grab a few friends, hop in to a same server and just start shooting everything that attacks you.Killing floor offers a Great deal of fun in the shape of killing a lot of different types of mutated beings.It has a wide variety of weapons and classes, leveling up a class requires you to do certain things (eg. Sharpshooter needs to get headshots, Medic needs to heal), classes are well varied, every class feels unique and has their own weapons (Every gun is still possible to buy even if you're playing a certain class, but the class bonus' do not apply to other classes weapons).Game feels good, overall the movement is fluid, and getting that headshot on a bloater to blow up it's head feels awesome.Difficulty is easily adjusted, easy feels easy, and Hell on Earth offers a great deal of challenge.The game is also very well modded and it offers a lot of content on top of the classic game's content,DLC's are also a thing, they offer more weapons, if you're not satisfied with the defaults. I myself don't own any DLC, so I cannot give a proper review on that, but as far as I know, they are not considered overpowered.Overall, I prefer the First Killing floor over the second one, if you're not too bothered by ""lower"" graphics, I'd definitely give it a go.

												Great game to kill zombies in a coop mode with your friends, you have variety of zombies, you play in different rounds ""waves"", increasing the difficulty (between waves you have time to buy weapons)even a last level with the ""Patriarch"" who starts saying ""what have you done to my children"", very funny hahaha. There are also some other modes.From time to time, while playing it makes a slowmotion effect that is very exciting.And the maps are good too, I really like westlondon and steamland (steam-punk style). I don't kno why, but i never can find my friends who are playing the game in the friends list on the menu, i have to follow or invite them via steam.Wish it had also female characters for free for i always have to choose one with a mask because i like to play as a woman.I do recommend this game : ))))			"

GoodKF has this magic charm that takes Half Life graphics and hilariously bad voice-acting and uses it to build a grindhouse game atmosphere instead of detracting from it. Punchy, powerful weapons, fast gameplay against powerful specimens and a lot of diverse, sprawling maps. Tons and tons of modded servers. BadKF's been criticized for really slow progression and a ""Perk"" system that makes a low-tier player useless compared to a high-level one. This means you'll have a terrible time if you get into a server on Suicidal or Hell on Earth somehow as a low-level perk, and probably kicked.DLCA few reskin guns and slew of cosmetic ones, you also get content from Portal, and some TWI products like Rising Storm or Red Orchestra 2 if you also own them.Worth?Call it a $10 game. Comes for free with KF2 deluxe.			"

So it isn't quite a horror but a good survival action game, with lots of maps and acceptable graphics. "

												Bloody great fixed and revamped retail version of the UT2004 Co-operative survival horror mod developed back in 2005. Set in possibly near future, in London, where a military contract project to create super soldiers goes wrong and the unfinished clone mutants have laid waste to everything in their way..What's good:The gunplay..oh MAYN the gunplay. Excellent gunshot noises, they sound simply such that they never get old, there's sharp reports and then there's more pew type for some weapons, all sounds fit their weapon. Also reload sounds are nice, almost no stock sound effects, and even where there is those, they are modified so it's fine with me. The TWI made reload sounds are great, not any overly sharp or crisp cheesy clatter etc..Also animations are fluid, the weapons have a fittingly harsh recoil, not realistic yes but who the f*** wants realistic guns in KF? Also the weapons shake your vision nicely, gives a nice harsh physical feedback into firing your guns..alright let's not write a book.Specimen visual designs and their behavior, all of them have some kind of purpose to help and murder those damn survivors for once. They look suitably scuffed, grimy and some a bit grotesque and quite intimidating. Some of them are still pretty much human but others are full on cyborg mutants and have proper body horror and look disfigured. So their behavior then..so as I said all of them cooperate with their complementary to each other tactics, for example Clots aren't that bad even in groups but if they grab you you're in for a bad time because the bigger muties can get to pummel and bash you unhindered or simply a swarm of lesser specimens might overpower you. And Husks prevent players from being safe by simply staying away..those ♥♥♥♥ERS will no doubt at some point remove a good chunk of your precious armor and deal over the course of a few seconds a moderate dent to your health. Bloats can massively impede a readily panicking player from aiming properly and seeing what's going around themself. Crawlers often finish a lone terminally injured player who was just about to get some distance and continue fighting.Great level variety, some of them almost solely outdoors maps, some a good 50/50 mix of outdoors and indoors, both viable camping areas. Also there are night time, evening etc maps and some with quite somber weather. Some have very nice vertical axis variation too!-Proper weapon variety in each class, in some classes though it's rather damage per second difference vs. one shot damage. But a weapon with high DPS vs one hit power suits some purposes better. -Pretty good gore system for being in 2004 era game engine. Same gore effects apply to both players and the specimens I may add. Dismemberment can happen, at the limb joints and of course neck, leaving visible bone and roughly torn flesh and blood spraying too. The next level of gore is that a specimen either loses half of all his limbs or simply gets turned to small chunks and red mist which looks endlessly satisfying as a Demolitions. So yeah pretty nice gore, it can be quite terrifying to see your player get torn to pieces by a Fleshpound's pummeling.-Raw soundtrack, most of it badass Industrial by zYnthetic, and then a smaller bunch of action tracks are more standard metal. Fuels your rampage suitably. At downtime there plays some well done ambient music, pretty much all of it too by zYnthetic.What isn't good..-Removal of the great weather effects and ambient sounds in the maps Westlondon, Manor, Bioticslab, Offices. In the mod version 2.5 atleast, these maps had amazing atmosphere.-The slight lack of voicepack variety, could have been like 4 different voices or so. I do like the voice acting though, it's silly and not all too good but in a charming way. "

												I've always maintained that a game had to either be really creative(on story, game mechanics, art, or the like) or have a really high budget to be successful or fun. Killing Floor completely disproves both. Co-op zombie survival in waves with breaks in between to purchase weapons isn't new. In fact, this type of game could be considered to be the antithesis of creativity, as it also has absolutely no unique features whatsoever. The game looks like it was created by a 12 year old with Unity assets over the course of a week. The graphics are absolutely horrendous(just like many other games, it looks worse than on the screenshots), the physics are awkward, the sounds are bland and the UI isn't any better. Nothing about this game would make it seem worth buying.So why can't I stop playing Killing Floor? Why can't any of the other 96% of people who recommend this game to others, for that matter? I don't know. Buy the game and see for yourself- clearly there must be a reason, no?			"

So yeah pretty nice gore, it can be quite terrifying to see your player get torn to pieces by a Fleshpound's pummeling.-Raw soundtrack, most of it badass Industrial by zYnthetic, and then a smaller bunch of action tracks are more standard metal. Fuels your rampage suitably. At downtime there plays some well done ambient music, pretty much all of it too by zYnthetic.What isn't good..-Removal of the great weather effects and ambient sounds in the maps Westlondon, Manor, Bioticslab, Offices. In the mod version 2.5 atleast, these maps had amazing atmosphere.-The slight lack of voicepack variety, could have been like 4 different voices or so. I do like the voice acting though, it's silly and not all too good but in a charming way. "

												I've always maintained that a game had to either be really creative(on story, game mechanics, art, or the like) or have a really high budget to be successful or fun. Killing Floor completely disproves both. Co-op zombie survival in waves with breaks in between to purchase weapons isn't new. In fact, this type of game could be considered to be the antithesis of creativity, as it also has absolutely no unique features whatsoever. The game looks like it was created by a 12 year old with Unity assets over the course of a week. The graphics are absolutely horrendous(just like many other games, it looks worse than on the screenshots), the physics are awkward, the sounds are bland and the UI isn't any better. Nothing about this game would make it seem worth buying.So why can't I stop playing Killing Floor? Why can't any of the other 96% of people who recommend this game to others, for that matter? I don't know. Buy the game and see for yourself- clearly there must be a reason, no?			"

												Killing Floor is one of my favorite non-Valve games on Steam. I'm not going to bore you with this whole in-depth analysis about the game, but I will say this: Like any co-op-based game, it can be made or ruined by the people you play it with. If you play it with friends- or get lucky and meet a lobby of nice folks- then the game will shine like gold.			"

												Bloody great fixed and revamped retail version of the UT2004 Co-operative survival horror mod developed back in 2005. Set in possibly near future, in London, where a military contract project to create super soldiers goes wrong and the unfinished clone mutants have laid waste to everything in their way..What's good:The gunplay..oh MAYN the gunplay. Excellent gunshot noises, they sound simply such that they never get old, there's sharp reports and then there's more pew type for some weapons, all sounds fit their weapon. Also reload sounds are nice, almost no stock sound effects, and even where there is those, they are modified so it's fine with me. The TWI made reload sounds are great, not any overly sharp or crisp cheesy clatter etc..Also animations are fluid, the weapons have a fittingly harsh recoil, not realistic yes but who the f*** wants realistic guns in KF? Also the weapons shake your vision nicely, gives a nice harsh physical feedback into firing your guns..alright let's not write a book.Specimen visual designs and their behavior, all of them have some kind of purpose to help and murder those damn survivors for once. They look suitably scuffed, grimy and some a bit grotesque and quite intimidating. Some of them are still pretty much human but others are full on cyborg mutants and have proper body horror and look disfigured. So their behavior then..so as I said all of them cooperate with their complementary to each other tactics, for example Clots aren't that bad even in groups but if they grab you you're in for a bad time because the bigger muties can get to pummel and bash you unhindered or simply a swarm of lesser specimens might overpower you. And Husks prevent players from being safe by simply staying away..those ♥♥♥♥ERS will no doubt at some point remove a good chunk of your precious armor and deal over the course of a few seconds a moderate dent to your health. Bloats can massively impede a readily panicking player from aiming properly and seeing what's going around themself. Crawlers often finish a lone terminally injured player who was just about to get some distance and continue fighting.Great level variety, some of them almost solely outdoors maps, some a good 50/50 mix of outdoors and indoors, both viable camping areas. Also there are night time, evening etc maps and some with quite somber weather. Some have very nice vertical axis variation too!-Proper weapon variety in each class, in some classes though it's rather damage per second difference vs. one shot damage. But a weapon with high DPS vs one hit power suits some purposes better. -Pretty good gore system for being in 2004 era game engine. Same gore effects apply to both players and the specimens I may add. Dismemberment can happen, at the limb joints and of course neck, leaving visible bone and roughly torn flesh and blood spraying too. The next level of gore is that a specimen either loses half of all his limbs or simply gets turned to small chunks and red mist which looks endlessly satisfying as a Demolitions. So yeah pretty nice gore, it can be quite terrifying to see your player get torn to pieces by a Fleshpound's pummeling.-Raw soundtrack, most of it badass Industrial by zYnthetic, and then a smaller bunch of action tracks are more standard metal.

 Killing Floor  Unfortunately I recorded too long in this game. The production is very cool and you can play it for many hours as long as you have friends with you. Playing alone does not make sense and the community is not so cool as it sounds. After that, the game offers a large amount of weapons and characters ofcourse just as we buy dlc's then we will get it. Official maps are pretty cool, and if you are bored then you can play on the maps created by other players. Killing Floor is definitely one of the better cooperative games.  "

												Killing Floor tells the story of Booker T. DeWitt, a private detective hired to investigate the kidnapping of Dosh by an ancient race of sentient machines known as ""The Reapers"". The ""Reapers"" live underground and use emergence holes to access the world above. Aided by his old friend Victor Sullivan they must retrieve an item known as the Cintamani Stone in order to fight an invasion by a terrifying parasitic alien horde known as The Flood. The game Stars Bill Cosby as the voice of The Fleshpund and a musical score by Michael Buble and performances by the cast of smash hit broadway musical 'Cats'.Killing Floor is a quirky, indie romp with a fantastic performance from Ellen Page as Mr. Fosters love interest.I heartily recommend this game to anyone who loves 2d sidesrolling platformers			"

												Killing Floor is an intense RPG/FPS that can take minutes to get into but hundreds of hours to become proficient at.  The game offers 5 difficulties, the lower of which you can be comfortable playing alone but the higher difficulties demand exceptional teamwork in order to overcome the grisly odds.  Seven different perks that grow in power as you level them up to six times allow you to choose the type of destruction you wish to bring to the mutant freaks.The combat includes anywhere from one to six players and the more people you have on your squad the larger the force and the bigger the healthpool of the opposition.  The menace you attempt to best with your buddies is as diverse as they are deadly.  Wave-based gameplay gradually introduces you to the specimens while giving you time to save up your dosh for spending at the games rather formidable armory.  While the game is four years old the developers still release brand new content for the game on a semi-regular basis, with seasonal updates that reskin the specimens you fight into hilariously creepy incarnations.  New characters, new weapons and new maps await even the veteran players every few months.			"

												For those who have trouble with the servers, I came across something. If you would like to play with friends, it seems the only option is to play in ""internet games"" on multiplayer and choose a server made by another user. If you'd like to make your own, that's going to be more complicated and it does not work for me or my friends at all. That's a bit of a con, hopefully this issue will be solved soon.Overall, pretty good game. I don't know what life is anymore.			"

Only problem I have is that this game can sometimes really get quite damned hard, but Killing Floor is no doubt a game that folks who love guns, gore, and the British will adore.8/10 - Great.			"

												You kill zeds (zombies) for gore, perks and weapons. The more gruesome are the kills, the more money you get. Money means weapons, ammo and armor. So, this game rewards you for brutality. Which is kind of cool thing for a shooter. Cooperation, correct weapon choice and reaction speed are critical to succeed at this game, more than in any other. I think, after KF, you will be better at any shooter.KF also supports Steam Workshop content. And there are DLC characters, you can either buy or unlock by achievements.The downsides are a rather complicated interface, slow perk progress and outdated graphics quality.Nevertheless, the game offers a decent amount of fun for some time, especially when played with friends. It starts to feel repetitive after you have played all the maps and modes, which aren't that many actually. A content for 3-7 evenings, perhaps, until you've tried everything the base game has to offers. Don't see much point of buying DLCs, though, which basically are pretty guns and pretty characters.I recommend to get KF on sales. 5 € well spent. KF is one of those games you return to from time to time.My overall rating: 7/10.			"

												If there's one thing I admire, it's a developer supporting their game long after release.  Killing Floor has been updated with content (a lot of it free) so often that Tripwire Interactive is one of my favorite developers.  But enough about them, let's talk about the game.Killing Floor is a mutant (not zombie and you will be stoned if you refer to them as zombies) survival game.  The premise is that an experiment has gone wrong, mutants emerge, blah blah blah, you've heard it before.  We're not here for the story, we're here for the guns and the killing.  Though one interesting bit about the backstory is that originally it was the military and police dealing with the mutants, but now everyone is in on the fun.  You have DJ's wielding katanas, a guy in a chicken suit, santa clause, and even the pyro from Team Fortress 2.The game takes place in the UK, with hilariously over the top stereotypes for each person.  From the accent to the forms of swearing, you'll find yourself spamming in game commands just to hear all the things they can say.You'll find yourself in various locations.  The game does support custom maps, but the maps Tripwire have made themselves are amazing as well.  You'll find in labs, carnivals, and even the ruins Aperture Laboratory.  Some have gimmicks like elevators and what not that will allow you to escape from the mutants.Speaking of mutants, there are tons of mutants.  You have the Clot, your standard peon.  Be aware of it's grab though, it'll root you in place.  The Gorefast is an upgraded version that can run, but also possesses a longer attack range.  The Stalker can turn invisible and the Crawler jumps around.  Both are easy to kill though.  There are your fat zombies, Bloats, who not only puke on you, but will also explode in a shower of puke when you shoot them too much in the torso.  You have Sirens, mutants in straight jackets that will scream, disabling your grenades and doing pure health damage.  Husks will prevent you from camping by shooting fireballs at you.  Now for the big ones, for which you will need big guns.  The Scrake has a chain saw, get him to half health and he'll charge you.  Same with the Fleshpound, but more frightening.  With two spiked gloves, he'll become enraged and chase you.  At the end of every game, you'll face a Patriarch, armed with a chain saw and rocket launcher to cover the distance.  Get to close and he'll smack you.  Do too much damage and he'll run, turn invisible and heal.  So how do you kill him?  Keep pounding him with all you got and don't give him time to rest.Of course, to help you kill all these things is a vast arsenal.  You have assault rifles, shotguns (pump, semi, and fully auto), handguns, smg's, snipers, explosives, and even make-shift weapons.  Supporting you are also perks.  Like to blow stuff up?  Equip the demolition perk.  Shotguns are your thing?  Equip the Support Specialist perk.  There's a perk for everyone.TL:DR - Horde style survival game, played best with friends (up to 6 people, more can be supported with mods).  May get repetitive, but if that's the case, maybe you should try a map other than West London.			"

BUY.IT.FAST!Killing Floor is an Horror-Co-op Shooter in a post apocalyptic scenery. You play in Multiplayer with a group of 5 (max) other players. Choose your weapons, your tactic and your friends - and do it fast!Its wave based with stronger enemies spawning each wave and concludes with a final boss wave. Weapons are perk based and perks can be leveled persistently trough playing.For ME, it is the best Co-op game on STEAM. It isn't the holy apple - it has also some bugs or problems and the graphic is meh. But, it is addictive as hell (with a good team).++ very good Co-op based game++ huge variation of weapons, maps and characters++ always up to date++ lots of DLC++ high gore and blood factor (uncut version)++ if you play ""Suicidal"" or ""Hell on Earth"" - IT IS SUICIDAL OR HELL ON EARTH++ perk / level system - classes have unique roles, pros/cons, levelling is addictive++ events (christmas, halloween, summer..)+ many achievements+ nice sound effects and slow motion+ skill based+ doesn't get old or boring+ makes fun with or without other players!I love this game, but...- no telled story or campaign- DLC are expensive...one character for 3,99€!?- hasn't the nicest physics or graphic (but it's still ok!)- about 10 zombie kinds...not so many- got killed by evil creatures, not the floor...- should've learned something these 400 hours...""Killing Floor"" - Thank you. 9,5/10 "

												Right, where do I start?Killing Floor is a Survival Co-op, wave based game that was originally a mod for Unreal Tournement 2004. The goal is to survive the waves by killing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Killing♥♥♥♥♥♥earns money which then can be spent at the trader in-between waves for guns, ammo and armour. The game revolves around a perk system, players can pick a perk that can be helpful (or detrimental) to the team. Each perk usually has positives and negatives to using them. For example, Beserkers get up close and personal to hack and slash specimen and can soak up bits of damage. The Field Medic keeps the team alive by healing them via syringe injections and have very durable armour so can soak up damage if needed. Firebugs are great at crowd control by setting groups of specimen on fire to deal damage overtime and to slow them down and so on. However the perk you choose is not set in stone, you can switch in-between waves during trader time and also it sometimes helps to have off-perk weapons in some cases.The game is greatly optimized, it can play on most toasters with ease and comes with so many graphical options that even puts Twinnings teabag varieties to shame. The learning curve can be steep, I would advise playing on easy or normal difficulty to start with to get used to the mechanics. Most harder difficulty games (Suicidal and Hell On Earth) often require higher perk levels, practice makes perfect.Perhaps the main thing that keeps me coming back to this game is the modders. Modded servers are a whole new ball game with the inclusion of content such as maps, perks, specimen and weapons. The amount of new content on some of them are so extreme that you may not want to ever go back to stock. You have been warned!!!!With over 2.5k hours invested in the game so far, this is easily the game that I play the most and for a good reason.			"

												My very first steam game. I remember when this game only had 4 maps and hardly any weapons. Now the game has  over 100 maps and many weapons. The developers are active and have many more games, and they still update and give the community more stuff every month/year  This game is simply well put together and till this day is very active!ProMap sizes are bigClasses determine how well you can handle the weaponSteam workshop modswaves of zombiesCan loan teammates money			"

												Are you bored of staying in one spot for 10 minutes straight, with hordes of zombies rampaging at your front door and with little ammo to spare?You've come to the right place. Kill specimens. They're not really zombies, we just like mutating things and hope for the best. Although, we did create this... abomination, and it's currently pinning us down with a big♥♥♥♥♥chaingun and this large rocket launcher. Oh, he said something for once in clear English, something like ""One in the pi-""Still reading this? Want an actual review of this game? You've come to the next right place. Grab your pistol, give drugs to people, get dosh, buy weapons, survive, buy more weapons, experiment, melee things to death, it's got it all. With Killing Floor 2 coming out next year, and this week's update, this game cannot die. A good handful are still playing it daily, and you can even play by yourself.More of a strategy, if you're playing by yourself, any perk can be the best, even Field Medic. ""But I'm not healing anyone!"" you say. It's cause you gain awesome abilities by running as fast as a berzerker. Oh yeah, berzerking ravaging through fleshpounds with a claymore sword, we got a badass on the field.Now if you were playing with friends, now we need communication. A six player team can be done properly, if people are very good at this game, like a skilled elite of the FBI or something. Still, this game's got what it worth, and multiplayer is unforgetable.10/10			"

												The soundtrack is kickass, the shooty stuff is fun, the gore is satisfying, the game delivers a challenge on single player and online Co-op, and the Zeds? I prefer mine splattered. Killing Floor is a nice, british Action-Survival FPS with experimental mutants that aren't zombies, but they sure as hell are mowed down and fall apart like them. Only problem I have is that this game can sometimes really get quite damned hard, but Killing Floor is no doubt a game that folks who love guns, gore, and the British will adore.8/10 - Great.			"

												If there's one thing I admire, it's a developer supporting their game long after release.  Killing Floor has been updated with content (a lot of it free) so often that Tripwire Interactive is one of my favorite developers.  But enough about them, let's talk about the game.Killing Floor is a mutant (not zombie and you will be stoned if you refer to them as zombies) survival game.  The premise is that an experiment has gone wrong, mutants emerge, blah blah blah, you've heard it before.  We're not here for the story, we're here for the guns and the killing.  Though one interesting bit about the backstory is that originally it was the military and police dealing with the mutants, but now everyone is in on the fun.  You have DJ's wielding katanas, a guy in a chicken suit, santa clause, and even the pyro from Team Fortress 2.The game takes place in the UK, with hilariously over the top stereotypes for each person.  From the accent to the forms of swearing, you'll find yourself spamming in game commands just to hear all the things they can say.You'll find yourself in various locations.  The game does support custom maps, but the maps Tripwire have made themselves are amazing as well.  You'll find in labs, carnivals, and even the ruins Aperture Laboratory.  Some have gimmicks like elevators and what not that will allow you to escape from the mutants.Speaking of mutants, there are tons of mutants.  You have the Clot, your standard peon.  Be aware of it's grab though, it'll root you in place.  The Gorefast is an upgraded version that can run, but also possesses a longer attack range.  The Stalker can turn invisible and the Crawler jumps around.  Both are easy to kill though.  There are your fat zombies, Bloats, who not only puke on you, but will also explode in a shower of puke when you shoot them too much in the torso.  You have Sirens, mutants in straight jackets that will scream, disabling your grenades and doing pure health damage.  Husks will prevent you from camping by shooting fireballs at you.  Now for the big ones, for which you will need big guns.  The Scrake has a chain saw, get him to half health and he'll charge you.  Same with the Fleshpound, but more frightening.  With two spiked gloves, he'll become enraged and chase you.  At the end of every game, you'll face a Patriarch, armed with a chain saw and rocket launcher to cover the distance.  Get to close and he'll smack you.  Do too much damage and he'll run, turn invisible and heal.  So how do you kill him?  Keep pounding him with all you got and don't give him time to rest.Of course, to help you kill all these things is a vast arsenal.  You have assault rifles, shotguns (pump, semi, and fully auto), handguns, smg's, snipers, explosives, and even make-shift weapons.  Supporting you are also perks.  Like to blow stuff up?  Equip the demolition perk.  Shotguns are your thing?  Equip the Support Specialist perk.  There's a perk for everyone.TL:DR - Horde style survival game, played best with friends (up to 6 people, more can be supported with mods).  May get repetitive, but if that's the case, maybe you should try a map other than West London.			"

												You kill zeds (zombies) for gore, perks and weapons. The more gruesome are the kills, the more money you get. Money means weapons, ammo and armor. So, this game rewards you for brutality. Which is kind of cool thing for a shooter. Cooperation, correct weapon choice and reaction speed are critical to succeed at this game, more than in any other. I think, after KF, you will be better at any shooter.KF also supports Steam Workshop content. And there are DLC characters, you can either buy or unlock by achievements.The downsides are a rather complicated interface, slow perk progress and outdated graphics quality.Nevertheless, the game offers a decent amount of fun for some time, especially when played with friends. It starts to feel repetitive after you have played all the maps and modes, which aren't that many actually. A content for 3-7 evenings, perhaps, until you've tried everything the base game has to offers. Don't see much point of buying DLCs, though, which basically are pretty guns and pretty characters.I recommend to get KF on sales. 5 € well spent. KF is one of those games you return to from time to time.My overall rating: 7/10.			"

												This game is a once in a while game. As person, who netted around 1500 hours in this (I had an account hijacked). I am essentially a vet of this game, I joined in October of 2013, I played around in single player, being afraid of fleshpounds and the patriarch I seldom played it. Eventually after watching SSoHPKC play this game it inspired me to play it a lot more. I was 14 turning 15 and this game was my birthday money well spent. It's amazing, its fun, the music is brutal and grindy as are the steampunk(esk) graphics. IF however, you have not bought this game, two things, What in gods name are you waiting for and, please unless youre a left and remapped your controlls, its 'Q' to heal your self, 5 and click to heal others, Caps lock to voice chat and Right Click to aim down sights; and as a personal favor to yourself so you don't seem like some greifing piece of dung, please do NOT play HARD, SUICIDAL OR HELL ON EARTH AS A LEVEL 2!Please don't do those things and play it at your own pace. I love newbies that are fun and tenacious but no one on earth likes the scrub that shoots the Fleshpound on HOE as a level 2 medic and dies and complains that it's everyone elses fault, its not only annoying but very unsportsman-like, with all that said, this is a masterpieces baby <3.With love,The guy who changes his name every weekRabbit			"

												A little gem for some mindless killing fun or either a challenging horde fighting game to do with some friends or strangers, or simply by yourself, with the goal to survive many waves of monsters, until you and your teammates are the only living thing left in the map, with each wave getting tougher as more of these monsters will appear, together with stronger and nastier kind of them appearing as you progress in the game.The player will be given a character provided with the basic pistol and basic melee weapon in the game, and as soon the game starts you will be able to use these weak weapons to kill the first handful of monsters. As soon as you've done with this first wave, you will be given the way to go to the Trader, which will sell you many more and way stronger weapons that you can use, instead of your standard cookies and milk. Based on what ""Perk"" are you going to use, which is the skill level with a certain category of weapons that you can decide to specialize into, such as being better at using shotguns, assault rifles, or being better at healing or at using melee weapons, you will be given a wide variety of weapons that you should be supposed to use, but you can anytime change the kind of weapons you want to use, or completely change the Perk you're playing with. Each of these Perks will also give you a particular role in the game that you will easily find out just by playing it, which is also the way to improve said skills.There are a total of 9 kind of monsters you can encounter during a full game, each with many skills and characteristics meant to pose the players a certain kind of threat based on how dangerous these enemies are, with one last final one that is meant to be the ""boss"" of the game, the stronger of them all and your final goal to beat the game.In a summary this is the game, which can sound pretty simple and easy, but by playing in harder difficulties you will find out that it requires much strategy depending on the perks you and any of your teammates are playing, by the kind of enemies you have around and the situation you're in.It may be a pretty old game and may have lots of DLCs, which are almost all cosmetic characters or weapons while just 2-3 are actually different weapons, but these aren't that great and is usually better to stick with the ones present for everyone in the game.It's as of today a pretty fun game where many people are still playing on the servers, even with the new KF2 out.If you like a decent good old game that has also a workshop for some game modding that adds some variety to the game, and also runs smoothly even on the oldest computers, you've come to the right page.

												With KF2 going straight to hell, KF1 is still #1 brainless meat shooter, especially on modded servers.It's still alive and still kicking.Bought it on release and never doubted my choice.I only wish I could say the same about KF2..			"

												Awesome Coop-game, it is still fun even after years of playing it. It used to have a rock-paper-scissor-like approach, whith each class having unique strenghts and weaknesses making the game very teamplay-demanding. Those were the great time of KF, very hard to beat on the highest difficulty level with a lot of knowledge and teamplay required to make it through the map. Unfortunately, the Devs removed the classes`weaknesses and now every perk can kill every zed and team selection doesnt matter anymore. But it stil is a lot of fun to play and there will be still some challenges for newer players but the veterans will need to play on modded servers like ScrN-Hardcore. Every PC-gamer should definitely have this game in his library!			"

												Welcome to my review of Killing Floor. Now, I could go on and on with some boring review, but why do that when I can just be straight to the point?This here is Killing Floor. This is a game where you, to great surprise, kill things. In fact, you kill a lot of things. To be honest, I hope you like killing things, because that's this game's primary feature!Not entirely 100% positive what the things are? Don't worry, because we aren't either! Before you know it, you too, will be mindlessly firing the portable killing machine of your choice beside others who share your newly obtained urge to fire weapons at mutants without questioning the logic of why you're a military operative sent against mutants with nothing but a Beretta M9, a knife, a welding tool, and a healing injector that magically recharges over time!What do you do? Simple! You kill things. Once you're done killing things, you get weapons from the money you got from killing things so you can kill more things and earn MORE money to get BETTER weapons to kill more things with, until you finally kill enough things to get to the big thing called the patriarch. By then, hopefully your squad of originally highly unprepared, lighthearted, talkative british soldiers will have killed enough things to get powerful enough weapons to stand a chance against this final mutant! What happens when you win, you ask? You do it all over again! Astonishing, correct?How do you get weapons? Like any fully-unprepared squad of six brits would in an apocalypse! You trust a completely legitimate travelling mercenary who has no affiliation with the army, that conveniently manages to travel from shop to shop for absolutely no reason since it's all within the same small area, without ever having to fight any of the mutants you're facing! We should also note that she is the only living person in the game aside from your squad, so it's your job to make sure that you clean out these completely decimated areas so the people that don't live anymore can be free!But killing things with portable killing machines is just not enough! The game uses a class system. Now, I could use the actual names, but who needs names to confuse people, when we're already throwing logic out the window?! Lets just use fancy, informative descriptions!Our fabulous classes include:Brits who shoot things with automatic weapons and can see invisible women.Brits who heal people with the same automatic weapons they kill things with, while tanking damage like no one else ever could.Brits who burn things.Brits who blow things up.Brits who blast things with shotguns and carry more than anyone else.Brits who snipe enemies from afar and fail to realize pistols are actually powerful in this game.And lastly, Brits who run really fast and use melee weapons to attack the enemies that are also primarily limited to melee attacks!Should you play long enough to level a class up really far, the queen will smile upon your efforts and no longer send you in with just a Beretta M9 and a knife to fight with on the first wave - instead, she will provide you with a weapon for your class that is significantly more useful! In addition, levelling up causes the goddess of guns to bless your firearms that match your class with improved firepower! No, she doesn't give you new kinds of bullets, or modifications to the guns, they just magically obtain greater potential! It makes perfect sense if you don't think about it, and why would you?! Your thoughts should be focused on killing mutants, you bloody fool!But make no mistake - this is NOT a first person shooter! No, this is in fact a killing simulator. That's right, a killing simulator! You aren't just shooting these mutants, it's up to you whether or not you take limbs off their torsos, blast their heads off, decapitate them, burn them alive, or blast them to little bits! Be creative with how you kill mutants, just don't give them the opportunity to be creative as well!Need more guns? Of course you do! That's why there's three weapon pack DLCs! Don't like DLCs? No problem! Turn to modding, and make Killing Floor's battles into an even bigger massacre than they already are!So what are you waiting for? Throw away your logic, bring your friends, lose your social life, and get to slaughtering mutants over and over, because who needs reasons anyway?!			"

												(Just a small, positive review)This game is the reason I hopped on Steam almost 4 years ago.A truly unique experience with perfect teamplay elements!It has a round-based system in which the game works, you need to survive each round, kill high priority enemies before taking down the smaller ones. And the harder modes would definitely require you to use tactics - which can be ruined by selfish/inept people though.For each enemy & round you complete, you get money which you can then use at the trader to buy weapons, armor & grenades - they are discounted based on how high your specific class is.At the end of the round you will fight the Patriarch, a boss that can be quite dangerous if the team doesn't coordinate well or doesn't have the right classes to fight/distract it.(Also, I made a lot of Steam friends via this game!)I'd recommend playing Killing Floor before getting Killing Floor 2, since this game was the basis on which Killing Floor 2 was based - which is a great game, in it's own right.Personal score: 7.5/10Best regards,Dukhat			"

												I find Killing Floor to be a very impressive survival based co-operative shooter, it is very simple and easy to understand and for players to connect with. The gamplay itself is very good with 6 varied classes for players to try with different strengths to allow players to have a well rounded team to tackle the hordes with. I find the visuals to still be good even though the game runs on the now old unreal 2 engine, the animation for things such as reloading is also very smooth and creative and is on par and often better than modern released games like Battlefield and Call of Duty in my opinion. The game is especially fun when played with friends or even a good team that you may meet on various servers, but it can be equally fun to be played solo every once in a while. The game itself also has lots of difficulty setting allowing for new players to take it easy and hardcore veterans to still be challenged. The developers of this game are also very supportive and still release updates adding new content in events such as ""Twisted Christmas"" and ""Summer Sideshow"" which is always nice to get continued support especially this long after release. Overall: 80/100			"

												I bought this game with the internship of letting my eight year old son learn about interior design but instead he got a large number of men from australia complain about how much money they have. I don't care if you are from a predigious background or not it is just rude to wave your money in someones face just because you can afford more guns and bullets. There was a man who threw his money in the air but he caught it before i could and then had the nerve to ask what i was doing. we were then rudely interrupted by a man with no flesh who killed the first man. overall it is a great tool but i think there could have been more emphasis on textures (there are only like three) rather than having lots of dead policemen with no skin killing rude people with money. I know a lot about this because I was in #occupy 2012 and it was really cold but i perversered because i am trying to make the world a better place and make all the rich people give me some because i have worked so hard and my eight year old son can't even design the layout of my new kitchen. If i ran this game then i would make it so that the guns can shoot the complaining australian men too which i think was the whole point of #occupy and isn't that what we're all fighting for???			"

												Killing Floor is an FPS Zombie Killing Game that gives you 6 different perks to choose from. Once you have chosen a perk, you can switch anytime in between waves of the current game or while in the lobby. The game is kind of like Horde from Gears of War or Firefight from Halo 3: ODST in being that you fight against waves of enemies and then against a boss at the end of the last wave. You get to level up each perk to a maximum of 6 levels and with each level, you get really cool benefits. At the end of each wave, you can buy weapons/armor/grenades from this shop that opens up at random locations throughout the map. There's only a certain amount of time to shop and the higher the difficulty, the less time..this means that if you're far away from the shop before it opens...you're screwed! Overall, this is a really fun game, it has excellent gameplay and gore, and it's worth the buy!			"

British Metal Zombie Killers  TL;DR Killing Floor is a Fantastic wave based shooter with challenging gameplay , humorous dialogue and a head banging soundtrack. You and 4 teammates will be pit against the bowels of hell as an array of monsters come to tear your nipples off. Using specialized classes with the weapons you purchase you will help each other to survive by strategic placement or running around like lunatics, that have been given to much sugar.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Fast pacedGreat Co-op experienceRocking SoundtrackEasy for NewcomersCons Lacking a variety in gameplayNo storyLevels do not change any gameplay---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayIn Killing floor choosing a class sets your playstyle for the match, your either going to be running around and keeping you distance or participating in fisticuffs. The game has very little strategy involved other than find a corner and only kill the last zombie when you’re at the merchant. Even though There are numerous types of monsters and weapons, you’ll find yourself buying the same guns every game, the game sadly can become repetitive in its gameplay. Characters While there are no actual characters with a full-fledged story, the dialogue is delightfully British and witty, with funny quips and spammable taunts. There are roughly 100 character skins to choose from , most are just silly military skins but others are refrences like the tf2 pyro. Art/Graphics Killing floor has that gritty film look and it pulls it off so well , with the dark environments and array of characters and monsters. The small maps usually follow a theme and they all give off a feeling of horror.There are many character models to choose form and variants of the monsters, Yet they all seem to fit nicely in the level themes, Even the Christmas ones are very well made.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

												So I decided to redo, this review as my old one was 'Yes, Killing floor is the best' i thought that didnt give enough reasoning for people to buy the game but that was back in 2014 and nows 2017so let me review this product from the top of my mind as i havent played it for awhile, well this game provided some fun for 14 hours, now i would say its pretty glitchly and does have alot of bugs, i would recommend mods and also playing with friends as it gets very boring alone, i quit this game after Killing Floor 2 came out and this game stopped reciving updates, if you go to get any Killing Floor game get Killer floor 2 but if you already have that then, i do recommend buying this game, just for the kind of V1 style and feel the og killing floor.Hopes this help some of you out			"

												One of the FPS games on Steam that I'd seriously recommend. It's fun if you're playing casually on Normal or Hard, but if you want one hell of a challenge, try Suicidal or Hell on Earth difficulty. Game is pretty repetitive, but with 7 classes to choose from it makes the game fun. The more you use specific weapons, the more you'll rack up experience for those corresponding classes. The game is extremely fun to play with friends, and practically everyone on Steam either knows about this game or owns it. I'd highly recommend this game to practically everyone. Also, they have events in the Summer, Halloween, and during Christmas.			"

												(updated review 12/26/2014 [review made more serious])(updated review 6/15/2016) [thoughts on Killing Floor 2])9/10+7 different perks+a lot of different weapons+Heavily team based+difficulty scaling based on # of players+customizable game difficulty/length+9 different types of zombies+boss at the end of every set of waves+few seconds of slow motion after killing a zombie sometimes+challenging+mod support+you can choose between 4 different types of zombies. Hillbillies, sideshow acts, christmas icons, or the regular zombies. (requires editing of internal file)-repetetive-game is very hard starting off-no updating anymore-quite a bit of DLC-may be a little bit glitchyAt the time of this review being made, Killing floor 2 has been announced, and is basicly going to be a better version of killing floor. I would recommend buying Killing Floor 1 (this game) on sale if possible.Edit: At the time, killing floor 2 isn't a good game. Too many bad design choices have been made to kill things that made the core gameplay what it was. I'm still hoping KF2 will rise to be even better than this game, but that's happening reeeeally slowly. So for now, this is the better game, and I still recomend picking it up.and one last thing.

												I bought this game with the internship of letting my eight year old son learn about interior design but instead he got a large number of men from australia complain about how much money they have. I don't care if you are from a predigious background or not it is just rude to wave your money in someones face just because you can afford more guns and bullets. There was a man who threw his money in the air but he caught it before i could and then had the nerve to ask what i was doing. we were then rudely interrupted by a man with no flesh who killed the first man. overall it is a great tool but i think there could have been more emphasis on textures (there are only like three) rather than having lots of dead policemen with no skin killing rude people with money. I know a lot about this because I was in #occupy 2012 and it was really cold but i perversered because i am trying to make the world a better place and make all the rich people give me some because i have worked so hard and my eight year old son can't even design the layout of my new kitchen. If i ran this game then i would make it so that the guns can shoot the complaining australian men too which i think was the whole point of #occupy and isn't that what we're all fighting for???			"

												Killing Floor, a very good zombie game which is actually fun to play it with friends online. It shows you a different way of what zombies are. Here zombies are not just some infected people which you need to kill and with that you're done. No! Here zombies are powerful creatures. And also don't forget the level system which is quiet awesome. Kill zombies and get higher level!If you like zombie and action games, this game is just for you! This game has many DLC'S which all are new characters, new or golden guns and stuff like that. If you are really going to get this game, buy the whole Killing Floor Bundle because sooner or later you're going to ask for those DLC'S because ofcourse with those the game is more enjoyable.My rate for this game: 7/10			"

												If you like killing zombies, you'll like this game. When I first got it the loading time was slow but now it loads speedy. It's not like your average zombie game because you get money when you kill them and you buy weapons when the ""waves"" are over. The only thing I don't like about the game is how sometimes the zombies get lost and it takes forever to find them. Still, it's a great game that never gets old.			"

												Killing Floor is an FPS zombie Shooter.  It's generally a multiplayer game but the game let's you play solo by setting up a server where no other players can join, so effectively you get single player OR you can play with friends coop.  The game starts with you facing down the first wave of zombies.  During this wave, you must slowly find your way to the shop keeper so you can upgrade your gear (weapons, items, etc).  The shop keeper is somewhere on the map and there's an arrow in yur HUD pointing in the direction of the next shop.  If you clear a wave then a red trail appears showing you exactly where the shop is.  You can customize for more waves by selecting a longer game.  Each wave is kept track of in your HUD, with zombie and wave count.There are items like guns and ammo available for pick up around the map.  The weapons available at the shop aren't bad but generally, if you've opted for the DLC then you have a bigger choice of weapons to use.  Weapons basically have a cumbersome/weight factor so you can't carry everything you want for each wave of zombies.  There are varrying zombies that do several things so depending on what you're facing might depend on what loadout you choose. When you have zombies firing missile launchers in your direction, you may opt for the body armor.The graphics aren't bad for an old game... but it is an old game so you're dealing with an old graphics engine no matter how much DLC you add to your initial game.  There's several unique zombies and creatures that are pretty creative in their gore factor. Headshots have that slow motion action feel to them adding to the eye candy effect a bit.  There is quite a following of the game and there's even new DLC every so often that include maps and unique character sets with tons of achievements to farm for.  There's plenty of maps and the better you know the map, the better you play.  Incidentally, there's no mini-map so you REALLY have to know the map for longer survival and shop locations.  My only real problem with the game is that you can't run.  If you're used to playing COD or some other FPS where you can just take up a sprint... not here.  The game will let you slow down to a walk though.  I'm assuming for better aim as you're moving and firing at the same time.  I'm a fan of Tripwire games so this is right in there as a classic fave.  It's an old game but I'd still recommend it ON SALE... with the DLC on sale.  You can get multiple DLC packages and the game itself super cheap when there's a sale.  Looking forward to Killing Floor 2 for sure.			"

Awesome class / character progression system to fit multiplayer or singleplayer roles. Several different zombie types keep the game interesting. There's also a wide variety of unlockable guns and DLC guns for each class.I'm also a big fan of welding doors shut to temporarily hold off the impending doom. The difficulty levels are great in case the game gets too easy (or hard). I definetly recommend this game if you like survival / apocalypse shooters.			"

												KIlling Floor isn't just your average FPS.  Improving your stats, and not to mention, surviving the game takes a lot of patience and even more teamwork.  The replay value is high thanks to Perks (character classes) that take an incredible but worthwhile amount of time to level up, a wide range of weapons to experiment (or toy!) with and different maps.  A good deal of knowledge about the game mechanics is necessary to make it through the extermination runs, but that's where friends come in handy.  When playing with a team you can trust, then win or lose, the experience is just amazing!			"

												Simply put, if you enjoy First Person Shooters, Survival Games, Co-op, or horror, you will LOVE Killing Floor.This game sports a variety of weapons, each designed for a ""Class"". When you start a match, you can choose a Perk, making you suited for a role (ex. Medic, Support Specialist, and Commando), you can change the perk at any time though, and you level up the perks gradually, helping you face harder difficulties (which you can select at any time). As a team, or alone, you face waves of genetically modified clones, that each have unique traits (for example, one type can cloak, another can walk on walls and leap far distances). At the end wave, you fight a ""Boss"" of sorts, that has a rocket launcher on its shoulder, and a chaingun for an arm. Yeah, it can be as hard as it sounds. That's how a standard match goes, but as of late, objective based maps have also been introduced, and the Developers make special events for holidays and seasons, and also update things just for the sake of supporting the game, and adding new stuff. You can also shake things up a bit with mods, which you can easily get on the Steam Workshop. Mods include maps (which can have objectives or special things like acid floors, for instance), weapons, character models, and even unique gamemodes, like one that is directly based on the Aliens franchise. Overall, I would say that it is a very addicting game with extensive support from the developers and the community. It is also fairly cheap, and honestly, it is not much of a risky buy, because it is honestly just so addicting (coming from a FPS lover).			"

												First of all I would just say that Killing Floor (KF) is a very good game if you are looking for somehting to do when you are bored or just want to kill some monsters.  Positive GraphicsGameplayMany mapsMultiplayer Negative Class balanceHigh level requirments (level 5 and up)So lets talk about why I think all those things are positive and negative. The graphics are looking good and really fits this type of game without feeling strange and missplaced. When it comes to the gameplay I think that the monsters are balanced and there is always a challenge in trying to win but ofcourse that depends on what difficulty you are playing on(!). There is alot of map and plenty more to be downloaded that have been made by others, you will not get bored easily with all these maps. The multiplayer works really well and does almost always work without any problem, sometimes some friends have trouble joining the server even when there is no problem from our side but hey that does not happen often so no point in complaining to much about it.So why do I think that the class balance is bad? For example the berseker can run around and 1-hit most of the monsters without breaking a sweat while other classes have to shoot like a madman to kil them. But that also depends on where you shoot. Also the bonuses each class get when they reach level 5 is kinda unbalanced. The medic gets a body armor while others gets weapons that are worth more, that is not really nice but still a body armor is atleast something. When you reach level 5 as a medic you have to heal 2.5x the amount you have healed to reach level 5 just to get to level 6 which is a big leap. It takes a while depending on how much you play but I guess that they don't everyone to reach the high levels so fast.			"

												theres mods, theres guns, theres co-op, theres events(only if you got the game in 2010 or 2011, but they have maps in the workshop for that), theres over the top trailers, and theres♥♥♥♥♥loads of DLC the doesn't matter because its mostly skins and characters. This games has all you could want. CO-OP.The co-op is fun because theres so many maps to mess around with friends, family, you name it. its almost almost fun. There is almost no way to get board, unless you grind for hours on end getting wled points for support then your perks dont save (has happend to me D:)MapsSome maps are harder than others, (Hell and westlodon are pretty hard, while mountain pass, and moon base are relitivly easy) i personly like Workshop maps and closed corders maps the best.Zedszombies, speicems, what ever you wnat to call them, theres some common ones and some hard ones.GunsMy favorite, theres medic guns that can heal others, WAY too OP shotguns, rilfes, pistols, assalt rifles, battle rifles, lots of melee, fire stuff, exsplosives, and much more. If you see my screen shot of moon base, they've not removed the Z.E.D gun and you can still get it.The Storythere isn't really a sory to this game, but there still is one. Horazine has mad spesemens and they were releasted from their under ground lab from the Horazine staff. Then scowering over most of west london and killing every thing in their path. You must stop them, life or death.Over allThis game is probly if not the best mutiplayer zombie/suvival horror game I've ever played and probly will play. I wuold give it a 15/10 flesh pounds. (unless your damned perks dont save and ur lvl 2 again after grinding for hours)			"

												A really good zombie FPS. The graphics are very good so is the audio. There is a variety of zombies and most of them are a pain in the butt if you don't have a suitible weapon. There are a lot of DLC's so better get a bundle on sale. The gameplay is good there are waves and in every wave more and more zombies come to eat your flesh. There are difficulties and they make the game even harder because more zombies come and they are also harder to kill. Here's a piece of advice: there is one achievement which unlocks you an overpowered axe so better get it. I recommend this game it's really fun and also get another copy for your friend. With friends its always better. Rated 10/10			"

												Ahhh, Killing Floor, where do I begin?Back during the christmas steam sale of 2013 my friends and I decided to get this game when it went on sale. Back then we just thought, hey it's a multiplayer game, and it looks pretty cool. We never thought we would sink as much time into this game as we have.It used to hang at the initial load up screen for ages, but even then it worth the 2 minutes of black screen to wait to play this game, the gameplay its self is addictive and enjoyable, the leveling system is a bit too high on the grinding curve if you ask me, once you get to level 4 in the different classes it just drags. I am stoked to see what the next game will bring to the table.Also, what is up with the dialogue, specifically with the trader? Why does she say things like;I like the big ones, don't you?The shop is open, boys; come get me!They're all dead! It's time to go shoppin'!Come and get 'em! Lovely big guns!I'll tool you up, just right.4 of the 5 of those dialogues are definitly spoken with a naughty overtone of sorts, i'm not complaining by any means, at this point its a great joke between my friends and I quoting her and laughing. Anyways, you won't regret getting it, and I am looking forward to Killing Floor 2.			"

British Metal Zombie Killers  TL;DR Killing Floor is a Fantastic wave based shooter with challenging gameplay , humorous dialogue and a head banging soundtrack. You and 4 teammates will be pit against the bowels of hell as an array of monsters come to tear your nipples off. Using specialized classes with the weapons you purchase you will help each other to survive by strategic placement or running around like lunatics, that have been given to much sugar.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Fast pacedGreat Co-op experienceRocking SoundtrackEasy for NewcomersCons Lacking a variety in gameplayNo storyLevels do not change any gameplay---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayIn Killing floor choosing a class sets your playstyle for the match, your either going to be running around and keeping you distance or participating in fisticuffs. The game has very little strategy involved other than find a corner and only kill the last zombie when you’re at the merchant. Even though There are numerous types of monsters and weapons, you’ll find yourself buying the same guns every game, the game sadly can become repetitive in its gameplay. Characters While there are no actual characters with a full-fledged story, the dialogue is delightfully British and witty, with funny quips and spammable taunts. There are roughly 100 character skins to choose from , most are just silly military skins but others are refrences like the tf2 pyro. Art/Graphics Killing floor has that gritty film look and it pulls it off so well , with the dark environments and array of characters and monsters. The small maps usually follow a theme and they all give off a feeling of horror.There are many character models to choose form and variants of the monsters, Yet they all seem to fit nicely in the level themes, Even the Christmas ones are very well made.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

Perhaps you prefer to chop heads left and right?  Or do you simply love to make it rain dosh everywhere you go?  Killing floor has it all, with endless waves of horrifying foes, a wide variety of maps, weapons, and classes, and a healthy competition between your teammates that will have you striving to not only survive, but shine on the scoreboard.  Tripwire even provides periodic updates and holiday events with special achievements and Zed models to keep things fresh.  Cooperate to survive, or style on your teammates by taking on the horde solo.  The Zombie Apocalypse is now!			"

												This game... This mind blowing, goretastic Flesh addict slaying game... This is tied with COD WAW Zombies for the whole ""Survival"" feel.This review will be separated into 3 categories.Graphics: 7.65/10  Although not as pretty as some would expect, the graphics feel right for the theme and are fairly good for the timeframe it was released.Sound: 8/10 The soundtrack is eerie to say the least and although I prefer to have heavy metal playing as I stupidly chainsaw fleshpounds, I still love it.Gameplay: 9.5/10 The shineing feature, The coup' de grace. The single most fun part. From slow-motion headshots, to knifeing a horde, to even Deryl'ing the stalkers it is fun as hell. Final verdict: 9.0/10 Although I admit to being biased due to how much I love this game, I just see it as being good.Good enough to make me give it a serious review. Which means I just have to do this.NotExtinction/10 - Treyarch			"

												(Edit now includes : decent grammatic improvements, less bias, less bloat bile, totally different review.)Killing Floor 1 was one of my early steam games, so I had to do it a bit of respectful justice and give it a cleaner review.There's a lot to be said about this game, so get your reading glasses on, and prepare yourself for the hate you'll dish out to me later for the waste of time. The Good Holy hell this was an addictive game for me, it ran beautifully even on cheap flimsy laptops that were nowhere near up to par for gaming, yet you could run it on ultra on good pcs' and end up loving it to pieces that way as well.The Classes were unique right down to the core, spare Combat Medic and Demolition for obvious reasons, their bonuses made you feel like each class had a whole different set of playstyles as well as strengths/weaknesses to them, along with the fact they had a heartwarming discount to their own class-based weapons.The maps were extremely varied, from small london towns, to giant bleak and nuclear fallout-esque forests. There was no ground that wasn't contaminated by Horzine's horrible creations. The Bad The enemies for the most part are somewhat generic, and feel a bit ""Clonelike"" in design, and I'm not saying that because they're literally clones. The only enemies that truly stood out to me in both design and abilities in the field are : the Fleshpound, The Scrake, and the dreaded Patriarch.The Fleshpound being the least original, in my eyes atleast, because he'll eventually enrage at either not seeing you for so long, or for seeing you for so long, I forget exactly how he was Kited in this game. (If you're unsure what I mean about kiting, or even care to want to know, please don't ask, just look at a guide for Killing Floor and you'll find it easily.)The scrake being the middle point, not only is he big, bulky and terrifyingly quick for someone his size, but he also has a unique damage enragement system, where he will only become enraged at around 50% hp, this meant for team co-ordination not to hit him until the trash was cleaned up.and the horrifying Patriarch, I will have to leave him out mostly since this is already a huge rambling mess, but this was the creator of the Horzine's horrible mistake creations, and he decided to test his experiments on himself as well, and mounted a gattling gun onto his left arm, as well as an RPG for a massive munitions system.The only other bad thing, was no character was really unique to themselves, they either felt the same as the next guy, had the same voice all around, or just never really felt like they were worth going out of the way to buy/earn. The Ugly One of my issues with Killing Floor, that may be up to the community to debate over, was the last year of Tripwire supporting this game, was mostly microtransactions that gave very unattractive weapons, or characters with unusually bad gimmicks, such as leaving a fake trail of dosh around whenever you walk. I'm not usually up for microtransaction hate since it's very petty to hate an optional piece of content, but I will admit they dicked over the community from the last year of KF and onward, ignoring the complaints and even banning some people over voicing their disagreements to them, Tripwire is a very hostile company as of late and if you want to buy their dlc or support it then cheers, but just remember that they're not as nice/mean as people think, they're simply looking to protect their investment and make revenue off of it. Overall Impression While I love this game to bits and pieces, there is definitely an elephant in the room that urks me personally, and that's unfriendly customer support and/or community responses.If the company decides to add dlc, you should decide if Your money is worth it not anybody else's, and nobody should be banned over thinking Tripwire's not exactly doing their job right, because agtain in reality they're not exactly saintlike.All in all I still think this game is a 8/10 game, it's good and has a lot of potential for good times, but there can be a good few repetitive issues to it that you may, or may not enjoy.

												An amazingly fun wave based zombie shooter. Teamwork is encouraged on Normal and essential on Hard and up. The community is decent for the most part (unless you join a Hard or harder game using a Level 0-1 perk, that will definitely irritate people). The perks are diverse and encourage different weapon use and gameplay style. It received more than 20 additional maps and countless patches since release (believe that's over now that Killing Floor 2 is out). Events during Halloween and Christmas were always a blast with themed Zeds to kill and timed achievements to earn.			"

												theres mods, theres guns, theres co-op, theres events(only if you got the game in 2010 or 2011, but they have maps in the workshop for that), theres over the top trailers, and theres♥♥♥♥♥loads of DLC the doesn't matter because its mostly skins and characters. This games has all you could want. CO-OP.The co-op is fun because theres so many maps to mess around with friends, family, you name it. its almost almost fun. There is almost no way to get board, unless you grind for hours on end getting wled points for support then your perks dont save (has happend to me D:)MapsSome maps are harder than others, (Hell and westlodon are pretty hard, while mountain pass, and moon base are relitivly easy) i personly like Workshop maps and closed corders maps the best.Zedszombies, speicems, what ever you wnat to call them, theres some common ones and some hard ones.GunsMy favorite, theres medic guns that can heal others, WAY too OP shotguns, rilfes, pistols, assalt rifles, battle rifles, lots of melee, fire stuff, exsplosives, and much more. If you see my screen shot of moon base, they've not removed the Z.E.D gun and you can still get it.The Storythere isn't really a sory to this game, but there still is one. Horazine has mad spesemens and they were releasted from their under ground lab from the Horazine staff. Then scowering over most of west london and killing every thing in their path. You must stop them, life or death.Over allThis game is probly if not the best mutiplayer zombie/suvival horror game I've ever played and probly will play. I wuold give it a 15/10 flesh pounds.

												(Edit now includes : decent grammatic improvements, less bias, less bloat bile, totally different review.)Killing Floor 1 was one of my early steam games, so I had to do it a bit of respectful justice and give it a cleaner review.There's a lot to be said about this game, so get your reading glasses on, and prepare yourself for the hate you'll dish out to me later for the waste of time. The Good Holy hell this was an addictive game for me, it ran beautifully even on cheap flimsy laptops that were nowhere near up to par for gaming, yet you could run it on ultra on good pcs' and end up loving it to pieces that way as well.The Classes were unique right down to the core, spare Combat Medic and Demolition for obvious reasons, their bonuses made you feel like each class had a whole different set of playstyles as well as strengths/weaknesses to them, along with the fact they had a heartwarming discount to their own class-based weapons.The maps were extremely varied, from small london towns, to giant bleak and nuclear fallout-esque forests. There was no ground that wasn't contaminated by Horzine's horrible creations. The Bad The enemies for the most part are somewhat generic, and feel a bit ""Clonelike"" in design, and I'm not saying that because they're literally clones. The only enemies that truly stood out to me in both design and abilities in the field are : the Fleshpound, The Scrake, and the dreaded Patriarch.The Fleshpound being the least original, in my eyes atleast, because he'll eventually enrage at either not seeing you for so long, or for seeing you for so long, I forget exactly how he was Kited in this game.

												Visceral. Brutal. Gory. But I think that the word that describes Killing Floor the best is satisfaction. Every single kill is a shot of adrenaline as you pump your shotgun and take aim at the next freaky mutant victim. When played with a bunch of friends, it becomes a real challenge without becoming too repetitive. Plus, with above-average graphics, stellar performance and special events through out the year, there's really no excuse for those Clots to keep their heads.			"

												This game is easily one of the most enjoyable zombie killing shooters currently available.Even more than a year after release it is still being supported by its developers, receiving upgrades and new content on a regular basis.The graphics engine might be slightly outdated and the teamplay oriented frantic gameplay is probably not suited for everyone, but with that low price tag and all the additional content available through the community (i.e. whitelisted maps), this is a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in the zombie horror apocalypse genre.

												All I have to say about this game is DO$H! Grab it while ya' can! But in all seriousness, this game's pretty fun with friends, and can be hard from time to time even with a full experienced party. It's a game that can hold it's weight even in 2014. My favorite part of it would have to be the soundtrack. The story doesn't seem very interesting (if you can actually manage to find it. Most of it is in the map descriptions) and the gameplay, while better than Left For Dead in my opinion, is basically just an FPS with passive abilities that make every player a little different from one another (except Berserker. No one can play melee class other than Berserker since that passive damage resistance is necessary). This game gets a 7/10 from me.			"

												Defently a great game to pass the time! This game reminds me a lot of Call of Duty zombies but has an interesting perk leveling system. I would have to say that the gameplay gets stale fast because it is so repetitive, but with the Steam Workshop there are countless maps,weapons and other random bits to play with.Also comes with amazing british voice acting!

												Killing floor is a great game to play with friends. It is also a money hole for DLC, which is why I find it so hard to recommend. I bought this game when it was fairly new. I didn't mind so much when they added skins because I didn't feel like I needed to buy them but the weapon DLCs hit my loyalty to this game pretty hard. All in all I do recommend it if you want a fun game to play with your friends but don't be surprised if you feel a little under-appreciated as a customer later.			"

												This is a surprisingly addictive coop, fps, wave-based, zombie survival.Unlike most games Killing Floor simply acknowledges that it is a game. There are multiple types of zombies with their own unique abilities, but not anything special. The game has a good variety of guns and maps, and a perk-based leveling up tree. The amount of achievements is off the wall. With over 250 of them, it's very hard to get bored of this game.Now, the only down side to all of these happy notes. DLC. $8 a pop for nothing but a retextures. $8 for a 4-pack of player models, that do nothing but change the way you look. $8 for a 4-pack of golden weapons that are the same as their in-game equivalents. The only thing that may be col is the community weapons pack, but even for a crossbow that shoots rotary saws... Not worth $8.BUT, that's not an in-game problem, SO BUY KILLING FLOOR NOW!			"

												Killing Floor, a very good zombie game which is actually fun to play it with friends online. It shows you a different way of what zombies are. Here zombies are not just some infected people which you need to kill and with that you're done. No! Here zombies are powerful creatures. And also don't forget the level system which is quiet awesome. Kill zombies and get higher level!If you like zombie and action games, this game is just for you! This game has many DLC'S which all are new characters, new or golden guns and stuff like that. If you are really going to get this game, buy the whole Killing Floor Bundle because sooner or later you're going to ask for those DLC'S because ofcourse with those the game is more enjoyable.My rate for this game: 7/10			"

												Killing Floor suffers from lack of polish, but does resemble a fairly decent coop survival shooter with subtle RPG elements. The game fundamentals are solid even with the lack of continuity by chasing down a trader for gun and ammo purchases between hordes of zombies. For casual players, the RPG elements are much too serious a grind to reach maximum level. The developers continue to put time and effort into keeping the game popular and fun with sales events and new DLC. It's not all that fun to play by yourself, but certainly plenty of entertainment for you and your mates together.			"

The zombies are balanced and the weapons in the game are perfect. This game is trully all about teamwork, BUT if you get good at this game you can save your team from losing the whole thing....believe me when I say this: your heart will be pounding. There is nothing like thinking you are safe and then turn around to see the biggest, baddest, and most angry Zed come rushing towards you roaring. This game is great to play with family members and the more people the better. Get this game. Seriously.			"

												This game is easily one of the most enjoyable zombie killing shooters currently available.Even more than a year after release it is still being supported by its developers, receiving upgrades and new content on a regular basis.The graphics engine might be slightly outdated and the teamplay oriented frantic gameplay is probably not suited for everyone, but with that low price tag and all the additional content available through the community (i.e. whitelisted maps), this is a must-have for anyone even remotely interested in the zombie horror apocalypse genre.

This games has all you could want. CO-OP.The co-op is fun because theres so many maps to mess around with friends, family, you name it. its almost almost fun. There is almost no way to get board, unless you grind for hours on end getting wled points for support then your perks dont save (has happend to me D:)MapsSome maps are harder than others, (Hell and westlodon are pretty hard, while mountain pass, and moon base are relitivly easy) i personly like Workshop maps and closed corders maps the best.Zedszombies, speicems, what ever you wnat to call them, theres some common ones and some hard ones.GunsMy favorite, theres medic guns that can heal others, WAY too OP shotguns, rilfes, pistols, assalt rifles, battle rifles, lots of melee, fire stuff, exsplosives, and much more. If you see my screen shot of moon base, they've not removed the Z.E.D gun and you can still get it.The Storythere isn't really a sory to this game, but there still is one. Horazine has mad spesemens and they were releasted from their under ground lab from the Horazine staff. Then scowering over most of west london and killing every thing in their path. You must stop them, life or death.Over allThis game is probly if not the best mutiplayer zombie/suvival horror game I've ever played and probly will play. I wuold give it a 15/10 flesh pounds. (unless your damned perks dont save and ur lvl 2 again after grinding for hours)			"

												Started playing during the Christmas event. The Gorefasts were gingerbread men. I ran out of ammo as the horde of gingerbread men closed in on me, I pulled out my knife and managed to kill a few, as I cut their heads off they said ""Eat Me."". I was terrified in my last moments before the horde chopped me to bits. 10/10 Would kill gingerbread men again.			"

												Não se enganem pela aparência tosca desse jogo. É um dos melhores jogos que eu já joguei!Os gráficos, animação e as vozes podem repelir ao primeiro olhar, mas todas as características básicas que fazem esse jogo um excelente shooter estão lá. Animação do recarregamento das armas, o equilíbrio das classes dos personagens e suas aplicações táticas em cooperação são fenomenais.Jogo extremamente divertido. Não há nada mais emocionante que enfrentar o Patriarca.			"

												Guys BUY Killing floor it is worth it. It is the best game in the world. Do you like left for dead well this is 4 times better. You can play it over and over and over but never get bored because every game has a different ending unlike left for dead all you do is get from checkpoint A to checkpoint B and kill some zombies on the way. But killing floor has like 10 different types of enemys THAT appear all the time not once in awhile. Sadly though it is $20 so save up and buy it.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: OK review above ^ isnt too good..... was younger and dumber then and just loved the game so much at first that i throw out a quick review. Now the game dosent really change all the time like said above i mean sure there a different maps and 9 basic enimes that show up at increasing difficulty, then a boss at the end of all the waves. This game is WELL worth the money i spent i have almost 100 hours logged which sure isnt 1,000 like some but isnt something to sneeze at either. Graphics are decent arent to hard core but nice (espically some of the player created maps they are really gorgeous) Overall i would easily give it a solid 8.5/10 great game no doubt about it i HIGHLY recommend grabing this there are events every Christmas, Summer, Fall, and Halloween which keep it going after all these years after release (i believe dont quote me on that ;)  ) Good luck out there survivors.

												Alright, even though this game was made in '09, has graphics that would make make a grandmother have a stroke, AI that, in comparison to other games that were released in the same time frame, were clunky and irrational most of the time. Also included is a server browser system that has been known to drive people to insanity.Few games have given me more enjoyment than Killing Floor.The game is very simplistic in its objective: See zombie, shoot zombie, get paid, buy bigger guns, repeat. Even though this may seem boring while you sit there, in your ""gaming chair"", waiting for your next game of Dota 2 to load, it really isn't. There is nothing more enjoyable and suspenceful than playing with a group of 5 friends (the game allows 6 people in standard servers), everyone dying but you on wave 10 on suicidal, out of ammo against 2 fleshpunds and about 30 other Zeds.The gameplay is very enjoyable, especially on higher difficulties, like suicidal or HoE (Hell on Earth), where teamwork is absolutely essential for survival for all 10 waves. There are 7 perks, each has its own ablilities (like the Berzerker, which does bonus melee damage) and uses for helping your squad survive the onslaught of horrific freaks you're up against. The maps are varied and requie you to shose your perks accordingly, depending on if its a day or night map, or open space or tight corridors. The goal of Killing Floor is to survie all 10 waves to get to wave 11, which is the main freak leader himself: the Patriarch. If you kill him (no mercy allowed), your squad survives. If all of you die in the course of 1 round, you lose. At the end of each round, any dead players respawn, but only if there are still surviving players.Tripwire has done a very good job of keeping players in the game durring its 5 years of release. They have done special events, such as The Twisted Christmas Event, or Hillbilly Horror (Halloween). Also, a steady drip of new maps, characters, and    guns have fallen into the hands of eagerly awaiting fans, most of which are given freely, or in-game achievement unlocks. Even though there are several packs of guns only available through paid DLC, they do not affect game ballance in the least, but only serve to vary gameplay and team tactics. Also included is the complete is a very extensive set of  od tools, allowing useres to create vurtually anything they want with the game; now that Killing Floor has Workshop, a hwole new relm of content has been opend to players.Over all, this game has kept me satified for over a year, as well as Tripwire gaining my respect for thier devotion to their playerbase. Alright Tripwire, time to bring Killing Floor 2 to the eagerly awating masses.			"

												One of my favorite games next to Payday. If you're looking for a co-op survival wave thing similar to CoD zombies then this is the game for you, except the fact that this is probably better than what any CoD zombie game has to offer you. The people are pretty friendly and nice, they'll give you a boost when they can by sparing you some dosh if you come in late. It's heavily team based and you can't kill eachother which makes it perfect. Only met a few trolls or bad ones but compared to everybody else I've met their a huge minority. Game is fun, intense, and even scary at certain points when you're the last one alive fighting off three fleshpounds and a scrake. Basically just buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game.			"

												Are you thinking about getting yourself Killing Floor? If so, I have just three questions for you: Do you like FPS games? Do you like co-op based multiplayer games? Do you have couple of friends to play with? If you have answered yes three times, there is nothing else you need to know. Killing Floor is going to provide you and your friends with lots of fun. There you are with bunch of friends challenging hordes of mutants knowing you have no chance to survive on your own. Working together is the only way through and you guys are gonna enjoy it because there is plenty of weapons to choose from. When you are bored of shotguns and machine guns, you can try roasting yourself a mutant burger with flamethrower or cutting a slice of mutant bacon with brand new katana. But nothing beats boredom as well as good old grenade launcher.The ways to dispose of mutants are numerous but the same could be said about the ways you can die. You can either drown in acid vomit from huge Bloats, get butchered by Gorefasts, humanlike mutants with blades instead of hands, devoured alive by insectlike Crawlers or just get drilled down by almost unkillable Fleshpounds. If you hold up long enough and make it to the end of the stage, you will face Patriarch, nasty piece of mutant-ish weaponry who will do anything to butcher the ones who killed his babies.Killing Floor is definitely good game which provides great fun for the buck, considering how cheaply you can get the base game. There is only one problem, the DLC policy, not too uncommon in these days (Hi Bethesda) when getting half of the new DLCs will cost you more than GotY edition, which is kind of unfair to people who already own some.

												It's a nice cooperative game. This game requires players to be able to help and cover each other. No teamwork, No Survival. In my opinion, from the scale of 10 stars, it's 9 stars... Why ? because sometimes, the speciment would get stuck in somewhere the players don't know, and then somehow the round finished without anyone killed that speciment. But still, it's a great and challenging game, even when you've achieved the final step of any perk.			"

												Killing Floor is an example of multiplayer survival done right. Sure, there's single player but that's honestly as boring as the game gets. Multiplayer is where you should head with this game, even if you're playing with strangers, if they're competant and follow a very, very basic strategy, you can still have fun. The game is difficult, it takes a lot of practice on each difficulty before you can step up to the next one, along with the need to constantly boost your perks. The perks are very helpful and actually affect gameplay in terms of damage output, weapon costs, etc. but levelling them up is a grindfest; However if you're having fun then you wont even notice.The gameplay is wavebased, with a brief time-period allocated to buying weapons at the end of each wave. It's a lot more strategic than it first seems, at harder difficulties you need to have an idea of what you're doing before you even start, what weapons to buy, when to buy them. Additionally, if you're playing with friends you generally need to decide right from the beginning who uses what perk to aid the team, who buys specific weapons to deal with specific enemies, and what strategy to follow. The game's difficulty only adds to the tension and atmosphere, that coupled with a satisfying gore system makes it fun.The game is modder friendly so there's countless maps, skins and mods to keep you busy if you're bored of vanilla, just bring d0sh, lads.

												Killing Floor is a great zombie survival game which does not have the attributes which some don't like about the zombies from Call of Duty, this zombie survival game has an end to it.The game has multiple difficulties to choose from as well as multiple perks to enhance different play styles.  The perks enhance things such as explosive damage, headshot damage multiplier, shotgun damage and many other things.  Each perk of course can be levelled up so that the perk offers more enhancements to the specific playstyle, such as the support specialist is a perk that enhances the stats for shotgun users, the perk levels up from weld points which are gained from welding and unwelding doors and of course the other portion of levelling up the perk is gained from distributing damage with shotguns.  Once perks are levelled up to level 5 and 6 bonuses are added alongside the perk such as starting weapons and possibly armor.There are multiple maps to choose form while playing Killing Floor and each game played consists of 10 waves and a final boss wave.  The boss is a zombie called The Patriarch.In this game there are multiple types of zombies instead of just one type which other games tend to stick with, each zombie is a different styled zombie varying in strength and agility.Overall this game has a lot of different aspects to it and is a very enjoyable game which has a lot of replay value in it and I recommend it to any survival horror game enthusiast.

												great co op survival game. had it for a few years now, with 100+ hours clocked in it, and im still enjoying it! :D there are also events a few times a year, where they add new maps, guns, and skins.you get ""dosh"" for killing specimens and surviving waves, which can be spent to buy guns, ammo, and body armor between waves. you can also share it with your team mates so they can get whatever they need aswell.also it does require abit of skill and teamwork to survive, unlike left for dead where you just run through a mission shooting everything you see. for that reason though i would recommend playing with friends or regulars, as there isnt a whole lot of coordination and teamwork in public lobbies.

												Its fun to play, specially with friends, getting cornered by the zombies. If you do enjoy zombie killing games you'll have quite a good experience. There are lots of achievements to make on Steam. There are also DLCs. There are some classes and each has its specific perks, there are no big disadvantages or overpowered classes at all, each has its specific guns, though, you can still buy other classes' guns but you wont do so well with them as you'll do with the guns' specific classes.

												I bought this game with the internship of letting my eight year old son learn about interior design but instead he got a large number of men from australia complain about how much money they have. I don't care if you are from a predigious background or not it is just rude to wave your money in someones face just because you can afford more guns and bullets. There was a man who threw his money in the air but he caught it before i could and then had the nerve to ask what i was doing. we were then rudely interrupted by a man with no flesh who killed the first man. overall it is a great tool but i think there could have been more emphasis on textures (there are only like three) rather than having lots of dead policemen with no skin killing rude people with money. I know a lot about this because I was in #occupy 2012 and it was really cold but i perversered because i am trying to make the world a better place and make all the rich people give me some because i have worked so hard and my eight year old son can't even design the layout of my new kitchen. If i ran this game then i would make it so that the guns can shoot the complaining australian men too which i think was the whole point of #occupy and isn't that what we're all fighting for???			"

												Killing Floor is a game that I pick up every now and then, and always end up wondering, ""Why don't I play this more often?"" The weapons are very satisfying to use, and every enemy in the game can be a reasonable threat. The final boss is among the most lethal of that I have ever seen (despite the fact that there are ways of easily beating him), as he is: faster than you, has an instant-kill rocket launcher attack, a minigun that has a chance of killing you in a burst (about a second), and melee attacks that brutalize you/send you flying away. This game is especially fun with friends, and the 7 (pretty sure it's 7) classes are all useful in some respect. I highly recommend picking up this game at sometime, especially if it goes on sale. "

												This game is amazing. The graphics aren't that bad, it runs really smoothly, and tons of fun. You can literally play this game for hours on end. The monsters are creepy and disgusting as heck and the weapons are all so badass. It also has so many different players, so you can always find a server that has people on it. And I love the thrill of the game; it just scares the @#$% out of me when I see a Gorefast or Scrake charging at me. There is literally so much good stuff you can say about this game. I give it 10/10! It is worth the dosh (in-game reference :P)			"

												Killing Floor is an FPS zombie Shooter.  It's generally a multiplayer game but the game let's you play solo by setting up a server where no other players can join, so effectively you get single player OR you can play with friends coop.  The game starts with you facing down the first wave of zombies.  During this wave, you must slowly find your way to the shop keeper so you can upgrade your gear (weapons, items, etc).  The shop keeper is somewhere on the map and there's an arrow in yur HUD pointing in the direction of the next shop.  If you clear a wave then a red trail appears showing you exactly where the shop is.  You can customize for more waves by selecting a longer game.  Each wave is kept track of in your HUD, with zombie and wave count.There are items like guns and ammo available for pick up around the map.  The weapons available at the shop aren't bad but generally, if you've opted for the DLC then you have a bigger choice of weapons to use.  Weapons basically have a cumbersome/weight factor so you can't carry everything you want for each wave of zombies.  There are varrying zombies that do several things so depending on what you're facing might depend on what loadout you choose. When you have zombies firing missile launchers in your direction, you may opt for the body armor.The graphics aren't bad for an old game... but it is an old game so you're dealing with an old graphics engine no matter how much DLC you add to your initial game.  There's several unique zombies and creatures that are pretty creative in their gore factor. Headshots have that slow motion action feel to them adding to the eye candy effect a bit.  There is quite a following of the game and there's even new DLC every so often that include maps and unique character sets with tons of achievements to farm for.  There's plenty of maps and the better you know the map, the better you play.  Incidentally, there's no mini-map so you REALLY have to know the map for longer survival and shop locations.  My only real problem with the game is that you can't run.  If you're used to playing COD or some other FPS where you can just take up a sprint... not here.  The game will let you slow down to a walk though.  I'm assuming for better aim as you're moving and firing at the same time.  I'm a fan of Tripwire games so this is right in there as a classic fave.  It's an old game but I'd still recommend it ON SALE... with the DLC on sale.  You can get multiple DLC packages and the game itself super cheap when there's a sale.  Looking forward to Killing Floor 2 for sure.			"

												I have logged so many hours into this game it is ridiculous. Every person I have recommended this game likes it.Killing Floor is sorta like a horde game where you and your teammates kill waves of dead specimens getting money. At the end of each wave a shop opens and you get to purchase weapons, stock on ammo grenades kevlar for the next round.It's not like left 4 dead where you follow a trail to get from point A to B, but in Killing Floor the whole map is opened to explore.Pros: hilarious English voice accents, many weapons which feel balanced and realistic with recoil, a nice class/perk leveling up system, great many various maps, slow motion kills(although some people dont like it), and an overall satisfaction to recking all the specimens down and blowing them limbs offCons: dated graphics, unlike left 4 dead where u have to get to the chopper, there is no real objective other than survive the final wave,no character differentiation what so ever, all are clones with same voice acting which sucks cuz you get to pick a character and class to play as,some achievements are damn near impossible to get since the game can get really hard at suicidal and hell on earth difficulties.I highly recommend this game. The gaming community is still much alive so you should be able to find plenty of servers to join the fun.			"

												Killing Floor suffers from lack of polish, but does resemble a fairly decent coop survival shooter with subtle RPG elements. The game fundamentals are solid even with the lack of continuity by chasing down a trader for gun and ammo purchases between hordes of zombies. For casual players, the RPG elements are much too serious a grind to reach maximum level. The developers continue to put time and effort into keeping the game popular and fun with sales events and new DLC. It's not all that fun to play by yourself, but certainly plenty of entertainment for you and your mates together.			"

												An amazingly fun wave based zombie shooter. Teamwork is encouraged on Normal and essential on Hard and up. The community is decent for the most part (unless you join a Hard or harder game using a Level 0-1 perk, that will definitely irritate people). The perks are diverse and encourage different weapon use and gameplay style. It received more than 20 additional maps and countless patches since release (believe that's over now that Killing Floor 2 is out). Events during Halloween and Christmas were always a blast with themed Zeds to kill and timed achievements to earn.			"

												A really good zombie FPS. The graphics are very good so is the audio. There is a variety of zombies and most of them are a pain in the butt if you don't have a suitible weapon. There are a lot of DLC's so better get a bundle on sale. The gameplay is good there are waves and in every wave more and more zombies come to eat your flesh. There are difficulties and they make the game even harder because more zombies come and they are also harder to kill. Here's a piece of advice: there is one achievement which unlocks you an overpowered axe so better get it. I recommend this game it's really fun and also get another copy for your friend. With friends its always better. Rated 10/10			"

												Killing Floor is probably one of the best co-op FPS's of all time. While I'm not a huge fan of leveling systems in FPS games, it works here because you don't have to fight against people who've already unlocked everything (and who could likely wipe the floor with you). But don't think the game is easy just because of that. It's not uncommon for even an experienced team to get overwhelmed in later rounds.The game's buying-between-rounds system lets you really change how you play and adapt to the skill level of your teammates. If you're playing with a lot of good people, you could pick up less-effective weapons and just have fun. If your team is struggling, you can go for your bread-and-butter weapons and mop up. You can switch roles between rounds as well, so maybe you're not helping out so much as a Firebug and your team is taking too much damage. You could switch to medic and see a huge turnaround in your team's performance.The aiming is as accurate as you are, and that's a seriously refereshing reward. No artificial inaccuracy or auto-aiming here. There's also no bullet-drop, so it's really a blend of realism and arcadish fun. You have to balance weapon load out with movement speed. The more you carry, the slower you go. Also, you have to be proficient at switching to the right weapon for the job. If you think you can pick any class and one weapon and just mow down every specimen in the game, think again. A support specialist with the right shotgun can solo a flesh pound with little practice. However, a commando with a bullpup should probably just switch to their knife and run away (like CS, you have to switch to your knife if you want to run).One of the few downsides to the game is that there is a lack of variety in enemies on any given map. You'll see the exact same set of enemies over and over again. If you don't absolutely fall in love with the game mechanics, I suspect this will be the aspect of the game that destroys replayability the fastest. It'd be nice to see a couple different models or skins for the same enemy type (like how the plain zombies in L4D1 & 2 don't all look the same). It'd also be nice to see a new enemy type (something I don't think we've ever seen from TripWire Interactive).However, you do get variety in the form of seasonal events which TWI is very good about putting on every year. Often they'll release new content (new map, new character, new weapons, balance tweaks, etc.), and they also reskin all enemies for these events. The graphics may be starting to show their age, but the gameplay is still unique and fun. It's a game that may not have the strongest foundation when it was released, but its content, stability, and overall quality has grown over the years. It's still played by many and easy to pick up at a great price during a steam sale.If you like challenging FPSs and enjoy co-op, definitely give this game a try.			"

												KIlling Floor isn't just your average FPS.  Improving your stats, and not to mention, surviving the game takes a lot of patience and even more teamwork.  The replay value is high thanks to Perks (character classes) that take an incredible but worthwhile amount of time to level up, a wide range of weapons to experiment (or toy!) with and different maps.  A good deal of knowledge about the game mechanics is necessary to make it through the extermination runs, but that's where friends come in handy.  When playing with a team you can trust, then win or lose, the experience is just amazing!			"

British Metal Zombie Killers  TL;DR Killing Floor is a Fantastic wave based shooter with challenging gameplay , humorous dialogue and a head banging soundtrack. You and 4 teammates will be pit against the bowels of hell as an array of monsters come to tear your nipples off. Using specialized classes with the weapons you purchase you will help each other to survive by strategic placement or running around like lunatics, that have been given to much sugar.Follow us here Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipPros  Fast pacedGreat Co-op experienceRocking SoundtrackEasy for NewcomersCons Lacking a variety in gameplayNo storyLevels do not change any gameplay---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GameplayIn Killing floor choosing a class sets your playstyle for the match, your either going to be running around and keeping you distance or participating in fisticuffs. The game has very little strategy involved other than find a corner and only kill the last zombie when you’re at the merchant. Even though There are numerous types of monsters and weapons, you’ll find yourself buying the same guns every game, the game sadly can become repetitive in its gameplay. Characters While there are no actual characters with a full-fledged story, the dialogue is delightfully British and witty, with funny quips and spammable taunts. There are roughly 100 character skins to choose from , most are just silly military skins but others are refrences like the tf2 pyro. Art/Graphics Killing floor has that gritty film look and it pulls it off so well , with the dark environments and array of characters and monsters. The small maps usually follow a theme and they all give off a feeling of horror.There are many character models to choose form and variants of the monsters, Yet they all seem to fit nicely in the level themes, Even the Christmas ones are very well made.If you like this join us here to get the latest Reviews:Steamship Discord: https://discord.gg/XbsKrtKSteamship Steam group : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thesteamshipWhat would you like to see for our next review ?

												Killing Floor is an FPS Zombie Killing Game that gives you 6 different perks to choose from. Once you have chosen a perk, you can switch anytime in between waves of the current game or while in the lobby. The game is kind of like Horde from Gears of War or Firefight from Halo 3: ODST in being that you fight against waves of enemies and then against a boss at the end of the last wave. You get to level up each perk to a maximum of 6 levels and with each level, you get really cool benefits. At the end of each wave, you can buy weapons/armor/grenades from this shop that opens up at random locations throughout the map. There's only a certain amount of time to shop and the higher the difficulty, the less time..this means that if you're far away from the shop before it opens...you're screwed! Overall, this is a really fun game, it has excellent gameplay and gore, and it's worth the buy!			"

												At this point I've put in 80 hours and the game is still just as fun.  The weapon models and animations are supurb, as I expect from Tripwire, and the constant updates even this far into the games life, keeps this game alive and strong.  Servers are always avalible and mods are apleaty for this coop, zombie shooter.			"

												One of the FPS games on Steam that I'd seriously recommend. It's fun if you're playing casually on Normal or Hard, but if you want one hell of a challenge, try Suicidal or Hell on Earth difficulty. Game is pretty repetitive, but with 7 classes to choose from it makes the game fun. The more you use specific weapons, the more you'll rack up experience for those corresponding classes. The game is extremely fun to play with friends, and practically everyone on Steam either knows about this game or owns it. I'd highly recommend this game to practically everyone. Also, they have events in the Summer, Halloween, and during Christmas.			"

Since i met someone who tought me how to actually play the game i have found it much more enjoyable as i know how to counter all the different zeds there is to offer and how to survive the higher difficalties. This game is definitely in my top games of all time. I'd like to thank this person alot for making me love this game, you now who you are if you read this.			"

												One of my favorite games next to Payday. If you're looking for a co-op survival wave thing similar to CoD zombies then this is the game for you, except the fact that this is probably better than what any CoD zombie game has to offer you. The people are pretty friendly and nice, they'll give you a boost when they can by sparing you some dosh if you come in late. It's heavily team based and you can't kill eachother which makes it perfect. Only met a few trolls or bad ones but compared to everybody else I've met their a huge minority. Game is fun, intense, and even scary at certain points when you're the last one alive fighting off three fleshpounds and a scrake. Basically just buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game.			"

												Alright, even though this game was made in '09, has graphics that would make make a grandmother have a stroke, AI that, in comparison to other games that were released in the same time frame, were clunky and irrational most of the time. Also included is a server browser system that has been known to drive people to insanity.Few games have given me more enjoyment than Killing Floor.The game is very simplistic in its objective: See zombie, shoot zombie, get paid, buy bigger guns, repeat. Even though this may seem boring while you sit there, in your ""gaming chair"", waiting for your next game of Dota 2 to load, it really isn't. There is nothing more enjoyable and suspenceful than playing with a group of 5 friends (the game allows 6 people in standard servers), everyone dying but you on wave 10 on suicidal, out of ammo against 2 fleshpunds and about 30 other Zeds.The gameplay is very enjoyable, especially on higher difficulties, like suicidal or HoE (Hell on Earth), where teamwork is absolutely essential for survival for all 10 waves. There are 7 perks, each has its own ablilities (like the Berzerker, which does bonus melee damage) and uses for helping your squad survive the onslaught of horrific freaks you're up against. The maps are varied and requie you to shose your perks accordingly, depending on if its a day or night map, or open space or tight corridors. The goal of Killing Floor is to survie all 10 waves to get to wave 11, which is the main freak leader himself: the Patriarch. If you kill him (no mercy allowed), your squad survives. If all of you die in the course of 1 round, you lose. At the end of each round, any dead players respawn, but only if there are still surviving players.Tripwire has done a very good job of keeping players in the game durring its 5 years of release. They have done special events, such as The Twisted Christmas Event, or Hillbilly Horror (Halloween). Also, a steady drip of new maps, characters, and    guns have fallen into the hands of eagerly awaiting fans, most of which are given freely, or in-game achievement unlocks. Even though there are several packs of guns only available through paid DLC, they do not affect game ballance in the least, but only serve to vary gameplay and team tactics. Also included is the complete is a very extensive set of  od tools, allowing useres to create vurtually anything they want with the game; now that Killing Floor has Workshop, a hwole new relm of content has been opend to players.Over all, this game has kept me satified for over a year, as well as Tripwire gaining my respect for thier devotion to their playerbase. Alright Tripwire, time to bring Killing Floor 2 to the eagerly awating masses.			"

												Wave based zombie (I know it's speice men..) killing done RIGHT! It's amazing fun and refreshing with a fresh class based system, leveling up each class specifically to use different weapons with more effiency. It gives something to the more casual players, looking for a nice, fun little game to play with friends or randoms. But it also gives an extreme challenge to more experienced players with friends, because the Hell on Earth difficulty requires teamwork and synergy. I reccomend it fully.			"

												I would honestly recommend anyone who loves horror  / survival to try this shooter out. This is by far the most fun (and possibly most disturbing) game I have yet to play. With easy-to-learn controls and 7 perks to level up, this game will not only rock your♥♥♥♥♥in Singleplayer mode, but will provide endless hours of non-stop fun in Multiplayer online or LAN. Buy it and I'll see you online.			"

												Killing Floor is one hell of an addictive zombie survival game. I only just got it today, and holy crap it is fun.You are a British soldiery type guy who has to fight the undead to survive each round, kind of like Call of Duty's Zombies, but waayyyy better. Each couple of rounds is a boss which is damn hard, so go to the trader and buy yourself some good guns and armour. If you buy this game as well, it gives you two guest passes which you can give to your friends to play a long with you. Get Killing Floor it is a really fun game, and worth its price.			"

Since i met someone who tought me how to actually play the game i have found it much more enjoyable as i know how to counter all the different zeds there is to offer and how to survive the higher difficalties. This game is definitely in my top games of all time. I'd like to thank this person alot for making me love this game, you now who you are if you read this.			"

												An instant zombie classic. This game brought me together with many friends and introduced me to many other awesome gamers who like to kill zombies. Games can range from short - long, lasting 4 waves - 10 waves, with a Patriarch boss getting his own wave at the end. Similar to L4D, except gameplay is wave based not objective based. However there is an objective play mode with a few maps that are fun as well. From your basic zombie (referred to as ZEDs in this game) to the intimidating Fleshpound and Scrake, there are many different special zombie types who will all try to eat you in different ways.There are 7 perk types to play as, from the melee Berserker, to the Medic, to the Sharpshooter, there is likely a class you will really enjoy playing.Play solo or with a group up to 6, and on custom servers upwards of 30 players on one server.Many players have created custom maps or objective modes that are unique and fun to play, aside from the 30~ish regular maps, if you like killing zombies, this game can get addicting. There are 5 difficulty levels, and starting out you really should play on 1/5 - Beginner, because as you level your perks (which level to 6 ((higher on custom servers))) you will become stronger with those weapon types and gain necessary benefits to damage and survival that you need to have for higher difficulties.After 700~ hours, I've completed all but a handful of maps on 4/5 diff - Suicidal. It's extremely challenging and 5/5 diff is even more ridiculous. If you're good at FPS you will get the hang of it, but like any game, this one in particular takes time and practice.A great game to play with friends as well, the more perk types your team can cover the better chances you have of surviving, although it is possible to solo most difficulties with any perk, some are more challenging than others. Each perk has a role that they perform and zombies they should focus on taking out, teamwork is key and if you are a lone wolf you can stick with solo.Still fun after years of playing it. Up there with L4D.			"

												By far, the best sequel to Resident Evil ever. It even has Samuel L. Jackson in it. Character development is terrible though because there's only one voice actor for the entire cast (except the one character who has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥). But by far, the worst sequel to Tekken. There isn't even any fighting mechanics. Overall, would not recommend to my cat. Would recommend to my parrot.			"

												Killing Floor is my new favorite horde-based game, that's what you do KF, mow down legions of zombies with your team(under most circumstances). If that concept appeals to you then the rest should even more, there are a variety of enemies to keep you aware from the simple clot to the irritating Sirens as well as the Flesh Pounds. The multiple classes(which are levelable by the way) give you many different approaches to combat zombies, I find the demolition class to be particularily up to my speed. Explosives+zombies= a fun combination. The adjustable difficulty levels add a lot to Killing Floor's replay value, even if you've just started, the beginning difficulty proved entertaining and easygoing as I learned the basic ins and outs of the game.I recommend this game for anyone who's seeking a fun co-op experience and likes killing zombies.

												This game is basically about Zombie killing frenzy. If you like chomping through zombies, this game is a must-buy. The main highlight is playing with friends.This is what you have to do:1. Your friends need to play different classes to defeat the different types of zombies.2. Survive the horde while chatting or just trying to level up your class.It is fun for laid-back gaming, but with the occasion of raging at the annoying zombies with absurd powers. Such as the siren...I hate that b*tch. Heh. Enjoy your game. (Best with friends)			"

												Killing Floor is quite possibly the best zombie survival/horror game I have played. It's always a great game to bust out at a LAN party and provides endless hours of enjoyment for everyone involved! It has something that Left4Dead never did: a leveling system! That means there is always something to strive for and it keeps you coming back for more. The class system makes the game very interesting but more than anything it is important to note that this game is HARD! for the longest time my friends and I couldn't get past Beginner difficulty! All in all this game gets a five star review for me. there's not much in the way of a story which is fine because nobody expected it to be more than a fun multiplayer survival horror game, and oh does it provide on that level.

												Wave based zombie (I know it's speice men..) killing done RIGHT! It's amazing fun and refreshing with a fresh class based system, leveling up each class specifically to use different weapons with more effiency. It gives something to the more casual players, looking for a nice, fun little game to play with friends or randoms. But it also gives an extreme challenge to more experienced players with friends, because the Hell on Earth difficulty requires teamwork and synergy. I reccomend it fully.			"

If you're a fan of co-op and survival horror games, then this game is an absolute must. Haven't been able to stop playing in my free time thus far.

												YES. Three years back, I used to play this multiplayer with my Dad and brother. I highly recommend that you play, and that if you like zombie/horror/survival/shooter/FPS games like me, this is THE game for you. There's plenty of customization, guns, varieties of zombies, even CLASSES for your survivor which I have never seen before in any horror. This game even has Jump Scares! (Thanks to the crawlers, creepy lil guys.) When you get this game, you won't regret it. 11/10 stars.			"

												[REPOST] I had never really appreciated KF until recently, even though it has always been my favourite game on steam. Since i met someone who tought me how to actually play the game i have found it much more enjoyable as i know how to counter all the different zeds there is to offer and how to survive the higher difficalties. This game is definitely in my top games of all time. I'd like to thank this person alot for making me love this game, you now who you are if you read this.			"

												Starting out as a mod for Unreal Tournament it expanded into it's own game. And we were lucky that happened. Upon starting the game and getting right to the Zed killing your character is this cute looking military guy called Corporal Lewis. Watching him and the other characters ""run"" is one of the more amusing animations in this game. They kind of waddle. While the graphics are sorely dated at this point, it's the gameplay that keeps people coming back. Up to six squad members battle it out to kill the most Zeds to earn money to upgrade weapons. But you have to work as a team in order to make it to the boss round and win. There are a large variety of Zeds. From the small but quick Crawlers to the large and slow Bloats (think Boomer from Left 4 Dead). They all attack differently and you have to be prepared for it or you could end up dead lickity split. There are two Zeds however that stand out. The Fleshpound (think the Tank) and the Scrake (not like the Charger but kind of close). These two are extremely powerful and take certain perks (loadouts) to kill. Then there is the boss, the Patriarch. It takes all your ammo and your squads ammo to really take him down which makes it very satisfying when you do. Another great addition to this game were holiday events the devs would release. So in the summer they had a ""Summer Sideshow"" event a couple of times where you got new achievements and maps to unlock and circus Zeds to fight. Then there were Halloween events with their own set of achievements and maps and Halloween Zeds and lastly Christmas events.Fun gameplay, has awesome holiday events that transform the enemies and locales to fit either the 4th of July, Halloween or Christmas. Plus has the villain who needs a hug the most.			"

												Many of the problem i've sighted on is that this game product is having too many servers that's deserted and maximum player in only one server, servers that changes from 80- to 400+, servers that blocks Eventful Map, foolish newbie on a local Hard, Suicidal and HOE. But the only possible likeness I found is that without Comrades (Players) close to me, and closer to the hordes  , I could've regret the fate of bringing this game, sure they may fool around, coward away, and even daredevil themselves while having the worst opportunities against powerful Zeds, they've could be the source of my determination, talent, skill.(And for sure one day when KF2 release, please put a perks higher ups for the original KF players, thank you,Tripwire.)

I only just got it today, and holy crap it is fun.You are a British soldiery type guy who has to fight the undead to survive each round, kind of like Call of Duty's Zombies, but waayyyy better. Each couple of rounds is a boss which is damn hard, so go to the trader and buy yourself some good guns and armour. If you buy this game as well, it gives you two guest passes which you can give to your friends to play a long with you. Get Killing Floor it is a really fun game, and worth its price.			"

												An instant zombie classic. This game brought me together with many friends and introduced me to many other awesome gamers who like to kill zombies. Games can range from short - long, lasting 4 waves - 10 waves, with a Patriarch boss getting his own wave at the end. Similar to L4D, except gameplay is wave based not objective based. However there is an objective play mode with a few maps that are fun as well. From your basic zombie (referred to as ZEDs in this game) to the intimidating Fleshpound and Scrake, there are many different special zombie types who will all try to eat you in different ways.There are 7 perk types to play as, from the melee Berserker, to the Medic, to the Sharpshooter, there is likely a class you will really enjoy playing.Play solo or with a group up to 6, and on custom servers upwards of 30 players on one server.Many players have created custom maps or objective modes that are unique and fun to play, aside from the 30~ish regular maps, if you like killing zombies, this game can get addicting. There are 5 difficulty levels, and starting out you really should play on 1/5 - Beginner, because as you level your perks (which level to 6 ((higher on custom servers))) you will become stronger with those weapon types and gain necessary benefits to damage and survival that you need to have for higher difficulties.After 700~ hours, I've completed all but a handful of maps on 4/5 diff - Suicidal. It's extremely challenging and 5/5 diff is even more ridiculous. If you're good at FPS you will get the hang of it, but like any game, this one in particular takes time and practice.A great game to play with friends as well, the more perk types your team can cover the better chances you have of surviving, although it is possible to solo most difficulties with any perk, some are more challenging than others. Each perk has a role that they perform and zombies they should focus on taking out, teamwork is key and if you are a lone wolf you can stick with solo.Still fun after years of playing it. Up there with L4D.			"

												Killing Floor seems to be in a style that isn't seen to often in the gaming industry, as a true Survival Horror co-op game. Unlike other sorts of these games, such as Left 4 Dead for instance, this game does not follow as storyline at all. You spawn into the level, and you either survive or die. 6 different classes to experiment with: Sharpshooter, Support, Berserker, Demolition, Firebug and Medic, means you'll definitely find your preferred play style A great game, constantly being updated by its developers, (it does seasonal cosmetic changes in game, which are always fun), made even more enjoyable when played with friends.

												It's hard to some up Killing floor. It's a zombie game with a steam punk feel and an 'old school' play style wich makes you fall in love. It takes practice and lots of skill to play this game. Teamwork is nearly essential and you will learn to help others and be aware of their situation because your survival also depends on it. Headshots however, are deffinitely essentia and accuracy and timing are very important. Killing floor 2 is not comparable to this game and in my opinion the sequel lost the old school charm and is more an entirely different game rather than a sequel. That not to say KF2 is a bad game it is still a good game, its just different.You will be eaten and die constantly. You will watch those you love be eaten. you will run faster with your knife. Until the Patriarch finds you.  Say hi Patty!			"

OverviewKilling Floor is a co-op horror survival FPS zombie game. You must fave wave after wave of these ""zeds"", the zombie-clones, until you reach the final boss. You pick a perk, which yields unique bonuses, to help you against the threat of the zeds.This game has a myriad of options to customize the gameplay, like different difficulty settings and mutators that add twists to the gameplay.After each wave of enemies has been finished, you must get to the trader where you can refill ammo and buy new weapons. In the break time between waves, you can find a good spot to hold out.Once you reach the final wave, you must face the Patriarch. This is the boss of Killing Floor, and requires coordinated teamwork to take him down. He poses a great threat and has many unique attack patterns.Pros Solid gunplay: all the guns in this game look and feel unique, and they all handle brilliantly. There are many to guns to choose from as well. Huge variety of maps: Including workshop support, this game has a huge number of maps for you to master. They all feel intricately built and are great environments for slaughtering the zeds. Balance: This game has matured of the many years since release. All the different perks all feel equally important amidst the multiplayer matches, and no perks are over overpowered or underpowered. The zeds: There are 10 unique zeds to face in this game. Every zed has many different skins based on certain events like Halloween, etc. The zeds are fun to kill and even the weakest enemy (the Clot, which can grab you) can prove difficult under certain circumstances. Longevity: This game has plenty of replayability. You can level up your perks, or try to earn the achievements (of which there are hundreds) so you are always working towards something. Each match feels different and fun. Sound: This game has an epic rock soundtrack. I'm not a fan of rock, but this soundtrack is just awesome and fits perfectly. The humour: The voice commands in this game are really funny and all the characters have great personality. This makes the game more fun and lighthearted.Cons The hitboxes: Unfortunately, this game doesn't have the best hitboxes. The problem here is, they are just too large! Sometimes after decapitating an enemy, I attempt to shoot an enemy behind it, but the bullets get stopped by the excessively large hitbox of the headless zed I decapitated just before. However, the large hitboxes can make it easier for newbs to play.Neutral DLC: This games offers a lot of DLC. This is mostly cosmetic, like guns skins or characters skins, however there are a few gun packs that add new weapons which are locked way in DLC. Single Player: This is a game that is meant to be played online, so don't go into it expecting a single player campaign or anything. You can still play solo, however. No more support: This game has received many content-rich updates. However with Killing Floor 2 released, there will be no more updates for Killing Floor 2. This game is already practically bug free and has a lot of content.ConclusionOverall, this is a very solid zombies shooting game that I thoroughly enjoy playing. It is great for anyone of varying skill levels, and if you like zombies, you will love this game! I give it a 9/10			"

												Even though the graphics aren't as good as the sequel, it's still fun and has a nice variety of weapons, enemies and maps.My only complaint is that the dlcs are overpriced, but you can play the game just fine without them and not having them doesn't subtract from the game experience.

												Killing Floor is one hell of an addictive zombie survival game. I only just got it today, and holy crap it is fun.You are a British soldiery type guy who has to fight the undead to survive each round, kind of like Call of Duty's Zombies, but waayyyy better. Each couple of rounds is a boss which is damn hard, so go to the trader and buy yourself some good guns and armour. If you buy this game as well, it gives you two guest passes which you can give to your friends to play a long with you. Get Killing Floor it is a really fun game, and worth its price.			"

												I have never thought that Killing Floor suck me this bad.Every game has its flaws, and this is not an exception. It has some glitches, such as the enemies spawn and get stuck, etc.This game is basically a defense-wave FPS with emphasizing survival feature. The length of a match can be decided in 3 types (Short, Medium, Long). Also, it has the difficulty that is set in 5 levels (Beginner, Normal, Hard, Suicidal, Hell on Earth). If you are newbie to this game, don't ever mess with Suicidal/Hell on Earth, or players will be rude to you, since you will ruin their matches.The class system, which is called PERK, is balanced. Each perk has its own pros and cons. You start at lvl 0 every perk, and maximum level of perk that you can get is lvl 6 through some requirements that are described in menu. Some are really painful to fulfill them. When you are in specific perk, you will gain some advantages from it like discount, damage, and special ability. The higher lvl you are, the more advantages you get. Choosing perk and know what you are supposed to do.If you want, you can use leveling map perky to shorten the process. However, this game doesn't rely on players from their perk levels much (Of course the higher difficulties, the higher perks will be respected as basic requirements). The most essential factors that rule are SKILL and INSTINCT. Keep in mind that FAILURE is always an option in Killing Floor. You learn from it, and improve gradually. Don't be a♥♥♥♥♥to rage quit after you die due to lack of experience. Watching people play is really a necessary part to help you succeed in this game.			"

												This was originally a UT2004 mod and i enjoyed more than red orchestra. It's a basic survival shooter that is actually challenging. This game is not meant to be taken serious. The Gameplay is fun with other players. The perk system is enjoyable to me. The weapons are very fun to use and sound beefy like in UT2004. The pistols,shot guns, swords,chain saws, flame thrower, machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, rocket launcher, SMGs, and flame ball launcher are your weapons in it.  The community is good unlike TF2 which is full of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. the gameplay no matter what difficulty you are playing its still challenging. 9.5/10 Great game worth your dosh			"

Cor blimey that reminds me of the weird selection of weapons from flamethrowers to golden flamethrowers because DLC thats why.			"

												Excellent game.Whilst it may not have the greatest graphics or the most fantastic gameplay. It is without a doubt, one of the greatest games I've played on PC. The graphics, whilst not great, are quite something and the gameplay, while doesn't innovate or have any stand out never seen before features, is very smooth. Moreover, unlike many games, it is a game which you can play as much as you want and never get bored or play the exact same game as previously. As you will be constantly finding out new methods of surviving.The final great thing about this game is that it just kicks♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												I initially didn't like this game. However, looking back, it's because I only played solo rather than multiplayer. I even wrote a negative review, then put the game down. Skip forward several months later and one of my friends asked if I wanted to play with him. And accepting that invitation changed my opinion of the game completely. Killing Floor is meant to be played with others, and through this game I can live out my fantasy of being a back-row team healer via the Field Medic class. Of course, there are 6 other classes to choose from, each one suiting a certain playstyle; it's almost guaranteed you'd find a class that suits your preferred weapon(s) of choice.The online community for this game is like none I've ever seen before; everyone is supportive of eachother and all seem to share the same goal; kick zombie♥♥♥♥♥and help themselves (as well as others) improve. In all my time playing, I've never joined an online multiplayer lobby with even one person resembling that of the stereotypical toxic immature 'troll'. For being a relatively older game, there online community is still very active, which is great.			"

												I got the killing floor 6 pack. It's an amazing game to play with friends. It's all about teamwork, and using different perks to accomplish the team objective together. Some what like L4D :) However, this game should release more guns and events. Although they do host festive events, but I would like it if they host more. Any how, good game to enjoy with a bunch of friends.			"

												This game is like L4D, but instead of fighting zombies in the Eastern U.S, you're fighting mutated experiments on the Island of Great Britain.You can either complete objectives, or just kill Specimens for the hell of it.While you can play alone, it's more fun w/ friends and other players, it requires more skill than the average survival shooter, and it rewards you if you're a nice shot.W/ dozens of player models, constant update, and clear care by the devs, if you like team work, this game bunches it into a game that can be enjoyed even more if you play with friends, and if you have to play alone, the game balances itself out for you, making a title you shouldn't want to miss.

												You never can predict who will survive an apocalypse.  It's an unlikely combination of headshot percentage, situational awareness, and an appropriate hold over one's sense of self-preservation.  A Berzerker can charge fearlessly,  but will likely succumb to friendly fire if too psyched up.  A Firebug will too often find his friends as flammable as the ZEDs.  Most Assaults can't hit the broadside of a barn.  A Support might find the confidence of a shotgun is falsely assured, and weld shut his only chance of escape.  A cool-headed Sharpshooter might find he didn't panic enough, stuck in a corner.  A Medic will learn too late he let too many friends die.  Damn you, Horizine.  You've condemned us all to hell.. well, not me.  I could stare down the gates of Hell with a bolt action rifle, and thanks to Killing Floor, laugh at all other minor cataclysms.  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY! The other survivors will look and dress exactly like me, a ninja in riot gear. Learn to love the endless loops of generic death metal. Insult specimens. Run faster with the knife. Aim for the head.  Let's get to the trader.			"

												I really like this game and it is worth buying. I have played this game a long time, this is my 2nd steam account and between the two I have well over 3200 hours of play with this game. This was my first steam game I ever bought. The first thing I liked about the game, other the the fact it has some very interesting monsters, Was that the game was team based. And that the game could also be played solo. But the more I played I noticed that the ""ZEDS"". interacted with each other in some strange and funny ways.That you don't normally see in video games. For example a Bloat puked on some Clots by mistake. and a few of the Clots followed the Bloat around and attacked it from behind. until the Bloat killed them off.I have played about every game worth playing on PC and most gaming consoles. And I have to say Killing Floor is one of the most unique games, I have ever played.It's not only that the game is fun and has lots of replay value. but the community support and love for this game is awesome. Just check out the workshop for new mods and maps. I have about 100 maps that I can play in solo mode ""off line"". or if I want I can host my own server or use the multiplayer server to find a game. There are also Events hosted by Tripwire during the summer and Holidays. I have to say this game is the only reason I still have a Steam account.......just buy it already			"

												I can't believe that I haven't posted my review for this game after the time I played it with a couple of people.I may be a Survivalist, so saying that I like these arena-style games doesn't really make much sense right? Well, I'm here to give my best thought about this game.First thing I like about it? Well, it's the difficulty. The enemies here aren't as easy to kill as those realistic looking AAA games many of you play, and that's what makes this a great and fun challenge. The feeling I get everytime I survive, everytime I get an achievment and even everytime we lose is amplified because I know they are tough. In all honesty, I can't even survive on Hard mode that easy, let alone Hell on Earth difficulty, and that is why I like the difficulty of this game.Secondly. Weapons. There is SO many that I always ponder on what I should buy. It seemed that I was a rather good Sharpshooter, so I kinda went along with it, and I got Ms Popper, who is my favourite Lever Action Rifle in the game. The variety of cool, funny and over-the-top weapons makes killing these specimens a whole lot more fun. Add the slow-mo zed time moments and you have yourself a smashing time.Lastly, before this review becomes a full fledged life story or something, is the optimisations. It may sound strange but to me, optimising a game is just as important as everything else, sometimes even more, and this game in my opinion is well-optimised. Being able to play this game with almost no lag on my cruddy laptop just blows my mind.With all this said, I shall give my rating of 12/10, for I am still trying to get better at this amazing and well-worth game. Thank you for reading this and for creating this game. :D			"

												Excellent horde mode shooter with great gunplay and a wide selection of weapons suited to different play styles. While the graphical fidelity leaves a lot to be desired, it rarely makes an impact on the fun, visceral gameplay. Definitely worth a try.Warning: tactics and teamplay required, also: no crosshairs.

												Great team based survival game! work together as 1 of 7 perks (classes) including sharpshooter,support specialist, field medic, bezerker, demolisionist, firebug, and comando. each perk is well ballanced (interms of the other perks) and each perk excels at dealing with diffrent situation/enemies and have there own buffs/bonuses. head shots are very satisfing as is leveling up. each perk can go up to a level max of 6 and progress to levels is permenant meaning if in one game you lvl up to sharp shooter lvl 2 you will forever be a level 2 whenever you chose sharpshooter even if its a diffrent server 54 days later each time a perk levels up you gain more benifits to the things associated with that perk, for example a level 2 demo deal more damage with explosives than a lvl 1 demo. and much more than a lvl 1 feild medic. diffrence in levels between players is not a problem because you are exclusively working as a team. so higher leveled team mates are benificail not a hinderance. with atleast 7 diffrent types of enemeis plus a final boss you has a rocket launcher for an arm. the intencity of this team based survival horror game is far above satisfactory. WARNING if you are looking for scary, the scariest thing in this game is the picture of the siren on the menu screen slide show. ... *shudders*			"

												What this game lacks in glamor, it makes up for in game-play and execution! Right from the start this game throws the player into the driver's seat. No need for a drawn out tutorial, an unnecessary single player campaign or overly complicated controls, the player is tossed into the mix with minimal delay and given nothing more than a set of legs to run with, weapons, and monsters that need killing!The game is built off of survival multiplayer co-op. There are a number of classes that can be leveled up to improve the stats for the player's weapons, health and armor; consequently, a slight rpg system is implemented. It is the given ability to level up that makes the higher difficulties a thrill and worth the many hours of replay this game offers. The different classes can offer a diverse team build.The weapons are numerous and extremely satisfactory! The few equipment option are also well made. All players are given a door welder, one class gets a buff for it, that can be used to seal doors from attacking hordes. To many survival games lack the option to barricade doors. *cough* Aliens: Colonial Marines *cough*There are so many levels to choose from -- official and community made. Each map feels unique. Some of the player made maps are given twists, but the basic idea to all the maps is to survive and kill.Over all, it is the simplicity of this game that makes it so good. Everything is does, it does well! Even now this game is worth well over $20

												I seem to be the only person on my Steam Friends list who doesn't like Killing Floor. So I'll be kind and list the Positives first: - Many players and servers.- Priced right and frequently on sale. - It's received a steady stream of map updates.- Reasonably-priced DLC. - It's light on hardware requirements; you can play this on practically any computer.- Gritty. Great atmosphere.Negatives:- Utterly rediculous premse. - Hideous graphics.- Repetitive gameplay... after 10 minutes, you've seen all there is to see in this game.In closing: Bleh.			"

												If you enjoy mowing down zeds with an assault rifle, slicing them with a katana, or simply blowing them to bits, this game is pretty much the best for doing all of those things. With multiple perks to choose from, you're never bored doing the same old thing. Even mid-game, if you decide you want to just lay back and burn zeds, you can switch at the end of each wave.This is hands down my favorite co-op game of all time.			"

Pros:One of the better co-op experiences on PC. Great for LAN parties.Enough weapons and maps to keep the game fresh for a lot of playtime.Even after all this time it still has a great community behind it.Neutral:DLC is overpriced, but it's not like you need to buy it.Cons:Graphics - When the game came out the graphics were just ""meh"". It hasn't aged well at all. That being said it doesn't really detract from the game in any meaningful way.Load times. "

												I've been playing this on and off over the years since it was a mod back in 2005. I love this game, the first real coop survival. The maps are great, the game feels smooth. The guns are meaty and heavy. The music is mostly a metal soundtrack and it's amazing! 7 interesting classes that are completely different. You need teamwork on higher levels which is great. The community is one of the best. Even in late 2015 with the 2nd game out i still recommend you buy and play this one. It's a must play classic now.			"

												Killing Floor is a classic co-op shooter. With lots of characters, weapons, and perks to choose from it is highly replayable and highly enjoyable with friends. Once the vanilla content gets boring, there is an amazing community that has developed loads of custom content like new maps, weapons, and even new game-modes. Advice: While this game is great, don't buy it for $20 because it goes on sale a lot and then you can save some money.			"
