												The DRM in this game is both intrusive, and draining on PC resources, and has limited activations to boot.  My CPU usage went from 7% to 100%, which should not happen in an imitation 8-bit game, and prevented me from starting it up a second time after the initial install.  What I did get to play suffered from controls that felt stiff and uncomfortable to use.  Even at 80% off, this is not worth the money.			"

Good grief, I have better things to do with my time than to hunt down idiots who insist on DRM'ing their crap to only render it unusable to the end user.Thank goodness I didn't buy copies for all my friends as $0.99 seemed like such a bargain, instead it is a lesson in punishing the end users.Way to go guys!

												The DRM with the 5 machine lifetime activation limit is just unacceptable. The limit was raised to 20 but it really shouldn't have any activation limits that doesn't replenish. The game is alright but the hassle to actually play the thing isn't worth it. Replenishing activations would have been the best move but they likely figured that nobody would ever want to play this game anyway. Low activation limits says to me that even Capcom didn't think it was a very good game.I burned 3 activations just to play it the first time. This was back when it still only had 5 lifetime activations.			"

												Absolutely terrible DRM. Third-party DRM on top of Steam AND a 5-machine-activation restriction, to this day I have yet to play the game, because it simply won't go past the CD Key activation screen. It returns an ""invalid"" error. The product is nothing short of broken and the 5-machine-restriction is a major publisher practically begging its audience to stay away from its own product. Do not buy, despite the low price-tag, unless you feel adventurous enough to deal with its technical baggage on the customer.PS: I would like a refund, Capcom. Otherwise, we're done.			"

Now for the actual review of the game itself -After only playing this game for an hour, I would say that it was worth my $1 from steam's capcom sale.It has a nice classic, retro feel reminiscent of my childhood NES days.I will say that the controls are rather clunky which provides challenge of playing this game.The game allows you to map the controls on your gamepad and also switch to fullscreen (thru menu option or pushing ALT+Enter).Very simplistic and easy to pick up.Reminds me of a mash-up between Metroid and Contra.I only recommend this game for it being only $1 and having the will/courage to go through the trouble of activating your key.

												I like hard platformers but this one is hard for the wrong reasons. Basically you have only 3 lifes and if you run out you have to restart the whole level again(and each level is pretty big). If you make it to the second level with no lifes left, then you have to  beat that level without dying once or you have to restart the whole game and try to make it to the second level with more lifes.I got 99% in Super Meat Boy, because it's a fun and challenging game. With Dark Void Zero i gave up in the second level. Not because it was too hard but because it punishes failure too hard and doesnt respect my time.			"

												I've played many 8 bit games in my day and I'm surprised on how well this one plays and handles with my controller. The music has that 8 bit Capcom feel to it when they designed their games. The objectives in the game are fairly simple to accomplish but there are portions of the game that may frustrate you. Kind of cool at the beginning too that you have to press on a button to blow on the cartridge to make it work, and also the reference to TV star Jimmy Fallon in the game. Graphically , yes it's retro but it's easily worth the X amount of dollars paid for , and even more so when its on sale. I just wish the activation mechanism was taken away as it's not easy to deauthorize a game without customer support these days :(			"

												Abysmal. Dark Void Zero came out around the same time Megaman 10 did, trying to ride on the faux-retro wave Capcom had going. Unlike Megaman 9 and 10, which simply emulated Megaman 2's style, Capcom tried to make a unique gameplay style here. It didn't end well. The controls are finicky and hard to use gracefully, and the gameplay is just a slog, having to go back and forth every-which-way to get keycards and killing the same borning respawning enemies. Go play Section Z or Action in New York instead.			"

												Very hard, often punishingly so. A perfect recreation of an 8-bit side-scroller, complete with the niggling issues that made those games so frustrating. 3 lives, no continues. So you die 3 times, you start again. Janky controls that end up getting you stuck on walls, shooting into mid air and trapped in corners. The enemies can take much less damage than you but that's about their only weakness. Constantly and almost immediately respawning, it's clear the developers had little imagination as to where the game would go and instead made one intensely hard level that with enough practise you could likely complete in around 30 minutes. Problem is, I don't have the will to memorize enemy locations and wrestle with outdated controls to actually get that far.			"

Double DRM is extremely annoying, but even more annoying is games that don't work. However, an email to SecuROM solved the issue, took a day for them to respond, now the game works fine.Don't let the DRM issue keep you from buying this game. If you're a fan of NES games, this is a game you'll want to pick up. As annoying as it was to have to make the game work, it wasn't in any way difficult.

												2015 Review! - TL;DR version - SecuROM problems resolved - play it now - GET THIS GAME!I held off reviewing this game after purchasing due to the fact that SecuROM was having issues. I am happy to say those issues have been resolved and you can now play Dark Void Zero after inputting your serial. Still sucks we have to deal with third party DRM but its better than no game at all! Simply put Dark Void Zero is leaps and bounds better than the original game on which it is based. This is a super retro style game wherein it definitely feels and plays like a classic 8 bit NES game of yesteryear. You can jump and shoot and with the use of your trusty jetpack, fly and hover. Its a challenging and fun game with a decent (if not silly) story. If you like retro style games but they never quite feel retro enough...this game is for you!PS: Disregard my playtime. I played this game to near completion on my 3DS and just wanted to try it out on the big screen with surround sound and it plays exactly the same! Controller reccommended btw!			"

												let us list the reasons this game should not be purchased for any price-the moment you boot up the game, you're hit with a securom security code thingymadoodle.this doesn't even work and in most cases won't even let you into the game.the security thingy only gives you a few licenses so, even though you paid for the game with your own money, you're limited to how many times you download the game.if you happen to get past all the security stuffs, the game is awful. it has terrible controls and the graphics look less pixelated and more compressed JPEG.have fun kids.

												DRM worked fo rme first time. I don't understadn what people are having problems with. My only complaint is that the game is not fully compatible will all common Universal game pads. I have a Retrolink NES pad. Mind you befor I scraped parts off of a dead Real NES pad to make it feel good enough to use Most people seem to have baught into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controler full price. It should work with it as it's a common pad. going to keep looking into a way to get th epad to work with the game.			"

												The control is the biggest problem, but the sloppy design, blurry scaling (there is no native rez for this game, only fullscreen and windowed), sloppy framerate, weird hitboxes, and trolly trial-and-error level design also contribute.Never once do I feel that I am in proper control, able to effectively fight the enemies. I feel like a toddler trying to do heart surgery; there is NO way I'll ever be able to do anything precise.The weapons are generally uninspired, the story is totally DGAF, and the rocket pack handles like♥♥♥♥♥♥To top that off, you NEVER recorver your lives from stage to stage or on load, so if you use them all in the first stage (and you probably will, what with the insta-kill lava pits that you can't see because the lower 1/5 of the screen is obscured by your ""notifications"" EVERY SINLGE TIME you get an item), you will have NO lives for the second stage. Or third. You can't get 1-Ups from enemies. TL;DR - This game was NOT well planned, and though I spent $0.99 on it, I feel as if even THAT was too much.0.5/10			"

For the 80's gamers it will be a blast from the past. It's not an ""unforgiven"" game it has difficulty levels so you can probably avoid fustration (unlike with the real hard NES games). So far so great.			"

												Platformer that can, at times, be very frustrating. If you die, you have to start all over. The levels aren't that big so it's not that big of a deal, but there are only 3 levels. So you'll die at least a few times. The graphics remind me of the 90's 2D games; charming and stylish. And for €4 you can't go wrong, at least it's a whole lot better than the other Dark Void game.[Rating: 83/100]			"

												The origins of this game, whether they are true or not, certainly ring true after having played the game. The reason being, this game handles as if it was designed in the early days of platforming, when game creators hadn't quite gotten the hang of how things should handle.The movement of your character isn't abysmal, but using the jetpack is far from the joy it is in the previous (or...  later?) Dark Void game.  You can hold the jump button down to rocket, which is OK for going up, but the delay makes coming down tricky to control, or you double tap, which is probably the preferred method but has some weird quirks, like a slight bob that makes aiming while hovering trickier than it should be.  The controls overall feel oddly unresponsive. This combines with moving, which re-adjusts your aim, making you have to do a lot of fiddly jiggering to really point the way you want.  All the while, getting blasted by aliens.  This could have been fine if it were a dual stick shooter instead, but the way it is makes dodging and firing a real chore if you want to be safe.And you do want to be safe.  Because if you take a lot of damage, you WILL have a ""low health"" alert.  That goes on and on.  And is annoying.  This just adds to the likelyhood that this game really was created in the 80s.The entire first level consists of collect keycard, open next door, collect another keycard, which is OK, but again, makes it feel dated.  I got to the first boss, and promptly lost all my lives.  And yes, since this is claiming to be an arcade game, having lives makes sense, but it feels just like worthless punishment here.For a bonus, while it's not the WORST music, it sounds like Mega Man cast-offs to me, uninspiring stuff that didn't make the cut for their better tracks.I guess for me, they either really found this game and decided to do absolutely no modernization, or they concocted a story meant to play on nostalgia and went out of their way to make it play poorly.  I really hope it's the first, which is forgivable.  The thing about nostalgia is that, people would have had to play the game before now to have nostalgia for it.  Either way, poor mechanics without the memories to back them up are a disappointment, and make this game overall not worth it to me.			"

												Dark Void Zero is a final push by capcom to cash in on retro gaming and quite frankly I find it a complete waste of time. The Nes era has come and gone so what exactly is the point of designing such a game in the modern era? Sure leader-board and achievements is all fine and dandy, but what about the gameplay and longevity? There is no randomization in the game, spawn points are the exact same in every playthrough, level and monster creativity isn’t really anything to write home about, and the game is insanely short at only 2-3 hours. The only reason to play this beyond the first playthrough is to score higher and get achievements. If this game was released 20 years ago it would still get outclasses my Metroid, releasing it today to compete against modern platformers and it would get outclassed by everything. If you are considering getting this game, get Capsized instead; same♥♥♥♥♥♥ better play value.			"

												$5 no. $1 sure. Extremely short relatively challenging platformer with a jetpack. A fun play and replay. But not for $5 especially when people are having launch issues with the CD key.			"

												Absolute garbage. Even though it's in my favorite genre, this game has so many flaws its impossible for me to like it. For one thing, yes, it's an NES Homage, but the game design seems to be from the same era - dying just to restart the whole damn game isn't fun at all, especially in a genre about EXPLORATION you are PUNISHED for exploring. Don't let me get started about the atrocious platforming mechanics either.Do not make the mistake I made and do NOT buy this game.			"

												Buy it and if the activation refuses to work, get a refund. I bought this a long time ago and on Windows 7 it refused to activate. After upgrading to 10, I gave it another try and it worked. Don't know if the OS change fixed it or not, but it's working. This game is a ton of fun and better than the other, modern, Dark Void. It's like this game actually came out on the SNES. I have more fun with this than most modern AAA games released. Why can't Capcom just make games like this? Only complaint is the DRM.			"

												Dark Void Zero brings back the classic ""NES difficulty"", where games were short but hard as balls to beat.Besides the difficulty, it also captures the rest of the 8-bit feeling perfectly. Play this for a couple of hours straight and you'll probably think that you were playing some obscure NES game on an emulator this whole time.The levels follow the old ""get keycards, open new part of level, repeat until end of level is reached"" formula. This is then layered on with hard enemies and deliciously kind-of-frustrating controls (it's more frustrating when you're using the jetpack power-up, when you're on foot, the controls are actually extremely simple and straight-forward).As if this wasn't enough to make it a controller smashing game, there aren't any continues. You die 3 times (or more, since there are 1UPs through the levels) and you gotta start the level all over again and get the keycards again.Buy it, play it, do whatever you want with it.EDIT: !!READ THIS PART, PLEASE!! --- I forgot to mention something that some people love to complain about because... I dunno, they just do (I understand the frustration this brings, but calm yourselves. If this is a dealbreaker for many of you, then what in the actual ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with you?). There is an extra layer of DRM on this game, aside from Steam. The overall hated SecuROM.This piece of DRM imposes a set number of times your game can be activated. There's a limit of 20 activations now since Capcom raised the number, instead of the 5 activations it had before.>>NOW THIS IS THE IMPORTANT PART!<<: There's a way you can avoid using the activations. Before you uninstall the game for whatever reason, do this: right-click the game on your Steam library, go to ""Properties"" and then ""Set launch options"", write ""/revoke"" (without the quotation marks, of course) and RUN THE GAME (you must do this before uninstalling it!!)... and now you're safe to uninstall it without losing one of the activations!Have fun without having to worry about the DRM!Oh, and one more thing: whatever is said about SecuROM using the CPU like crazy is NOT true.

												When I played Dark Void Zero for the first time, I WAS SO SURE that it is an old game from NES. It lasted for the moment when I tried to find it on some NES related websites and found nothing. What does that mean? Dark Void Zero have an amazing atmosphere and while playing, it really feels like old game. It bring so many good memories, when platformer games were simply and fun. It's not a long game, have only 3 levels and 3 boss fights, and if you are not begginer when it comes to this genre, you can complete this game in 1 hour. Is it hard? At first, on hard difficult level, but once you learn how to deal with enemies and boss, it will be piece of cake. I guess that's most fun thing in such a games. I can recommend this game to every platformer games fan, it's a great game.ABOUT SecuROM DRM - not only the activation limit was raised up to 20 times, but you can also revoke activation limit in this game, check the guide in community hub. Still, it sucks that game which already have a DRM (Steam) are using another one, just to make lifes of us, gamers, harder.			"

												A nice little throwback to the NES days. It is far too short, though, even for its price tag of $5. If it's ever on sale, fans of the genre can pick it up for a little over 3 hours of entertainment. Take my advice and play it with an XBox controller or something similar with a comparable D-pad.

I feel like ranting like Angry Joe!Update: 2 days ago on 11/11/14, I finally got a reply back from Capcom Support! I was told that my code will now work, and it finally did! With this game you have to contact Capcom Support for now, they'll do an investigation, and it may take almost two weeks, but when they are done, you will be able to play the game! DRM sucks, and is ruining gaming, it is getting worst! I enjoyed the game, it is a never before released NES game for PC, but beware, serious DRM problem with this game!			"

												Enemies respawn while you are in the room, forces weapon changes. It achieves what it attempts to, it's a game that's made with a very 8 bit or 16 bit philosophy.

												I'd precaution that I don't think this game is a bad game, I just can't recommend this version.I bought this game in a sale a while ago and am just playing it seriously now. If you have any interest in this game, and if you own any Nintendo handheld from the DSi onward, buy that version instead. I haven't played the DSiware version, mind you, but from videos of gameplay I figured the PC version would be somehow better in it least resolution, but a better look at the graphics here only serve to the games' detriment; the native resolution on the DS makes it look as if it were a unique step beyond 8-bit, the 2 options (windowed and fullscreen)  on PC make it look like poor mockery of a NES game. One problem I have which I presume is present in both versions is that the sound design (other than the music) is inconsistent with the ""retro"" theme, with some sounds being appropriate and some just being poorly masked modern sound effects, which is jarring when noticed. I had to drag the windowed screen to a much smaller size to make the graphics decent looking, and also put the sound effects down to minimum and the music 3 notches above it - there was some definite oversight with whoever made the default options so bad. If you've made the same mistake of already buying this version of the game, this is at least the most optimal way to play it.Now, my biggest gripe with this port is the blatant removal of an integral feature: the map. The DSiware version gives it to you on the bigger top screen the entire time, like the DS Castlevania games. Here, Mr. Tesla is constantly referring to having updated your map, and THERE IS NO MAP. There isn't even a button to bring it up. You could argue that the map is unnecessary given how simple the map is, and maybe this is a direct throwback to Metroid I & II, but again, it is CONSTANTLY referred to in game, and those are the only games in the series that are too obtuse to play now without the use of a guide. I could have overlooked it here if they only removed that from the dialogue. That Capcom hasn't is obscenely lazy, and as a result, there is no justification for having released this game in the state it is in.I had no issues with the CD-Key, but it was still an unnecessary and inconvenient step in the process further defining this version as the inferior port.Edit: Nevermind, the M key brings up the map, which is explained nowhere and I had to find out online! Still can't recommend this version.			"
