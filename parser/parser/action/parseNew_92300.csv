NOTE:Don't buy this version but instead, take a look at “A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX” which is essentially an upgraded version of the game. I'm only recommending this game based on my experience before the new version released.TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda is a 2.5D side scrolling action platform game that attempts to fill-in for the Mega Man (Rock Man) drought.Like the aforementioned Mega Man series, this game places you in the shoes of an advance combat android named Ares. After a mysterious asteroid collided with a Deep Space Reprocessing station, a group of scientists were sent to investigate an energy emission radiating from it. Shortly after arriving, the team discovers that all the machines inside the station are now hostile to human life after being exposed to a new vapor gas called Zytron which came from the Asteroid. The Scientists, before being trapped, was able to send samples of the Gas back to earth who then develops Ares, an android immune to Zytron. Ares is now sent on a search and rescue mission on the Minos Space Station and along the way, discover the true nature of Zytron.PROS:+ High resolution graphics with a nice and colorful artstyle+ Crafting System for weapons and item upgrades+ Good weapon variety+ Good character designs+ Outstanding soundtrack+ Responsive controls (specially on a gamepad)CONS:- Very short- The game relies on grinding to extend gameplay (what I call “game time through attrition”) - Story is under developed- Cinematics are dull with no voice acting and, more importantly, no sound effects except the soundtrack in the background.- Underwhelming bossesCONCLUSION:GOOD GAME which is reminiscent of the Mega Man franchise. It has good high resolution graphics with a nice and colorful artstyle; it features a crafting system based on materials you collect from the world and enemies; the game shines with its amazing soundtrack and responsive controls specially with a game pad. For its cons, the game is very short and the cinematics are a bit boring and unrewarding but for the price however, this game would make as a good casual experience for younger audiences.Although I'm placing my recommendation, please don't buy this version and take a look at the “A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX”  instead. It's essentially an upgraded version of the game. --------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												I'm reviewing this game as it's in a bubble.  There's an updated version of the game, that interested people should get.  It seems to be just an improved version of A.R.E.S., if so, that's what you want.A.R.E.S. is almost a Mega Man game.  You get a character which has a array of guns, who runs through levels populated by enemies, and beats them by shooting them. However this game falls short of that mark because a few features.  While the hero doesn't defeat enemies and get their powers, he does beat an enemy and often gets an upgrade but he doesn't receive a specific power.   In addition this is a linear game.  There's five levels and the player has to beat each in order, though he's able to go back and replay old levels. That doesn't make it a bad game, but anyone looking to replace the blue bomber with this game might feel it falls short, however the game is still a great game, and will remind players of Mega Man, even when it's clear this is different. One big change in this game is the player is able to shoot in any direction, instead of just forwards and backwards, and that allows the player to have a better fluidity of motion.  There's also a few alternate attacks that ramp up the power.  There's a cannon that comes in and fires down, laying  waste to enemies in the way.  There's also a pair of grenades that can help destroy enemies in the way.   However the grenades have ammo, and they have to be replenished almost constantly.  The cost is cheap, but at the same time, this comes from the same currency you use to upgrade your weapons, so for my game I rarely used the grenades. Overall though A.R.E.S. is a fun simple game.  It's a bit short, though there's a difficulty mode that definitely will challenge the player, a number of achievements that have different challenges attached, and a scoring system for the die hard fans.   For five bucks, it's easy to recommend this (or the remake).  It might not be anyone's favorite game, but it's a rather enjoyable sidescroller.			"

												A.R.E.S. is one of those games you can only recommend to a certain few. There isn't anything particularly special about A.R.E.S. and although it attempts to be a solid platformer, it falls short through a frustrating ""crafting/shop"" system. The majority of items in the game require nearly all three of the specific currencies to construct and unfortunately, one of those currencies is in very short supply throughout the game. After three full playthroughs, the needed currency is always scarce. So farm if you must, though like any hardcore platformer fan, you'll persevere without the upgrades -- even if it kills you.The game itself is rather short and each successive playthrough becomes shorter because you can keep your unlocked items. My final run through of the game was a little over 40 mins. The cutscenes are decently created in a typical ""fanime"" style. The story tries to be more than it is and is mostly ignored except in between chapters. There are only 5 chapters with none of the stage environments or enemies revealing anything about the world A.R.E.S. is set in.I had hoped A.R.E.S. would've been more than what I played and because there is really nothing memorable about the game,  I can only recommend this to those that play for the learning experience of game development.

												At best, A.R.E.S. is competent. It doesn't know whether it wants to be Mega Man or Metroid, and suffers for it. The level design includes both large multi-scrolling rooms and more platforming-oriented sections, and it's never entirely clear which drops are bottomless pits and which lead to other parts of the stage. I'm also not happy with the upgrade mechanic, which encourages literal grinding as you kill enemies for the three types of items that are needed to upgrade your weapons. The controls also feel a little slow, with the dash move in particular always feeling like it's just a little too long to execute and traverses just a little too short a distance to avoid enemy attacks.At least the boss fights are pretty fun, and it's entertaining when you get into the groove of blasting enemies and jumping from platform to platform. But all of its other problems make it hard to recommend. You could do worse, but you could also do a whole lot better. Try Cave Story+, Noitu Love 2, or They Bleed Pixels if you want to play a really good action-platformer.			"

												A real gem of a platformer. I loved the currency system in here as you can replay previous missions to collect more recycled parts to create power-ups and upgrades to your character's weapons. The actual levels are very well designed, there are plenty of jumping puzzles which can get frustrating but it's still a required feature in any platformer. I really enjoyed using the plasma field weapon, you feel pretty overpowered while using it, although you are far from it as you will find yourself dying over and over again but wanting to come back for more. Really recommend this as it's good few hours gameplay for cheap!			"

												A.R.E.S. Goes EXtinctThis is not a bad game, it is actually pretty decent.  It looks great, has solid gameplay featuring some cool weapons, and decent level design.  However, it does suffer from being way too short and lacking difficulty.  That is not why I'm not recommending this game though.  The reason is that they have an IMPROVED version for the SAME price now available!  If you are interested in this title, then stop now and head to the A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX page!   "

												Shoulda called it JUMP 'N SHOOT MAN. A Megaman tribute or ripoff or something, A.R.E.S. is a ""walk to the right and shoot"" platformer with a tacked on crafting system. It lacks a lot of polish, and the controls seem awkward, but if you're into Megaman style games it might be worth a look.Watch a few gameplay videos, and if it seems interesting, grab it on sale.

												A.R.E.S. is a fun game though it doesn't have anything that really makes it stand out from the rest of the platform games.  It's a sci-fi futuristic platformer with cumbersome controls.  It's not a horrible game by any means, but it lacks the ability to keep your attention and wanting more.  I did beat the game, but it sat in my library for a very long time prior to beating it.  Look somewhere else for a good action platformer.			"

												This is an easy game to beat. It has only 5 stages, each has one mid-boss and a stage boss.You start out with just a simple gun and a simple moveset, and you unlock more variations when you move on.In my opinion, when you are playing sidescrolling platformers using a keyboard, you are playing it wrong. So a controller is highly recommended.I like how the different gun types are designed to be used for different kind of playstyle and situation instead of the boring strength/weakness thing.The graphics and music are cool and futuristic. The plot is neglegible.100% achievement requires some practice and luck. It is challenging but not impossible. All the stages have the exact same enemy spawn, and each bosses have the exact same pattern, so you can practice and memorize the stages to improve your score to get the required rank.My score: 7/10			"

												Some people would consider this a MegaMan clone. It seems any platformer with a gun is considered a MegaMan clone. A.R.E.S. stands on its own very well though. With each enemy kill, you can ""recycle"" parts from the enemy and use them to heal yourself or upgrade your weapons. Of course, they do reference their own closeness to MegaMan by having a walkway before the bosses similar to the famous boss hall in all of the MegaMan games.The 2.5D graphics are great, the controls are fun, the design is great and the story intrigues me. If you like MegaMan or any other gun driven platformer, definitely pick this up. It is well worth the price point.			"

												A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda is a 2.5D side-scrolling action platformer. The game is pretty short, with 5 levels and a boss at the end of each level, which takes about 3h to finish on the normal difficulty. But, there is some replay value for a higher difficulty, increased score and secrets.Also, there appears to be a newer version available: A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda EX, that improves a lot from the original. So, I would like to point you to the newer version, since here I did encounter a few problems, such as no music, and a few crashes that made me restart the level I was on.			"

												ARES is a Megaman clone where you try to save the world against some catastrophe with assistance from your special suit and an ally to give you guidance. I played with a gamepad, so movement is with 1 stick, and shooting is with the other. The story was not the most gripping, standard save the world type stuff. Your suit makes you immune to some chemical that is being released, which is why you are mostly going alone.I found the enemy types to be pretty repetitive at the beginning. It seems in the first level I fought about 100 copies of the same 3 enemies. The boss design was a little lacking. The best strategy seemed to be to hide out in a corner or tank the fight. The controls were somewhat sloppy. It was difficult to get the tight movement necessary to dodge some attacks.The graphics are bright and colorful, but I found the animation to be choppy. The environments didn't really do enough to draw me in to the game. Seemed like I was just fighting in giant labs of warehouses. The soundtrack does a little to pump you up, however. It may have been the high point.I feel that there are enough entries in the Megaman/Metroidvania platformer genre that are more worthy of your time than ARES. Try it if you are a huge fan of these games and are running out of quality options, but I cannot recommend it to everyone.Grade: C-			"

												I'm not the kind of guy to go around calling games soulless, but in this case I don't want to waste time. A.R.E.S. is a miserable, joyless experience hacked together from a gross misunderstanding of all that is good about platformers. It does nothing well, is thick with boneheaded design choices, and won't even last you much more than an hour even if you DID enjoy it. I feel like that should be enough to ward anyone off of it, but just to be sure I'll happily dig further into the trash pile this game is.A.R.E.S. refers to you, the lucky combat cyborg sent to the JUNK SECTOR to save it from a mysterious robot-corrupting gas. JUNK SECTOR is a space station of literal garbage, through which you will blast robots and crates to reach some tiny anime scientist and unravel the mystery of the evil space fart. Along the way you will find new weapons, loads of literal garbage to upgrade them with, a whole mess of unimportant characters, and a really bad rendition of the plot of Prometheus. And buddy, we're just getting started.Platforming through JUNK SECTOR is stiff, awkward, and features little variety. Most of the levels consist of hallways full of crates to jump over or shafts of platforms to scale. You start with a double jump and a roll but your character drops like a stone and the roll is over a static distance so don't expect any fluid maneuvers here. There are plenty of enemies to blast and you can do so with free range of aiming, dispatching most in just short bursts. Enemies tend not to be very threatening (even on the base difficulty of Hard) unless there's no room to deal with them, which is a common issue with the cramped levels and zoomed-in camera.Shooting things or locating hidden items earns you salvage, three kinds of junk currency you can use to make items or upgrade your weapons. This unfortunately is way more of a hassle than you might be thinking because there are no health or ammo pickups, you have to craft healing items and grenades. Yes, that means you can cripple your ability to upgrade gear if you're having trouble with the game, or lock yourself out of items if you want to squeak out an upgrade without a buffer. Grenades are pretty important too because they're used to access the game's secret areas and are used to air dash, for some inconceivable reason.On the other hand you can break the bosses by crafting dozens of healing items and mashing them into your metal body every few hits. You won't really need to because the bosses aren't terribly difficult, adhering to familiar patterns of leaping or rolling or telegraphing big beam attacks. Even on ""Hard"" it's not a very challenging game, and you'll get through it in an hour or so because there are only five levels. You read that right, five levels. No secret levels, not even any backtracking. Five linear levels are all you get here, each done up in bland, featureless tech motifs that look nothing like habitable environments. And it's not even until the very last level that they contain anything besides crates, traps, and enemies.The gameplay in A.R.E.S. is utterly deficient, failing to provide any sort of gratifying movement, combat, or goals to slog your way through. Fortunately that deficiency extends to the story and world-building as well, so don't feel like you're missing anything by skipping this title. There's one person to save, one super weapon to fight, and one big bad with an incredibly cliche M.O. for setting this whole thing off. The story especially hews close to those lousy PlayStation-era Mega Man X games, and really the entire game feels like a bad pastiche of the mistakes those titles made ages ago. So much effort was made to imitate something that wasn't that good in the first place that nobody bothered to check if they were making even worse mistakes here. But they did, oh Lord did they ever, leaving A.R.E.S. as one of the blandest, most boring platformers I've ever forced my way through.			"

Title: A.R.E.S.: Extinction AgendaGenre: Action, IndieDeveloper: Extend Studio Publisher: Extend Studio, ORiGO GAMES Release Date: 20 Jan, 2011You're a lady in a spacesuit, on a space station with mad robots. Shooting things.Main ReviewYou're a woman in a spacesuit on a lone mission to find out what happened in deep space, on an abandoned junk station. Something about this game feels strangely  familiar. Ah well, at least she's called Valkyl and not Samus, right?Anyway, after speeding straight into the game, I'm placed as a space suit warrior lady in a a seedy, futuristic station, where all the machinery has gone mental and is now trying to kill everything. The learning curve is harsh, you more or less need to learn yourself  the mechanics, deal with weird little robot things fast or die miserably. A lot. I like that you have to figure out everything by yourself. At the same time I dislike it. It's part of the charm of retro games. And that includes the sounds!At least  with all this you can upgrade your stuff so it looks more awesome AND kills things a lot faster.I think the design is pretty cool, futuristic shiny green and blue space, with rusting machinery as backdrop. The enemies, and there are a lot, from security system robots to weird little vacuum cleaner things that don't like you. I'm not usually a fan of futuristic style games, but this one has something about it I like.The controls take some getting used to, and they're part of what make this platformer challenging. That, and the oops I didn't expect that to happen moments when you slide under a wall and get blasted by sentry turrets on the other side. I think the controls could be better crafted or more responsive.What I find annoying is how far back a level/save point resets if you die, which can mean you have to refight tough monsters you already killed, and repeat a lot of content, which could make it stressful fast. Though there is a sense of achievement getting past those ANNOYING OBSTACLES.ProsCool space graphicsOld school soundsPuzzles progress well.Getting weapons is awesome!Throws you straight in(makes it more old style)ConsKind of stressful (because of the controls)Not very longThrows you straight in (No help) Controls are clunkyTL;DROverall VerdictI want to like this game, but the controls I feel drag down the quality of this platformer. The story is small but you know what's going on. Everything about the game I think can be amazing, but the responsiveness of the controls, and the situations you find yourself in with them let it down. I like everything in the game, except for the gameplay. If you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group! "

A.R.E.S. is very much a love letter to the Mega Man X series, but never quite reaches the same heights. A lone robot goes on a mission to a space station where a mysterious virus has taken over all the machines while an NPC dumps information on them at key points - if it all feels familiar to old console players, it's because it absolutely is.The main issue is that a lot of the charm that made Mega Man X what it was is gone - the game is linear, weapons are few and stingily upgrade, and A.R.E.S is nowhere near as responsive as X was. Controls are slightly clunky, rewarding pattern recognition over reflexes, and areas often have a constrained, restricted feel (oewing to the decent amount of space your character takes up on-screen) that may be appropriate for the space station theme, but aren't much fun to play around in. Enemies often include flying foes that are hard to target with the default gun. Add in 3D environments that can occasionally be confusing as to what qualifies as a ledge and you have the recipe for some issues. Add in a rather pointless crafting system - you need particular elements to craft each upgrade, but... there's no way to predict or seek out the exact elements you need. It also makes you choose between buying disposable items and upgrades, leaving the former as a trap and the latter as the only great choice to make. And the story is pretty forgettable, and ends on a cliffhanger that seems unlikely to ever be picked up again. It's also quite short if that's a issue - lasting only a few hours, it certainly doesn't overstay its welcome.That isn't to say it's all bad - the boss fights are clever, if heavy on pattern recognition, and it's light fun if you're willing to put up with its foibles, and rewards replays with extra unlockables and upgrades.  Mega Man X fans may enjoy it well enough if you pick it up on sale, as it's not truly bad, just exceedingly average - it doesn't really fall over, but it doesn't do much to distinugish itself.			"

												How did it all go so wrong? You had decades of platformers to look back on to get it right.This is not a bad game per sé, but I could find faults with nearly every aspect of it without trying.As hommage to Megaman (I presume), your starting suit is bad. That's fine as you get the better suit quickly, but the weapon upgrades are something else. I only upgraded the Wave Emitter because a gun shooting through walls seemed OP. It is, and incredibly so. It made the game completely trivial until the last boss (where it still seemed to outperform all other guns by a long shot), and the SMG seemed similarly powerful.Difficulty comes in 2 forms: surprise attacks (mobs that will charge at you as you enter the next screen, you'll quickly learn to zone with attack held down) and the lack of a second thumb on your right hand that would allow you to jump while firing.The controls are...it's hard to describe, it feels like there is some sort of weird animation-lock that prevents you from turning around/jumping as soon as you'd expect to be able to (which is awful in a game designed with heavy slide usage in mind) after firing. Example situation as I have witnessed it: I'm firing at something to my right, I'm on the left edge of a platform, the next higher one is up to the left. I fire, press and hold left and press jump. Character fires, turns around, walks off the edge. This can be reproduced 100% of the time, I'm not sure how this got through. Sure, you could say ""so you walk off a platform, big deal"", but what if the platform is a laserbeam and my attempt to jump is an attempt to slide through it, but instead I get hit (this situation brought to you by the final boss)? These are real situations, and they make the game quite annoying.Grenades seem kind of tacked on and pointless until you get the unlimited grenades-upgrade, you only need to grenade-jump very occasionally and the other weapons are so strong that you don't need grenades for combat.Speaking of ""tacked on"", the crafting system also seems pretty redundant. It's not too painful, and it allows you to farm healthpacks, but you could always farm lives in these sort of games, so it's nothing really new (which is fine).The boss patterns are very simple. I don't play these sort of games that often, yet I don't think I needed more than 2 attempts on any boss except the last one (on Hard). In fact, I think I oneshot all but 1 and the last boss boss on my first run.The last boss is a three phase fight, and presented the only real challenge in the game for me. Sadly, however, this was mostly because of the bad boss(-room) design and phasing. The bottom left and right platforms regularly get you stuck (due to the ramp underneath), the big yellow laser orb has a larger hitbox than is visually apparent (I must have gotten hit by that about 20 times when it clearly didn't touch me), and if there are projectiles out on the screen when the boss phases, you will be rooted in place and take the projectiles in the mouth as there is nothing you can do about it. Mechanically the boss was somewhat challenging and fun otherwise, though still only what you'd expect in other games on Normal difficulty.Overall, A.R.E.S: E.A. is a very short (~2.5 hours for first playthrough) and easy platformer with Twin-Stick shooting (please tag the game accordingly!), little innovation and many flaws. This is the kind of game you will best enjoy if you want to replay and master it (and you will have to if you want the achievements). For a one-time playthrough it is utterly unremarkable, but the upgrades from the first playthrough persist and make replaying it a somewhat appealing proposition.With as little choice as we have on Steam for Megaman-like games, it's an okay buy.If I had to give it a rating, I'd say 6/10.

												Crazy-intense high-twitch side-scroller.  Looks like a modernized version of Mega Man or Metroid, but plays more like Contra - lots of enemies coming at you all the time.  It theoretically supports gamepad, but it plays nicely with keyboard-move, mouse-aim controls.If that's what you're looking for, it's a lot of fun!  Good graphics, good music, occasionally-frustrating-but-mostly-in-the-good-way gameplay.			"

												Please do not buy this game. It is years old, and it is buggy beyond belief. I literally walk through a door, the ground is not detected and I immediatly fall to my death in several cases. If it wasn't for that, this is a loose platform shooter using a dual stick idea, one for shootin' and one for movin'. It would be a much more fun idea if it played tighter. You can do better than this game with mega man mods and clones online as freeware.			"

												Presentation in this game is fine, the graphics are okay.  I really struggled with the control system and the character is too large.  Pretty sure a double-jump covers almost the height of the screen!There didn't seem to be any way to remain stationary and fire at a diagonal which was really my main gripe.  If there is a way around this then someone let me know and I'll go back in game and have another play and rewrite this review.			"

Actually isn't that bad. In fact, it's kind of goodAlright, I know starting a review with that type of header isn't likely to inspire a lot of confidence. But trust me on this one:This game actually isn't that bad. In fact, it's kind of good?A.R.E.S. feels straight out of the 90s in both design, story, fidelity, and - let's face it - name. It's an action side-scroller and you control a robot dude. You have access to several types of weapons (that you're never not spamming the entire level), and you use them to mow down hordes of enemies and the occasional boss. There are some RPG-lite elements, like weapon upgrading and new suits, but it's all pretty shallow.It's short, and not all that hard. Its understanding of level design is...uh...questionable. It's colorful and full of neon. Did I mention you're constantly firing guns? Like, all the time?That's it. That's all there is. But there doesn't need to be anymore, right? This isn't a ""fake"" retro game, there are no surprise plot twists or usage of ironic ""bad design""In fact, maybe that's why the experience felt so good: it was genuine. It felt like a dumb action game that was perfectly content providing that exact experience - a callback without all the ""heh, remember THIS?!"" that plagues so many others. It's a fun game, and I think you'll have fun with it as well.			"

												ARES is an interesting game and is definately worth a look despite some of the negative reviews you might see. It's a side scrolling action game, very similar to Mega Man. The game's story is not it's strong point; essentially you're a robot sent on a mission to a space station to stop the evil AI from blowing up a planet. Typical stuff.The gameplay is standard run 'n' gun for the most part, and features an upgrade system where all of your weapons can be upgraded to make them stronger. Although usually this doesn't seem to be worth it as the differences in damage are minimal. Besides what you should do is to take those components for upgrading and use them to make medkits for healing; with enough of them the game becomes a breeze since all enemies drop components. Of course there is a higher difficulty setting, and rankings for each stage if you're a completionist. It's not the best game out there but it isn't the worst either, and recommended if you have some cash to spare and some time to kill.			"

												As much as I want to recommend A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda I cannot, the game did not meet my expectations at all. While the shooting is decent along with the weapon variety and the ocasional need to craft grenades to access other side areas you spend alot of the time jumping and for me the jumping in this game felt kinda clunky when sometimes the controls wouldn't respond at all and I was playing with mouse and keyboard because aiming with the right stick on the 360 controller was a pain I couldn't bare. The game relies on the loot that enemies drop, which is three different resources, to craft items such as medkits and grenades and also to upgrade your weapons and grenades. Basicly you're forced to go through the level shooting enemies and if you need going back and killing those enemies again (because enemies respawn as soon as you leave their ""area) and sometimes doing some platforming. While the graphicstyle is nothing to brag about it gets the job done and it kinda ""fits"" the setting of the game. The game gets alot repetitive even though it's extremely short (I've beated it in less than 2 hours) with some ocasional variety everytime you meet a boss. The plot of the game was probably the only thing I enjoyed about it but unfortunately I don't think that alone is enough to recommend this game to any other people.			"

												It is clear that Treasure's Mega Drive releases in the form of Alien Soldier and Gunstar Heroes play a huge part to A.R.E.S. design with huge epic bosses, eight directional firing and an emphasis on weapon power-ups more specifically. While it would seem from the offset that the folks from Extend Studio know what they're doing, sadly A.R.E.S.  never quite manages to capture the precise beats of the controls and core mechanics that made both of the mentioned games as exciting as they were in the early nineties. My biggest gripe with A.R.E.S. is that the controls never do what you want them to, even with an Xbox pad. It really hurts the rest of the experience when the game pegs a wealth of secrets accessible only through exploration and careful platforming. This wouldn't be a problem if all the actions in the game didn't feel a chore to commence as the lumbering animations making double jumps especially hard to predict and all-round not fun to do. Despite this fatal shortcoming,  I will give A.R.E.S. credit for it's soundtrack which, like the Mega Drive games I mentioned, feature memorable tracks for each level. Still, Would I concluding recommend this game because of that alone? No, not really.			"

Posted: June 13, 2016
												Quick Summary: ARES Extinction Agenda is a side scrolling shooter similar to Megaman, with a very short campaign. The game’s replay value comes from grinding for “recyclable parts” which are used to purchase weapon upgrades, and from trying to get a higher score on each level (faster completion and taking less damage). You’ll want to use a controller for this game.You play a robot soldier named Ares, investigating the takeover of a human inhabited area where a mysterious gas has seized control of all the electronics (robot enemies). Throughout the game’s 5 levels you discover more and more about Zytron, the green gas responsible for this whole mess, and why it’s hell bent on killing all humans. Ares gameplay is mostly side scrolling though there is some mild climbing and platforming. You have a double jump, but it’s not especially powerful, and don’t expect to be climbing walls like Megaman. Your life is measured in “energy” which can be upgraded by finding “data cubes” (collectibles) or by getting higher scores in levels. Energy does not regenerate so you’ll probably want to take your time if you’re a new player. There are a few weapons and outfits to choose from, but they don’t have that big of an effect on gameplay.Pros:+The game is fun if you’re looking for a short action packed diversion. The story is okay as well, though nothing special. +Once you’ve beaten the game you can replay missions at will, trying to get higher scores and trying to collect all the data cubes.  This allows you to grind for recyclable parts pretty easily and buy all the weapon upgrades to make your “hard mode” playthrough easier.Cons:-If you play with keyboard and mouse like I did, your aim may be better (mouse aiming) but you’ll run into the problem of keyboards not registering more than 3 buttons pressed at once. For example running, jumping, shooting, and using special moves simultaneously. This will lead to some embarrassing falls to your death. -The game isn’t hard if you just want to play through, but if you want the steam achievements, they can be a pain. I played through the game twice and couldn’t get higher than C ranking. Maybe I just suck, but to get the high ranking you need to finish each round in half the par time, take no damage, and get 100 hit combos. I couldn’t even beat the bosses without losing half my energy. -As mentioned before, the game is very short. It takes about 2 hours to beat the whole thing, even if you’ve never played the game before.Overall ARES may be a short game, but it’s fun while it lasts and the download size is pretty small (graphics are good though). Give it a try if you have it, but don’t feel bad if you don’t have the game’s DLC – Berzerker suit. It just gives you a powerful weapon that passes through walls while making you take extra damage from enemy attacks. It isn’t that useful after the first couple of levels.  "

The controlers do not feel as tight as they should be (like many N64 titles). Kind of sluggish. Even unresponsive at times. I've experienced a handful deaths where my attempt to make a simple jump ended with me walking right off a ledge to my doom. And for no obvious reason other than buggy controls. Overall the game is fun for a short time and not nessesarily a bad purchase. Just don't expect anything amazing. Overall the game just looks sounds and feels weak but if you get past that and just enjoy it for what it is (a Megaman esc action platformer) then you might actually like it. If this were a console game I would sum it up as a good one to rent.			"

It is a great nod to Mega Man and older 2D Side Scrollers, but again, my only complaint was the length.  From what I have read, there does not seem to be a planned sequel (could be wrong though) which is unfotunate, because from what you get out of the story, it could have easily lead into multiple sequels.  Again, I had fun playing this.  It only took a few hours, but it was still a pretty fun game and was deinitely worth what I paid for it.

												It's like Contra with some design apparently influenced by Metroid. Besides the somewhat handicapped mid-air jump the game mechanics are fun, but sadly A.R.E.S. never delivers a real challenge. We played it on hard and made it through the 5 levels under 2 hours. On the second run it's even worse because you're already powered up. Unless you're a hunter for achievements and in-game rankings, you'll drop this game after having mildly fun for about 1 or 2 hours. I really would have liked the game because I appreciate the attempt in bringing a dated genre polished up to recent systems, but ultimately A.R.E.S. feels like a prolonged tutorial with the main game missing.

												A.R.E.S. is what you get when you mix Megaman, 80's cartoons, and the old DoS game ""Abuse"", and put them all in a 2.5D blender.A brief review for a brief game, A.R.E.S. can typically be finished in one sitting, which of course is the point. Weapon purchases and upgrades transfer over with every new game that is started, and there are multiple endings depending on the difficulty one chooses, throwing in a little bit of bullet hell style progression into the mix as well. And for you OCD types, there's also some collection elements, so it's fun to go back and suss out secrets from every corner you can find.If I had one complaint about this game, it's that you absolutely should be playing with a controller. I realize that isn't much to ask in this day and age, but for those stuck on a mouse and keyboard, unfortunately the programming of the game will only allow you to press two keys at once, so for some of those tricker platforming sections, it gets a little extra hard to navigate properly.That aside, the game runs smoothly, looks nice, has a bit of a cartoonish feel to the plot, and is mostly just an excuse to run around and cause robots to explode. And at the end of the day, isn't that all we all really want?			"

												I tried to like this game, but it just really doesn't appeal to me.The controls feel slow, and the jump is absolutely abysmal. Several platforming puzzles lead to frustration just because of how short the Character's jump was.You're also told early on that you can change suits, but the game does not give any explanation as to why you'd want to do this, and how each suit affects you. From what i experienced, there isn't any discernable difference between the suits anyway, aside from the berserker suit.The enemies are more of an annoyance than anything else, and it's very difficult to dodge their projectiles as your character is rather large. And even if you do get hit a lot, you can easily craft a cheap healthkit that heals most of your bar. Speaking of the crafting system, you can also make grenades. But i rarely found myself using them, aside from when they were required to bypass obstacles, they can also be used to perform an air dash move, but this needs to be charged up and so is only useful in specific situations.All in all, I think this game isn't really that good. If you like platformers such as megaman, then i'd recommend buying it during a sale. But other people probably won't enjoy this.			"

Intro:A.R.E.S. is a Megaman clone that has been around long before there were any real alternatives on Steam. The whole package looks pretty good and seems worth a buy, but after playing through it I was rather disappointed.Yes, despite my low hours, I did beat this game. Its that short.Gameplay:The game itself plays like you'd expect a Megaman game to, except that you control your projectile location with the analog stick. This change actually really hurts the game. It becomes less about strategy and positioning and more about mindlessly clicking on enemies.Like with any Megaman game, you go through stages and kill bosses. You unlock new weapons, some armors, the usual.Its not terrible, but it just doesn't feel satisfying.The stage design is boring, the characters are uninspired, and the overall presentation just falls flat.Instead of fulfilling my want for a Megaman fix, I just found myself wanting to play an actual Megaman game.The whole game feels off and left me wanting to play an actual Megaman game.Story, Visuals, & Music:If this game had a story, I have no idea what it was.The visuals are fine. The music is mediocre and even good at times.The title screen and the music playing immediately give the game a Megaman X feel. I was pretty pumped to jump into it, but it just left me disappointed.PC Version:okConclusion:I really don't know why this game hits me in all the wrong places. It seems like it should be good, but it just isn't. Its certainly something I'll ever install again.This is one of the few games in my Steam library that I actually regret purchasing, despite having only paid 2 dollars for it.If you really want to play a Megaman game, just emulate the originals. There are PC ports of many of them, but they're pretty bad. There's also a Megaman collection on Steam with the first 6 games if you really want a Megaman title in your collection.Outside of the originals, there's Mighty No. 9 that looked wonderful but fell pretty flat. I haven't played it myself, but have only heard negativity.There is one game worth checking out though. Its called 20XX and is a rogue-light take on Megaman X. I've played it briefly and found it a ton of fun. It really captures the feel of a Megaman game. Its still in early access, but its definitely something I'll be picking up in the future.But A.R.E.S? God no.			"

												A valiant attempt by the developer, I guess, but this game just did not do anything for me. Weak story, mediocre game-play, and something about the jump physics made platforming very frustrating. If you already have it as part of a bundle (which is how I got it), then check it out and see for yourself.Otherwise, I see no real reason to get it on its own.			"

												A.R.E.S. is a good game, but if you expect a Metroid-like game continue your search. This is more like a Megaman game. It does some things different, like upgrading of creating weapons with parts of destroyed enemies, finding collectibles and things like that. But nothing big. The art style is cool, even though the main character lacks personality. Still, it's an ok game so far, but not worth the full price.[Rating: 61/100]			"

												This is a 2D platformer shooter with a very arcadey look.   It doesn't bring much to the old, dead genre and there's technical limitations which give it the thumbs down.The animations are pretty bad, really clunky and not smooth.Controls are awkward and cludgey.The enemies are all very samey and boring.   You can't set your resolution above 1080p, which was a popular gaming resolution about 6 years ago.Worth giving a miss.			"

												So I was led under the impression that A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda was a Mega Man-styled side-scroller where you pick a stage of any order you want, go around blasting robotic enemies, and steal special powers from the bosses. Not true; just because you have a robot (or a cyborg or a someone in a mecha or sorts) that can jump and shoot thngs doesn't immediately make it a Mega Man clone. If anything, this game resembles more closely to the oft-forgotten (and now freeware) MS-DOS game Abuse by Crack dot Com (comprising of a few former id Software guys), with a bits of Metroid thrown in. The story is that you're A.R.E.S., a combat robot with a mission to rescue Dr. Julia Carson, a scientist from United Earth working on a way to save the planet through a concept known as Deep Space Reprocessing by recycling waste, and investigate the DSR space station, the Junk Sector, and its Zytron outbreak. The game however only has five levels and most of the replay value comes from trying to improve your score and get higher ranks. A.R.E.S. is not alone on this mission as he's aided by Valkyl, an A.I. of a battleship who can rain down destruction after filling a special meter. Along the way, you'll collect various upgrades that gives you new abilities such as an exploding/electrical dash and better immunity to toxic Zytron gases infesting the Junk Sector space station. You also get a few new guns to play around with, which can be upgraded with the scraps and resources you collect from fallen enemies and scattered throughout stages. Said ability upgrades can be used to reach hidden areas to uncover secret items or data packs that shed some light on the mission, the Junk Sector, characters, enemies, and UE.Sadly this is where things fall apart for me and this game because there's one glaring problem with this game that I have: the controls. I've put this game down before and recently picked up again this game again to see if it was just me or the game's sluggish controls that was putting me off, and I can say it's latter that's driving me to play other platformers with precise controls. I've played many 2D platformers in my day, but A.R.E.S. feels sluggish and sometimes unresponsive on both keyboard+mouse and controller. Not to mention he feels sluggish to move around in these levels, even with these upgrades to give him more advanced moves he feels slow to move around. Metagal has more responsive controls than this game. Hell, even Mighty No. 9 on Wii U has more responsive controls than this game. Speaking of levels, the level design can sometimes come off as cheap; a noticible moment is this climb from one of the game's bosses in the third level where you have to leap from platform to platform to the top, but thanks to medicore controls, I usually fall for a cheap death and my score/rank goes with it. Fun. The Metroid elements this game tries to use doesn't quite capture the sense of progression that other Metroidvanias games out there give and feels more like a chore to collect these upgrades to pad out the short longevity. Although the game as a nice soundtrack, but to be honest, there are some tracks that were completely forgettable and boring to me. While there's an EX version of this game that came out a few years ago that updates the graphics and adds another character, I honestly don't think a $10 price tag is justifible for an ""update"" when other developers lately are giving the updated versions of their games for free if they met a certain ceteria (e.g. Darksiders II, BioShock, Skyrim). Not to mention I'm not fond of the redesigns of Valkyl and especially not Dr. Julia Carson in EX.Another reason I'm not giving this game a recommendation is how Extend Studios had the nerve to take advantage of the blacklash Mighty No. 9 is suffering through to ""promote"" sales of their game. They have to nerve to put the game on sale just around the time when the game was going on sale anyways during Steam's Summer Sale a few months ago for the sake of bashing Inafune. What was that 2% difference between the 77% for your ""mighty"" discount and the 75% discount during the Summer Sale supposed to represent, your respect for a struggling developer? Seriously, kicking people while they're down just because of your petty ""disappointment"" with Mighty No. 9 has become your business practice now? Sadly I'm probably the only one who sees this sort of practice as mean-spirited, underhanded, disgusting, and outright unprofessional. Hopefully A.R.E.S. will be more fun to play in Combat Core, but honestly, rather than working on an Episode 2 for this game (I'm sure you'll figure that out), I think what Extend Studios should be doing is work on their people skills.-EDIT-Recently bought Mighty No. 9 on PC, it runs and plays like an absolute dream for me.♥♥♥♥♥♥your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Extend Studios, you greedy selfish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

												ARES is pretty great. Mega Man-esque action and a great soundtrack by the guys who did the Iji soundtrack. The boss fights are frantic in hard mode. The only gripe I have is the need to farm materials to get SS rank, but if you don't care about tha t it's a good game, good for speedrunning and no-damage runs too.			"

												It's been a while since i've played a good sidescroller for PC but i am pleased to say, ares is JUST the thing. Minimal story (note, there IS a decent enough story, but it doesn't get in the way whatsoever) upgrades are a nice amazing touch and they don't completely break the game. As a bonus grinding the necessary materials took me only about half an hour to max all upgrades. Exploration is VERY rewarding as you can find various upgrades that either lower crafting costs or enhance your abilities. The bosses are FUN to fight and tough as nails until you get the patterns right. While the game certainly isn't a breeze, the difficulty plus the satisfaction of nailing down a difficult pattern is on par with the satisfaction of doing so in old NES classics such as ninja gaiden and megaman (from which ares draws a lot of inspiration) On the downside jumping is the worst kind of clunky. It works perfectly under normal conditions but the jumping is just a FEW pixels off. Not much normally, but on stages of heavy hurried platforming deaths galore if you don't perform a FLAWLESS jump.I got the game from indiegala on special for $2.60 but i'm having more fun with it than other AAA titles, as such with all it has to offer, i would rate this a 8/10 the game is VERY addictive and satisfying even if the jumping is off other than that what keeps this from being a truly stellar (read: future classic) is how little risk they took, as well as how little tools they drew from the games they paid homage to. not just weapons, but collectible armor pieces (megaman x) would have been AMAZING coupled with bigger open world environments a-la- metroidvania would have been even more amazing. Icing on the cake would have been a ledge climbing mechanic such as metroid fusion-onwards and this game would have stood its ground with the greats, probably knocked out a few.as it stands now however it's still an amazing game. i you HAVE the money, i suggest you buy it even if just for the sweet sweet nostalgia value			"

												If you're a megaman fan, it's a good idea to pick this one up. The stages are set up so that you're not always just rushing in one direction to the end. You find weapons and abilities that you can upgrade, as well as craft certain useable items throughout the game. Being able to craft repair kits in stage makes the game a bit more forgiving, but you waste materials that you would rather use on upgrades. Crafting can also be a bit annoying sometimes because it feels needlessly split amongst 3 different kinds of materials, when all of them are used when crafting any item, and only the yellow ones seem to be a bit more scarce than the others. The slides are a little hard to execute with a controller. If you use a PS3/4 Controller using DS#Tool, it will force-bind movement to the analog stick, which might make certain movements a little more complicated than I wanted, but this could be fixed by using something like Joy2Key instead.Despite a few nuances in the game, It was pretty fun to play. It only takes a couple hours to beat for the seasoned veteran in platformers, but there are also many things that are easily missed or passed on the first playthrough. The stage system allows you to easily revisit these areas, so it's not like you have to play through the whole game.			"

												Belated review. A.R.E.S. is a decent 2D platformer/shooter which reminds me a bit of Contra and other similar games. Some reviews have made it sound like a Metroid style game, but it's not really an open-ended world. Rather, it consists of 4 or 5 linear stages that are played chronologically. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this, just that some other impressions of the game are a bit misleading. It's actually a fairly decent game, assuming you like this genre. There is a story, but I honestly didn't follow it all that cloely, as it was largely unnecessary. The main draw is jumping and shooting stuff. The game is also fairly challenging, especially if trying to achieve high ranks for each level. It can also be completely in just a few hours. All in all it's a decent game that lacks the sort of polish one might see in AAA titles. Worth checking out if you are a fan of this genre and can get it cheap.			"

The gameplay is a little bit hard when you use keyboard and mouse, but you get use to it after some time.The game is easy even on the hard mode, but it is hard to get SS grades and take all the achivements.I recommend you to buy it only if you find it in a promotion with less than US$5,00.I bought the game because some friends compared it with Megaman and Metroid, but I didn't feel that it look as any of those.

												This game probably tries to appeal to fans of retro games in the style of Mega Man and Mega Man X, that was my impression. Another impression I had was that it tried to be more accessible.Lowering difficulty is not a problem, but the game was not adjusted to be both easier AND fun. It's just an unchallenging game that will probably bore you after a while, even if it is very short.That is because the game misses the point that games like Mega Man had few levels because the difficulty was so high that it would take you a while to beat. This is short, easy and with few variations. But the soundtrack is not too bad. The problem is that if you're in the target audience for this game, you probably know of better games and expect something you won't get out of this.And that is the biggest argument against this game. It's not that it's not that great, but it's that even at a price tag of only $9.99 compared to bigger budget titles, there are much better options everywhere at a lower or very similar price, like buying Mega Man X on Virtual Console or other retro-styled games like Super Meat Boy or VVVVVV or you could always just save that money for a higher costing but way better alternative.It's a very weak recommend at best.

Bosses feel much more impressive than you, easy or hard to your taste, beating them doesn't feel like you just won a piece of a puzzle.You gain currency to buy upgrades, controls are good with a controller IIRC. This review has been a while past playing.

												If you're considering buying...Words of warning: 1) THIS IS NOT A MEGAMAN REPLACEMENT2) THERE IS A NEWER VERSION RELEASED NOWA.R.E.S. will remind you of the Blue Bomber, initially, but you'll quickly find this to run its own course.A.R.E.S. hails back to 2D platforming style with a surprising amount of capability. The levels are adequately designed and secrets are there for you if you're willing to find them. That is about where the similarities between Megaman and A.R.E.S. end.What A.R.E.S. ends up being I can only liken to a bullet hell, Dark Souls, side-scrolling 2D platformer hybrid; particularly in the boss fights. Where trial-and-error and graze-point margin escapes from damage are key to you living long enough to fire back. Challenging, but doable.You have a leveling system for your weapons and need various parts to upgrade them, so you may end up with a little bit of grinding before facing down boss opponents as you will likely want to do more than chip damage to them.The levels themselves are well done, as noted above, and generally challenging enough. The atmosphere is appropriate and the game feels like it should alude to much more coming...that said, the game is quite short and never goes further on the story.The major point that might turn people off about A.R.E.S. is the controls, which require you to effectively track both your mouse and your character's location and aim appropriately.This can cause issues, as you may not always be in the center of your screen, causing you to miss your target because of a change in your position and not adjusting your aim location to the new line of sight.In short it's a more complicated game than Megaman to play as you need to think in several directions.I know a common concern from others has been input lag, but I hadn't run into that at all in my playing, so I would give it a positive here where others would not.Over-all I'd say A.R.E.S. is worth a play at $5 and I have no regrets in buying it at the time. However, there is a newer version out to buy so if you can put up the $10 for the expanded version, I would reccommend doing so.			"

												A.R.E.S is a fun side-scrolling platformer, kinda like Megaman games (the first thing it made me thought of). It provided some decent challenge (at least if you play on Hard difficulty) and the storyline was a pass. You unlock 4 weapons throughout the game which you can upgrade into stronger versions, 5 levels each with its own boss, so the whole game was fairly short and could be finished within 3-4 hours. Although, there is a lot of replayability value if you want to upgrade all your weapons, find all the secrets and get perfect SS score on each level, and other things that are listed in the achievements.For $5, I'd say the game wasn't bad and definitely worth trying. However, I do want to point out that there is a similar game called A.R.E.S: Extinction Agenda EX which is available for $5 extra (if you already own this game) and is apparently an improved version of this game with more content. I haven't got to play the EX version yet, but I'd say that this game has at least earned my recommendation.			"

												This is a side-scrolling platformer shooter in the same vein as Mega Man, except you can shoot in any direction, not pick the order of the stages, and you can upgrade your weapons on the fly provided you have enough of the three materials enemies drop.  The game is kinda short clocking in at only five stages, but there is some replay value in not only trying to max out the weapons and grenades, but also in stage rankings.  The achievements seem fairly difficult, as some require great stage ranks, which will take some time and memorization.  For a first game in the series, this isn't really too bad of a game.  It won't take you very long to beat, and it has some staying power beyond that.			"

Well, this isn't a flash game, but it surely feels like one. The plot is dry and cliche, movement is not easy, and the graphics feel bland and repetitive. The only redeeming quality of this game, really, is that you can collect and upgrade. The plot really isn't worth playing through, the action is somewhat boring, and the characters are uninteresting. The bosses have some variety, but it doesn't stick out enough to really affect the general feel of the game.

												This is a side-scrolling platformer shooter in the same vein as Mega Man, except you can shoot in any direction, not pick the order of the stages, and you can upgrade your weapons on the fly provided you have enough of the three materials enemies drop.  The game is kinda short clocking in at only five stages, but there is some replay value in not only trying to max out the weapons and grenades, but also in stage rankings.  The achievements seem fairly difficult, as some require great stage ranks, which will take some time and memorization.  For a first game in the series, this isn't really too bad of a game.  It won't take you very long to beat, and it has some staying power beyond that.			"

												A.R.E.S is a fun side-scrolling platformer, kinda like Megaman games (the first thing it made me thought of). It provided some decent challenge (at least if you play on Hard difficulty) and the storyline was a pass. You unlock 4 weapons throughout the game which you can upgrade into stronger versions, 5 levels each with its own boss, so the whole game was fairly short and could be finished within 3-4 hours. Although, there is a lot of replayability value if you want to upgrade all your weapons, find all the secrets and get perfect SS score on each level, and other things that are listed in the achievements.For $5, I'd say the game wasn't bad and definitely worth trying. However, I do want to point out that there is a similar game called A.R.E.S: Extinction Agenda EX which is available for $5 extra (if you already own this game) and is apparently an improved version of this game with more content. I haven't got to play the EX version yet, but I'd say that this game has at least earned my recommendation.			"

												A sad example of all style and no substance.ARES: Extinction Agenda tries its best recapture the charm of golden age sidescrollers, the kind I played growing up. It's pretty clear that Mega Man was in the mind of the developer when they crafted this. The entire game bleeds with '90's nostalgia and it genuinely feels like a game from that era. It fits the role so well.Too bad it's only acting the role; the game is a mess of horribly stiff controls, unimaginative level design, and uninspired combat. That's all there really is to it; it's boring.Skip on this.			"

												I really wish that I could recommend this game.It has cool graphics, an awsome soundtrack, a weapon upgrade system and pretty tough boss fights when you play on hard(I can't say anything about normal mode, sorry).A.R.E.S. is obviously inspired by Megaman and it has no reason to hide itself.Unfortunatly, this is everything I can say about this game.It has almost no story, just a minor plot, which doesn't surprise, if you know it has only five short levels.Each level takes about five to 15 minutes and when you play them for the second or third time, this even goes down to 2,5 to 9 minutes.So basically, it's more like a polished minigame.I give a 4 out of 10If you can manage to grab on a -75% sale, go ahead.Otherwise I recommend to stay away.

												This game is not worth the money you will spend on it. The gameplay is unoriginal, jumping between platforms is difficult at times, the enemies are boring, and attacks from the final boss are hectic and near impossible to dodge. The chosen style of art is not appealing, the animation is not well done, and the sound effects do not fit their actions. The campaign was only a few hours long--and could probably be finished quicker--and was not worth the amount I spent on it during the sale.			"

												It is a short game; the campaign only lasted a couple of hours my first playthrough, but this game is action packed nonetheless. I have heard comparisons of this game to Megaman X, but it feels like a more action packed and shorter version of Metroid. I did not play this enough to unlock all the achievements, or find all the collectibles. I just did multiple playthroughs with different difficulties. The boss fights were enjoyable, but the rest of the game was a bit easy in comparison; easily disposable trash enemies and no thought-provoking/skillful platforming. Don't get me wrong though, I did enjoy it, otherwise I would not replay it thrice, but if you are the kind of buyer who wants bang for their buck, I do warn that the story felt awfully short, and to get full enjoyment, you should plan to do multiple playthroughs and aim for some of the more challenging achievements.

												I bought a bundle just for this game, and for the most part, i'm not disappointed. If you enjoy Megaman, you'll feel at home with this. It has a fixed theme that escalates it art style, and provides gameplay that is fluid, even offering a crutch for player less adapted to it. For the most part, it's a fun, short experience. My only con is the game feels EXTREMELY slow, in terms of character and enemy animation. I had to check several times what my FPS was. It feels like it hinders the great animation cycles but once you get used to it, it's dandy.			"

												Personal Rating: 4 of 10If you are familiar with the Megaman series back in the days, you will definitely see the similarity here in this game. You control a futurisitc armored character in this 2D character with 3D environment side scrolling where you collects scraps to upgrade your weapon and equipment. However I must warn you that this game is much more challenging. I played this game using a game pad and how I loathe the jumping part. It sometimes does not register the jump when you press. Also there are many situation in the game when you die almost immediately causing to repeat a scene over and over again.If you liked Megaman and love to take games challenges to a greater height then this is the game for you.

												Megaman finally met his match, A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda is action side-scroller game. You play as ARES who must stop evil robots from spreading on space station  and save the day as always. As not much of inspiring storyline gameplay serves game well. You litteraly do run and gun thing all over in 5 different areas, and fighting final bosses. The game itself is fun and enjoyable, you can destroy robots and pick up different materials to produce valuable items to help you in your quest or use them to upgrade your weapons. Soundtrack is great, gameplay is awesome, story is ok, backgrounds are cool. To sum up everything ARES is worth your time and won't let you down. One of the best indie ever made.			"

Can you live up to the task or will you be reduced to nuts and bolts? You are Ares, the first Zytron immune robot. A symbol of how far human technology has come, you are the most advanced robot in existence; built to run faster, jump higher, and fire quicker. In addition to these core attributes, your design includes a system for converting spare parts and resources into valuable items, armor, and weaponry. You will need to use everything at your disposal in order to reach and rescue the survivors aboard the Zytron infected space station.			"

												If the classic Megaman X games (X-X3) ever had a modern spiritual successor, I feel it would be something like this game.Everything from the Boss Battles to the Music (again, sounds like a modern spiritual successor to the 16-bit sounds of classic Megaman X) are exciting, the animation is enjoyable, levels were well designed, and the story (while short) is gripping.  Only complaint (If I can even call it that): I want MORE. The game was relatively short, and I could see some people doing a speed-run fairly quickly. I REALLY hope a sequel is on the agenda for the developers, I'd love to see not only more levels/weapons/abilities but more of the world of A.R.E.S. and the main character.			"

												Okay, so a) this is definitely not the type of game I usually go for, and b) I only played the first level, but.... it's okay, I guess. I mean, I had some issues with the controls, but then I'm playing with my mouse and keyboard, so maybe that makes some difference. It's a basic side-scrolling shooter, heavy shades of Megaman I thought, and that's all well and good, but it's not something I feel I desperately want to play again. The graphics are kind of a fun mix of sci-fi grunge and cutesy animation; the music...well, I don't really remember the music at the moment, and I just finished playing it, so. Not memorable, I guess. I would say, short of the occasional frustration I felt with jumping, it's not bad.			"

												Pros+Nice visuals+Interesting upgrade system+Good background music+New game plus and grades encourages replayingCons-Sound effects are dull-Story is corny (There's an achievement for watching all the cutscenes, good luck with that)-Dying at bosses will have you going through their intro and cutscene every time you face them-Enemies can shoot you off screen but you can't shoot them-It's on the short side (5 levels)Bottom LineIt's an indie title with its inspiration obviously coming from Mega Man. It's got a nice style and an interesting weapon system. There's definitely an emphasis on replaying levels, whether it's to collect pieces to upgrade weapons or to get a better score for that level. Honestly I never felt compelled to do either. I upgraded my favorite weapon to max (level 3) and did so for another. This is a title for those wanting a challenge and like getting graded on doing well. Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale.			"

												I'll keep it short but sweet.Megaman (jump and run levels) + Turrican 2 (music and guns) = A.R.E.S.The only gripe I had about this game was at the start, I thought the graphics were a bit.  Crap, really.  Lets say, flash-like characters and animation (paper clip style). But it does eventually grow on you and gets pounced on by the great gameplay this has to offer.Whilst there are only 5 stages, the story (I played on hard start > finish) only takes around 2 hours, and I had a bugger of a time at the final boss ...

												I bought this game because I loved the soundtrack. It's a shame it's the only good part about the game.The game isn't bad, but it's rather mediocre. The main levels are filled with enemies that oppose almost no resistance, contrasted with bosses who have attacks that are literally impossible to dodge with your slow character. To compensate, you have a lot of health, and the ability to buy health packs from the pause menu, which breaks the already low difficulty. Quite a long ways from the  twitchy experiences of Mega Man and Metal Slug.The game also has that unpolished feel that screams ""indie"" in a bad way. Weird animations, unbalanced weapons (Why use grenades at all when I can do the same damage in 3 shots), cliche story (humens r EVIL!1)... It's also pretty short (~2 hours), though 100% completion probably needs a lot more due to the upgrade system needing to redo levels to gather materials.All in all I'm prettry disapointed, but at least I'll have some good songs to add to my library.

												For people who like platformers, in the vein of games such as the Mega Man X series. The level design is nicely done and the difficulty ramping follows a logical path, while it throws you curve balls every now and then - in the form of subtle (and some not so subtle), unexpected gameplay changes - to keep it interesting and refreshing to play. It has a great art direction, as well as power-driven rock/electronica musical scores that fit so well with it.A note, however; I highly recommend playing this on a controller with at least one analogue stick if possible. I questioned it's negligence of the d-pad on the default controller layout at first, but after playing, it feels right - on both my Xbox 360 and PS3 controller.These developers show obvious love for their work, and I regret not picking this up earlier.

												A.R.E.S. has its strong points- retro platform shooting that brings back the days of the Megaman X series.  The music is good, the graphics are adequate, and it's lots of fun to just shoot things and jump from platform to platform like the old days.But the game has problems too.  Terrible slideshow cutscenes, a terrible script, some hit-detection issues, and worst- lots of spots for blind-jump-death.  The game teaches you to ""explore"" for hidden secrets by jumping in places that look like fatally bottomless pits by hiding goodies there every so often.  But half the time or better, the bottomless pits are really just instant death.It's a short game, but fun to go through a second time once you've unlocked the good weapons.  I can't recommend spending a lot of money on it- maybe $3-5?  But if you get it as a freebie with a bundle, give it a shot and you might enjoy it.			"

												A.R.E.S. is a shooter/platformer game starring a robot in his quest to protect humanity. Any similarities with other famous titles end there, as the flagship high attention to level design that is so present in most installments of Megaman games is completely ignored with this game.I completed my first playthrough of A.R.E.S. on the ""Hard"" difficulty so I cant speak for the normal one. As said in my intro the biggest point of disappointment in the game was the level design. There is a total of 5 levels in the game, all but the last one very straightfoward in the sense that you just have to move to the right while killing enemies... But that's it. The enemies are seemingly placed at random in the levels (Which also have almost no variation. We could describe all the scenarios as ""orange factory"", ""red factory"", etc) neither enemy placement or overall level details and progression had any though put into it.Another point that juts out when playing the game is it's controls. You move with the left control stick and shoot 360º with the other stick, using the ""A"" button on the xbox 360 gamepad to jump/double jump. You start right off the bat with the ability to double jump and because of that all platforming segments of the game have to be based around it. This is really bad because the jump itself is very awkward, and when most of the game depends on it that can be a very frustrating experience. You will more often than not simply do the ""double jump"" animation instead of doing the first one, which will make you fall to your death a lot.Although failing a mission is simply considered a ""slap on the wrist"", because the game instantly lets you continue from the last checkpoint with no ""Continues"" system implemented.Another detail that shows how uninspired the levels are is the fact that all of them have an obligatory ""Enemy gauntlet"" room, where you have to stay in a single screen fighting some waves of enemies until the game is satisfied.The bosses, aside from the last one, are actually ok when compared to the rest of the game. Although they dont have many attack patterns and are mostly just giant damage sponges they are far from the worst problem the game had.The game tries to give you various shallow mechanics, like having 2 types of granades that clear different obstacles and having you craft your items (Like grenades, health pickups and upgrades) from fallen enemy parts and even giving you the ability to call from air support to deal damage to all enemies in the screen, but due to the short lenght of the game (About 1,5h from start to finish) they are as previously mentioned shallow and are only there as failed experiments. The game also gives you multiple weapons but I was never complied to use them, prefering to stick to my default blaster that was already upgraded to the final level (3).Overall A.R.E.S. was a very unpleasant experience, showing that it takes more than a couple of capable people to make a satisfying game. The game is short, uninspired and terribly bland and that's what makes it get an overall 3/10 from me.			"

												A.R.E.S: Extinction Agenda is a side scrolling action platform game.You play as a robot called ARES through linear levels with mid-bosses and bosses at the end of those levels. As you defeat enemies and blow up crates, you can find three types of resources which can be used to upgrade your abilities and weapons. You acquire more weapons as you progress through the game.The storyline is nothing amazing, but engaging enough. The game itself looks beautiful and plays like the old Megaman X games on the SNES. The levels have varied enemy types and can be challenging. There are also several difficulty modes and a ranking system based on how well you perform in each level. My only complaint is that it is far too short...with only 5-6 levels, you can finish the storyline very quickly with full upgrades. The DLC for the game simply includes alternate skins for ARES and music, nothing that really adds to the gameplay.The game itself is great, but you don't get very much for what you pay. I also doubt any further DLCs with expanded levels or extras will be added. I hope if they ever release a sequel, it will be much longer.			"

												So yeah, if you're looking for a good 2D shooter/platformer like I was when I picked this game up . . . keep looking. I recommend Bionic Commando Re-Armed instead, a much better game than this piece of fetid robo garbage. Seriously, the jumping is wonky, the shooting handles poorly, and the art style is the definition of unimaginative (and pretty lazily animated in most cases), the music all sounds like drunken remixes of Sonic 2's casino levels, and the game's larger design concepts are a mish mash of thrown together ideas that amateurs would think are cool but just lead to a muddled mess. I know this is an older indie title and that the folks making it couldn't compete with the greats out there making excellent 2D shooters, but even taking that into consideration, there's really very little to recommend here. Hopefully the folks who made this learned a lot and will make something better next time, but if you're just a player looking for a good time I highly recommend you move along to the next possibility. A super-fighting robot A.R.E.S ain't. Play it for the steam cards if that matters to you, then uninstall.			"

												If you've ever been a hardcore Megaman fan like I have been, then you'll probably fall in love immediately. Short, sweet, and to the point, it's obviously not a story-driven game, more so the story is just an excuse to go to one location to the next blasting robot after robot into oblivion much like the Megaman games were. It's a very short game, I was able to complete it in a couple of sittings, and it took me around five, or six hours to complete. It has a healthy amount of weapons to play around with, upgrades, and hidden goodies to find. It provides a moderate challenge depending on what difficulty you play it on. My only complaint is that I think the game could use a little more polish, but that issue is a minor one. Overall for the time I spent with it I had a blast, and left me hoping for a sequel just so I could blast more robots all over again.			"

The character design is great non the less. All in all visually is nice but synergy would be nice. Gameplay isn't something new and needs some work as well as controls to be perfect. Also the level design is a bit cramped so I found myself quite often taking hits because I had like a small chance to dodge.I'll only recommend this if you love the genre and aren't claustrophobic.

It's probably a matter of personal preference, but game is not aesthetically pleasing. Monsters don't have ""personality."" Animations are boring. That's not to say the graphics are bad. Sound: The game noise level is too high. Music and sounds don't complement each other. Instead, they mix into a mess. Gameplay: The story is forgetable. Level design is decent and prompts interest in exploration due to secrets and upgrades. Respawning enemies become annoying, though. The game is pretty hard even on easy.

												A.R.E.S. Is a side scrolling platformer in which you take the form of a robot named Ares.  Using your gun, you shoot enemies as you progress through the levels.  Think of it as “Megaman” meets “Metroid”.  You jump, shoot enemies and dodge your enemies oncoming attacks.   There are boss battles at the end of the levels that aren't too difficult.  It just requires you to learn there patterns to be able to defeat them.  You can gather some items to craft.  There isn't a wide variety of choices on crafting though.  The game isn't particularly challenging but it's not easy either.  The game's music is pretty good, I enjoyed listening to it as I made my way through each level.  Overall I think it's a pretty good game.  I enjoyed playing it and I'm glad I was able to pick it up on sale.  I think that at $10 it's still a good price but if you're unsure then get it on sale like I did.			"

												I'll keep it short but sweet.Megaman (jump and run levels) + Turrican 2 (music and guns) = A.R.E.S.The only gripe I had about this game was at the start, I thought the graphics were a bit.  Crap, really.  Lets say, flash-like characters and animation (paper clip style). But it does eventually grow on you and gets pounced on by the great gameplay this has to offer.Whilst there are only 5 stages, the story (I played on hard start > finish) only takes around 2 hours, and I had a bugger of a time at the final boss ... Grrr!Bets that SoundDuck studios are heavily inspired by Chris Huelsbeck!			"

												A.R.E.S is a fast paced RPG-type action side-scrolling shooter, with alot of great music, flashy graphics and plenty of firepower. Take control of Ares; The first technologically advanced robot with an immunity to the machine infecting virus; Zytron - With 4 different guns at your dissposell, and 2 types of grenades for added fire power, fight through the infected robots and help save Dr.Julia Carson from the Zytron. When in trouble, call for help from your Eye-In-The-Sky-AI, Valkyl, and her Valkyl Lazer, which will help with thing get stuffy and you need some breathing space: Her lazer destroys everything in your line of fire. With the Steam DLC, use the Berserker Blaster, with the power to rip through multiple enemies in one shot! Albeit short, this game is worth a try, and is good for when you feel like abit of Gun-Assisted gymnastics.			"

												A.R.E.S. has its strong points- retro platform shooting that brings back the days of the Megaman X series.  The music is good, the graphics are adequate, and it's lots of fun to just shoot things and jump from platform to platform like the old days.But the game has problems too.  Terrible slideshow cutscenes, a terrible script, some hit-detection issues, and worst- lots of spots for blind-jump-death.  The game teaches you to ""explore"" for hidden secrets by jumping in places that look like fatally bottomless pits by hiding goodies there every so often.  But half the time or better, the bottomless pits are really just instant death.It's a short game, but fun to go through a second time once you've unlocked the good weapons.  I can't recommend spending a lot of money on it- maybe $3-5?  But if you get it as a freebie with a bundle, give it a shot and you might enjoy it.			"

												I bought this game because I loved the soundtrack. It's a shame it's the only good part about the game.The game isn't bad, but it's rather mediocre. The main levels are filled with enemies that oppose almost no resistance, contrasted with bosses who have attacks that are literally impossible to dodge with your slow character. To compensate, you have a lot of health, and the ability to buy health packs from the pause menu, which breaks the already low difficulty. Quite a long ways from the  twitchy experiences of Mega Man and Metal Slug.The game also has that unpolished feel that screams ""indie"" in a bad way. Weird animations, unbalanced weapons (Why use grenades at all when I can do the same damage in 3 shots), cliche story (humens r EVIL!1)... It's also pretty short (~2 hours), though 100% completion probably needs a lot more due to the upgrade system needing to redo levels to gather materials.All in all I'm prettry disapointed, but at least I'll have some good songs to add to my library.

												This game is good. It is. Is it amazing? No, but if you're a fan of Mega Man, it's pretty much as good as you'll get until Mighty Number 9 or something. The artwork is heartbreakingly beautiful and it controls very well. Basically, this game is the child of Cave Story and Mega Man, which is a very natural combo. There aren't too many levels, but they're long. The bosses are gigantic and the fights are very satisfying, but, the plot is...well the plot is kinda iffy at best. The ending is pretty bad too. If you're someone who values a rewarding ending above all, might wanna skip this one. Overall, I recommend it on gameplay alone. The overall pros and cons in my eyes are the following:Pros:Stunning artwork Some Metroid style backtracking with rewardsGood level designDecent platformingSoundtrack fits the mood wellCons:Ending's a disapointmentNot much in the way of charactersSome of the jumps are iffy, not many but some.

												Achievement progress at time of writing: 15/24 (63%)This game is a very short Megaman-like game. The story is not terribly engaging, mainly ""Go here and kill this robot. Now go here and kill this robot"" and also very short, as I completed the game in about 2-3 hours. The mechanics are a little tricky, particularly the Grenade Jump (combined that grenades are limited and a bit uncommon to find) can make some sections frustrating. There is also not much done to encourage weapon variety in different situations (I just basically used the Blue gun the entire game).Overall, I would say unless you want an ok Megaman-esque game, I would give this a pass.

Was I suppose to just craft a few more repair kits? So that's what this boss is going to do, just charge, charge, charge.You know a good platform game when it push's your skills, you can walk up to the boss, have a slither of health left, yet you dart around your enemy, near misses, excitement galore.

												Basically a remake of the SNES era Megaman games. Not much at first glance, or even first play through, but this is one game that does unlocks and achievements well (i.e. they add depth to game play rather than just being annoying fetch quests and lists to tick off). Because of this the game itself doesn't really even start until you've finished it once and unlocked abilities needed to uncover secrets in previous areas. While this could be annoying, the entire game is very brief (you could do a run through in under an hour if you know what you are doing), so game play is much more focused on perfecting how you play rather than on progression to new areas. Probably not for everyone, and definitely not the best PC platformer out there, but if you can get it cheap (it seems like this is in a bundle every other week now) and you like old school platformers this is definitely worth a run through.

Generic anime art for characters, monsters are generically robotic and have stilted movements, music is repetitive (Get Item fanfare in particular is obnoxious, long, and inappropriately trying to be cool), and any sort of actiony cutscene tries to be cool and fails because its all styleless chilche..None of the enemies are fun to fight in any way including bosses.  W+M1 is the way to go for every weapon.  Platformers are one of my fav game types and the platforming in this game is TERRIBLE!  As far as I can tell the game is short too, and there's no real reason to replay any stage except to slightly upgrade stats or grind for items (the game even suggests this!).  Haven't beaten it yet, but my peek at the level select screen also suggests the game is quite short.I'm glad I didn't pay more than the $1.25 split from Inide Royale, because this game really sucks.

A game that people claim is a lot like Mega Man X however going through it personally I didn't acquire the fun and excitement from this.The game plays well and performs fine; you can shoot in any direction you want and the controls are manageable for both KB+M and a controller, there are some secrets laying about, weapons you've acquired can be upgraded via the ""materials"" you acquire from enemy drops, and the bosses get progressively tougher, It all mostly works where my only minor problem is that there are obstacles in the way of the main path and if you don't have any of the right grenades you have to constantly keep making a specific type of grenade in the upgrade menu just so you can use it to get past obstacles that you'll frequently come by.The real kicker here, however, that made me not like this game at all is how bland it is. There are a lot of enemies that come by but there's no sort of excitement or satisfaction when gunning them down and there's little to no challenge when fighting them.I didn't find any noticeable differences when upgrading my equipment and it's a bit of a hassle to try to upgrade them especially since they require the same materials you need to make grenades which I used mainly for getting past obstacles.I didn't finish the game but looking at the level select screen it looked like there was only about 5 big levels.I was hoping to enjoy this game somewhat seeing how pretty it was but unfortunately it just felt overall boring.

												I bought this game because I loved the soundtrack. It's a shame it's the only good part about the game.The game isn't bad, but it's rather mediocre. The main levels are filled with enemies that oppose almost no resistance, contrasted with bosses who have attacks that are literally impossible to dodge with your slow character. To compensate, you have a lot of health, and the ability to buy health packs from the pause menu, which breaks the already low difficulty. Quite a long ways from the  twitchy experiences of Mega Man and Metal Slug.The game also has that unpolished feel that screams ""indie"" in a bad way. Weird animations, unbalanced weapons (Why use grenades at all when I can do the same damage in 3 shots), cliche story (humens r EVIL!1)... It's also pretty short (~2 hours), though 100% completion probably needs a lot more due to the upgrade system needing to redo levels to gather materials.All in all I'm prettry disapointed, but at least I'll have some good songs to add to my library.

												A.R.E.S. has its strong points- retro platform shooting that brings back the days of the Megaman X series.  The music is good, the graphics are adequate, and it's lots of fun to just shoot things and jump from platform to platform like the old days.But the game has problems too.  Terrible slideshow cutscenes, a terrible script, some hit-detection issues, and worst- lots of spots for blind-jump-death.  The game teaches you to ""explore"" for hidden secrets by jumping in places that look like fatally bottomless pits by hiding goodies there every so often.  But half the time or better, the bottomless pits are really just instant death.It's a short game, but fun to go through a second time once you've unlocked the good weapons.  I can't recommend spending a lot of money on it- maybe $3-5?  But if you get it as a freebie with a bundle, give it a shot and you might enjoy it.			"

												I'll keep it short but sweet.Megaman (jump and run levels) + Turrican 2 (music and guns) = A.R.E.S.The only gripe I had about this game was at the start, I thought the graphics were a bit.  Crap, really.  Lets say, flash-like characters and animation (paper clip style). But it does eventually grow on you and gets pounced on by the great gameplay this has to offer.Whilst there are only 5 stages, the story (I played on hard start > finish) only takes around 2 hours, and I had a bugger of a time at the final boss ... Grrr!Bets that SoundDuck studios are heavily inspired by Chris Huelsbeck!			"

Good for a quick play through if you can get it a price that will meet that expectation.  If you're looking for something deeper, with more content, better story or high production values, you'll be disappointed.  It is what it is: A short, not bad little action game.

												This game is good. It is. Is it amazing? No, but if you're a fan of Mega Man, it's pretty much as good as you'll get until Mighty Number 9 or something. The artwork is heartbreakingly beautiful and it controls very well. Basically, this game is the child of Cave Story and Mega Man, which is a very natural combo. There aren't too many levels, but they're long. The bosses are gigantic and the fights are very satisfying, but, the plot is...well the plot is kinda iffy at best. The ending is pretty bad too. If you're someone who values a rewarding ending above all, might wanna skip this one. Overall, I recommend it on gameplay alone. The overall pros and cons in my eyes are the following:Pros:Stunning artwork Some Metroid style backtracking with rewardsGood level designDecent platformingSoundtrack fits the mood wellCons:Ending's a disapointmentNot much in the way of charactersSome of the jumps are iffy, not many but some.

												When I think of A.R.E.S., I can't help but think of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. They're totally different games; ARES is a 2D action-platformer and STALKER is an open-world FPS, but they share one critical thing: nobody expects their acronym to actually stand for anything. It's the name of the main character; any further explanation is left to the imagination. However, with only four letters, it's not terribly difficult to guess what they might be.Always Riddling Enemies with ShotsARES: Extinction Agenda plays something like the Megaman series if it was invented twenty years later. Controls boil down to variations on jumping and shooting, the former feeling fantastic and the latter feeling less so. The combat is fast and frantic; if you manage to get a bead on them, enemies die in seconds. You aim & fire either via mouse cursor or analog stick, making attacking & dodging independent. This is for the best, as ARES moves a tad too ridigly for its own good especially when it comes to the air.  The designers seem to have been at least somewhat aware of this, and tend to stray away from insta-kill death pits, which can swing the difficulty from challenging to frustrating. Overall, the gameplay remains solid and plays to its best points, though there are speed bumps along the way.The game also includes a ranking system for each level, influenced by a number of simple factors. Did you find the secret area? Did you get hit? Did you go through quickly? It also takes into consideration a combo system, which counts the number of consecutive shots you've landed without taking damage. It's a simple system that rewards skill and practice well. The issue, however, is that it trivializes slower weapons when you can get six hits on enemies that would normally only take one or two. It's a small problem, but a definite oversight.Animations Rarely Exceed SubstandardARES' aesthetic appeal is a mixed bag. In screenshots and stills, the game look marvelous, and rightfully so; the environments are carefully detailed, maintaining a consistent art style that's a pleasure to look at. Sadly, this means little when half of the animations look like something off of an old Flash game. Most of the time, you're too preoccupied by the fast-paced gameplay to notice a laughably strange wiggle-to-death animation, but it becomes hard to forgive when some of the main bosses disassemble in the same spectacularly shoddy fashion. Overall, the graphics are well done but inconsistent.A Really Excellent SoundtrackOne of the best aspects of the game is its soundtrack (which is free to listen to here: http://hyperduck.bandcamp.com/album/a-r-e-s-extinction-agenda ) Electric guitar combines with industrial synth to amplify the already intense environment. It's a really standout part of the game, definitely worth picking up separately.Actually Rather Enjoyable; ShortAt its best, ARES is explosive. Satisfying shooting, detailed graphics, and a supercharged soundtrack all combine to make ARES' high points memorable. However, the game fizzles out far too soon, lasting only a couple hours. Enjoy it while it lasts; its replay value is limited.			"

												Critiques:-Art style is nice, but because the enemies' art designs are busy, they blend in a little too well with the environment. Could use more contrasting or brighter colors for visibility.-There is an odd dead zone where your bullets won't hit which is exactly next to your character's hitbox.-Can't pinpoint the precise issue, but the jumping feels ""floaty"".Other than those issues, a very proficient game.

Just grind for materials and buy 10 medkits). The enemies are bland and the bosses are unpredictable and not very memorable.The 2D art varies quite alot, but the 3D backgrounds look very nice all through the game.

Enemies drop trash that is collected for upgrades so there's always some form of progress.  I likely won't be earning the SS rank Genesis suit, but I can still enjoy playing and improve at my own pace. =)Checkpoints are generally well-placed.  However, there are a few instances where the player has to wait for (or speed through) in-game cutscenes.  Expect to be annoyed by dialogue before the final boss battle and a few animations involving minibosses.			"

												I may have played too little to have a valuable review. But the fact that I've played so little is explained by the fact that the game didn't catch my attention. I like plataformers and games of the same style (I love Megaman!). It is just that the story is poor, the combat system doesn't offer any fun (you will just hold the button and follow the enemies with your aim. No enemy will offer you a challenge, not even the bosses, not even on hardest difficult) and the scenarios aren't that well designed (as do the enemies. You'll face the same enemies a thousand times).I think the ideia behind the game is not that bad, I just don't think they got the better out of it.3/10			"

												This game is similar to Mega Man in that you run and shoot. The problem I had with it is that the jumping is really awkward and overly difficult. It is so bad it made me stop playing inspite of really wanting to like the game. Gave it two tries, but it just isn't fun.  It is a shame since the game feels like it could have potential.			"

Like many of the arcade-style titles, this game emphasizes multiple replays until you've memorized the levels and perfected the boss fights. If you enjoy that kind of repitition, then I could tentatively recommend this game to you if it's on sale. For everyone else, this game is short and forgettable and not something I would recommend, especially not for the $10 asking price.Disclaimer: I got this game as part of an indie bundle and would not have purchased it otherwise.

												It's a good concept... a Megaman-esq action platformer shooter that isn't Megaman. It's got a great look and music that tickles all the right spots if you're nostalgic for the glory days of Megaman X. But while A.R.E.S. has some good moves and gadgets and the makings of a solid and exciting action game, it stumbles at every step of the way. The developers made every mistake in the book. It starts with the unfortunate controls that will have you endlessly fumbling your controller, despite the fact that none of the movements you're performing are original in any way and have been done better in every other game that features them. But it extends into the enemy, level, and boss designs (the end-boss is terrible), which will leave you cringing again and again. It's too many little details to list, but you'll be dying a lot and it will be for stupid reasons every time. That is, unless you play on easy (well, ""Normal"") and spam med packs. Which in retrospect I might recommend because at least it's less frustrating. But a game like this shouldn't have to rely on a big health meter to be playable. I make it sound like garbage, but if it weren't for the heap of frustrating niggles too big to sweep under any rug, I'd probably love this game. It's not long, and it's not very original, but the elements it brings together are definitely fun ones. If the controls were reworked properly, that alone would make this a lot more fun. The rest could be fixed with a day's worth of focus-testing and tweaking. Unfortunate that it wasn't.I didn't hate my time playing through this, and if you enjoy games of this nature you may not either, but there is a lot of potential here that got buried under the myriad of small but significant mis-judgements in design.

												A.R.E.S.: Extinction Agenda is a 2D platformer in the vein of Megaman (Except not as nearly hard)Short but sweet A.R.E.S. features a variety of levels and powers. Controls are tight and usually responsive. I had no issues in that regard. My biggest issue was the ""Dual stick"" movement and firing which although it allowed for you to fire in any direction, the jump button is still A. WHY?The storyline isn't particularly bad but it's pretty forgettable over all. I went into it with no knowledge of the game or it's sordid past so I feel like I dodged a bullet and was able to enjoy it more as a cheap one-off.If you're a fan of side scrolling platformers give A.R.E.S. a try.

												An interesting side scrolling action game similar to Megaman or Vectorman. It's a short game with decent controls that is generally forgettable. The player's character is too slow, there isn't enough variation in pacing or enemies, and although it is not sloppily produced - it never evoked any real emotion from me. Not recommended for most gamers due to a wealth of other superior games in the genre that have been out for decades.			"

												4/10What is this: Remember an oldie called ""Abuse?"" No? Well this games plays just like that game. It's a platformer where you have to use your mouse for aiming.Graphics: The game looks good. Colors are vibrant. Nothing particularly stands out, however. It's probably a matter of personal preference, but game is not aesthetically pleasing. Monsters don't have ""personality."" Animations are boring. That's not to say the graphics are bad. Sound: The game noise level is too high. Music and sounds don't complement each other. Instead, they mix into a mess. Gameplay: The story is forgetable. Level design is decent and prompts interest in exploration due to secrets and upgrades. Respawning enemies become annoying, though. The game is pretty hard even on easy. Verdict: If you are a fan of action shooter platformers, you may want to give it a try. Otherwise, there are better options out there. Peace, friendship, bubblegum!			"

												A.R.E.S: Extinction Agenda is a side scrolling action platform game.You play as a robot called ARES through linear levels with mid-bosses and bosses at the end of those levels. As you defeat enemies and blow up crates, you can find three types of resources which can be used to upgrade your abilities and weapons. You acquire more weapons as you progress through the game.The storyline is nothing amazing, but engaging enough. The game itself looks beautiful and plays like the old Megaman X games on the SNES. The levels have varied enemy types and can be challenging. There are also several difficulty modes and a ranking system based on how well you perform in each level. My only complaint is that it is far too short...with only 5-6 levels, you can finish the storyline very quickly with full upgrades. The DLC for the game simply includes alternate skins for ARES and music, nothing that really adds to the gameplay.The game itself is great, but you don't get very much for what you pay. I also doubt any further DLCs with expanded levels or extras will be added. I hope if they ever release a sequel, it will be much longer.			"

												Yes, many people have said this is your regular platforming, side-scrolling, shooter. In some ways, yes, they are correct. However, I would have to disagree that A.R.E.S. is anything more than ""regular"".First of all, I have to talk about the music. It has a taste of Megaman X in it with a pinch of awesomeness. While you make your way through the stages, scrapping the bots that stand in your way, you are more and more encouraged to continue the destuction. Once you hear the tracks, you'll want to listen while playing other titles too! More reason to pick up the soundtrack since it is available.Next I need to talk about the art style. It has a retro feel to it, but has a very polished look. You really get to admire the artwork during the boss fights. The way they move and represent attacks really breathes life into the game.Lastly I will touch on the gameplay. A.R.E.S. does not require a high skill in gaming to be able to pick this title up and get to the action. Of course, there are extras in the game that will require you to hone your skills, but are worth it in the end to make you a better bot buster! Let me mention the boss fights. Don't let the appearance of the boss on-screen fool you. They whip out attacks that will leave you dumbfounded about how to counter! While rough, it makes for fun fights.All-in-all I was able to finish the game fairly quickly, but for gamers that like completing all the side stuff and maxing out your abilities, this title will provide plenty of replayability without you having to sacrifice hundreds of hours.

												Hello, so here it's my review of A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda./======Video Review/======[GameOptions]There a very few options in general, they could have flesed out a lot more.- GameplayThe game only has two game play options, ""Combat Dificulty"" Normal or Hard and Vibration ON or OFF. For a 2D side scrolling game it's Ok to have this few options specially if it's a simple game.- AudioIn audio options there are only BackGroumd Music and SFX sliders it would be nice if it had a Master volume. Also the fact there is no Dialog slider of Subtittle Toggle tells me there is no voice acting.- GraphicsOnly the Resolution option and a full screen toggle. The resolution seem to be all standard needed.- ControlsFairly good control options, both Primary and an alternate key bindings for keyboard, also controller support which is petty much required for platformers.[Mechanics & GamePlay]Starting up a new game you get the option to pick a Difficulty and told you can switch it on the fly, in my playthrough i went with hard and didn't change it.Every level starts with a cutscene or a bit of dialog witch advances a little the story, dialogs can go a little too fast to read in cutscenes.The tutorial is fair, covers most basic controls and explains powerups as they are adquired. However there are a few that are not well explained if at all.The game is a plataformer shoott'em up, in the control style of a Twin Stick shooter. Start with a basic gun and as the game progresses you are given new weapons each one a little different from the rest, however beyond  fire rate, area of effect and damage they do not provide any new mechaincs to the game.The initial grenade you are given, does open a few new mechanics but none of them are used any point during the game.The game has a crafting system, in witch you can craft items like Repair Kits, and Granades, also to power up you weapons but is rather swallow, and i only used crating for recovering HP and the odd granade to open paths.The Power ups for your weapons are not really necessary, if you have good shootingand platform skills you can get by the entire game without an upgrade, even inhard mode.There are no health pick ups and your guns ammo is infinite, making the Repair Kits and grenades the only reason to craft.There are some health recovery rooms in some levels, where you heal by standing on them, but are few and actually seem out of place.The ammount of materials you can get in a given level is lower than the cost of the weapon upgrades meaning you are expected to replay levels or stick to a weapon, however given that you get them as the game progresses right up to the seccond to last level, there is no way for you to tell if you should save materials, so replay it is.You can find in the levels a few red or blue boxes some hidden, some in hard to get places or just off the path, this boxes are stats upgrades or lore logs. Some of them require power up you don't get until later in the game, this along with the costs of the weapon upgrades show the devs wannting to extend the life of the game.However, the way the levels are layedout they are petty much linear, you can only be going forward or backwards, this is obscured by making some parts of the level vertical, but there is always just one path, by no means this game comes close to a metroidvania. Also fairly early in the game while explainig some of the UI the game spoils the  fact there are only five levels.[Design Flaws]- CutscenesThere are a lot of cutscenes that are not skippable.- ControlsThere where a few odd choices for a few default key bindings, like the suit changebeen Ctrl+T!!???You cannot play using the keyboard and mouse if you hace a controller plugged in.The mouse is disbled while the controller is plugged in, you must remove it to regain mouse controlls, no need to restart the game thankfully.- Level DesignAfter or before a miniboss or boss fight the game will take control away from the player even if the player was in a locked room, also it would force you to pick up any power up, new weapon or upgrade after the fight by the same means.This is a very bad way to do things, you must not take control away from the player, or do it as little as posible.In every level there are this rooms where you are locked, where the enemies do not drop resources and spawn one at a time, this rooms only waste the player's time since are no challenge and serve no purpose but to slowdown the player.There a quite a few places where they expect you to basicaly do a leap of faith and hope you didn't just drop to a instant dead pit. At the start they seemed awere of this and used arrows to tell you it was safe, but the devs only did this once.Some enemies are placed in spots where they are hidden by foreGround objects, making it so you can get damaged for free. This were a far too common occurrence.While others are placed in such a way you get hit by them literally as you walk into the room, this is far more rare but it happened enough to be noticed.Some bosses had atacks that where petty much unavoidable since there was not enough sign the attack was comming and the speed of the player is not fast enogh to get out the way even if you see it coming.[Bugs & Glitches]- I spotted a problem with the crafting UI where the numbers of the resources faded or became blurry with its background after the end of a tutorial making them hard to read.- The end score screen in some levels shows the text misplaced.- The special attack introduced in lvl 1 did not have its music played when used later. i dont know if it was meant to play every time.- Got killed by a glitch while going through a door, it only happened once.- During a boss fights my weapon got stuck pointing downwards after an unskippable cutscene, this glitch keep happening even after a restart of the game. This bug probably came to be because during the cutscene it seems they moved the target reticule down to simulate the hero lowering his gun but failed to put it back after the cutscene ended.- Also the game crashed during some boss fights a couple of times.[Improvements available]First of all make every cutscene skippable and not take control away while the player is in a locked room, this includes forcing the player to take power ups just keep the room loked until he/she picks it up.The crafting system does not really provide enough to the game, it would have been more interesting to have a classic item drop system in the enemies, such as health and ammo drops.Revise the default key bindings, there are over 100 keys no need for weird key combinations.Change the rooms so enemies can't hit the player immediately after entering the room and no locked rooms that are not a challenge or a puzzle.Verify that while going through the levels there are no points where the player has to do a leap of faith, otherwise you will have players jumping into instant death pits at random.[Conclusion]This game had a lot of good points early on; given the mount of weapon variety, the unused granade mechanics, the suits that seem to do nothing and the seemingly out of place health stations, i believe this game was originaly aiming for a metroidvania game, the lack of pick ups such as health and ammo seem to have originated from the integration of the crafting system, which from my point of view the devs could not figure out how to make work with a metroivania game, resulting in this linear game. I think this game is ok for its current price.			"

It's a little experience, and you may have a good afternoon playing the campaign. 5 Stages, replayable but get bored soon...			"

												ARES is a decent game engine with a fairly clean art direction.  The game is held back by being a mere 2 hours long and doesn't particularly push the genre of sidescrolling shooting games in any particular way in order to find more depth or content.  Its cost just simply doesn't justify the value.I did like the game though.  I just cannot suggest it.			"

												When I think of A.R.E.S., I can't help but think of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. They're totally different games; ARES is a 2D action-platformer and STALKER is an open-world FPS, but they share one critical thing: nobody expects their acronym to actually stand for anything. It's the name of the main character; any further explanation is left to the imagination. However, with only four letters, it's not terribly difficult to guess what they might be.Always Riddling Enemies with ShotsARES: Extinction Agenda plays something like the Megaman series if it was invented twenty years later. Controls boil down to variations on jumping and shooting, the former feeling fantastic and the latter feeling less so. The combat is fast and frantic; if you manage to get a bead on them, enemies die in seconds. You aim & fire either via mouse cursor or analog stick, making attacking & dodging independent. This is for the best, as ARES moves a tad too ridigly for its own good especially when it comes to the air.  The designers seem to have been at least somewhat aware of this, and tend to stray away from insta-kill death pits, which can swing the difficulty from challenging to frustrating. Overall, the gameplay remains solid and plays to its best points, though there are speed bumps along the way.The game also includes a ranking system for each level, influenced by a number of simple factors. Did you find the secret area? Did you get hit? Did you go through quickly? It also takes into consideration a combo system, which counts the number of consecutive shots you've landed without taking damage. It's a simple system that rewards skill and practice well. The issue, however, is that it trivializes slower weapons when you can get six hits on enemies that would normally only take one or two. It's a small problem, but a definite oversight.Animations Rarely Exceed SubstandardARES' aesthetic appeal is a mixed bag. In screenshots and stills, the game look marvelous, and rightfully so; the environments are carefully detailed, maintaining a consistent art style that's a pleasure to look at. Sadly, this means little when half of the animations look like something off of an old Flash game. Most of the time, you're too preoccupied by the fast-paced gameplay to notice a laughably strange wiggle-to-death animation, but it becomes hard to forgive when some of the main bosses disassemble in the same spectacularly shoddy fashion. Overall, the graphics are well done but inconsistent.A Really Excellent SoundtrackOne of the best aspects of the game is its soundtrack (which is free to listen to here: http://hyperduck.bandcamp.com/album/a-r-e-s-extinction-agenda ) Electric guitar combines with industrial synth to amplify the already intense environment. It's a really standout part of the game, definitely worth picking up separately.Actually Rather Enjoyable; ShortAt its best, ARES is explosive. Satisfying shooting, detailed graphics, and a supercharged soundtrack all combine to make ARES' high points memorable. However, the game fizzles out far too soon, lasting only a couple hours. Enjoy it while it lasts; its replay value is limited.			"

												ARES is a side-scrolling game in the same vein as the Mega Man X series. It's awfully short but has a replay value and challenge well fitting of it's price ($9.99). The main thing that seperates ARES from a Mega Man X game is the RPG mechanics woven in. Upgrade weapons and bombs, craft supplies using materials and collect a full bestiary along with upgrades for almost every entry. Replay value comes from the fact that you are scored at the end of each of five chapters. On the normal difficulty setting, you can only reach A rank, however on Hard, you can strive for SS. Raise your overall rank to unlock a bad♥♥♥♥♥new suit. The game's achievements provide it with some more replay value. There are only a handful but they're fun rather than tedious and boring. You'll want to play on Hard difficulty. This is where you'll experience the game the developers intended you to. I'm being cut off once again. Recommeded to any side-scrolling RPG fan!			"

There's lots of hidden goodies so it encourages playing the levels over again to find them all. I don't really care, so I didn't bother. ARES was fun for a hot minute.			"

Then I remembered that buying your own repair kits is actually kind of worse than regenerating health and that the game pretends to be a Metroidvania so that it can turn its five already short stages into farming and busywork.

												Basically a remake of the SNES era Megaman games. Not much at first glance, or even first play through, but this is one game that does unlocks and achievements well (i.e. they add depth to game play rather than just being annoying fetch quests and lists to tick off). Because of this the game itself doesn't really even start until you've finished it once and unlocked abilities needed to uncover secrets in previous areas. While this could be annoying, the entire game is very brief (you could do a run through in under an hour if you know what you are doing), so game play is much more focused on perfecting how you play rather than on progression to new areas. Probably not for everyone, and definitely not the best PC platformer out there, but if you can get it cheap (it seems like this is in a bundle every other week now) and you like old school platformers this is definitely worth a run through.

The only downfalls I see in this game is that its short and the level design is rather dull.  Beyond that you got an old school 2D action game thats a total blast to play... for a day... but at a discount so I can't complain.			"

												In a fit of boredom, I randomly decided to go through my backlog of indie games in alphabetical order. First up was A.R.E.S. Extinction Agenda. From the brief glimpses I caught prior to launching the game, I knew nothing more about it other than it being a platformer in the vein of Megaman.Make no mistake the A.R.E.S. is a short game. A playthrough on normal difficulty lasted me under two hours. However, if you're an achievement hunter, some of the hoops you'll have to jump through will undoubtedly prolong your game time.Despite its brief presence, I can't deny that I had plenty of nostalgic fun with A.R.E.S. As an avid fan of the old Megaman games, I was pleased to see this specific genre of platformer resurface amidst the flood of first person shooters. The game is fast paced, action packed, and on the hardest difficulty, near unforgiving.With this diamond in the rough lasting just as long as a movie, there is absolutely no reason for you to not give A.R.E.S. a shot.Grade: B-			"

The mechanics are a little tricky, particularly the Grenade Jump (combined that grenades are limited and a bit uncommon to find) can make some sections frustrating. There is also not much done to encourage weapon variety in different situations (I just basically used the Blue gun the entire game).Overall, I would say unless you want an ok Megaman-esque game, I would give this a pass.

												Pretty good game, very short though.Essentially this is a kind of poor attempt at a metroid clone with only 5 stages that last < 10 min each.  They could be completed faster if you could move any faster, but you are dreadfully slow.  A wider screen with a faster playstyle would have made this game much better, but its zoomed SO FAR IN on your character it leaves almost no room for anything to actually be going on on the screen.  I enjoyed the leveling system and upgrading items, everything carried over level to level so you could go back and get stronger for the next one... if you needed it.  Its dreadfully easy even on the ""hard"" setting which just made you take more damage.  5/10I would have put much less time into the game but the achievements required multiple playthroughs.			"

												A.R.E.S. is kind of short, but very very sweet. While recently updated to the EX edition, also on Steam, this version costs half as much, so if you're on a budget, you can do a lot worse. The game has a very Mega Man X4 feel, with tight controls, an interesting upgrade system, and some really cool environments. Totally worth picking up, but if you've got a few extra bucks to spare, go for the EX version.			"

												This game was a fun side scroller with an awesome story line then you get to the last boss and you realize that everything leading up to him was all a lie because this game tricked you into believing you were an awesome robot with ninja like reflexes and a heart of gold, but then BOOM boss makes you cry like the first time the doctor spanked your butt comin out of your mothers birth hanger.

												Way too short, too boring, the customization is laughable, and the graphics look like cardboard cutouts pasted ontop of eachother. I'm only making a review now because I saw this trash heap in my library and it was too late to refund it.			"

												It's a pretty solid, entertaining little title. If you thought megamn when you saw it, you were right! Still, it does a solid job of making it's own and is a good little bit of fun, stories a bit rushed though.			"

												ARES is a mediocre Megaman-clone type game. It is somewhat competently executed but it isn't great, and isn't as good as the actual megaman games. Overall, probably not worth your time or money; it isn't terrible, but the game has been done better many times, and there's no reason to play this over all the better executed versions of it.			"

												Don't expect this to be the new Contra. It is fun and all of you who like to master a game and replay levels over and over again this is a game to consider. All in all the story is short and not really good, there's not a lot of background to back it. Enemies will feel quite repetitive and double jumping can be really annoying sometimes. Overall: 6/10			"

												This game is similar to Mega Man in that you run and shoot. The problem I had with it is that the jumping is really awkward and overly difficult. It is so bad it made me stop playing inspite of really wanting to like the game. Gave it two tries, but it just isn't fun.  It is a shame since the game feels like it could have potential.			"

												A new version of this game has since been released on Steam:Old review:I love this game and hope for sequels.  A.R.E.S. gives me all of the sidescrolling upgrade collection I want with wiggle room so I can see all of the main content.  Levels are unlocked in a linear fashion, but they can be returned to for further exploration and achievements.  Enemies drop trash that is collected for upgrades so there's always some form of progress.  I likely won't be earning the SS rank Genesis suit, but I can still enjoy playing and improve at my own pace. =)Checkpoints are generally well-placed.  However, there are a few instances where the player has to wait for (or speed through) in-game cutscenes.  Expect to be annoyed by dialogue before the final boss battle and a few animations involving minibosses.			"

												Good for a few hours, get it when it's on a discount. One thing of note is the upgrade system, which seems quite redundant. You need 3 types of ""scrap"" to do upgrades, but they drop from the enemies with almost the same ratio. So why have three different types?			"

												A game that tries to be a Metroidvania but comes across as a college project. Everything in the game from graphics and sound to tightness and responsiveness of the controls feels extremely mediocre. I played the first level and the first boss and is already writing my review, which is telling. This game does nothing unique and everything like it out there is better.			"

												This game has very sharp graphics and a very good soundtrack, but I just don't care for the game mechanics. The controls generally ""work"" fine, but they don't feel quite tight. I don't feel like I'm getting the precision and proper control like I would from Contra or Metal Slug. The result - I never feel that all my hits and deaths are completely my fault, yet the game rates my perfomance at level end.  It also sucks that certain moves that you wouldn't remember after not playing the game for a while isn't displayed anywhere else but the tutorial - no help from the button config screen. Unless this genre is the only genre you play, I can't suggest it.			"
