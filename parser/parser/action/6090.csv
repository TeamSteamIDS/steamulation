												For me, this was one of those ""Oh snap! I played this as a kid and it was AMAZING, let's play it again!""aaaaaand then I realize that it hasn't quite aged very well. Don't get me wrong though, this is still a positive review. I'm just being honest with myself. It looks pretty muddy, the controls aren't that great and overall? We've just done much better in the realm of 3rd Person FPS games since then. HOWEVER. It is still a hilariously original game with memorable characters (the tea drinking, british centurion robot is my favorite) and it's still very playable. If you want to revist some nostalgia? I say it's worth the price. If you've never played it before, you'll probably be a hate-it-or-love-it type of person. It might be too archiac for you or it might be just right. For me? it's a classic gem that may not have aged super well, but it's still an entertaining and memorable experience.			"

												This game is the funniest game I've ever played. The graphics aren't the best but what do you expect, it's a game from the early 2000's. I honestly think that the developer's were focusing more on the humor than anything else. If you want a good laugh, then I highly recommend this game.			"

												A good Lucas Arts third person shooter. From the zanny characters to the intense gunplay, there's a lot to like. The story is unexpectedly weak, and gameplay involves destorying spawn points that will spew enemies until destroyed. However, I whole-heartedly recommend this game, and only wish there was more to say about it.Here's gameplay:

												After having owned this game for Xbox, I felt I should buy it for PC. I went into the options and the settings are quite varied. The highest resolution is 1600x900. I currently use a 1920x1080 screen. Details go above that of the Xbox really well. You won't notice much difference with resolutions below 1366x768. You shouldn't worry about how the game performs as long as you have comparable hardware to the Xbox.			"

			http://www.wsgf.org/dr/armed-and-dangerous/en - Widescreen fix. I couldn't make it work, but maybe you will. Try it. This is one of the funniest games i've ever played.		

When I hear “bunch of misfits” I always think of these guys here. They are united by one goal, they are brave, they are weird, they are human, robot, mole and a smelly old man. They are ... Lionhearts!!! This is one of the wackiest game i've ever played. I can't express how crazy and absurd (in a good way) are the story and characters. I write this review with a huge grin on my face. In almost every cutscene I laugh my ♥♥♥ off. You are the Lionhearts, a bunch of misfits, who are trying to save their kingdom from the evil king Forge. He wants to unlock the power of the Book of Rule, so it's up to our heroes to steal the book from him and use it to undo all the bad things. Let me introduce the Lionhearts (drum roll): Q – big robot that like to drink tea and he always have a cup in his hand; Jonesy – a mole, often mistaken for a rat and everybody likes to make fun of him; Rexus – short  and smelly old man, that put a spell to locked the book's power. He have some sort of jedi powers and he is blind as a bat; finally the character you control Roman. He always wear a red scarf around his mouth, like he is in the wild west. Truth to be told the game kinda feel that way. The story is complete bonkers and I love it. It will take to very different places and you will meet a whole bunch of insane characters, more crazy than our heroes. King Fogre is also insane. He sends his son Stig to lead his army againts the Lionhearts and he is … to say it politely, not very bright person. I don't want to spoil more. One last thing. In every cutscene you will see amazing stuff.The gameplay is straightforward. It's a third-person shooter and you play only as Roman, but Jonesy and Q are always behind you. They help, but you will do most of the shooting. You can give them three command – guard an area, return to you and defend you. They have their health bars, but if some of them die it's not instant game over. You will see them in the next level if the story dictates that. I try always to make them run over a health pack, but it's not that easy.The weapons are great. You have some standard like submachine gun, sniper rifle and bolt action rifle, but the others are amazing – Gurnar personal mortar who looks like a tuba and fires granades, rocket launcher that can fire up to four homing rockets and my favourite and the most unique ever created in any media – land shark gun! (появяват се думите една по една и една акула) You fire it at some target and the shark start “swimming” and then it start to eating enemies. It will follow you around for a short period of time. The ammo for all the weapons can be acquired in two ways. The first is by killing enemies they drop different types (they also drop health packs) and the second is by going into “The Grunt & Polewart”. It's a pub. There also you can change your weapon, fill up your ammo and health. What better way to get them and drink a beer.The secondary weapons are also insane. Sticky bomb that makes enemies run in panic when it's on them. It's funny to see them running around and screaming. There are more. Guy Fawks Traitor bomb – turns enemies againts each other, Knockout bomb – giant boxing glove that punches enemies from a distance, Portable Black Hole and finally the best from the secondary – Tropsy Turvy bomb. It turns the world upside down and enemies fall to their death. If the weapons were all standard the gameplay would be kinda boring.The level design is okay. There vast open spaces, but earlier levels feel kinda empty. Yes, you will shoot constantly, but there isn't something interesting sights to see. But later levels are much better. Most of the buildings can be destroyed and for such an old game, it's interesting to see it. You will see snowy villige, shooting bad guys near the beach or in a trenches and so on. The levels have this weird mix setting between middle ages and steam punk. Really interesting design. There also hidden tokens spread around the levels and when you find them you will unlock things like big head, big hands, another difficulty and so on.After every few levels there is a turret section. They are 2-3 minutes long and don't overstay their welcome. They are fun and challenging enough. And speaking of difficulty this game is not easy. The enemies are not Storm troopers. They are accurate and they will shoot on sight. I died quite a few times, so you have to use all your tools to survive.One of the best things here is the voice acting. It's simply amazing. When you combine it with the great writing, you have fantastic recipe for laughing a lot. All actors have british accent. Some sound more scottish, others more english. They all do amazing job. Even the side characters are greatly voiced. My favourite character is Rexus. He is more goofy and with him are the best scenes.The soundtrack is also good. Typical orchestral tracks, but some have this military vibe and feel like you are in a war. Others are more ambient, but nothing is more satisfying that to kill enemies accompanied by scottish bagpipes. They will lift your spirit up and you will fight more agressively!The things I don't like here are not many. The graphics are not a problem for me. The game came out in 2003, so you can't expect to look great. The biggest problem is the lack of enemy variety. You will see all the time the grunt with bolt action rifle, sniper rifle or the guy with submachine gun or granade launcher. There are few flying like zeppelin and the really big enemies (they are tough and fun to fight), but they are few and far between. The other problem that people may have is with the gameplay. It's repetetive, but I like it. The crazy guns and funny cutscence is what kept the game become stale.The game is made by Planet Moon Studios, which also made another underrated cult classic – Giants: Citizen Kabuto, a game ahead of it's time. It's like their faith to make underrated games. If you didn't guess by now, I love AnD. Everything is over the top! The characters, the guns, the enemies. It's funny as hell, you have crazy weapons, hilarious cutscenes, it runs great on a modern PC and on top of that you have a freaking jetpack! Instantly 10/10! Bad joke aside this is a refreshing idea to spice up the gameplay. It adds verticality. Some enemies have it too and it's fun to fly around and try to shoot each other. Or just grab the homing rocket launcher. You have it in almost half of the game and it's amazing! It's not an expensive title, so go now and buy it. I had hell of a good time with Armed and Dangerous.			"

												Armed and Dangerous follows a very similar line to that of it's predecessor, Giants Citizen Kabuto. An excellent comedy game with the absolutely awesome (yet sadly deceased) Tony Jay voicing an amusing role as an oppressive King, this follows the typical story of rebellion.The game in itself is short, and it's way too similar to Giants: Citizen Kabuto with base building replaced by turret/railshooting sequences. With those marring marks, the game is still enjoyable enough to play through it, especially for any fan of Planet Moon's work.			"

												I can't really remember all that much, except that it was a solid third person shooter, with lots of humor. And it was developed by the same team that created the still excellent Citizen Kabuto, which makes this at least a must play title (that's right; not 'own', because, by now, it's probably a bit dated).[Rating: 77/100]			"

												This is one of the first games I've ever played(Originally on Xbox), and it remains one of my favourites to this day. Its graphics may be showing its age, but the game remains incredibly fun even now, with some of the most memorable and ridiculous weapons of any game I've seen. The combat is constantly entertaining and can sometimes be surprisingly difficult, but one of the best things about this game is the humour. Almost every cutscene of this game is absolutely hilarious, and it is a genuine shame this game is not more well known. I cannot more highly recommend that you try this game, especially if you get it on sale. It's quite easily worth the price, and I'd gladly pay quite a lot more for it.I'll be home with the Book of Rule, so save the last pint for me. "

												Armed and Dangerous features you as Roman (leader of a band of rebels called the Lionhearts) on a quest to find the mythical Book of Rule and bring down the tyrannical King Forge. In traditional LucasArts/Planet Moon style, this game is a fantasy third-person shooter with a very British sense of humour and a stereotyped gang of the foolish American, savvy Cockney, Angry Scot and the self-aware, well spoken English robot with a Tea fixation either blundering or saving their way through this fantasy land.of Milola.The game was a great one for the time with it's relatively simple controls and console-friendly interface, it felt more like a port than a PC game which is understandable, it was an Xbox release. The game has not aged due to it's awfully rendered DivX based cutscenes and suffers from resolutions not common now. The levels lack variety, consisting of missions to blow an objective up or save hostages from the king's ogres and Germans or hold off waves off attackers in a turret segment.Armed and Dangerous was quite a difficult game, marching out in the slightly repetitive levels will lead to a quick death. However, you are far from alone with two allies who can't shoot for toffee and a vast array of weaponry ranging from Mortar launching Tubas to Land Shark guns and a vindaloo rocket launcher mixed with a quite destructible environment for the time.Armed and Dangerous was a fun and hilarious title, and still makes for a solid game despite the badly optimised cutscenes. While it slipped under the radar at the time (and still does) it makes for a rather classic yet flawed LucasArts game. Despite the faults and the game being ten years old now, Armed and Dangerous is still the silliest third person shooter you are ever likely to play.Just beware of the Shrub Patrol. Down with the King.			"

												One of the funniest games ever made. It's right up there with the Monkey Island series and No One Lives Forever 2. The land shark gun alone is worth picking it up while the game's on sale.			"

												Great fun and humour on a small budget. it is relatively light on the specs, so most computers can run this game fluidly.			"

												Yeah, this is a good game. One that would probably sate one's need for huge guts and appendages going to and fro. There is a gun that shoots a shark. It devastates opponents. Sometimes it misses- but my theory is that it never misses. It just waddles into the deep, dark void, without uncertainty, without hesitation. And it finds itself in the metaphyical realm, waiting to wriggle through...Biding, festering. But yeah, this game is cool. A solid 7/10 at least, lol			"

												I played this game when I was a kid. Revisiting this as an adult gives me a new found respect for it, there were some adult jokes that I missed. Some of the banter makes more sense now!This game is a must play for someone looking for a funny third person shooting game.Now give me the keeys!			"

												Dated graphics (and very low res cut scenes), but OMG so much fun. This has to rank amongst the funniest games ever. Witty dialogue, crazy story, insane characters, and equally insane weapons (topsy turvy bomb anyone ?). There's a gun in here that fires a enemy seeking shark ! A shark ! 3rd person shooter at heart but so so much more underneath. Worth a few coins of anyone's hard earned cash.			"

												This was one of those games I couldn't put down in college.  It had a unique storyline coupled with many references to LOTR, Star Wars and Monty Python.  Add in this being one of the first games with a voice cast -- an incredible one at that -- and you have one of the few games that has stuck with me through the years.At the time, this game literally stopped me in my tracks playing, to just look around at the beauty of the environments.  I still remember the first time I was in a turrent and had literally 1,000's of arrows being shot at me, individually rendering and arcing in.  Incredible.One of my picks for must plays of the early 00's.5/5			"

												Armed and Dangerous features you as Roman (leader of a band of rebels called the Lionhearts) on a quest to find the mythical Book of Rule and bring down the tyrannical King Forge. In traditional LucasArts/Planet Moon style, this game is a fantasy third-person shooter with a very British sense of humour and a stereotyped gang of the foolish American, savvy Cockney, Angry Scot and the self-aware, well spoken English robot with a Tea fixation either blundering or saving their way through this fantasy land.of Milola.The game was a great one for the time with it's relatively simple controls and console-friendly interface, it felt more like a port than a PC game which is understandable, it was an Xbox release. The game has not aged due to it's awfully rendered DivX based cutscenes and suffers from resolutions not common now. The levels lack variety, consisting of missions to blow an objective up or save hostages from the king's ogres and Germans or hold off waves off attackers in a turret segment.Armed and Dangerous was quite a difficult game, marching out in the slightly repetitive levels will lead to a quick death. However, you are far from alone with two allies who can't shoot for toffee and a vast array of weaponry ranging from Mortar launching Tubas to Land Shark guns and a vindaloo rocket launcher mixed with a quite destructible environment for the time.Armed and Dangerous was a fun and hilarious title, and still makes for a solid game despite the badly optimised cutscenes. While it slipped under the radar at the time (and still does) it makes for a rather classic yet flawed LucasArts game. Despite the faults and the game being ten years old now, Armed and Dangerous is still the silliest third person shooter you are ever likely to play.Just beware of the Shrub Patrol. Down with the King.			"
