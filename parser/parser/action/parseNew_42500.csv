												kinda fun from what i remember online with friends.. I had poor net connection at the time. Would liketo play again with friends. Also if using xbox pad.. do not check the check box for it.. as it puts a large deadzone in the controller. you can still use the xbox pad just go to joypad tab to change keys, there are some sensitivity settings in there also when changing the sticks for up and down or left and right. and also set teh to sliders to about 40 on the 3rd tab. If you cant get it to work well add me on steam and ill send you my control file.			"

												You get what you pay for.a fun but limited deathmatch game that has no one playing onlinethe bots you play against are way too easy and they cheat like crazy. unlimited boost, they tailgate you forever while airbraking. they dont stall but you do. they are way too easy, very repetitive and only become dangerous in groups (even on the hardest setting)it could use better controller support, allthough it works well enough using one.the way they work make menu choices slow and tedious.instead of jumping through the options,a controller gives you a slow moving arrow as you use a mouse. ingame they work well enoughthe multiplayer part is dead, no one onlinei give it a 6/10 overall.would be more if there actually was anyone online.it's ok for some mindless fun			"

THE GAME IS WORTH IT I got it for free from a giveaway for the anniversary of the game.I'm really impressed of the game. Its the best Flight action/arcade game I've played so far. However, it does not have a big player basis. A small number of people play it, but its really worth it and there are a lot of more hours of fun for me discover in the game :).I can't recommend you to buy it, simply because I did not buy it myself, but if I did, I would recommend it to you to buy it.

												I have over 600 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #49 - DogFighterExactly as you'd expect from the title, DogFighter pits you as a fighter pilot against a number of other pilots.  It's pretty much deathmatch with propellar planes, which isn't itself a bad thing.I started with the tutorial, which does a perfectly good job taking you through the various controls in the game.   The left stick controls the plane, while the right stick is used for performing different maneuvers, which include barrel rolls in either direction, a loop, and an Immelmann turn.Much like a typical deathmatch game, you pick up powerups, which can provide both offensive and defensive capabilities.  Offensive items are activated with the right trigger, and defensive items are activated with the left trigger.The flight model is completely arcade-like, so anyone expecting simulator level realism should look elsewhere.  But, on the flip side, the game is very easy to pick up.The game offers some different game modes, but they don't really change the core gameplay which is to fly your plane, shoot other plans, and don't get shot down.  All of the game modes are just variations of the basic deathmatch.Which brings me to the problem I had with this game.  You can't really have a deathmatch game without other people playing it.  And nobody seems to be playing this anymore.  Granted, this game came out back in 2010, but sadly it seems the shelf life of this game was pretty short, and people have moved on.  So, unless you fancy playing deathmatch with a bunch of bots, you are better off looking at other games. "

Teal DeerDevelopers: Dark Water Studios Publishers: Instinct SoftwareInitial release: Jun 2010Genre: Action, Flying, Dogfight, Casual, Arcade#Worth/NotWorth: #WaitforSaleBSERC - (Borderline Sardonic and Extremely Reductive Comparison): The DogFight only version of Crimson Skies. Exposition, Concurrence and SummationDogFighter is a silly game in all honestly. But it's a earnest sort of silly. The game feels very late 90's early 2000's; it features a rather campy sort of rock soundtrack that feels like you are entering the ring at a WWF/WCW/NWO event. It has multiplayer but still features bot matches. For the price, there is a surprising amount of level/map variety as well as weapon variety. A decent amount of pick-ups in game to alter things like boost or top speed. Front and rear firing weapons across different handling planes accompany a variety of modes, not a TON of modes as they are all variations of a standard Dogfight but team matches, lone wolf matches and tournaments are more than I was expecting.  THE GISTIt's way more than I expected for the price, it actually is a bit a fun for a small bit of time but has no real legs and is a nice filler/palette cleanser game. Especially if you just want to fly around and shoot at crap. Follow my curation for more "

												This in my honest opinion is a must-have, it is fun and has a very 'arcadey' feel to it, and no Pay-To-Win bullcrap, some of the best characteristics in the game are the power ups that aren't permanent and only last for 1 game(Or until you run out of ammo for them). Some of the bad characteristics of the game is the repetitive stalling, although the fun of the battles helps supress that frustration.93/100                                    -Your Captain Pot8			"

												DogFighter is an extremely fun flight combat game. The level of customization, the decent number of maps and the plethora of game modes really sell this game. DogFighter is more than a dogfighting simulator, it is a dogfighting game. You should totally get this game while it is cheap.It is tough to find a match online but when you do get into a match the game is totally worth it.If you haven't already listened to me and bought this game, you sir are a fool.

												I am reluctant to trash a game with so little gameplay minutes but this game puts forward all it has to offer very quickly. Unfortunately it is not quite as good as one could have hoped after seeing the trailer.  The trailer video shows ultra-tight multiplay fun and really fast flying! ...but in reality the speed is not there. Boost does not add much. There are also zero people online. And the controls: Play it with a gamepad and aiming is hell. Play it with a flightstick and the twitchy gameplay will be hell for you and your stick.  Play it with a mouse and you will get trashed in the close quarters turns. I simply was not able to find a proper control scheme that worked. Mouse was the best though. A flying arcade game can be fast and playable on multiple control types. e.g. Skydrift. It is not an entirely lost case though. Game is probably at it's best when played with a few friends who are all of the same skill level. This could probably be quite nice LAN game among friends. But playing against the few random humans online or bots? Forget it. Not worth it even at this price. 4/10			"

												There are some ideas that are so simple that passionate developers ruin them by making things more difficult than they have to be.  My major complaint with this game is the controls.  There are too many for a casual game like this.  Also, this game takes a lot of tweaking to respond semi-smoothly -- mouse sensitivity (never did figure out the game pad).  All in all, the maps seem pretty standard.  The planes aren't based on Flight Simulator mechanics, but I wasn't expecting that.  I kind of just wanted to start this game up and have fun.  I didn't want to fiddle with it forever.  This games needs simplification and also should be optimized for slower PC's.  I don't recommend buying this.			"

The only sad thing is that I went to look at multiplayer and no servers existed or my firewall was blocking the game.I'll try messing with the firewall tomorrow and I'll edit this review if anything new came up.(If this review helped you, one-up it and maybe even comment on it, thanks!)

The game only gets hard when you're absolutely massively outnumbered, because then there's a decent chance that someone will try to take a potshot at you :) Even so, this game is extremely fun.  pick-up-and-play kinda fun..  Nothing too taxing.. No hard rules to understand.. just fly and shoot.  Very well recommended if you have a fair internet connection and want to have a play online.			"

												Stress Relief game if you are a hard working citizen. Game mechanics are great and the story line is okay. It could have had a more in depth and more longer story line but for its budget they definately deserve a thumbs up for the effort.7/10 RatingI do recommend buying this game			"

												Has no singleplayer campaign or anything like it. Multiplayer has been dead for half a decade. Basically all you can do is run deathmatch, wave survival, or time limit killing against bots. All of it basically boils down to the same thing, as you use the same 5 pickups, and every level is the exact same because it doesn't matter what's in the background since you're up in the sky. Gets boring and repetitive fast. Impossible to manuever quickly or make fast/tight turns with the mouse controls, which is what this type of game is all about. Interest in this lasts about as long as the Wright brothers first flight, 1 minute. 3/10			"

												This is a great game! The flying in the game is alot of fun! The ""dogfighting"" is intense when you are trying to kill other people. The challenges in the game are awesome. The graphics make you feel like you are really in that area. The controls are not hard to get used to. The guns are fun to shoot. The planes are great looking and have their own flight style. There is CTF, DM, and TDM match play, there is also a lone wolf match were your against a tone of bots which is alot of fun to do with a friends. The sounds in the game make it intense to hear gun fire come your way. The online community is great and very competative. The guys at Dark Water constantly try to improve the game play and make things better all the time. If you enjoy playing a good time flight fighting arcade style game then this is the game for you. If you get it you won't regret it! So get it already!!			"

												Just so it's said, this is NOT a recommendation. The game looks better than it is, and the gameplay is dumb and boring. The developers of this game could've done more with the game i think. As right now, it's just a arcade game for ADHD 8 year olds.I cannot complain about graphics, it's ok, it flows nicely and such, but there is absolutely no gameplay that makes you want to keep wanting to come back to the game. Rather, after playing for 5 - 10minutes, you will want to quickly find the ESC button, quit and uninstall the game.Rating 5 out of 100			"

												Was hoping this to be related in some way to the fantastic but old dogfigher game where you fly in the house and fight with toys.The game lacks polish. The UI  (menus, dialogs, controls) are aweful. There is no way to control or change the settings while in the tutorial. If I need to invert the axes or change mouse sensitivity I have to quit and restart the tutorial. Enabling realistic flight mode made the plane move like a snake. absolutely out of control. May be the controls are better with xbox controller, but the lack of polish everywhere makes me doubt that. For 2.99 it is probably a very good game for a young kid. But for any serious players its waste of money and slot on steam.			"

												Want a summary of how bad this game is? The only thing you really need to know is this game uses the Pause/break and scroll lock button in the control scheme... wtf. While that's the number 1 thing the annoys me, the soundtrack, consisting of only a couple incerdibly generic rock music, drove me insane. I only got to play the tutorial, which was very long and boring by the way, and when I tried to join a singleplayer game (because this game's player base might consist of two people) the game crashed and I didn't see a point in launching it again.TL:DR This is just another crappy indie plane fighting games that has no one fight against.Addendum: This game also takes all the skill out of the genre by binding all the basic plane moves (ie. barrel roll and loop the loop) to hot keys. Whether or not you see that has good or bad is really up to you.			"

												Neat little game that I could accustom it to Quake or that style of arena FPS but with planes and the constraints of them. Its interesting and somewhat fun, but on Team Death Match when playing in singleplayer the friendly AI are useless unfortunately. Though Deathmatch is still fun but even on hard the AI dont really stand much of a chance against a real human. Since this game is so old though and it was a mainly multiplayer focused game the multiplayer is expectantly dead at this point. No one is online aside from a few crazed and forgotten souls in limbo.Since it is a multiplayer focused game and dead, and the singleplayer component isn't that challenging or fun I would advise not buying this game unless you have a group already interested in playing the game as you will need other people to play with to get the most out of the game. Though it is some fun to just fly around blasting bots its not that fun for a very long time.			"

												This was once a great fun game. However its now dead. Not 1 or 5 people on a 32 server type dead i mean dead dead. Not a single server in sight. The was a dev that said they were making an update but so far it seems to be nothing as nothing ever followed. In the end dont buy this. Not because its a bad game but because theres no multiplayer servers to play and bots get boring after a while. If the game becomes active again though i will change my review.			"

												Not as good as I thought. Unless I really missed something badly, the  mouse control sucks: to keep turning you need to keep moving your mouse. This is the first time I have ever used the ""increase sensitivity"" button of my mouse in action. Also I think the game is missing a certain sense of speed and that the scale is badly off at least on some maps, making the planes look like toy models in the middle of huge buildings and other constructions.
