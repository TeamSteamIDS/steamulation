Max Payne		* 10/10Max Payne. The Very first chapter. I didn't remember it being SO GOOD. But before writing a thesis about the game a few warnings first.NEWER SYSTEMS LOW COMPATIBILITY ALERT! I repeat: low compatibility. Meaning If you have a recent system like me (i5, 8Gb RAM, Integrated intel HD Graphics+Nvidia GTX 840M Running on Windows 10) you're going to have some trouble running the game. Luckily there's the community (Steam and non-steam) that helps because Rockstar or Remedy are never going to release any update... -.-Back in topic: The Game. Max Payne is a 3rd person view shooter famous for introducing the Bullet Time mechanics in a Videogame. But that's just a pleasant trick. The best part of the game is the story and everything about it. This game is a Noir, in the story, the characters, the settings and... the comic. Yes, because most of the story is being told through a dark, rough comic adding some original style to the story. And even if the visual novel takes most of the storytelling, some cutscene are rendered with the game engine and the direction has been really greatly studied. In this re-play (I already played the game in day one release, when games were released on CDs... Not even DVDs... XD) I didn't recall it being so interactive. I believe, for the time it was released, it's amazing to see almost every TV, wardrobe, furniture, vending machine or stuff being usable or openable.+++PROs+++ STORY. The very first scene is the very end... And Max is clearly stating it (So No Spoilers... XD). The whole game is a flashback running the events that brough the character to his actual situation. Sounds a simple nice circle story, but it's not just that. It's the way is being told, through a roughtly sketched crude comic (giving a very dark style) where Max is telling us his thoughts, reasoning about a clue, or impressions with hindsights, sarcastically describing the other characters or lame situations. As if the comic wasn't enough there are few cutscenes rendered with the game engine with really some studied notable shots, so I can really say this game was very well studied and built. BULLET TIME. The world has been amazed and astonished by the Slow motion scenes recently seen in the matrix that the gaming community NEEDED soomething like that. This game was one of the first (if not the very first) to implement a slow motion system. You can run or Dodge-jump while shooting and the last enemy killed has his slow motion sequence. And best for last, when shooting with sniper rifle the camera follows your bullet in slow motion. Awesome... Simply Awesome. SAM LAKE. Max Payne's faces and expressions are from Remedy's Sam Lake. It was supposed to be kind of a joke during Beta testing but they stayed. They make me laugh every time, I've ""memed"" them with my friend through whole high school, yet I still like it. If they weren't so much exaggerated they could have worked perfectly. RIDDLES. You don't have to go ahead shooting all the time. Tere's alwase a moment of peace where you're bound to solve some puzzles or riddles... Well, not really riddles, most of the times is just about shooting something or using something to open your way, but at the time it was studied in a way that spread the level of interactivity because you have to find the right thing to shoot at, or interact with items that noone was used to think as usable. Kind of innovative for the time, and in my opinion still enjoyable nowadays. MUSIC. If you have a main theme that sticks forever in your head you already won. You don't even need anything else at all. Still in the game, besides the epic main theme, you find some dark atmosphere arrangements that match the Visual Novel moments, and nice action or particular music sections. LOCATIONS. You get to see so many different places like the subway, a motel, a pier, a mansion and more. All of them are built with a lot of attention for the details. It's not a matter of graphic of course but for the times it was full of decorations and stuff that really enrich the locations. GRAPHIC ENGINE. I'm not sure it makes any sense speaking of the engine while the game is almost 15 years old, but I remember it really had great details at the time: High detailed characters, bullets' shells, walls' damage. And still nowadays can be appreciated... (If you can get past Sam Lake's flat face XD) MODS. I can still remember playing to one of the most badass mods (for the time) ever: Kung Fu Payne. This mod alone is worth the title of ""Mod community"" XD. Seriously, you can find many mods, funny or interesting in the web. Too bad nothing is being hosted in the steam community but that was expected considering the Cons... DIFFICULTY. You have to be careful and think well your moves because you can die with one shot of shotgun. At the easiest difficulty. O.o---CONs--- NEWER SYSTEMS LOW COMPATIBILITY. As I've already mentioned in the introduction this is the classic Steam release'n'forget system adopted with many old titles. No patches are being released because the game is really old, and because of this it obviously has some odd issues on newer systems. Talking about both OS and Hardware. Fortunately it's nothing that serious, in the steam community there are some solutions and workarounds and if you can't find your solution there, trust me, google is always your friend. AI. Sometimes enemies behave with ""a plan"", but most of the times they'll just find cover, then they'll run towards you if you don't show up or go back.  "

												So many years have passed and yet this game's graphic novel story presentation, depressing atmosphere and most of all bullet time/slow motion system are still top notch, unparalleled by any other game of the same genre, sequels aside.The guys at Remedy Entertainment (and later Rockstar Games) really outdid themselves with Max Payne, magnificently filling it with witty comic-book lines, dark humour and tons of movie references, all starting from its very name!
