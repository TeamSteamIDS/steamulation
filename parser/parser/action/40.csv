												Deathmatch classic is valves tribute to Good old Quake. If you have ever played quake, you know where you going. Deathmatch classic is Really fast paced online shooter, People running around map shooting each others with rocket launchers and Spammin  Miniguns. Deathmatch classic is also typical valve game , it dont have single player. And thats the biggest problem on this game, It nearly never has any players playing it.  But when you do find server with some players, oh boy Let the fun begin.   Overall, the gameplay is really nice, and this game is awesome for some sort hectic battles. but its weaknes is lack of players.  But still, i can recomend this, but dont expect to find players easily on this game			"

												Deathmatch Classic is Valve's praise on Quake. It's basically Quake rerendered in the GoldSource (Basically still the Quake engine) engine. It adds in a few half life textures, and the open source and infinite maps possibility, but overall, it's just Quake. Very fun and addictive. I definitely prefer HL DM Source though. The community, kind of isn't there, but you can probably find a server with 5-10 people on there at the right times.			"

												Half Life 1’s GoldSrc engine is a modified version of ID’s Quake Engine. Where ID revolutionised the FPS genera with it’s full 3D engine and popular multiplayer component, Valve’s success with a Half Life 1 and Counterstrike arguably eclipsed ID’s title. Being the good sports they are, Valve remade Quake’s original ground breaking death match in their engine as a homage to the developers who built the FPS genera from the ground up.Nine Inch Nailgun out of Ten			"

												Deathmatch Classic was a mod for Half-Life created by Valve software alongside others like Team Fortress Classic and Day of Defeat. Unfortunately it was never as popular as some of the others and quietly faded back into obscurity.DMC is essentially a remake of the multiplayer component of Quake 1 using Half-Life's particular GoldSrc engine. Including remade versions of Quake 1's various weapons, such as the nailgun, super shotgun and rocket launcher. It uses a lot of Half-life's assets like multiplayer models, textures and sprites. And at the same time attempts to mimic Quake's physics. Allowing players to also bunnyhop and strafejump. They also remade several of Quake 1's deathmatch maps and included them with the game.Now all of this was great. Although Deathmatch Classic released at around the same time as Quake 3 and Unreal Tournament. As a result the community didn't really gravitate towards it as much as Valve would have liked, seeing it as a little outdated and more of a novelty.  Playing it today you can see some general upsides to Deathmatch Classic. It uses Steam's server browser and has mods for bots. So it is rather easy to setup a game of classic Quake deathmatch with someone online. But the playerbase is extinct, and as a result it's just another relic in Valve's catalogue			"

Today the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join (I just found 1 server with 13 players). I got this game with Counter Strike 1.6 and decided to give it a go.

												Valve gave Quake deathmatch a makeover, and now nobody plays it. If you have enough friends who bought it in a collection you can badger into playing with you, or if you find a server with bots, you'll probably be alright. The game itself is okay I guess, although kind of janky, since it's a remake of Quake in an engine that itself is a heavily modified version of Quake's engine meant for somewhat more realistic games like Half-Life. If you plan on playing something like this semi-regularly you're really just better off playing an actual Quake game.			"

												Though EXTREMEMLY lacking in players nowadays, Deathmatch Classic may not be the game on your account that you've played for over 500 hours, but it's still really fun, extremely addicting, and, occasionally quite funny sometimes. Nowadays, it's really nothing new, but back then in the late, late, late, late 90's, I've heard this game was EVERYWHERE! What's good about the game though is that there isn't TOO much variety. You have, like, what? 7 weapons in total? But I'm telling you, you have no idea how satisfying it feels to blow up a Kleiner with the RPG... Missle Launcher... thing. I recommend Deathmatch Classic to... really anyone :). (beyond the age of 10, that is.)9.5/10			"

Looking at the games population, it completly depends on the time you are on. You will find at least 1 game with 5-10 people though so that shouldn't be an issue (and sometimes the population is like zero ;/). Overall a great example that graphics dont matter.			"

												One day when I was really young I was playing on my Dad's old steam account and I found this game on it, I decided to play it and I had a really fun time and when I saw that it was on sale I just had to get it and I have to say that this is one of the best valve games that have been released. The fast paced fighting and constant action makes the game fun and interesting. However, there are not many people on the servers to play with and if there are any there they are on at a certain time which is usually late at night but that small time I do get to play with people is a really enjoyable time and I certainly think the pros outweigh the cons in this game.

												With the Quake engine being the basis for the legendary Goldsrc engine, bringing us timeless classics such as Half Life and Counter Strike, it was nice to see VALVE paying tribute to the folks that made their games possible to begin with !  True to the title, this is deathmatch in its purest form... Gathering an arsenal of powerful weapons to unload hell on your opponents before they can roast you !The engine's been tweaked to make advanced movement techniques such as bunny hopping easier, lending itself to a fast paced fragfest that tests the limits of your reflexes and your dexterity.Triumphing over your adversaries couldn't be any more satisfying when you're dominating the map with a quad damaged rocket launcher!The game itself easily gets a thumbs up for always keeping your blood boiling, but....I wish I could speak highly of the game's userbase; unfortunately, this game has been neglected over time in favor of newer, more popular games such as the ever beloved Team Fortress 2.Ultimately, a multiplayer game thrives on the people that play it, so as it stands, I wouldn't reccomend buying this game seperate from the Valve Complete Pack.  However, if you recieved the game from that deal, and you have a couple of friends ready to rumble, you'll have a blast shootin' it up like it were 1996 !			"

												This is like the remastered version of Quake 1 Multiplayer mod or QuakeWorld. The model textures and geometry polygon count have been increased for its smoothness. Plus most servers have Metamod 3rd party support and bots to make DMC servers live longer than Quake 1 servers. If you own a dedicated server for CS 1.6 and like to try host DMC, go ahead. Don't bother using HPB_Bots as they are too sluggish and incompetant, but try RCBot v1.442-beta out. However RCBot got some complicated configurations, but it's useful for your bot to work various ways.			"

												You'll probably never launch the game and you only have it because you bought the Complete Valve Pack. If your getting it seperatly, then their is a problem. Their is litterally no reason to get this game unless its in the Pack or you wanna get a certain number of games in your library. If you are considering this game (for whatever reason) and you havent got the pack, wait till the summer sale or some sale, and get the pack for 50 bucks. Plenty of games, cool to see all the games Valve has made, and you get EVERY TEXTURE FOR GMOD (when you download the games you need).Lets say you do get this game:There arent alot of people on (because the game is pretty old) but the game is shockingly pretty fun. If you find a server (which isnt actually too hard) then the Multiplayer is very fluid and fast. The guns are very satisfying, also kills are rewarding because its hard to take someone down.In the end, if you got a few spare bucks, its a good game.			"

It's interesting to think about, these bots can't break out of this crumbling, forgotten virtual world that they're stuck in, they can't form any meaningful relationships or even properly communicate with each other except with pre-chosen stock phrases and rockets to the face. They're only choice is to keep on fighting each other forever, or at least until the dusty, neglected computers keeping the servers that they live in break down.			"

												Joseph Stalin or Iosif Vissarionovich Stalin (Russian: Ио́сиф Виссарио́нович Ста́лин, pronounced [ˈjɵsʲɪf vʲɪsɐˈrʲɵnəvʲɪtɕ ˈstalʲɪn]; born Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili, Georgian: იოსებ ბესარიონის ძე ჯუღაშვილი, pronounced [iɔsɛb bɛsɑriɔnis dzɛ dʒuɣɑʃvili]; 18 December 1878[1] – 5 March 1953) was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953.Among the Bolshevik revolutionaries who took part in the Russian Revolution of 1917, Stalin was appointed general secretary of the party's Central Committee in 1922. He subsequently managed to consolidate power following the 1924 death of Vladimir Lenin through suppressing Lenin's criticisms (in the postscript of his testament) and expanding the functions of his role, all the while eliminating any opposition. He remained general secretary until the post was abolished in 1952, concurrently serving as the Premier of the Soviet Union from 1941 onward.Under Stalin's rule, the concept of ""socialism in one country"" became a central tenet of Soviet society. He replaced the New Economic Policy introduced by Lenin in the early 1920s with a highly centralised command economy, launching a period of industrialization and collectivization that resulted in the rapid transformation of the USSR from an agrarian society into an industrial power.[2] However, the economic changes coincided with the imprisonment of millions of people in correctional labour camps.[3] The initial upheaval in agriculture disrupted food production and contributed to the catastrophic Soviet famine of 1932–1933, known as the Holodomor in Ukraine. Between 1934 and 1939 he organized and led a massive purge (known as ""Great Purge"") of the party, government, armed forces and intelligentsia, in which millions of so-called ""enemies of the Soviet people"" were imprisoned, exiled or executed. In a period that lasted from 1936 to 1939, Stalin instituted a campaign against enemies within his regime. Major figures in the Communist Party, such as the old Bolsheviks, Leon Trotsky, and most of the Red Army generals, were killed after being convicted of plotting to overthrow the government and Stalin.[4]In August 1939, after failed attempts to conclude anti-Hitler pacts with other major European powers, Stalin entered into a non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany that divided their influence and territory within Eastern Europe, resulting in their invasion of Poland in September of that year, but Germany later violated the agreement and launched a massive invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941. Despite heavy human and territorial losses, Soviet forces managed to halt the Nazi incursion after the decisive Battles of Moscow and Stalingrad. After defeating the Axis powers on the Eastern Front, the Red Army captured Berlin in May 1945, effectively ending the war in Europe for the Allies.[5][6] The Soviet Union subsequently emerged as one of two recognized world superpowers, the other being the United States.[7] The Yalta and Potsdam conferences established communist governments loyal to the Soviet Union in the Eastern Bloc countries as buffer states. He also fostered close relations with Mao Zedong in China and Kim Il-sung in North Korea.Stalin led the Soviet Union through its post-war reconstruction phase, which saw a significant rise in tension with the Western world that would later be known as the Cold War. During this period, the USSR became the second country in the world to successfully develop a nuclear weapon, as well as launching the Great Plan for the Transformation of Nature in response to another widespread famine and the Great Construction Projects of Communism.In the years following his death, Stalin and his regime have been condemned on numerous occasions, most notably in 1956 when his successor Nikita Khrushchev denounced his legacy and initiated a process of de-Stalinization. He remains a controversial figure today, with many regarding him as a tyrant.[8] However, popular opinion within the Russian Federation is mixed.[9][10][11] Stalin is attributed to 20,000,000–40,000,000 deaths as a result of his regime's actions.[12][13] "

The graphics are top notch and the sounds from the characters in game make me swear someone in standing next to me talking regularly.The game has a big fandom that grows rapidly on a daily basis, with tons of welcoming fans to meet everyday. There are tons of different gamemodes and servers to choose from if the base game somehow gets too repititious for whatever reason.I'd swear this game was made in 2056!

												Its a very good quake multiplayer port...or thats what i think it is. It only changes things like the logo to the Half-Life/Roman A. Its not as  fast-paced as the Quake multiplayer and this game's community dose not exist but if you can get on a server with REAL people then you will find hard to press the Quit button on the menu.

The game is Valve's tribute to Quake. The gameplay is similar to Quake with all the same weapons and pickups except for the Half-Life's trademark crowbar as a melee weapon. The game is very fun to play and you can get into it pretty easily. Although not many players play it anymore , so you'll be fighting with bots more than real players . But it's still a great game if you're old school.  Triskelion Turbella Reviews   "

												Deathmatch is a wonderful game that is still very much alive online. It feels like a mix of a lot of games. For example I found a Quake 3 Mod or version online and played it with other people with crazy guns. Its a hoot to play with friends. The graphics are kind of older like in HalfLife Original. There is still blood and carnage to be had in this game. Its definitely one to pick up if your into a lot of online gaming, You can play against bots online and have human players a lot play with you if you're into that kind of thing. This game is passed up and put to the side to play a lot of other games these days, but if you can get this game somehow then i would't pass up the opportunity to get it and play it. I've really enjoyed playing it and I know you will too!			"

Long story short: It's a copy and paste port of Quake's Deathmatch mode into Valve's Goldsource engine with less maps, less mods, and no singleplayer. Skip it and grab Quake instead.DISCLAIMER: As an Australian, the playerbase is almost non-existant. While playable with 4 to 8 friends, you won't enjoy this game as much if you're by yourself.Deathmatch Classic is essentially just a deathmatch type game mode using Quake's weapons (and some of its maps). It feels like it was an experiment to recreate Quake inside Valve's new engine than anything else, because it lacks any sort of content unique to the experience.Not that there's anything wrong with this game: Quake's multiplayer is some of the best there is. There's a bunch of cool weapons, each for different playstyles and situations, and the maps give a nice sense of dynamic movement. It's quick, fast, and tonnes of fun.The issue here is that Deathmatch Classic doesn't add anything other than a couple of maps. They're still good, but the issue is that for $5, you're playing a thinned down experience of the multiplayer portion of an 18 year old game that is available on the same platform. As part of the Counter-Strike 1 Anthology, it's an okay bonus, but as a standalone title it's not worth the price.RATING: 0 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]

  0 UPs 1 UPs 2 UPs 3 UPs   Not worth playing, skip it Alright, play it if you're into the genre Very good, play it if you're looking for something worth trying One to go down in history, a must have for everyone[/table]  0 DOWNs 1 DOWNs 2 DOWNs 3 DOWNs   Nothing detrimental in the game A few things wrong, but doesn't ruin it Kind-of broken or aggravating, you may not be able to put up with it Very, very broken, a lesson on what not to do "

												While the game is okay. But, it is beaten by many, MANY, other arena shooters.Try Cube 2 (Open-Source: Mac, Windows, Linux) Unreal Tournamant (Freeware: Windows, Linux + bad Mac port ) or Unreal Tournament 2004 (Steam, Commercial, Windows, Linux, easily availible for Mac if you look up how to do it.) instead. Far better in every possible way.The only real reason to get this is iff you enter the CD-Key of an old Sierra game, and get it on accident.			"

												Hello Fellow Scientists,This game is pretty much dead. There are very rarely any servers to join in on and it's an outdated deathmatch game overall.

												Much to my personal dismay, Deathmatch Classic has no reason to be recommended. Deathmatch Classic is the original QuakeWorld, but in the GoldSrc (Half-life 1, Counter strike 1.6) engine, most of the maps are great redesigns of Quake's deathmatch maps that still impress me despite its age (I have a thing for castles/churches with compressed jpegs for skyboxes), However not only is the gameplay slower due to its engine, but its playerbase is as dead as Ricochet's.Deathmatch Classic was clearly not meant to be a best-seller but a shoutout to id software and their breakthrough in PC gaming in terms of multiplayer thanks to QuakeWorld and Doom deathmatch.If you want the Deathmatch Classic experience, save your five bucks, go download Quake Live, and play it until bethesda decides to demand subscription money for every time you push a button mid-game.

												Deathmatch Classic has everything you need from a video game: you can kill people. Seriously, you can kill the heck out of them. You can't get 5 feet in this game without killing or being killed. Your entire time is spent killing. Just constant death, over and over. It is unrelenting. Murder until you can't murder any more, then murder more. Slaughter people. End their lives. Snuff out their existence. Every item, weapon, and control in this game is designed to kill or to keep you alive long enough to kill more. Execute others. They will DIE.It's also a good one for kids because it's not very complex.			"

												This is basically a remake of Quake 1's deathmatch mode on the Half-Life 1 engine, and it's awesome! The run around and shoot anything that moves style of deathmatch gameplay is a blast. The one thing that holds me back from saying you should run out and get this is the fact that barely anyone plays. You'll have maybe 3 or 4 humans at one point or another, with everyone else being bots. That said, if you get this in a Half-Life or Valve package, you should absolutely boot it up and play a few rounds.			"

												Deathmatch classic is Valve's ode to id software for giving them access to the Quake engine as they did use a modified engine to make Half-life. This game is a recreation of Quake deathmatch in the Goldsrc(Half-life Engine) and making it in a Half-life style. the game is fun, addicting and a great throwback to Quake, Only downsides is that hardly anyone plays Deathmatch Classic but you will atleast find 1 or 5 servers up and running. But overall this is a great game/mod and I would recommend it to any HL1, TF and Quake fans. 8/10			"

												This essentially is Quake Deathmatch, but on the Half-Life engine... and dead.I don't recommend it simply because you'll have more fun out of QuakeWorld, which this is an exact copy of.There are many free, legal ways to play QuakeWorld these days. Just look for nQuake, as an example.QuakeWorld also has way more mods and maps than Deathmatch Classic ever did.This game certainly was not a bad effort - it's very interesting to see Quake deathmatch ported over with Half-Life esque assets - but this used to be a free mod for Half-Life owners and not something you pay 5 bucks for.Only buy if you have someone to play this with or just want to access the content.

The game provides a fun multiplayer only experience and has a decent community. It's hard to say too much about this game due to it being multiplayer only but it is a good game with decent graphics and sound; great level design and gameplay.8/15 - ""Valve's fun Quake tribute""			"

												Deathmatch Classic is what they call the standard Half-Life 1 multi-player nowadays and I doubt it helps it much. It's still just Half-Life 1 multi-player and the problem with Half-Life 1 multi-player is that you have an incredibly amount of significantly better choices within the same game.Counter-Strike, Natural Selection, Day of Defeat, Half-Quake, The Specialist and the list goes on and on. No what what kind of FPS multi-player you are looking for, there will be a mod that serves your need and this makes Deathmatch Classic a somewhat redundant choice.There is absolutely no reason to buy this. Get the regular Half-Life instead.			"

												Pretty fun game done in the style of Quake. However before you look into this I strongly suggest you check out Quake Live, which is a free to play HD remake of Quake 3. It is far better and there are alot more players populating it's servers. Due to this game's price though, you can't really go wrong, especially if you have some friends to play with. You probably won't go back to it after you've had your fill though.			"

												Deathmatch Classic is a multiplayer DM action on HL1 engine, copying almost one to one Deathmatch of Quake 1. It was a free modification that came with patch for Half-Life back when it had retail release, yet as of right now it's being sold serapately on Steam.And I must announce first, the Internet community here is almost dead. Not worth the purchase, I am afraid. Most often, you will see a list of completely empty servers, only sometimes getting 1-3 players playing on one server.But yes, what you see here is almost complete copy of Quake 1 Deathmatch experience - a Valve's tribute of it, with same weapons, same maps even, close textures. But it's now shinier and a bit slower-paced. You get same maps. You get same weapons, but they look quite HD compared to Quake 1 style. You know them, shotguns, nailguns, grenade and rocket launchers. And as you know, rocket launcher is really the best weapon here, can't really hope to hit all time with weak projectile weapon that is Nailgun, while Rockets provide heavy-damaging splash effect anywhere you point at. Another thing, is that high-ping is quite unfriendly in this game, you can only hope to do damage with rockets. So yes, Rocket Launcher is overpowered and main thing there, like in Quake 1.  Otherwise, classic Arena formula. Stock, shoot, then run and restock. It's quite fun to duel, combatting and juggling with rockets and then getting away to restock health and armor, taking best on map.Now, if only it wasn't so dead...			"

												Easily overlooked, DMC joined the host of other official mods for the original Half-Life near the end of its glory days. It's a remake of the original Quake 1 deathmatch, an homage to the Half-Life engine's roots. It's a load of fun for about 5 minutes before you realize that Half-Life's deathmatch was more fun if only because it had Snarks. Still, this game has some charm in its remakes of classic Quake arenas.			"

												The gameplay is similar to Quake with all the same weapons and pickups except for the Half-Life's trademark crowbar as a melee weapon. The game is very fun to play and you can get into it pretty easily. Learning some of the most advanced techniques mimicked from Quake such as bunnyhopping can be tough to learn but other than that the game is not hard at all to play. However, the game doesn't really have that many active players and you won't have the same kind of fun playing it as Valve's other titles. On the whole, the game is fun but gets repetitive later on!			"

												Pros - - Like any other arena DM game, its fun, high paced, and intense.- The number of playermodels you can choose from is cool.- Rewards those who learn the layouts of maps well.- Weapons like the rocket launcher are satisfying as hell to use.- Rewards good gamesence and aim.- The regulars to DMC are pretty chill to play with.Cons - - Biggest con, there is only 1 server left in the world playing DMC. And it is rarely filled with real people, most times there are only bots to fight. - Playerbase is very very small.- Valve wants to charge 4.99 for this game, and its one of the things holding it back from having a slightly more active playerbase. And no one wants to pay 5 bucks for a game only a handful of people in the world play anymore.			"

												Deathmatch Classic was designed and released mid-'01 in honor of id Software's Quake 1.  The axe is replaced with Gordon's crowbar, since Valve made this game using the Half-Life 1 engine, GoldSrc, which is ironically a heavily modified Quake engine.  The gameplay is simplistic, tough, yet fun.  I am however upset that nobody plays this good shooter anymore since everyone refuses to recognize that the Chromosome Cannon (a.k.a. male P.o.V. weaponized manhood) is the only weapon you'll ever need to win in this game.  Below are the most commonly available maps with a short description of each next to their server-recognized names:dmc_2 = magma pitdmc_3 = maze dmc_4 = lava silodmc_6 = central portaldmc_e1m2 = watery church			"

												Wish more people played this. Very simple. Very fun. Basic deathmatch with weapons and upgrades scattered throughout the map, so battles are fast and intense. This game is old, so it has what made FPS's fun back in the day. It doesnt take one shot to kill someone and you can carry as many weapons as you want. So yeah. Just classic deathmatch. No idea how they came up with the title though!			"

												While an extreme amount of fun can be had with this game, those extreme amounts come in long intervals. The only real issue with this game is a lack of players. But if you manage to overcome this obstacle, then this game is a ton of fun. Don't expect any real twist in gameplay from Valve on this game, as it is a tribute to the glory of Quake. But this game is almost exactly that. A tribute. If you are looking for a fun time fragging your friends like old times then this game is really only ideal if you get it in a bundle. So to paraphrase...Pros-A remake of sorts of one of the most revolutionary FPS games of all time. A good remake at that.-Tight controls, an array of weapons, and tricks are carried over from Quake, so you will own people if you were good back in the day.-Can run on a potato and still look decent.-Can have an assortment of different pings and still play smoothly during matches.-Decent texture quality for the maps.-Good customization of your character for rounds. You can choose to play as Gman or Gordan Freeman, as well as some other characters from the original Half Life.-Good fun for you and your friends if you want an interesting ""blast from the past"" during a LAN party.-Comes with a few bundles so you can snag this game for next to nothing while getting some of Valve's top work.Cons-No one plays it enough to find a lively match.-Too few servers to actually play on, but thankfully there are servers to begin with.-While the maps are mainly ports of Quake maps without their more explicit, pixel-heavy graphics, there are only around 6-8 maps total, not including Custom maps though. -Since there aren't really many matches at all, you won't really have the opportunity to enjoy this game.Other topics-Outdated gameplay mechanics by today's standards, but perfect by the logic of the original games produced by Id Software.-Weapon selection, while restricted to the original weapon selection from Quake, can become stale for more modern players.The verdict is...... Get it only in a bundle. I loved Quake, and I loved what little bit I get from this. The game offers so much, but can only really do so when you have others to play against.			"

												Pros - - Like any other arena DM game, its fun, high paced, and intense.- The number of playermodels you can choose from is cool.- Rewards those who learn the layouts of maps well.- Weapons like the rocket launcher are satisfying as hell to use.- Rewards good gamesence and aim.- The regulars to DMC are pretty chill to play with.Cons - - Biggest con, there is only 1 server left in the world playing DMC. And it is rarely filled with real people, most times there are only bots to fight. - Playerbase is very very small.- Valve wants to charge 4.99 for this game, and its one of the things holding it back from having a slightly more active playerbase. And no one wants to pay 5 bucks for a game only a handful of people in the world play anymore.			"

												I'll be honest, I didn't buy this on it's own, I bought the full Valve game pack a few Christmases ago and this was one of the games included in the bundle.I decided to play it simply to see how bad it was, because I saw how old it was and wanted a good laugh.Turns out this game is actually....really fun. Sure, it looks like a piece of ♥♥♥♥ but remember this game isn't even from this century, nevermind decade. I actually go back on it every few months and play it for few minutes or so, sometimes even with a friend.This game isn't very populated as you'd expect, but there's always around 8-9 servers on at all times, so you'll find a game quite easily.If you're going on holiday and can't take your main PC and have to use a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, or perhaps your PC is broke and you need something to do whilst it's getting fixed and you have an old PC at hand, I'd reccomend buying this. It's just a bunch of mindless pixelated killing, sure- but it's fun as ♥♥♥♥.			"

												This game is great, no doubt about it.I have only spent (at the time) 42 minutes in total, and it breezed past quicklyIf you find the right server, it's great.Pros:-Fast paced action-Hours of fun-My head hurts from the intensity-Runs on the Source engine, for that little bit of perfume.Cons:-None!I rate this 7.5/10, and I put down the rating due to the intense ♥♥♥♥ happening at all times.Again, my head hurts.

												I bought Valve Complete Pack and I wanted to play some other games that CS:GO. First thing that I saw was this. It was 32 MB so I thought, well It will download for about  6 secs soooo, yeah, let's give it a try. I joined a server which had 1 guy playing on it, cuz all the others were empty. There were two teams, Satan and Jesus. I choose Jesus cuz he's my man, and I went around and killed satan bots with a shotgun like a boss. Then After a while, the other player started Team Killing and I got disconnected for no reason at all. :P Anyways, very fun and crazy. Get it as a apart of the Valve Pack.			"

												It's okay for a dollar, I guess... There's really no point in playing this now besides nostalgia or if you have a potato. But there are much better things to play on a potato. However, it is still fun.			"

												Goldsrc is a heavily modified quake engine, this game is quake but on goldsrc. If you guy's are looking for a cheap awesome game that runs well, then buy this game! It is also reccommended for quake veterans and players.			"

												Nobody plays it anymore so you'll have to install a third-party bot. But as a Quake Fan this game is awesome and with bots or better yet friends it's a very fun game.			"

												Funny thing about this game: When I bought the original Counter-Strike, I got this game for free (as well as a bunch of other games), so that's a plus.If you're looking for a good-ol' classic arena shooter, this is the game for you.			"
