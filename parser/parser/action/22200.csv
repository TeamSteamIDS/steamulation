												Zeno Clash is a beat'em up style fighting game with a dash of first person shooter added into the mix. This game uses Valve's Source engine and was released in April 2009. The xBox got it's version a year later in 2010, but for some reason, got a ""Ultimate Edition"" with content that cannot be accessed on the PC version.  You play as a young warrior named Ghat, and you are on the run from your family as you have accidentally killed your father in an explosion. You have a female companion by the name of Deadra who helps save Ghat along the way. The gameplay is whilst looks like it is a very generic fighting game, it feels different. I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the gameplay seemed a little off to begin with. The tutorial gives a very good introduction into the basics of fighting and dodging, as well as helps you along the way with controls and early combos.  You have the usual quick attacks, powerful attacks, dodges, and blocks as you would expect. Zeno Clash also adds in a little gun combat too, which again, almost feels a little bit off. There is no auto reload on the weapons, which is not always a bad thing, but most fps style games now days at least auto reload once you have emptied your round/clip.  You also cannot fire you run unless you are looking down the scope of it; meaning you will probably end up throwing your weapon around a lot like I did as I was just trying to shoot from the hip. Every level is essentially a fight scene, you have a set amount of opponents which are introduced at the start of each stage, and the aim is to kill them, simples. Zeno Clash has a very good aiming system meaning you can rotate between various different enemies and have the camera automatically face the location they are in. The majority of Zeno Clash's graphics are really top notch; something we should expect from a Source Engine game though. This game is six years old and still looks like a current generation game in my eyes. I played this on a 4K resolution and it looked absolutely stunning (for the most part). Where I ran into a weird graphic problem, was the tutorial. I am not sure whether it was a bug or glitch for me, but the resolution/texture quality/anti aliasing, was absurdly bad on all the tutorial scenes.  I really didn't know what was happening, I went from looking at a stunning 4k rendered world, to something which looks like a SNES has just produced. Like I said, this only happened for me on the tutorial levels, the rest of the game was absolutely fine. Zeno Clash has a good story; one that has a lot of olive branches into a few smaller stories, but focuses on the main story for the majority of the time. The game ends well and will leave you wanting to find out more about the world of Zenozoik (I just love the name of this place!).This game has three levels of difficulty; I played on normal and had a sufficiently challenging playthrough, there are no points which had me running against a brick wall for hours - I had to retry a couple of times. I can see the harder difficulty to be a real challenge though, since the handicap fights can get real hectic if you don't keep track on where all of your enemies are at ALL times - you will end up getting your head beat in from behind and you won't even realize. A full playthrough of Zeno Clash's story mode took me just about five hours; the rest of the time I spent in the challenge mode, which allows you to climb a tower and have your scores ranked every time you beat the final boss. In total I got about fourteen hours worth of gameplay out of it, so for £6,99, I am very happy with that outcome. Other than the strange graphical glitches I had on the tutorial modes; I did experience a few crashes. This came from when trying to use anything related to the Steam Overlay such as screenshots, or shift+tabbing to bring up your friends list whilst in game; this instantly crashed me to the desktop. The game also doesn't have a manual save function, so you are relying heavily on the auto save feature. Normally when I am playing a game which I have experienced crashes on, I try to save as often as I can, so when I found out I couldn't manually saved, it made me very cautious and was often on edge hoping for it not to crash, which somewhat spoiled the experience for me.  I also had a problem where the game would not count any of my achievements,  whether this is because of the issue with the Steam Overlay or not - I'm not sure. To sum up; I will recommend Zeno Clash as a very good PC game; it's standing the test of time very well, has some very nice graphics, a compelling story line and decent gameplay. If you don't experience any crashes or bugs, then you will have yourself a welcome addition to your Steam library in this game. If you can't really overlook the issues; then this may be one of the only times I say to try the console version out since that sounds like it is virtually bug free. Thankfully Steam does have a demo up for this game, so you can try it out first before purchasing - which is something I would highly recommend you do.

xeno- prefix. from Ancient Greek ξένος (ksénos, “alien”) a. Having to do with foreigners, as in xenophilia, or more commonly, xenophobia. b. From a foreign place, as in xenolith.clash noun. onomatopoeic a. A skirmish, a hostile encounter. b. Opposition, contradiction, such as between differing or contending interests, views, purposes etc.In my imagination, the development of Xeno-- sorry, Zeno Clash -- started when folks at Ace Team got together, got high, and got onto the subject of ancient mythologies (Roman, Greek, Norse, etc.) and how weird they all were. I mean, if you want crazy characters and crazier stories, you need look no further than some of the gods and goddesses traipsing around back in the day. Athena, birthed fully formed out of the sweaty forehead of Zeus; Pan, the goat-god of wanton sex; Artemis, goddess of the hunt, who for some reason was depicted in various interpretations as being literally covered with breasts; Medusa, she of the stylish snake perm and stony gaze, being some kind of metaphor for psychosexual wackiness (I'm pretty sure we can blame Freud for that); Jeff, the God of Biscuits; and even some nutter who told people to eat some bread and drink some wine and pretend it was his flesh and his blood... I mean, ew, dude. I'm sure we have enough problems without adding cannibalism to it. So anyway, the developers were shooting the breeze about Gods and Golden Fleece and rivers of blood and whatever until one guy, as I imagine it, stood up and went, ""Yeah... but like, what if... Dude! What if there were, like, aliens, right? And they were weird, like totally, heh, but then, like, THEY also had myths and ♥♥♥♥! I mean... dude...""So that's where this game comes from, more or less. There is a distinct dreamlike quality inherent in the stories of myth, fantastical and larger than life, and that is the feeling you get as you find your way through the land of Zenozoik. It feels deliciously alien and new, in the visuals and in the story (neither of which go out of their way to make a lot of sense, but it's still easy enough to follow). You'll see and hear a lot of weird stuff, and sooner or later, you just go with the flow because it's weirdly seductive. Even running on the old Source engine, and looking a bit dated now in 2015, the art and design and imagination of the dev team comes through in nearly every area so that you will truly think you are in fact running around on an impossibly, impossibly alien world. Luckily, they do at least have one thing in common with us here on Earth: they really like punching the stuffing out of each other.If you've seen anything about Zeno Clash you already know the basics: it's a first-person brawler-shooter. Way more emphasis on the brawling than the shooting, thankfully. You, a fugitive on the run, have a modest set of fighting moves at your disposal, such as light and strong punches, blocks, dodges, counterattacks, grabs and throws. Unfortunately, so do your opponents for the most part, although they will also attack you at range if they get a chance. You get a small selection of weapons yourself, and they come in handy once in a while but the majority of your combat will be served in knuckle sandwiches. And they were never so tasty: combat feels fantastic in this game. It's fun, responsive and fast, with a good amount of variety (though there could be more), and it's super satisfying to land an uppercut on some chump and watch him go flying. I didn't really think I'd enjoy such a melee-focused FPS but after playing this I stand corrected, it's ridiculously fun. I even enjoyed the few bits where you are required to tote a rifle or another firearm, although I am glad those bits were few. They're not bad, really -- the rifle in particular sounds great, and it's amusing to plunk away at dudes with the double-fisted handguns -- but save for a couple spots you won't really get that much of a chance to use them because enemies will do their best to rush you if you're shooting at them, and none of the weapons are viable at close quarters.One thing you will notice right off the bat is the voice acting, and it is... hmm. How to describe it. Well, your first impression will probably be ""Oh my god this is bad."" And you wouldn't really be wrong, especially with regards to the main character. He is, let's say, from the same acting school as Christopher Walken and William Shatner, only he flunked out hard. His lines are awkwardly paced, and weirdly inexpressive; he speaks in a stilted, matter-of-fact tone. All of that might turn you off -- which is why I'm mentioning it -- but honestly, his weirdness actually fits the game very well. There is often dialogue that sounds so insane on paper, but because of the way he delivers his lines, it instead sounds believable and ordinary, which makes the bizarre setting of the game even more bizarre. All in all, it works for me. It may not work for you.It's not a very long game (ignore my obscenely long playtime), but it's a fully-formed, enjoyable, weird as all hell story that will have you doing at least one or two double-takes because you have probably never heard sentences like these in a game before. The fighting is hard and fast and so enjoyable, the world is filled with delicious weirdness for your eyes, and the trusty Source engine shines through even for a six year old game. I don't know about you, but it absolutely charmed the pants off me with how little Ace Team cared for making the ""right"" game, and made a fun, unique, and beautifully bizarre one instead.			"

												+ Combat system is incredibly simple and satisfying; everything connects and feels right, making this the game's greatest strength+ Character designs are creative and interesting; just the right mixture of weird and entertaining+ Strange weapon designs; very original in every respect (if you've seen the 1999 film ExistenZ, imagine the chicken bone gun, and populate an entire game-world with the same concept)+ Control scheme is efficient, and every button-press felt natural and satisfying+ Strange, yet appropriate soundtrack; did well to set the mood and keep you feeling mildly unsettled+ Atmospheric elements worked well with the environmental set-pieces to make for an absolutely bizarre world; I must say that this level of creativity, while unconventional, was a breath of fresh air+ Challenging, adaptive AI; enemies really keep you on your toes in the best possible way (save for a few, minor shortcomings - some of the bosses are also a bit too easy to cheese)- Terrible voice-acting- Stiff, clumsy animations- Frustrating and unnecessary lock-on system- Save for a (rather dull) Challenge Mode, and the ability to unlock cheat codes for the campaign, this title has virtually no replay value- Largely weak sound effects- Poorly explained, muddled plot with little character development and too many answers left out (topped off with a mediocre cliffhanger)LockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

												Truly a masterpiece. Fight your way to the truth of an unhinged world through mobsters, monsters, deranged beings and dark creatures.Zenozoik is a wonderful, vivid world, but this is no paradise. Forget the tales about the 'good savage', for this land is full of secrets and violence. Find out the reason of the brutal hunting you suffer from your own brothers, the secret crimes Ghat has come to know. In this first journey in Zenozoik, there'll be some revelations, but also questions that'll make you wish everything hidden to be brought into the open. The world ACE Team has created is really unique, and you'll always feel that there's much more to see... and to fight. Because Zeno Clash is above all, a brawling game, and it excels on it. The extraordinary plot backs an addictive and satisfying combat system, and luckyly the game includes modes beyond the main history which will sate your thirst for beating throwing you right into the action, in the increasingly harder stages of a tower which progressive destruction will delight you by its smart use of physics. Zeno Clash is an indispensable, which will remind you why some games deserve to be considered art; exalted visuals, surprising lore and relentless fights await you. Welcome to Zenozoik, brother.

												8/10Strong fantasy appeal.  The world and story is of new mythology.  Fighting system is challenging, fun, annoying, and very immersive.  For the most part the game is moderate difficulty from beginning to end.  Some of the fights can be easily beaten once you find a weakness in the A.I. or level design.  The game favors freaks who love originality.  The short length was perfect for the story.  Because it is a short game I would reccomend getting it on sale.  Overall a very enjoyable experience.  I have gained a number of concepts and ideas that will occupy my daydreams for the next month or so. I will be getting Zeno Clash 2 next time it is on sale.[If you are having problems with the fighting system then wait a few months and come back to it.  Start the game over and try again.  Worked for me.]			"

												This game is a strange ,unique and most of all a fun to play game. The first person view combat was a new experience to me and I really liked it. Although, the game felt a bit short than I was expecting. And the plot seems a bit in-complete. The additional challenge modes are fun as well. And best of all it is well optimized for my low end pc, which all source engine games do. The game is totally worth it and I will rate it a 8/10.			"

												This game has vivid and imaginative visuals going for it.But is otherwise let down by a boring, uninspiring and pretentiously written story.That and the game is a chore to play, with little satisfaction to be had from vanquishing your foes. The tedious fights feel like a punishment and distraction from the not as unpleasant cut-scenes.It's worth a look for its originality but has little redeeming value otherwise.			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Zeno Clash is a first-person melee fighting game developed by ACE Team using Valve's famous Source Engine and released on Steam back in 2009.The story begins with Ghat, the game's protagonist, waking up after being knocked out by an explosion which killed a creature known as Father-Mother who is the leader of a very powerful mafia like family in the small town of Halstedom. The protagonist Ghat is presumably one of Father-Mother's children who turned rogue and ran away from home and is now being pursued by his 'brothers and sisters' (enforcers of Father-Mother). Join him and his companion Deadra in a quest to discover the truth of about Ghat's past and trace back the series of events that led to the explosion.PROS:+ Excellent use of the Source Engine+ Good fisticuffs (melee) combat mechanic+ Surreal world and environment+ Complex but enjoyable story+ Interesting character, item and monster designs+ Item variety+ Good sound effects and voice acting+ The Devs were probably high during this game's production+ Challenging difficultiesCONS:- Extremely short (4-5 hours game time in my last playthrough)- Almost no replay value (except for the tower challenge mode)- Difficult learning curve- Story is a bit difficult to follow- Short linear levels (In my opinion, linear games are fine as long as the levels are lengthy and enjoyable)- No character progression (no armors, level ups or item upgrades)CONCLUSION:GOOD GAME. Zeno Clash sports a very unique art style that places you in a very surreal world with a strange geography and is populated by strange creatures all brought to life by the developer's clever use of Valve's Source Engine. The combat mechanics is fun albeit a little frustrating at times and hard to learn however, the items does give variety to the player's fighting style. The game should provide you with at least 4-5 hours of game time with its campaign with an added 'Tower Challenge' if the player wants to test his skills.I RECOMMEND this game mostly for the experience but the short game time could be an issue, still though, Zeno Clash is a fun game to play. I can't honestly cannot recommend it at full price (even if it is only $10 or your regional equivalent), so getting it on a sale is probably a better idea.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Zeno Clash is a bit short compared to most single-player games, and the gameplay mechanics can feel a bit limiting at times, but there is something about this game to which I am drawn.The excerpt from the IGN review about it feeling ""refreshingly original and completely compelling"" is 100% on the mark. Zeno Clash has a great story and is more than worth the $1 it tends to go on sale for during each of the past few big Steam sales at the time of this writing (Autumn Sale 2013). "

												I had no idea what the hell I was doing, but I beat it, somehow.It's relatively short, but the world is alien in both a good and a bad way. Some of the designs are awesome, funny and nice, others are just plain ugly and it doesn't always fit together. But I guess that's what makes Zeno Clash the game it is: Awkward and fun, much less than it could have been. An incredibly inventive universe only lightly touched by it's weird little storyline.I recommend Zeno Clash for anyone looking for an intriguing brief experience, or people with a thing for tattoo'd on moustaches.

												# Time to completion - about 4 hours #A fun first person melee focused game with a weird and wonderful art style, bizarre characters, and a story interesting enough to keep you wondering. Pros:-Combat is very unique and fun-Art style- An additional ""tower climb"" challange mode if you want.Cons:-Very linear-There is a ""lock on"" mechanic in the game that happens when you fight an enemy. This can be disengaged manually, but can get a bit annoying when it comes to fighting 3+ people are once.- There was one instance where i had to reload the level because it got bugged. Nothing major and it only took me about 5 minutes to make it up.Neutral:-It is short - like 3-4 hours.			"

												Very strange, to be honest, I thought someone dosed me with something, I had to ask and confirm with other people that this game was real. The gameplay at its heart is a first person brawler, with a healthy mix up of shooting here and there. but the story, woa ho ho.... man. imagine a world that was generations deep with inbreeding, as well as cross breeding with chickens and pigs, and not the cute jrpg way, but more of a demented master blaster way. This is the world you're going to get into with this game.I did not like the melee combat at first, but the story kept me playing, and I ended up finding that the parry hit and run knee to the face smash tactics to be, well....... really good. and by the end of the game I found myself actually wanting to toss my guns down and put my fists up. It's short, but left me satisfied. I hope we see more of this twisted world.			"

												  Zeno Clash is a wierd game that tries to, and succeeds at, doing something that no other FPS has done.  The story is strange, the characters are mysterious, and the player is left continuously wondering what will happen next.  Unfortunately, the story is also not interesting. The game just throws disparate scenario after scenario at you presented as a series of events that happened before the beginning of the game, and it leaves it largely up to you to connect these events.  The characters are not expanded upon, the enemies are only briefly expounded on, and the main characters motivations are left entirely unclear.  I believe this was a choice made deliberately to add mystery to the story, but for me it only left me wanting for a clear reason to continue to my goal.  None of this would be a problem if the game was fun.  I don't need a reason to complete the game if I enjoy playing it.  Zeno Clash is unique in that it tries to blend melee and ranged combat in an FPS in a way I've never seen before.  The melee portion includes blocking, counter attacks, dodging, grabs, and other staples of good melee combat.  The mechanics of the game is what brings it down in this respect.  It would take a long time to describe exactly how frustrating it is to control the combat, but I frequently ended up performing the wrong defensive move which would result in my taking damage.  Furthermore, the counterattacks don't work.  Almost every time I tried to counter an enemy they would block or dodge my counterattack.  The ranged combat has similar problems.  Guns are not meant to be used exclusively.  You are supposed to pick up a weapon and shoot an enemy as many times as you can until they get close to you.  This part feels good.  Watching an enemy running towards you, it feels great to score those two big hits that send them flying on their back then pelting them with more shots until they start towards you again.  When they start getting closer though is when the frustration begins.  When an enemy gets close, you are meant to lock on to put away your weapon and begin melee.  However, running away from an enemy breaks your lock, so if you are trying to get away, the gun comes back out.  If you are hit with the gun out, it drops to the ground with whatever ammo it had, where enemies can pick it up and use it against you.  In short, again, the mechanincs of this game make it very frustrating to do what you want to do, and to fight multiple enemies.  In conclusion, I wanted to like this game.  I like wierd games, I like difficult games, and I like story-driven games.  I HATE frustrating games, however, and this falls squarely into that last category.  The mechanincs of combat don't work, the story was not holding my interest, and I felt no reason to complete the game.  In addition, I found a Zeno Clash process running in the background of my PC even though I hadn't played the game in days and the game itself was not running, so my hours played are inflated.  I should note I did not finish this game.			"

												Zeno clash is probably one of the more memorable games I've played this year. Set in one of the most creative worlds I have ever witnessed, this game stands out as a real gem to me.+Well-developed melee fighting where you can lash together combos, strike quickly or strongly, or pick a median attack. Blocking, dodging, countering, finishing. Many great moves to help you deal with the situation at hand.+Ranged weapons that work fairly well from dual-wielded pistols, rifles, crossbows, or 'grenade launchers'. All very imaginatively designed in a way that they're nothing like you'd imagine based upon how I just described them. Unfortunately they make some fights a little too easy, but without them those same fights would have been a bit too hard.+It's challenging, but not unfair. Many games today are either too easy, or designed unfairly to promote difficulty. Zeno clash is almost the perfect median between the two.+The voice acting for the characters is simply splended. Every voice actor was given strange roles to fit, very specific roles, and they all nailed them with excellence. +Great and memorable characters. From the moral-less Ghat, to the kind and caring Deadra, to the mysterious Father-Mother and all of his-her sons and daughters you face throughout the game. To the also-mysterious Golem, and even to the many unique Corwid you face throughout the game. Oxameter and Gabel being the most memorable.+The story is confusing to begin with, but as you progress and learn more about what's happening it is fantastic. Absolutely great. Unfortunately it ends in a bit of a cliff hanger but that's fine! We have a sequel available to us! +The world is simply stunning. The setting is so unique and refreshing, I just want to experience more and more of it. Give me more!+The music fits the game so well! Matching every moment almost perfectly! Well-arranged tracks as well.+A challenge mode to keep you entertained after you beat the main story, which is well needed since....-I finished the game in a little over 3 hours. And the challenge mode will keep you busy for about one extra hour, which is nice.I give this game a solid 9/10. How short it is is what holds it back from its full potential, but this is a game no one should miss. Definitely pick this one up as soon as possible!			"

												Awkward controls, laughably bad voice acting, and atrociously lacking amount of customization and modability.It has a unique art style and interesting story, but nothing makes up for quite how ODD the game feels on so many levels, and the ending really isn't quite worth it. Might consider it on sale, but even then there are other things more worth your time.All in all, this game provides a good showcase of why first person brawlers don't tend to be produced much.			"

												I'm trying to think of the best way to advise somebody just now picking this game up, whether by random choice or under pressure from their friends. Of course, the latter will probably result in disappointment. Don't let the buzzwords (quirky, awkward, weird, crazy) fool you. The game is (though I loath to use this term) ""quirky,"" to be sure, the story and voice work have an awkward, disjointed feel, as does the game's art style. Trust me when I say this is all intentional on the part of the devs, and isn't just a pointless dive at becoming the strangest thing since Vangers.If you have ever been told this game is ""deep,"" it's because of the revelations of the sequel, Zeno Clash 2. Anyone suggesting you play the first part of a series because of how much THEY enjoyed the revelations of the second part is like someone watching Return of the King, going bananas over the charge of the Rohirim and suggesting you pick up the extended edition of Fellowship when you have no experience with LOTR whatsoever. You will not enjoy it. PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS WHATSOEVER. Ignore the exaltations of your peers.As for how ""quirky"" and ""awkward"" this game is, like I said, it's intentional. There's a suitable comparison in the 1984 movie Scanners. The protagonist is a man who has been mute his entire life, and suddenly regains the power of speech. It's not very well elaborated upon in the film, but his social skills and speech patterns are completely out of whack because of this: he has to develope these skills almost from the ground up. The people who inhabit the world of Zeno Clash have a similar problem, which is elaborated upon in the sequel; again, perhaps explaining why people think this game is so ""deep.""Gameplay is fairly simple and quite challenging. First person hand-to-hand is a very peculiar form of gameplay, particularly when it's as complicated as it is in both Zeno Clash 1 and 2. Though there is a limited variety of enemies, they all have unique fighting styles which you will have to adapt to in order to succeed. Enemies will fake you out, surprise you with the reach of their attacks, suddenly overwhelm you with a flurry of blows; to this day, whenever I pick up Zeno Clash I'm regularly intimidated and surprised by the combat, in spite of having played through the game multiple times. It's no surprise that some players are frustrated by how unpredictable it is and even reject the game entirely, dismissing it as quirky nonsense. Trust me, just have patience and work on your timing. Pick some good battle music and play the tower challenges. You'll probably find it as enjoyable and satisfying as I do.			"

												I'm trying to think of the best way to advise somebody just now picking this game up, whether by random choice or under pressure from their friends. Of course, the latter will probably result in disappointment. Don't let the buzzwords (quirky, awkward, weird, crazy) fool you. The game is (though I loath to use this term) ""quirky,"" to be sure, the story and voice work have an awkward, disjointed feel, as does the game's art style. Trust me when I say this is all intentional on the part of the devs, and isn't just a pointless dive at becoming the strangest thing since Vangers.If you have ever been told this game is ""deep,"" it's because of the revelations of the sequel, Zeno Clash 2. Anyone suggesting you play the first part of a series because of how much THEY enjoyed the revelations of the second part is like someone watching Return of the King, going bananas over the charge of the Rohirim and suggesting you pick up the extended edition of Fellowship when you have no experience with LOTR whatsoever. You will not enjoy it. PLAY THIS GAME WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATIONS WHATSOEVER. Ignore the exaltations of your peers.As for how ""quirky"" and ""awkward"" this game is, like I said, it's intentional. There's a suitable comparison in the 1984 movie Scanners. The protagonist is a man who has been mute his entire life, and suddenly regains the power of speech. It's not very well elaborated upon in the film, but his social skills and speech patterns are completely out of whack because of this: he has to develope these skills almost from the ground up. The people who inhabit the world of Zeno Clash have a similar problem, which is elaborated upon in the sequel; again, perhaps explaining why people think this game is so ""deep.""Gameplay is fairly simple and quite challenging. First person hand-to-hand is a very peculiar form of gameplay, particularly when it's as complicated as it is in both Zeno Clash 1 and 2. Though there is a limited variety of enemies, they all have unique fighting styles which you will have to adapt to in order to succeed. Enemies will fake you out, surprise you with the reach of their attacks, suddenly overwhelm you with a flurry of blows; to this day, whenever I pick up Zeno Clash I'm regularly intimidated and surprised by the combat, in spite of having played through the game multiple times. It's no surprise that some players are frustrated by how unpredictable it is and even reject the game entirely, dismissing it as quirky nonsense. Trust me, just have patience and work on your timing. Pick some good battle music and play the tower challenges. You'll probably find it as enjoyable and satisfying as I do.			"

												What the heck is Zeno Clash?Zeno clash is a first person bang em up type game where the player can punch or kick the crap out of his opponents. Seems like simple fun arcade stuff right? Sort of is, but there are added features to the game (beside the campaign) that make it significant. The storyline is a good one to say the least. There is a guy who trains you in the game and by the time he's done training you, he simply kills himself. This game is whacky, weird, and odd, but how it all comes together within the world is awesome. When people speak about creative games, this one definitely takes the cake with it's outrageous characters. Besides the game play, the characters alone will make you double take. They are given personalities with extreme oddity that simply makes it appealing. I fought a boss who jumped on top of a bunch of dinosaurs while trying to kill me for pete's sake. I really like the fighting engine and the added features of being able to pick up guns, crossbows, and other sort of crazy weaponry like blunt objects that send opponents flying. When you fight, it actually feels like you're making contact with the opponent. The feedback in the punches was done phenomenally. Should you buy it? On sale I would say unless you REALLY like these types of games.For future Zeno Clash games I would recommend multiplayer, and maybe even dare to try to incorporate local co-op. To add to the fighting, perhaps add kicks or even allow for players to hold down the mouse button, then use the mouse to swing to determine the type of swing. Don't make it to the point where people start snapping their mouse cord, but something decently close enough.RATING : 8.2/10get's an extra .2 for being a breakaway new type of genre.Gameplay B+ Story / Campaign A- Visuals / User Interface B Sounds / Music B Replay-ability B- Overall  B "

												If there ever was an award for weirdest world, Zeno Clash would be a top contender. The game starts with you killing your Father-Mother(Which is a single entity) under suspicious circumstances and it doesn't slow down from there as you progress both further away, running from your brothers and sisters, and back to the start, through flashbacks explaining how you came to kill your Father-Mother. At no point does Zeno Clash attempt to make excuses for it's insane universe, no explanation is given for anything that does not fit within the games context, things simply are.Some will love this and some will hate it but either way you can't help but admire the writers for making such an uncompromising world that gives you one WTF? moment after the other with barely a second to catch your breath.The gameplay is simplistic repetitive beat-em-up not worth mentioning but the game should be played, if only to experience the madding world of Zeno Clash, whose like you won't find anywhere else.

												It's safe to say that Zeno Clash wouldn't work as a big budget game from an established studio; it's far too different from convention, which would mean it's far too risky a project for them. But it's a perfect example of how some of the best and most original ideas are coming out of independent teams that have talent and passion and can take risk because they're not gambling with tens of millions of dollars. Zeno Clash sticks with you long after you play it, and that's a compliment many games aspire to have associated with them.			"

												Would you like a game that's really simple yet solid, like the beat'em ups from the days of yore (but in first person view)? What about an art style that looks like the lovechild of Roger Dean and David Cronenberg on acid? A soundtrack with a wild sense of urgency? Do you want to feel like Kenshiro from Hokuto no Ken, punching people into the air, while the story discreetly discusses  Sartrean Existentialism and Hobbesian societal notions? Do you want to shoot multibreasted rat people with a fishgun? What about birdmen? Then this game is for you!!!!!			"

												A short, but action packed journey in a unique world.You are on the run, hunted by your own family for the murder of your own father - or better - Father-Mother, aided only by the young woman by your side.The story is split in two parallel storylines: your present and your past, which will unfold via flashbacks, as you narrate your past and motives to your only remaining friend, and will take you to the very end of the world, before you decide to return home to settle your past once and for all.Gameplay-wise, the combat in this game is praised as one of the best melee combat experiences in gaming, and while I don't fully agree, I certainly see how it may be so for many people.You will find an immersive first person combat system, where every punch and every block counts, and mostly, FEELS right.In the end, it is a short story of ideals and revelations that may even manage to make you think of society as we see it.Hard to recommend to everyone, although it is so short (I completed it in 5h and I'm sure it can be completed in a little less) that even those who simply seek an alternative adventure won't be too weighed down. I do recommend it, however, to first person brawlers' fans, you will be given every tool to test your fighting skills.In short: short, first person brawler with excellent, fleshed out combat and a story with a morale set in a bizarre world.

												I mainly knew about ACE team because of the incredibly impressive Batman Doom, but I was surprised they were a commercial studio. I was definitely not disappointed in their first commercial effort. Simple, effective gameplay and visuals that feel straight out of Heavy Metal. First person brawlers need a much bigger presence. I've played an hour and a half but I'm halfway through the game. The simplicity makes up for the length though, and it feels like it can offer more replay in return. Don't bother complaining about it, you probably have more games in your Steam account than you can finish in your lifetime anyways. Be thankful you're not getting a 50 hour timesink that you'll put off playing forever because of the daunting length.			"

												I'm going to give the controversial opinion and say that I didn't really enjoy this game.The first person combat is amazing, yes. I love the way that the first person fighting mechanics feel. But the story just could not hold my interest.The world you are put in is such an interesting and creative one, yet the plot is so jointed and disconnected that I never felt like I got to know the world very well. The story and plot was just too confusing for me to understand. Many aspects just felt unexplained, and the game ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger.Is the game worth trying? Sure. But personally? I felt the confusing story made the game drag on far too long.			"

												Zeno Clash is weird. There's something not quite right about this game, but I still had a lot of fun playing it. There are many bizarre creatures and an unsettling storyline to back them up. I think this game was made just unique enough to stand out, but it's still too weird to love. Zeno Clash, metaphorically speaking, has a face that only a (giant hideous monster) mother could love. It's worth playing, but you've been warned.			"

												Maybe you watched The Dark Crystal and thought, ""Man, I sure would like to beat the $&!? out of everyone and everything in this world!"" This is pretty close. It's like, ""The Dark Crystal... Meth"".First person boxing and melee that mostly works with some ranged weapons thrown in. An older source engine game, the effects (lighting, atmosphere, reflections) look nice but not amazing. The art design itself is wildly creative and a highlight of the experience. The gameplay is not perfect, sometimes it can be frustrating because of the targeting mechanic (you lock on an opponent then need to unlock to regroup effectively), but it was actually quite satisfying overall. Some good brawls and decent variety, and when you need a weapon, it'll be there.The story is the stuff of dark fairy tales and myth. It is pretty weird and told with flashbacks that roll into the present. But it makes sense, in a dreamy sort of way. The voice acting is solid. Just don't expect a lot of character depth or the option to interact with anyone in any way besides pummeling the holy $&!? out of them. Not a very long game, Zeno Clash has a challenge ladder if you wanna fight some more.  I'd actually say it was a good length because it didn't get boring. The hand to hand combat combined with the great weird visuals makes this a pretty good buy for $10, or a great buy for .99 cents. Looking forward to Zeno Clash 2 :)

I have got to say its a great story even if it does feel a little minimalist. The characters and environments are just lovely!  I probably wont go through and try to beat the game again here on Steam but I want you to know that if you haven't played through this game, you definitely should if you are a fan of adventure games, Indie games, or just want a good thought provoking story!

I suggest to get it discounted though.- Review below ----------------------------------------------------------------------Zeno Clash is a unique game in its genre : a first person fighter - beat-them-all set in a tribal punk fantasy world. You play as Ghat all along his journey exiled from his tribe through the end of the world. Helped by his sister he will face many opponents and dangers to survive along his exile : that will includes many brothers and sisters of his own Father-Mother (an hermaphrodite creature) as well as a hired head-hunter, the Corwid of the Free's tribe and many critters.But Ghat isn't weak at all, quite the contrary, he is really strong despite his thin shape. He also learned how-to fight with Metamoq the chief of Corwid of the Free. So he knows how to fight using his fists or melee or gun weapons.The game features levels, meaning that there is no at lot to explore but there are many brawls and fights to come through. Despite that, there are many new environments and concepts to make the game quite interesting. Also each level are independent meaning that weapons you had at the end of a level won't be transferred to the next level. (Unless the bombs are but I'm not sure) So as you understood each level as its own weapons, enemies and fruits in specific places. The game consists in exploring (a little) and fighting/brawling waves of foes and bosses. The HUD is very simple : you got your own portrait with your health and stamina bars. Every time you run or prepare a strong attack you use stamina which will be restored slowly. And don't be afraid for your health bar running low, there are always some fruits that give you some health back as well as some checkpoint that restore you whole health ! The HUD show you also the remaining bombs you got.Adding to the story mode there is also a challenge mode. Challenges take place in a tower, split in two area : the top and the bottom. If you are going in the top you are going to fight many foes on each level using the given weapons or not (you can brawl instead most of the time) to reach the top level which include the story boss as well as many foes at the same time ! If you are going at the bottom, you'll need to fight foes and make you way below by jumping platform by platform using bombs if needed to break a whole platform to make a hole. But don't forget to take care of every foe cause you won't go deeper until you dealt with all of them. So you can push them all in the pit below but you'll need to face all the survivors at the end. Also when you'll go deeper you'll encounter golden enemies which are more powerful and tougher. Each level can be played independently so it's not a real survival game. At the end of each challenge you'll be in the leaderboard with the time you've made and the remaining health. So you can compete with your friends on steam.That's not all : you have also 70 Zeno Clash characters and foes patterns for Garry's Mod.I would really recommend this game !(*): A very uncommon issue happened to me in the Corvid of the Free forest : after I've beat up every foe the game keep playing without occurring the next wave. But after waiting / moving several minutes the next wave appeared.(#): I would say almost every achievement can be backtracked and several of them are kept while making another playthrough or replaying some levels. Only one ""difficult"" achievement requires you to play the whole story from the beginning to the end using weapons when you really need to. There are a lot of information on steam or elsewhere that explains when you need to use weapons or not. If you used one by mistake you can still kill yourself and try the current level but if you forgot to this playthrough will not count.			"

												First person games with good melee combat are sadly rare.  Too often it basically consists of flailing your arms with no force feedback until the enemy falls over (see Elder Scrolls).  Which is a a shame, because when these types of games do show up, they tend to be pretty awesome.As you can guess, Zeno Clash has good melee combat.  It's fairly simple, but it feels good.  You can dodge and block, punch and throw to your heart's content.  My only real complaint about the combat is that at times it feels a little barebones, especially because the game doesn't force you into most advanced techniques.  I rarely dodged or blocked in my playthrough (although I have yet to do the tower challenges).The melee segments are broken up by time with various other weapons, and a few boss battles.  I often found myself wishing I could go back to the melee combat (especially during the repetitive fights with heavy enemies), but even these segments were mildly enjoyable at worst and fun at best.The game also has a pretty good story.  It's simple and short, but it's supported by a wonderfully strange world, and it's fairly engaging.  It ends poorly though, with barely any sense of conclusion.  The game ends up feeling like a prologue for the sequel.All in all it's a very solid game.  Good melee combat, great world, fun variety of segments.  It's definitely not perfect: It's very short, and it's basically a series of scenes with fades between so it feels at times disjointed and restricting, but it's an enjoyable game, and worth playing if you like unique games or just want to beat up a bunch of weird creatures.

												TLDRPro's-Good story-Neat characters-Good combat mechanicsCon's-Real Short-No replay value-Older graphics (not really a con)Well for starters it holds up pretty well for a 2009 game. Graphics and audio settings are outdated. But it still looks pretty good. I beat the game in about 3 hours (without encountering any glitches) and then played some of the challenges.The game takes place in a really strange world filled with all sorts of creatures and characters and not a lot of backstory. The campaign flip-flops with a normal mission and then a flashback mission as you figure out things and the story is told.The gameplay is a solid mix of hand-to-hand combat with some ranged weapons and larger enemies/special fights. It got slightly boring and repetitive because you fight the same characters over and over throughout the campaign. BUT the story is interesting enough for me to enjoy the slightly repetitive fighting. After the campaign there isnt much replay value other than a few easter eggs and achievments. However there are  combat challenges that offer some extra content. I didn't finish all of them but someone that absolutely loves the game would.All around its a solid game, i'm not sure i'd pay more than $5 for it. A great outcome from such a small studio7/10			"

												absurdism is difficult. that which is otherworldly, that which is abstract understanding, can only stem from relations of relations of corrupted understandings. people gravitate toward things far removed from understanding. people talk and caw about games having disparate worlds, but zeno clash is true. zeno clash features a world so far removed from anything in fiction or in living. its an absolute triumph of visual direction. zeno clash is a textbook on the deranged. with all of my praise though, it does remind one distinctly of oddworld. however, zeno clash’s world is much more lively - less barren to say - and there are many humans. though there are many other creatures as well.whatever zeno clash ended up looking like, the base idea is something I would sell myself off for. I am incredibly glad this game exists. beat ‘em ups are eternal for me. what rings incredibly true for zeno clash is how traditional it is. you fight with two kinds of punches, light and heavy. a light punch can strike up to three times and can be comboed into a strong. strong punches are kind of like a wind up punch; space yourself away from your target and dash in with your fist. both are incredibly satisfying thanks to impeccable animation and hit detection. if an enemy becomes dazed, they can be thrown. and that’s basically it. the basic tendency calls back the roots of the beat ‘em up genre, a very comfortable thing for me, and a very different trace of influence for a modern game. especially considering the direction beat ‘em ups have taken with devil may cry, ninja gaiden, and god of war - although those are fantastic titles - it’s nice to see a game toning things back. except, I’d probably enjoy a hyper-complex combat system more, in all honesty.if zeno clashed revolved around limited arena battles punching the trash out of fugly foes, and in saying that it does anyway, then it’d be a fantastic game that anyone looking for new ideas in their vidcons should play. it wouldn’t raise any intellectual hell, but exist as something more primal than serious sam, with an even goofier atmosphere. the boxing arenas are still totally worth it. but what was a successful formula gets bogged down by forced variance. ace team wasn’t content with the gold they struck - or maybe the gold was struck from altering their original first person shooter formula? either way, there are guns in the game. shoehorned guns. guns that are not fun to shoot or use. if they were options to use in the battle royals then they would be tarnishing, but forgivable. they are not. the gunplay is forced numerous times. thankfully they are not long, yet the damage is still felt. it’s not like anything is broken with the guns - it’s just they’re incredibly mediocre compared to your fists. the endworld is an exception to that with interesting and fun ranged combat. though pacing of using a magic wand leaves some to be desired and the enemies you fight are nothing more than zombies, it’s still darkly enchanting.ranged weapons present one problem and melee weapons present another. melee weapons have a light swing and a heavy swing, much like your hands. once again, they function like they always have in the genre. they’re usually satisfying to use and offer a break from cracking skulls with your knuckles all day. the problem isn’t in the melee weapons, but when you’re given them. not too often can you use them against normal facepunchers. heavyweight enemies can only be damaged and toppled by heavy weapons and only the charge attack really does any damage. this leads to very mediocre and unsatisfying fights. there are no gambits allowed, no subcombos to pull off, no variety to speak of. you distance yourself, wind up attack, strafe, bash, retreat, repeat. and zeno clash will just throw these fatties at you as the game progresses. they’ll be one with small guys, one coming right after another, and at one point in the game two at a time. the two at a time encounter is pretty damn cool honestly. still, they are static and unfun encounters, and drag down what should be the pinnacle of the game.if zeno clash had a more organic presentation it would be legendary. if you traversed large and odd levels, fisting waves of enemies, it would have ascended. even if it had rather linear levels with stop and fight sequences, it still would have delivered a wholly amazing game. instead you’re more often that not pitted in smallish arenas to fight your rounds. there are more traditional fps orientated levels to be found, but in those you do not punch, which is all the more confusing. levels are relegated to being plot excerpts filled with gameplay, instead of having the plot compliment the gameplay. its pacing is haphazard and disappointing. it wants to have this grand adventure and yet its levels are arcade in nature. not like double dragon arcade, but dig-dug. they’re just rounds. that feeling is even more horribly accented in the second half when you repeat most of the places you already walked through on your return trip home, just with harder enemies.sheer repetition is zeno clash’s greatest flaw. guns are no different from eachother besides how many bullets sit in the chamber. melee weapons offer no variation aside from different looking skins. both guns and weapons have wonderful models, but that’s not the kind of variation I’m vying for. there are many different and awesome looking enemies. those many different awesome looking enemies will be fought two to even three times each. their names are the same, I guess they are the same people, but when you fight the same enemies in the same level as a few hours before it feels really freaking lazy. with the two bounty hunter confrontations, both very great despite relying on poor gunplay, it’s more than obvious that ace team really wanted variation in their game. so the design choices in the meat of their game sit in ugly defiance to their vision. a real frustrating execution overall.writing is stilted. purposefully, the characters need to assume their roles as midsavages. there is a mighty depth and conviction to the script. made up words and made up accents. though, the voice acting does not match the quality of writing, and is rather poor. the story itself, framed as a mystery, compliments the game’s piecemeal length. when it’s all said and done though the plot is a bit flat. it’s not really about what ghat did so much as ghat dealing with why he did it. with the characters being in a generally unrelatable state of mind, the implications aren’t so interesting to learn about. what’s great about the script is the weird things, the corwids, father-mother’s society, the endworld, golem’s crypticness. these things really draw you in. it succeds in vision and skill of writing even if it does not have the running time to tell a deep story.zeno clash is an addled burst of fraught strangeness smoothed with brand new gameplay. its short length makes it very easy to recommend, but it also is its greatest limiter with unrealized ideas all over the place. zeno clash is a small game and isn’t content with it. because of that, I’m not exactly content with it either.

												It is truly dificult to put this game into words. I will say this now: If you like strange games, this may be a big hit for you. The playstyle was rather interesting with a first-person fist fighting game mingles with shooting mechanics as well. It has a decent enough story, considering how short it is, but it could do a bit better. The art is really the best part of this game, it is extremely unique with a tribal-apocalypse thing going. Overall it is pretty fun to play as well, and is just short enough that right as it begins to feel repetitious, it ends. You could do a lot worse than Zeno Clash if you are aiming to kill a few hours on a weekend or something.			"

												TLDRPro's-Good story-Neat characters-Good combat mechanicsCon's-Real Short-No replay value-Older graphics (not really a con)Well for starters it holds up pretty well for a 2009 game. Graphics and audio settings are outdated. But it still looks pretty good. I beat the game in about 3 hours (without encountering any glitches) and then played some of the challenges.The game takes place in a really strange world filled with all sorts of creatures and characters and not a lot of backstory. The campaign flip-flops with a normal mission and then a flashback mission as you figure out things and the story is told.The gameplay is a solid mix of hand-to-hand combat with some ranged weapons and larger enemies/special fights. It got slightly boring and repetitive because you fight the same characters over and over throughout the campaign. BUT the story is interesting enough for me to enjoy the slightly repetitive fighting. After the campaign there isnt much replay value other than a few easter eggs and achievments. However there are  combat challenges that offer some extra content. I didn't finish all of them but someone that absolutely loves the game would.All around its a solid game, i'm not sure i'd pay more than $5 for it. A great outcome from such a small studio7/10			"

												What a strange game this is. Zeno Clash's dialogue, artstyle, characters and environments are all unique and work well together to tell a short, but interesting story. A lot of it doesnt make any sense in the beginning, but I think that just adds to the experience. Combat is a very strong aspect in Zeno Clash. It is a first person brawler with bits of shooting thrown in. The bulk of the combat will be punching and kicking the ♥♥♥♥ out of everybody. It can get to be challenging once more enemies get in it with you. Mastering the block and parry system can be difficult, but it will definitely be rewarding, since a sucessful bloack/parry combo can send an enemy flying across the screen. Theres nothing more satisfying than being able to do that. Also, you can kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of people while theyre on the ground. That feels good too.			"

												Gameplay:You can normal punch, strong punch, block and dodge. You can also do some advanced techniques like a super strong punch, a rushed elbow hit, and if you block then press your normal punch or strong punch button you can land a devastating quick kick. It's pretty simple. There are also weapons that have a small ""magazine"" (the best gun I found had 3 shots before I had to reload). You mostly walk in a straight line.  It is kind of dreamlike because even though it is linear many of the things from point A to B are cut out. For example in one part you are in the forest and then 5 minutes later (after a fight) you are in the coast. The gameplay is simple but fun.Story:Without giving too much away: Ghat murders Father-Mother (the name implies everything). He is on the run and his girlfriend (Deadra) tags along cause I don’t know. You get many flashbacks that tell more of the story and you try to piece it together. He refuses to tell his girlfriend Father-Mother's secret (why he killed it). This game is kind of weird. See a couple of the screenshots and you will see what I mean. The world looks twisted and colorful as do the characters. People are weird and some talk in riddles. You definitely will be laughing at some points in the game.Definitely get it. The story mode is short but you also get a challenge mode. I believe there is an SDK for this game but I haven’t come across any mods.			"

												Zeno Clash is a First Person ""Brawler"" by Chilean developer ACE Team. Made in the Source Engine, Zeno Clash is nothing but oozing in creativity. From the zany monster design to the intriguing weapons, the game creates an original setting the likes of which are not often seen amongst games these days. Although I mentioned weapons earlier, the meat of the games combat comes from the brawling segments. Through the usage of a stamina bar and several combos and counters, Zeno Clash attempts to be a first person fist-fighting game. In this it succeeds, though it will take some time to get used to the combat. It draws certain parallels to Dark Souls almost: both games have heavy and light attacks, blocking, and parrying. The games does so many things right such as introducing all fights with cool illustrations of the foes and breaking up the gameplay with various weapons, boss fights and changes of locale, that it doesn't fall hard to forgive it for its biggest flaw, namely voice acting. It being an Indie game and all it's not hard to understand why the voice acting might be less than stellar, but its a minor point that shouldn't impede anyone's enjoyment of the game. Zeno Clash is, among other things a first person brawler done right with one of the best fantasy settings in modern games.			"

												A first-person beat'em up game at it's finest! The world of Zeno Clash is very bizarre and weird which make exploring even more fun :D The main focus of the combat system are the melee fights.  It is pretty basic and not very complicated to master the melee system. You can punch, kick, throw, block, evade and deflect attacks. Combine those possibilities with the physics engine turns to be a LOT of fun!The weapons are very easy to use. Most of them have unlimited ammo but need to be reloaded properly. If you want to put your weapon away for a melee fight, you just need to ""lock on"" to an enemy.The levels are pretty small but it works for this title. The only thing I didn't like it so far would be the skybox. It was pretty empty most of the time. The story is quite nice and makes you want to buy the sequel... KAK!			"

												This is a first person melee brawler, which is quite a new take on the genre. The world is imaginatively designed and the music, while not particularly special is a nice mix of tribal music.Its a short and linear adventure at around 6 hours. Gameplay is a hit and miss. When the punches connect, they feel satisfying. However, it is frustrating when hit detection goes wonky. There is also a lock-on mechanic, while useful in theory, is a hassle when you need to get away from enemies. While there are also guns, they have too little ammo and load much too slowly to be effective in combat. The story is simple, but the way its presented is confusing and the characters aren't very memorable. The female sidekick you have doesn't help much at all in combat and would have been much better if she can be used as a co-op partner.Overall Rating: 6.5 / 10Not worth to buy full price, but worth a look if on sale. This is an unpolished gem and is a good first effort from this indie studio.			"

												I got this game in a bundle awhile back and just recently got around to playing it.This is a first person fighting game with a unique art style. Another reviewer referred to it as ""Stonepunk"", and I feel that is an appropriate description.The first part of the game was interesting with the blend of first person fighting and gunplay, but by the end of the game I was more than ready to be done with it. The story and characters are mediocre at best, and the game is quite short. The combat, which starts out relatively fun, degenerates into a repetitive slugfest with you constantly getting overwhelmed by more enemies than you can keep track of (including snipers) and it simply ends up being not fun by the end.On top of that, the combat controls were glitchy and didn't always register, and there's some major issues with enemies being invincible during most animations and your character getting stuck in a corner and taking a ton of damage. The icing on the cake is the baffling control decision to have the block/dodge key also throw your weapon, which makes fights with certain types of enemies far more difficult/annoying than they should be since the only way to harm them is with a melee weapon, but they almost always block your attacks if you're in front of them. You basically have to sprint in a circle around them (and they still hit you half the time from angles you wouldn't expect, and do a ton of damage) when you should be able to dodge and counterattack (they can do it to you, why can't you return the favor?).Overall, when this game works, it's a satisfying first person brawler, but when it doesn't it is one of the most frustrating and annoying games I've played in awhile. While not a completely terrible game, it has enough issues and little enough content (you fight against the same dozen or so characters over and over again in the course of the game) that I can't really recommend it unless you got it for next to nothing in a bundle like I did.

												This game isn't anything BUT good!The game story is intresting! It tells the start at the end!Good game desighn, could be betterAnd a bunch of weird stuff to make you questions!Now, let me talk about how this game is MUCH better then the second.The story has a twist, a very good ending,and story. The second is just a bunch of golems, which it says nothing about in the first game, and in the second game 10% of it you know why you need to say Father-Mother, heck i barley even know why you need to save Father-Mother. In the first game the controls are easy to learn and fast to comprehend. But in the second game it isn't the same, and it's like ""Prezeh yeayeh 2 preeayas aeh burrton"" bassicly the controls are MUCH worst and harder to get used to. And it just doesn't have the same... Feel, i don't know why but i'd perfer the old models then the new,the story doesn't ever surrond much about what happened in the past of the original zeno clash (this) and it's just heartbreakining to get a good game, then have a sequl which is bad. If there's a zeno clash 3, atleast make it better!I hope you liked me review, i know it's not good, and yes i understand zeno clash 2 is good. But i don't think it's the same.			"

												This is a very unique expierience that stands out from most games for various reasons that i will go into. i say that this game, atleast from me, gets a 9/10. why? let's find out.Visuals 10/10: this game's design is outlandish and surreal in almost every nook and cranny, but my oh my is it beautiful to look at. even though it does follow an invisible wall system, it feels as though you can just walk out and explore the world of zenoik. and that's just talking about it's scenery, it's characters are just as strange but fun to look at as their environment. from the corwids to the northern gate gang, there is a vibrant and bizarre variety of characters to see. and granted even though this game is considerably older than most next gen titles, it is very impressive for it's time.Gameplay 9/10: the concept of not relying on guns or swords but entirely on your fists sounds like anybody's childhood dream. and by god is it satisfying to punch somebody's face in in this game,and this right here is what makes this game so refreshing from the other titles. and it's great to feel that sense of impact when you hit someone or throw them into another fighter, through the majority of the game you'll have to rely on that. and even though there are weapons, they are all balanced to a degree in which you should only really use them if you absolutley have to. for example the club, it causes considerable damage to fighters but will break upon constant use. the cons about this though is the fact that i wish there were more combinations and ways to inflict damage than there already are. for example maybe adding in a right punch left punch system that would allow and demand for combo moves. but overall, it is a solid gameplay system.Story 7.5/10: this is where zeno clash starts to show some pretty bad flaws, it's story is fantastic and it's thought provoking. but it's really hard to follow sometimes and it cause alot of confusion with how fast things go by, especially the flashbacks, in which ghat explains why did what he did. but they seem to go by at the speed of sound sometimes expecting it's audience to keep up. however! it's voice acting and characterization is what saves it, you will remember who is who with their unique design and backgrounds and they will serve as reminders for later on if you happen to have forgotten what has happened. overall, it's an amazing storyline hindered by minor plotholes and really fast pacing.Concept 10/10: probably one of the most crisp and unique designs i've seen to date. for stonepunk is not a genre you hear all too often due to it not sounding all that appealing or fun. but it is indeed a sight to behold, and what i love most about it is it's independence in character design, you could add a rock man wearing bones around him and he'd fit in just fine. and it's design may turn others away for fearful reasons even, for some of the characters do look very bizarre and for some quite hideous or terrifying. but if your tired of seeing copy and paste soldiers or sexy chicks with no other purpose than being attractive. than this is a design worth looking into.Replayability 9/10: this is an absolute joy to play, whether your looking for overly fun gameplay or delicous eyecandy this is worth the price it has. for there are many possibilities for how you can go about fights in the second playthrough, for example you may have been beaten by jsaj over a million times due to you just starting the game but be able to be an equal or better fighter than he is on the second try due to knowing how to play better. as for the story, you can play it again and have a more clear understanding of things, but as for all story based games you will already know what will happen. so nothing will suprise you too much. Overall: this is a diamond in the rough for video game standards, with a concept so bold that it could've really sunk all the way down to rock bottom. but it succeeds in what it tries to accomplish, bare knuckle fightin'. it almost makes me wish that there were more first person punchers out there with how well this turned out. and even though it feels as though it sacrifices a good story for better gameplay, i don't think many will complain if they just want to have fun. but in all honesty, this is a must have in my opinion for those who want to see something new and done well on their plate.

												Zeno Clash is an interesting fighting game in a weird world full of odd creatures with questionable looks. Not to mention that they talk very badly. But still, you get to beat creatures up.The bosses of this game are interesting and the story isn't bad at all. The gameplay for ""common mobs"" might get a bit repetitive, but the change of scenery and all the ""story time"" places make up for it. If you're into fighting games (more like punching) then this game would deserve a peek.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												In Zeno Clash, you play as Ghat who is part of a 'family' by this strange creature known as Father-Mother. During the beginning of the game, things won't be very clear except that the supposed brothers and sisters that are a part of this family accuse you of killing Father-Mother. More is revealed as you progress in the game and you eventually find out the truth. Personally, I won't go into further details about the story to avoid spoilers.The gameplay is very unique in such a way that you don't often see this genre...This game plays in a first person perspective but your use of combat isn't through weapons (there is ranged weapons in the game, but you won't always be using them) instead, you use your fists to beat the ever living crap out of whoever stands in your way. You can lock on to your enemies and switch between which can be handy for quickly knowing when to defend or attack. At some areas of the game, your fists alone won't be reliable enough to hurt some enemies as some of them can vary from big enemies who charge at you and can knock you over resulting in some nasty damage or you have creatures that spit crap at you. So what do you do when it comes down to that? You use weapons! You can pick up some unique looking weapons that help from dual welded bone like pistols to a crossbow that fires skulls that explode upon impact with your enemies or you can have a bone sledgehammer that can deal massive damage to your enemies as you charge your swing.The level design is incredibly trippy but that's likely what the developers were going for as the world of Zeno Clash is incredibly unreal and is full of plenty of strange yet pretty scenary.Zeno Clash also has a unique tower mode which you unlock levels of as you progress through the main story. In the tower mode, you are inside a tower killing every enemy in the room to progress higher into the tower and you also also put against a time which shows how long you take. The timer isn't all too important as its just to put you against your friends to see who's faster at the level. As you progress, you'll meet all the different enemies you have met throughout the main game and in some rooms, you will have weapons that you can use or disarm from your enemies. But in the later levels there will also be room hazards that can be useful for killing your enemies in one fell swoop but be careful! As if you aren't, you can also be killed quickly.All in all, Zeno Clash is a incredibly fun game where you beat the crap out of people and I recommend checking it out if you're looking to punch in some faces! Plus, if you buy it and own Garry's Mod, you'll get all the models from the game!			"

												Zeno Clash is strange. There it is. I said it. You're totally surprised.Not only is it strange, but it's awkward. Honestly I couldn't tell if I was enjoying it until I completed it in one night. The concept is great. The melee combat is innovative and challenging. The story is so different that you'll spend most of the game being confused and wanting to know more. The story is one thing, but the scenery is astounding. It's like being shoved into someone's nightmare and battling disfigured humanoids and being afraid of the environment. I see 'Surreal' in the game tags now, which hits the nail on the head.Zeno clash is all over the place with the scenes that take place. I don't want to get into details - mostly since it's been a bit since I've played it and don't want to be 'that jackass', but the story is pretty much the entire game to me. I can't go around spouting out spoilers, right? ;b			"

												Zeno Clash is a very interesting First Person Brawler, in which you play as Ghat, one of the many children of the strange FatherMother, who, after killing FatherMother, is chased out of town by his own brothers and sisters. The game's story starts right after FatherMother's murder, but there's also flashback sequences when Ghat tells his friend Deadra about the events that lead to him killing FatherMother.Now, let's talk about the gameplay. As I mentioned above, it's a First Person Brawler, which means that for most of the game you'll be fighting with your fists. There's weapons, too, and areas in which you're required to use them, but for most of the game, it's a lot more satisfying to simply punch your way out. Progression is fairly linear, you'll go from point A to point B, fighting enemies in the middle, with some cutscenes here and there adding more story. Don't take that as a negative, though! It works fine enough for this game.The game also has a challenge mode, unlocked through story progression, with two distinct types: tower and pit. In the Tower challenge levels, you'll fight through five floors, each one filled with different enemies, and you must reach the top in the shortest amout of time possible, while losing very little health; even then, if you do lose some health in a floor, you'll gain some of it back for the next one. The Pit challenge levels have you going down a pit, trying to reach the bottom without killing yourself (if you drop from too high, you'll die), while some enemies try to fight you.I guess I should talk about the art style, which is quite unique; you'll find a world filled with bizarre environments and creatures; even some of the most ""normal"" characters, like Ghat or Deadra, have their bits of weirdness. And the soundtrack is excellent, I should say, with some really good tracks playing during the fight sequences. All of this adds to making Zeno Clash a really good game.Of course, not everything is positive; even though I enjoyed the game a lot, it seems to have some issues with hit detection: sometimes I would attack an enemy thinking that my fist would hit them, only to hit thin air, while in other cases, believing to be out of reach, some enemies have managed to hit me. Even then, this isn't noticeable for most of the game.So, to conclude, I can say I recommend Zeno Clash.			"

												One of my first purchases here on Steam. I believe it was back in 2009 if I remember correctly and it did have a very nice discount on it so it was immediately in my basket.Zeno Clash is an ambitious first person shooter game developed by ACE Team and released in 2009. The game uses the modified version of the Source Engine so it runs very well and while it is somewhat of an aged engine it still - in my opinion - looks good. Interestingly, rarely do you have the chance to use weapons with projectiles; emphasis is on melee combat and you do have the chance to use some clubs or other heavy weapons beside your fists. Combat is simple but very smooth - the game is very linear and as it is an independent game you can already guess it is quite short.Story-wise the game is rather silly - it puts you in the shoes of Ghat who is banished from his home after an attempt to kill Father-Mother. Yes, this creature is his father and mother as it seems the entire population of Ghat's settlement was raised by this hermaphroditic creature. Although banished, Ghat wishes to uncover the truth as to what really happened and what secret lies with the family.Anyways, combat is quite good and the game has a challenge option with levels of a tower to compete against a series of enemies. This is getting difficult gradually - a nice way to pass time once the story mode is finished.Zeno Clash is somewhat mediocre, but I believe the result of an original idea. If it is on sale this is a highly recommended game.			"

												This game has too many cool ideas and never fleshes them out enough to actually make an interesting story! Also, the plot twist is crap and so is the whole motivation behind the main character. The dialoag is all forced and the enitre game is just one bad mistake after another.What do it mean? Here's an example: This game allows you to shoot enemies with various weapons and then switch them out as you fight or stow them and your your fists. Sounds cool right? NOPE!!! The Lock Target button is mapped to the Swap Target button and the Pick Up New Weapon action. THE FREAKIN ""E"" key! So when your rushing up to a guy who just dropped his much better weapon, you instinctively press the E key to snap it up. ERRRRT Now youre locked onto the nearest enemy and youre now open for an attack CUZ YOUVE STILL GOT THE CRAPPY FISH PISTOLS.4/10 Save Your Money.			"

												I picked up Zeno Clash after having already played the second game with a friend, and I can tell you, the second one is better. This entry is pretty fun, but it lacks the quality of storytelling, free-roaming mechanics and of course, 2-player coop. However, it is significantly more straightforward (and thus, shorter), and the guns can be reloaded, though they have a habit of being knocked out of your hands. They do less damage then in the second game, and the hammers are much more awkward to use. Generally it's much easier to just punch things- except for the obnoxious heavy fights, which require you to use the hammers.Still, without having played this one (or had someone explain the premise), the second game really would not make a lot of sense, given the weirdness of not only the setting and asthetic but the morality and motivations of its characters. Collectively, the series is certainly the most unique thing to come out of the Source Engine, and worth playing. I would advise you play this entry before the second game, however.			"

												Unique is the name of the game here.It's an interesting experience but not very polished.The fighting system is a first person brawler, but uses fighting game mechanics so it's a really unique combat system that unfortunately doesn't work all that well. It's simple  to fight a small number of enemies once you get the hang of it, but late in the game you have to fight large numbers of enemies with varying abilities, and ranged attacks, making it incredibly difficult to keep track of everything and ramping up the difficulty.The story is unique as well, you play as an exiled prince sort of character, but beyond that, absolutely nothing makes sense. I'll use my Psych degree and says this whole thing carries a lot of Jungian and Freudian overtones as well.The voice acting, is god awful.If you're looking for a unique game experience, something you haven't seen before, this is it, if you're worried about the unpolished nature, better avoid.

												This game felt like it came so close to being awesome, but fell short. When the game started, I was thrilled by the battle mechanics, they felt so smooth and full of impact on the enemy. However, my opinion of it did a nosedive once the actual game started. The enemies have far too much health, and fighting becomes a chore. Every fight is the same. Block - punch - wait for them to get up - repeat 10 times. The game would have been much improved by making the enemy's health bar 25% what they are now, and giving me more variety in enemies.			"

												One of the more genuinely strange games I've ever played--made all the more strange by the fact that it doesn't seem to be cribbing from any familiar sources (at least that I am aware of) to construct its game world. You play a guy who is cast out of his tribe after murdering your hermaphroditic Father/Mother under mysterious circumstances. As the game progresses you piece together the events leading up to the murder all while evading your siblings who are out for vengeance.Oh yeah, and it's also a first person beat em up. Despite being such a potentially disastrous genre hybrid (FPS fighting games have rarely worked) the fighting mechanics and controls are actually implemented fairly well. Likewise, the art direction is top notch. Ultimately the central game mechanics are a bit limited, but the game is smart enough to be brief, ending just before you start to get bored with things. I probably prefer ""Rock of Ages"" (by the same team), but this is a worthy first game from them.			"

												Zeno clash a first person shooter game set in a crazy some what cave man style world full of mystery and oddity. Sit back and gaze a pone this beautiful word while trying to not die by suicidal squirrels with bombs strapped to them.Game Play: 8The game play over all is a typical shooter for the most part. You get guns that you aim and shoot while running around. However this game adds in a nice elemental of first person melee combat. While this game is mostly about shooting than melee, The melee does add a nice touch to it but it also has it's own problems. While trying to melee it tends to feel off and a little clunky. However if you can get the melee down it's pretty fun. Some of the weapons you have are duel Pistols, a rifle, a crossbow, skull grenades, and more. Each has an alt fire that can be used. Pretty much like most other shooters it's mainly point and shoot not much else.There isn't many bosses to fight in game. However this game has one of my most favorite boss fights of all time. You'll find yourself fighting a blind bounty hunter who sits on top of a dinosaur's head that is at least fifty feet above you. Who gives you a rift to make it far for you to fight him. He sits up there shooting down at you. While tossing down squirrels with bombs strapped to them to chase you around and blow up that you have to kick around and avoid. Yes... you did read that right... mother ♥♥♥♥ing squirrels with mother ♥♥♥♥ing bombs strapped to there mother ♥♥♥♥ing backs! How can you NOT like this boss fight! It is so odd but yet so much fun!Story: 7The story takes place in a fictional fantasy world called Zenozoik, and begins in a town called Halstedom. You play as ghat the protagonist of the game, You are running away from your home village after being hunted by everyone from there. You found out father-mother biggest darkest secret and now in fear of your life. With your girlfriend Deadra you both leave the village to trivial to the end of the world to find answers. The story has a great build up. It makes you want to know whats going to happen, why you are being hunted, and what is this BIG secret that ghat know. However when it's finally revealed what it is, you kinda feel disappointed. You have this great build up of a story to be let down at the end.Graphics: 9The graphics really sets the mood. Each level you go to has it's over style and feel to it. The last level you where just in doesn't look like the one your current in. Each level feels different and fresh while keeping to the primal cave man feel of the game. The graphics are all over the place from bright looking to dark. Some how it all works out nicely. You get a real sense of this world.To be honest, the world to me feels like Alice in wonderland but cave man style. You have such a massive world with crazy looking characters from humans, to animals, to each scene. The graphics really sets this game up nicely. I can not express how much I love the graphics for this game and just how it all comes together to make this world. It's a pretty unique experience. To me this what really makes game shine the most.Music: 8The music does a good job keeping pace with whats going on. It helps to make the world to come alive with the background ambiance. The music does a great job to set each level up and keep it feeling unique as much as possible.Final Though:Even though the game play is like a lot of other shooters with some added melee. This game just shines when it comes to presentation of the world. You will find your self lost in this crazy mystical world. Wanting to see more of what this world has to offer. I was so immersed in the world alone just because how it looked and felt and with all the crazy characters you end up meeting just really pulls it together to make it feel so unique. I compare this world of alice in wonder land, though not as amazing as alice but it has the great mystical feel to it that keep you wanting more.However like I said before it kinda of falls off the story with a great build up with a disappointing ending. However the ending is better than some other games out there. I find this game a good game to play for any one who like first person shooters. However this game IS weird and odd. If you can't get behind outlandish things you may find your self not liking this game.I sat down and beat this game in one sitting. Took me roughly 6 hours to beat it. So over all I would recommend this most to most people.Also...mother ♥♥♥♥ing Squirrels with mother ♥♥♥♥ing bombs strapped to there mother ♥♥♥♥ing backs!Final Score: 8for more reviews and other fun things check out my tumblr. www.rogue32807.tumblr.com "

For what the game sets out to do, you almost couldn’t do it any better.Every level in the game tries to do something unique, which made the experience very interesting.

												First person action/melee brawler in which you are one of the many children of Father-Mother and the only to know his dark secret. You must fight your brothers and sisters on your journey to confront Father-Mother. The story unfolds through cutscenes and flashbacks and is really eccentric. The areas and transitions feel quite disconnected initially, but near the end it starts coming together, things get interesting and the ending is satisfying.The combat isn't simple or intuitive and it'll take you a long time to learn advanced moves like dodging and countering attacks. Even the easiest difficulty will be frustrating if you don't master this system, so there is some skill involved. The game looks great with nice art, but the soundtrack is mediocre. It's short, lasting only a few hours if you don't try for achievements or challenge modes. There isn't a lot of depth here: no stats or inventory, it's 100% linear/combat and not much enemy or weapon variation, but still a good game.			"

												I think that Zeno Clash is worth playing, especially for the ridiculously low prices for which it can be purchased during sales.The combat is interesting and varied up until you are required to apply the same mêlée combat techniques to the majority of enemy types. There are more than 10 different fighting moves, without regard for any of the hand-held weapons, but with time you will find certain combinations to be most effective.During a one-on-one fight you can easily achieve a nice, powerful rhythm - however, when there are many enemies it can be difficult to single one out to focus your efforts.For less gung-ho players this may result in the tiresome process of wearing multiple enemies down one jab at a time. Drop a grenade amongst foes to speed things up.From this you may infer that too much of one thing can become dull, so luckily this tedium is broken up by special enemies that require more than fisticuffs.For example, heavy-set enemies can be overcome by using evasion or timed attacks to bring them to a state of vulnerability. Large, mentally-unstable enemies' weaknesses must be exploited to bring them down to your level so that you may cure their neurosis with, you guessed it, more punching.This does something to alleviate the familiarity of the dodge-punch-block-kick reptition of fighting, though these types of enemies are, too, used repeatedly.Sore knuckles and noses is not the only draw card for Zeno Clash, and if you aren't going to play for the combat then please play this game for the fantastic artistic design - for the music, visual art and script.I found the surreal landscapes and the outlandish flora and fauna to be both beautiful and unsettling. The ramshackle settlements and deformed, (often literally) animalistic citizens had me yearning to see what grotesqueries would arise next and I found this incredibly engaging for the duration of the game. The voices are many and varied, highly emotive and serve to easily differentiate the actors and how they feel towards the protagonist - as well as showing their individual strengths and weaknesses of character.If you appreciate well-executed gameplay and beautiful art direction then I believe that you will enjoy Zeno Clash as much as I did.If you have played it already then I urge you to buy it for a friend who has missed out.

												Unique is the name of the game here.It's an interesting experience but not very polished.The fighting system is a first person brawler, but uses fighting game mechanics so it's a really unique combat system that unfortunately doesn't work all that well. It's simple  to fight a small number of enemies once you get the hang of it, but late in the game you have to fight large numbers of enemies with varying abilities, and ranged attacks, making it incredibly difficult to keep track of everything and ramping up the difficulty.The story is unique as well, you play as an exiled prince sort of character, but beyond that, absolutely nothing makes sense. I'll use my Psych degree and says this whole thing carries a lot of Jungian and Freudian overtones as well.The voice acting, is god awful.If you're looking for a unique game experience, something you haven't seen before, this is it, if you're worried about the unpolished nature, better avoid.

												First person action/melee brawler in which you are one of the many children of Father-Mother and the only to know his dark secret. You must fight your brothers and sisters on your journey to confront Father-Mother. The story unfolds through cutscenes and flashbacks and is really eccentric. The areas and transitions feel quite disconnected initially, but near the end it starts coming together, things get interesting and the ending is satisfying.The combat isn't simple or intuitive and it'll take you a long time to learn advanced moves like dodging and countering attacks. Even the easiest difficulty will be frustrating if you don't master this system, so there is some skill involved. The game looks great with nice art, but the soundtrack is mediocre. It's short, lasting only a few hours if you don't try for achievements or challenge modes. There isn't a lot of depth here: no stats or inventory, it's 100% linear/combat and not much enemy or weapon variation, but still a good game.			"

												If Tim Burton and Doctor Seus made a collaberation to make a FPS beat em'up, the Zeno clash would probably be it. Its a decent game at worst, but its enviroment can make it very distrating, yet this is a fairly good game. The story is pretty good (though alittle hard to follow since its definetly not in our world) and most of the characters are interesting, but not my favorite game of all. While I certainly don't love it, I don't recommend it to gamers who like fps, fighting type game, or just want a unique journey. Just remember, don't judge a game by its cover.			"

												Obviously ZC served the maximum enjoyment i experienced in FPS shooters so far. It is a mixture of melee and gun fight, no question that the best part of the game is the unique hand to hand combat system, which is the most determinant part of the game. However, environmental components makes the game world a bit cartoonish,   and quite grotesque which may be turns the game hardly consumable for some people who do not like this kind of artistic style.Summa summarum, this is a crazy and strange world with aching heads, and toothless blood spitting people.Also stay tuned because ZC2 coming in 2013!

												Quick Summary: Zeno Clash is built on the Half Life 2 Source engine, so that should give you an idea what to expect in terms of graphics and hardware requirements. However in gameplay and art style the games are completely different. I gave Zeno Clash a try because my video card crapped out a while back and I wanted to try something less hardware intensive while I waited for a replacement. It was a fun game, but it’s definitely not for everyone.First off, note that the world of Zeno Clash is weird and alien while seeming like it could possibly be a post-apocalyptic Earth (it’s not). The “people” speak English but mix in strange words and phrases like it was an adaptation of a novel. Many citizens of this world are also a mix, of human and animal. Some of the people you’ll encounter are fully human while others look like bird men, elephant men, or just completely original beasts. The environment is sort of stone age with some odd guns/crossbows/magic thrown in (fish guns?). You play a human looking dude named Ghat who for some reason is being chased down by his former brothers and sisters. You and your one friend in the world are on a quest to bring justice to the children of Father/Mother (the main antagonist) even as these children fight you every step of the way.While I mentioned guns earlier, the game is mostly melee fighting, and you’ll need to get comfortable dodging and blocking blows from enemies, sometimes simultaneously from different sides.  The guns are mostly weak pea shooters but can be helpful if you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off from trading punches with a bunch of cheaters. Unlike kung-fu movies, these guys like to all attack at the same time. There is some variety in enemy types, but they’re mostly the same fighting style with character appearances. It’s the really big dudes that you need to watch out for.Pros:+Weird story that keeps you thinking. You’ll probably spend a bunch of the time trying to figure out what’s going on, and what happened leading to Ghat’s predicament.+The melee fighting system is fun, though challenging since you’re playing in First Person Shooter perspective and can only really concentrate on one guy at a time.Cons:-The graphics are rather dated, since the game is pretty old-There’s no “easy mode” for people who just want to experience the story. The game’s difficulty can be brutal for new players at certain point. The challenge levels seem more frustrating than they’re worth, especially when you’re forced to fight a whole group at once, and your “target lock” messes with your repositioning efforts.Overall, if you’ve run out of games to play or just want to try something weird, you can do a lot worse than Zeno Clash.

												While I wouldn't say that Zeno Clash was the worse game that I had ever played, I will, in no way, provide the illusion that it is anywhere within the realm of an acceptable game. Zeno Clash boasts a difficulty ramp that is unleveled and radical, in addition to a storyline that is mediocre on a good day. The gameplay, while could be improved, is admittedly quite nice, and has a nice ebb and flow to it. However, this does not mak up for it's other lacking mechanics. In addition to all of this, for the amount it costs, it is a frustratingly short game, and lengthing it would also improve the value immensely.			"

												Zeno Clash is a very interesting title. It takes place in a world that you aren't told much about, and it's a world filled with various types of humanoids, some human and some half animal. You play as Ghat, a man on the run alongside a friend and accused of murdering a creature called ""Father-Mother"". It sounds like an interesting story, and while the story itself and what actually takes place is good, the writing and the voice acting are not all that great and it detracts from what would otherwise be a decent tale. However, the graphics and gameplay both make up for these issue. The game is beautiful looking with a unique looking world with beautiful skies and landscapes, and you'll never see the same thing twice so you're never bored with what you see. This is good, as the game is played entirely from a first person perspective.The game is best described as a beat em up, as you progress, face hordes of enemies, and progress to the next segment. You don't learn new moves or upgrades as you go, but that is fine as you do well with what the game gives you. It's solid with blocks, dodges, punches, kicks, and throws along with hand to hand weaponry and guns. It's hard to be bored as you progress the game's campaign. There are four levels of difficulty, with my playthrough happening on Hard but there is also Easy, Normal, and Extreme. Hard mode presented a great challenge and it took about eight hours to get through it. Once you're done, there is a set of challenges to go through with a fixed difficulty to try your hand at.It's a beautiful, brutal, knock you down your ♥♥♥ recommendation. Give it a shot.			"

												TL;DR – The most this caveman brawler gives you in terms of plot and setting exposition is a moderately-short blurb on the game’s store page. Also, one of the enemy models closely resembles a *ToTaLLy MEtAl* version of the Swedish Chef from “The Muppet Show”. Recommend. Onto the review:It’s actually to Zeno Clash’s benefit that it doesn’t really explain itself outside of the basic gameplay mechanics, which are simplistic but nevertheless require a bit of finesse if you’re playing on any of the higher difficulties. To elaborate, combat is your typical mouse-bound primary-light-attack, secondary-heavy-attack affair, utilizing the spacebar for blocking and evading. Uncoordinated lout that I am, this was interpreted as “spam the secondary/primary and run around like a chicken sans head”. This ""style"" of gameplay actually worked for me, thanks to the normal-level difficulty setting I was playing on, in addition to smartly-placed health items in each area. Unfortunately, this is also the likely cause of the game’s growing tediousness later on, as, outside of a few close calls and even some deaths, I was just smashing through opponents in area after area. To offset this, there is some variety in the stages; for example, a brawling sequence being followed by a shooting gallery level, or some other contrivance (like using a magic torch to light up pyres and moving statues alike). And the guns, oh the guns. Indeed, the weapons in Zeno Clash most succinctly sum up the game’s overall art aesthetic; the closest comparison in décor is that of “The Flintstones”, with its brightly-colored yet naturalistic designs. Hell, there’s even dinosaurs (or at least large reptiles resembling them) in a level or two. The guns themselves specifically piqued my interest, as the idea of a primeval-era slugthrower is just surreally fantastic. For example, the pistols, which basically appear to be carved shells with a bunch of nails and rocks stuffed into them, are just fun to look at and use in all of their pea-shootery goodness (which may also explain why I keep running into the same named characters again after I so thoroughly obliterate their asses). Besides the art design, this sense of backwards absurdity is ingrained in the plot and characters; outside of the aftermentioned blurb, the game leaves it up to the progression of the narrative itself to explain what the hell is going on, eking out small bits of info through dialogue and actions. It's a refreshing break from grandiose blocks of text that describe a game's lore in exacting detail, but I fear the world of Zeno Clash might still be too alien to experience without detailed explanation for some players. At the same time however, it's that same feeling of unknowingness that may spur other players (myself included) to push on and immerse themselves in the absolute weirdness that is this game.  Final words: Zeno Clash is so aesthetically ""out there"" that it may dissuade players from digging into it, but the fairly-conventional combat system, in addition to a relatable (if somewhat vague) storyline, signifies that this 5ish-hour-long brawler is still worth playing for a couple of bucks.

												One of the most intriguing and innovative games I've played in a long time.The plot is good, and both the pacing and encounters are well done.I played it with a 360 controller (should be able to find a thread detailing how to enable it by searching a bit) and it made it a lot more enjoyable.This is a colourful and creative game which you wont forget easily, unless you're one of the braindead types who seem to dislike this game. 8/10			"

												Zeno Clash is just what an indie game should be: it is different from everything you are used to. The setting is a unique and delightfully bizarre punk fantasy world, and the characters are.. well they're all just as bizarre as the setting. The first-person brawler gameplay is excellent, sophisticated and challenging. Get this game, okay? Get this game, and every game ACE Team makes in days to come.			"

 My Experience Playing this game on my own was impossible to do in one sitting. I desperately gasped after something real to look at after 20, or so minutes, because it felt suffocating. In order to complete the game I had to hold my breath as I progressed. After I ran out of air, I'd have to escape and take a real breather. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. Graphics The graphics look really good and it utilizes the Source Enging to it's fullest potential to deliver something unseen before. It does this at the same time as it provides solid performance. Gameplay You get to approach this game with both melee and different weapons. Each one feels distinctly unique and fun to use. The guns are not restricted to only shooting, since they can be thrown, providing a useful stun if you've run out of ammo. Ammunition is pretty rare to come by, so you'll see yourself using anything to win a fight.The melee combat is where this game shines, though. It's one of the first that defined a proper melee combat system in first person. It's complex, fun and rewarding as you learn to use it. You dodge, block, kick and punch your way through enemies. Story This game would be nothing without it's story. It's a part of what makes it so hallucinating. If you feel like it's normal, then you're not. Summarization An absolutely great game which I definitely can't reccomend enough. The price is ludicrous at 9,99€ for this masterpiece. At sales it goes down by 90% to 0,99€. You have literally nothing to lose but your sanity, if you isolate yourself with this game. Don't isolate yourself with this game. Remeber that This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real., or society will probably have to euthanize you for your own good.  Score Survives the test of time  7.8 "

												People need to understand that ""weird""story doesnt make it good (this is terrible in my opinion), I found the story very lacking ,my character motivations are absent,the game feel clumsy , the voice acting is terrible and so is the gameplay. This is just a first person meele brawler with boring and repetitive gameplay that tries to compensate all his shortcoming with a strange story which is boring,unprovoking,poorly delivered,but because most people wont recognize a good plot,they think strange=good. I buy this at 90% discount (1 dolar) And I feel I wasted my money.			"

												I don't want to write a terribly long review of this game, because frankly I don't think it's deserving of one.  I started off rather curious and open-minded and felt that I was initially rewarded by a quirky but fun game.  The storyline had me intrigued, and as I continued to suspend disbelief and ignore a handful of ""game logic"" moments and repetitive fighting, I had hope that things would get better soon.  I was terribly mistaken.  After about 4 hours of gameplay, it feels like the dev team ran out of ideas and money.  Characters you've already fought are thrown back at you time and time again, and the story completely falls apart.  The ending is without a doubt the worst ending I've ever encountered in a video game.  The game rewards you for believing in it's surreal world by kicking you straight in the nuts as you realize all of your confusion was entirely justified.Unless you love the beat em up style and are prepared to fight the same characters using the same moves over and over and over again, AND can ignore massive plot holes, bad voice acting, and an unbelievably stupid story do NOT buy this game.  Not even on sale.  I chose to play this game on stream, and it was just frustrating, stupid, and the ending was unbelievably unsatisfying for everyone who watched.♥♥♥♥ing Rubik's Cube "

But, I finally got around to playing it, and I have to say it's something else.  While I have played games that attempted the first-person brawler before, that really isn't what really sets it apart.  What really makes this game original is it's setting, story, and character design.  It's surprisingly refreshing and different than anything i've seen, not only in a game, but in any medium.			"

												Oh, beautiful Zeno Clash..Zeno Clash is probably the only First Person Brawler in existance, and it does it oh so well. Instead of holding a gun, you have fists, and those fists hammer into enemies' faces ruthlessly. There are grabs, palm strikes, kicks, parries.. finishing moves.. Oh, and also guns, though you rarely get the chance to use them. The game has quite a high learning curve, but as soon as you get it down, I've found that it is one of the more enjoyable combat systems I have had the pleasure of playing with.The world of Zeno Clash is also vibrant and full of unique characters. The one who struck me the most were the Corwid of the Free, who are all obviously clinically insane in their single-mindedness. They do things because they do them. Examples being that one only wanted to walk in a straight line, another only wanted to eat people because that's what he did, and another wanted to be invisible, so he removed the eyes over everything that could see him, including his own. The art department really outdid itself on character design, and there isn't a single character in the game that could be classified as 'bland'The game also features an arena mode, which is probably best played after a first playthrough to get the basics down. All in all, this game was worth every cent. Get it if you want something new (and disturbing)!			"

												Zeno Clash is an first person fighting game, the locations and the culture of Zenozoik is the best part. The story is one of the things that ruins the game and something about some characters aren't explained very well (In the 2ND it is explained), but the fighting mechanics keeps you playing the game. After you complete the story, you can do these tower challenges with differents floors, enemies and weapons. Story is long 8 hours. If you like Zeno Clash 1, go get the 2nd too (It has Story Co-oP with 2 players!)			"

												Nothing is sense and everything is ♥♥♥♥. Great environments, good enough graphics, good combat system with responsiveness and a no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t feel. Normal or ""Hard"" mode is not very hard at all. Brawlers IMO are hard to balance but these devs did an ok job of it. Difficulty is badly done with + or - enemy damage. The AI is ok but nothing special. I found myself playing through looking forward to the next piece of scenery or story. The story is not good, but it is gripping as you just want to make sense of it all. I usually don't care much for the gameplay style of brawlers but I cannot say I disliked Zeno Clash at any point. The combat had adequate depth but my number one reason for playing through the game was for that fantastic art direction. It statisfied me.If the price is low, you want an acid trip gangbang, and like brawlers you could pick this up without regret.			"

												My experience with Zeno Clash was really strange. When I started, almost from very beggining I was put in fight, after two or three fights I closed game. I was wondering, when I will play it again. Combat system in Zeno Clash isn't bad - it's fine but also very annoying. I can't count how many times I got attacked from behind, but that's not what was annoying, the thing that comes after - not sure if it's bug, or if it should work that way, but almost everytime my character was performing once again last action. If fighting, in this kind of game, doesn't bring much pleasure then what is point of playing? This is easy question - THE WORLD AND CHARACTERS LIVING IN IT. This is most interesting part of game. I love every place and character this game have. With every next hour I wanted to know more. I would really love to see Zeno Clash as adventure game. I know I would have much more fun exploring new places, talking around and such than fighting. Well, that's just my opinion. If you love exploring bizzare worlds - Zeno Clash is good for that. Still, there is plenty of fighting, which can be hit or miss in case of Zeno Clash. In my case, it was sadly a miss.			"

												PROS:  Artwork of the level designs is SURREAL and otherworldly (no wonder it was nominated for an award); good ability to fight with hands and feet as well as use of crossbow slingshots, ""pea shooters"" and melee; voice acting is generally good;  music generally good (although I turned it WAY down for most of the game).CONS:  Poorly-written story makes no sense; tries to be some kind of Aesop's Fable, only without the fable (i.e. no moral being taught);  somewhat repetitive fighting, as the same enemies you just KO'ed over a half a dozen times or more already keep showing up again and again throughout the game (gets tiresome).This Source-Engine-driven game's fantastic environment makes up for its weak, nonsensical story.  It had the potential to be something a LOT greater than it turned out to be.  Without disclosing any major spoilers, let me just say that once you get to the ending, you'll realize that the whole game takes place in some sort of endless time-loop, with Ghat (the protagonist) being the victim of a false accusation...  You'll also come to realize that the creature called Father-Mother is being ""outed"" (which is the game's sole redeeming aspect)... And if all that brawling was still not enough for you, there are post-game Tower levels (multi-level arenas) where you can duke it out to your heart's content.  Personally, after two playthroughs, I had had enough already...  Overall, it's a ""refreshingly-unique"" kind of game, and a recommended play.  Check it out. ---Additional note:  For all you other ""discerning"" gents out there who prefer to see beautiful women in games dressed a little more ""interestingly"", there is a mod available for Daedra that accomplishes just that quite nicely.  Without giving the links, do a search for ""Zeno Clash - Deadra Mod"" (found  on Fileplanet dot com), then run it with the free Texmod app (dmcmods dot com).  Works well.   (Disclaimer:  I have no affiliation with either Fileplanet or DMCmods).Enjoy.  ;-)			"

												Well, I did play the entire game all the way though once on the middle diffuculty (describe as hard, mobs do normal damage).  Only took me 3 hours to beat.  I like that that it was short.  I have grown up enough that I don't have time to play games so being able to sit down and play one all the way through in one saturday is nice.  The story was, well it kept me hooked, but I wouldnt say it was good.  The world you are thrown in is pretty intriguing and interesting.  While the graphics are subpar (like most indy games) I was still able to be fully immensed in this place that resembled to me like a nuclear fallout (although it was never described as such).  The creativity that went into the world was the main thing that held my attention for the entire game.That being said, the gameplay was nothing to ride home about.  It had one of the better takes on hand to hand combat than any game I have played, but to be fair I have never played a game with hand to hand combat that I enjoyed.  I found myself always grabing a gun every chance I could and the guns were... well... how to describe it.  Appearently in this world guns are hard to find, so they are instead made out of very random things and very creatively done at that.  I found them to feel somewhat lacking though.  The game was entirely focused on hand to hand combat except one instance where you had to basically ""target practice"" as the acheivement suggest (definitely my favorite part of the game), while another instance was focused on flinging fire from your torch.  All in all, the story was pretty lame and gameplay nothing to brag home about, so I would probably not tell my friends to go out and buy it.  It was a nice free addition that came bundled with something i wanted.			"

												It's a weird game, that's for sure. But the combat (in first person) feels SOOOO good. I like how the punches feel, there's a certain weight to them. Add to that the fabulous (but weird) graphics and you have one heck of a game. Unfortunately, it's short (about 4 hours). But that's about the only negative thing I can say about it. It's so unique that I suggest you get this while you have the chance. Can't wait for the sequel (will it ever come ?).[Rating: 89/100]			"

												I have a love-hate relationship with this game. The story was pretty mediocre, but they constantly pull you along with the promise of this huge secret right around every corner. So I was constantly driven to play to figure it out, thinking I was getting closer and closer. Near the end you can figure it out and it’s honestly quite a letdown. The world is interesting and unique, but none of the characters are fleshed out enough for you to really care for them. I have to imagine they had an amazing world in-mind, but were limited in how they could present it. Still there’s plenty of mystery and yearning to find out more.The gameplay is fluid and has some fun melee components. It's unique in how the game almost plays out like an arena/fighter and FPS game. I had some issues with the controls, like accidently throwing my gun around into unobtainable places, but all in all the combat remained challenging (but not frustratingly so) and never dull. Regardless of the game's flaws, I can't deny how enthralled I was in the game within the short time it took me to beat it. I would recommend this game to any fans of parachuting squirrels, punching people in the face and mystery.			"

												Twice I have tried desperately to play this game under the constant peer pressure of ""It's so quirky but a fun beat 'em up! PLAY IT! PLAY IT YOU ♥♥♥♥!"". Now I concede: I really hate this game and never want to play it again.Yes the design and aesthetics are quirky as all hell, as are the story and dialogue. I actually love that about Zeno Clash; it's like a weird off-cut of early 2000's forays into 3D alien architecture that takes cues from someone who spent too much time flipping through microbiology books.On the surface the controls aren't difficult and combat seems manageable, if a little grating at times. I hate blocking mechanics even moreso when your dodge or evasion system is tied to it with movement. Using weapons is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because you can't dodge with a weapon and if you're not quite in range you start kicking insead of swinging your weapon. Also it won't let me use a controller which is god damn insane. The only thing I like about the combat is how visceral and meaty it can feel at times, when it isn't completely disorienting and aggravating.But perhaps all these problems are solely on me, and my desire for a dodge roll button or a lock-on system with a smoother option to switch between targets is an admission of weakness? I really wanted to like Zeno Clash but god help me the combat is really awful and controls like ♥♥♥♥. Maybe the sequel magically fixes everything? I don't know and I don't care to find out.Try to get it on sale or in a bundle, but if you don't like it you shouldn't feel bad.			"

												Surreal, bizarre, dreamlike, fantasy... it's hard to find words that describe this game (those are just all synonyms). But if you are looking for a game described as so, Zeno Clash is the game to play.So instead of spending too much time trying to meditate and enter your own dream world, you can play Zeno Clash.Also most people would say the second game is better, but I think this one is just great. You'll probably want to play this one first to understand the story.			"

												Here's a game you should definitely try! It's both great and well... incredibly average, but it's satisfying from start to finish.This is a short game, you can easily complete it in about 3 hours. It's a kinda sloppy melee first-person brawler.  Its combat system isn't bad, but it gets clunky at times, specially in group fights. However, punching enemies into a 5 meter flight makes you feel like a badass. And the ragdoll physics on the corpses are a nice touch as well. I haven't played Zeno Clash 2 yet, but I will soon enough, and I assume the combat system has been polished since 2009, although I've heard it focus too much on team fights, which is where the clumsiness comes in... But I digress. The game shines in its world and characters, which are all really weird, but at the same time, charming. They present neat ideas that feel like they should have been much more explored and fleshed out, but everything seems experimental here, hence its length.For example: ""The Corwids are not slaves of reality, so they can be insane. Oxameter walks in a straight line without letting letting anything change his path... and that's what Oxameter does."" There are other Corwids with interesting... ""features"", so I'd definitely recommend picking this up if you're interested in them alone.Now, another problem I have, in regards to the exploration of the world, is that, since the game goes from one arena to the others, you barely have any time to explore the areas and take the time to appreciate the world they've created. While you're in combat, you'll be busy to look around, and the scenes end as soon and you beat everyone up. This still leaves you with an idea of what it is, but too vague for my liking. Again, I hope Zeno Clash II solves this ""issue"".Voice acting is pretty bad, but it's bearable, and didn't ruin the overall experience for me. The cutscenes follow the same route, with some cheesy animations, but again, that wasn't my reason to be playing the game, so it didn't really make much of a difference.So, for the conclusion. If you're interesting in world, creature and character design, this is definitely a must-buy. They've done a great job there, I thoroughly enjoyed it!  If you're coming for the combat system, or a grand scale story... well, you'll not find it here, not quite. Still, I'd encourage you to pick it up on a sale, since it's a very interesting game to play.Well, I'm off to play Zeno Clash II now, I'm definitely interested in what comes next. Cheers!			"

												Sort of hate it.It's a cool concept, but in a game with an incredibly crappy story, it really needs solid mechanics to be pulled off.It's buggy and annoying, the combat is repetitive, and frankly it's too difficult.It's also childish that the game starts on ""hard"" where the enemies do normal damage, but allows you to turn it down to ""normal"" so they do less. Note that turning down the difficulty doesn't really help. The enemies are still pretty annoying.It would be fine if the enemies were smarter and fought you in a 1v1, but it's either 3 annoying enemies with guns shooting you (seriously, the guns can be fun when you have them, but when an enemy has them it's absolute bull. A full clip of the dual pistols in the hands of an enemy will take about a third of your health. They practically never miss.) Any time you DO fight 1v1 it's versus a heavy enemy who you can ONLY fight with a buggy ""heavy weapon"" with a ridiculous hitbox and huge input lag, to which if you are ever infront of the enemy it will always block it and counterattack.That said, even in the 1v1s the game will randomly decide to throw some random trash mob at you midway through the fight just because trying to deal with their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics isn't enough, you now have to use an incredibly slow weapon to kill an immediately respawning fast-attack enemy, in order to get a few attacks on the enemy who likes to sit there and do nothing but block your attacks in order to progress through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story.Maybe Zeno Clash 2 would be better JUST because of the multiplayer (I believe it's coop) so that you can have a fair fight for once.Sorry for the rant, this game ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, how was this released in 2009.

												This game was in my library for a very long time so I decided to give it a try. Now this game was by far the most strangest, out-there game, I have ever laid eyes on. The creatures are disturbing and crazy. The story was a bit confusing and bland, so its safe to say they really banked on the mind-numbing ""acid-trippy"" backdrop to sell the game. Visually the game wasn't bad per say, but it was developed on the Source engine, so obviously, it had a good platform to start from. I would like to say I was on the fence for this game, but I really wasn't. While playing I felt a longing for the end of the game. Once it was over, it left a empty...""What the f*** did I just play"" feeling. I can't say I'd recommend this game to anyone, but I have to give it some points to originality.			"

												There's a good game buried somewhere in here. The mechanics are great and the combat seems like what Dead Island was trying to achieve. Sadly the art director from this project was given nothing but a box of crayons and apparently M. Knight Shyamalan was hired to write what this game laughably calls a story. This is the single most unpleasant game to look at I've ever played. The scaling is awful and every character has hit the lowest point of the uncanny valley. Nearly everything is this game is unsettling to look at which would be great for a horror game but definitely not here. Zeno Clash proudly wears its pretentious art house mask, but unlike Braid, doesn't have the engaging story or gorgeous visuals to back it up.			"

												Not really sure what I expected with this game. It's clever and 100% original, I'll give it that. Also, you'll probably never see or play another game like it, that's for sure (except for Zeno Clash 2). But it's not really fun. I mean, the first hour is interesting because it's a new game and you're probably wondering why the game is so bizarre but I said it was clever because what sucks you in is the story and the strange events that take place within this game. Not much else. The fighting mechanic is interesting, but it's more of a gimmick than anything else. Take away all the zanny stuff in this game and you're left with a very VERY poor FPS-brawler. Still, very much recommended! Perhaps Zeno Clash 2 is an improvement?			"

												Did not expect this. This game was pretty great. LOVE the combat and i have a bad pc but it played wonderfully.The story was pretty good. I love the concept for the enemies, i won't give away anything but i havnt enjoyed fighting such deranged enemies in a long time. One last thing, that artwork was awesome i specially love the skyboxes.8/10 for me the only problem was the voice acting was a little weak other than that i recomend it.			"

												I uh... I don't know. I had my ""fun"" with the game, did a quick power through of the main story and I feel like it's only half of a game, which is understandable considering there is another Zeno Clash. Like I said, though, it feels not really like a full game. There are the challenges, and those are, well those are challenges, but the ""story"" that is being sold to me isn't really there. Was a weird, fun, etc, kinda game but only half of a game.Can't recommend unless you get it for the cheap or if you somehow manage to get both Zeno Clash I and II at the same time. I doubt the second one will take you much longer than this one.			"

But seriously, the visuals may be dated, but in my opinion the creativity in the designs and the absolute insanity of it all make it worth playing. Also its cheap these days, and goes on sale often. I can't wait to finish this knowing that there is a second game that also has mostly positive reviews. The game feels like a weird trip with visuals that remind me of the far cry 3 and 4 drug trip worlds only its the whole gameworld in this.

												What most games get wrong, this game gets incredibly right. Zeno Clash mixes FPS elements and a heavy combat system to make you feel like the ultimate tribal kung fu badass. The story can seem a bit off at first and the universe takes quite a long time to get fully immersed into. I can understand why the odd creatures and mishapen worlds can seriously throw people off but if you give this game a chance you will not regret it. Besides questionable voice acting and a somewhat short length, Zeno Clash provides enough story, group combat scenes, and boss battles for any fan of both the FPS and Beat-Em-Up genre to feel completely satisfied. Some might be thrown off by the repetitive fighting style that can get a bit old later on in the game but the mixture of shooting peculiar weapons and mutant-like enemies can have you forgetting about any kind of repetition. For anyone that enjoys tribal stories or fantasy adventures, this will truly satisfy all nerdy needs. Zeno Clash gets a Father-Mother assassinating 9/10 from me.			"

												Zeno Clash is a short, but sweet game that does first-person melee combat better than any other game I've played. The punches, dodges, and kicks all feel like they have real weight and every hit just feels right. Once you've beaten the main campaign, there are some great challenge maps to play, making for good replay value. The campaign is very short (4 hours), but I found it has no filler and every moment is pure gold. Story-wise, Zeno clash is very creative and fun, with lots of interesting characters and twists to it. The visual style is unlike anything I've seen, and is very cool. Overall, you can't go wrong with this game.			"

												Good graphics, since it's the Source engine, and good story. Gameplay is decent but can be frustrating at times. You can also use multiple weapons ( double crossbow FTW )and their design are pretty unique but you'll lose them after each loading screen. The biggest problem is its length: 190 minutes from 1st ( and only ) launch to credits, but that without counting the challenges I haven't tried yet.			"

												This game is cleverly designed. I was surprised to find that the first person fist fighting style of the game was executed so well that rather than being put off by the fists flying in front of my face, I ended up becoming absorbed in each fight, physically moving in my chair to dodge left and right. Besides clever game design, the art style is remarkably unique. Characters, landscapes and monsters all look very strange, but always familiar. The story was also unexpectedly good. The protagonist presents the player with an intriguing new perspective. I've never seen similar in any other game. I don't understand why this game isn't more well known.

												Easily one of the most original experiences I've ever seen in a PC game. Making a beat-em-up in a first-person situation was about as clunky as you could imagine, but it came out much better than you'd think. Still, it felt unfair and needlessly frustrating at times. It has a very 80s feel with the design looking like it came out of The Labyrinth and Dark Crystal with the tone of Mad Max and Water World. Zeno Clash is beautifully rendered too with the scenery and chaacter models ooking like they could actually have been made out of clay. The combat, which is the core gameplay, was solid and satisfying despite it's short comings. Never thought I could use the mouse and it feel like I'm really punching somebody! The voice acting is very flat and the story is very shallow, but the story didn't need to be very deep and the awkward voice acting added to the surreal and abstract feel of the whole thing. The music fit the atmosphere and the mood perfectly, similar to Abe's Odysee. I felt like that's probably the sounds you would hear in that universe.

												I would recommend this except it did have some faults to it. Some of the enemies could be quite easy if you figured out a tactic. Some of the fights were ridiculously hard like the last one you could be killed in practically one hit. I would say I would give this game a 7.5/10 mainly because of those two cons. The storyline was amazing and very surprising at the end,the graphics are surprisingly great and the controls were rather smooth but like I said some of the fights the way they were easy or hard took away from the greatness that this could have been.

												This game has some of the most satisfying melee combat I've ever played. I might even say it's the best. If not the deepest, at least it was incredibly fun to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of strange humanoid animal things in an environment reminiscent of surrealist painting.The story is fairly interesting and serves as an oddly disjointed but ultimately satisfactory vehicle for the gameplay. Zeno Clash pretty much plays like a classic beat-em-up, with wave-based combat, but in first person with minor shooting elements. If that at all sounds appealing, I highly recommend this game.			"

												A real diamond in the rough. A short but entertaining experience, with an extraordinarily unique setting and art style. Well worth your time. Some fun gameplay, and great visuals, considering that it had a such a tiny budget.			"

												Fantastic game with a catchy soundtrack and surreal, weird, yet very engaging universe. The whole game is divided in around 20 little scenes, takes you about five hours. It's just the right length. The combat system is nicely done. There are only two big flaws with this game: it's a bit unoptimized (that's caused by the engine), and the voice acting falls short for the worst possible character: your sidekick.Overall, it's one of the best indie games of 2009 and you should definitely play it.

												Zeno Clash... Ah Zeno clash... The game is about you (the person who you control) killing you're mother. So you along with a friend try to escape you're siblings, who are angry at you for killing Farther-Mother. You hope for better things  along the way but you soon realise you carn't escape you're siblings. Soon, you find yourself freeing a man-type-creature who has been capture for years. He then helps you get home. Along the way you are hunted down bye the Hunter who the Family paid to kill you. And again, you're siblings. you then return home and fight one on one with Farther-Mother. Thus at the end a big secret is revealed rolling into the second game of the series. I have enjoyed Zeno Clash, but, howether it is not perfect, with buggy fighting controls etc. it is sometimes difficult to fight in Zeno clash, and the short campain but, if you can get past that then it's actually pretty fun.I am ready to play the second one!I'll give the game a 8/10I hope you find this review helpful.

												Great story that explores the human condition--that is, the need for both security and freedom, the mutual exclusivity of either of these things in extreme, and the role of civilization in attempting to find a compromise between the two.  The bizarre, outlandish visual style is also very appealing and original.			"

												I have no idea what I just played but it was definately one of the more interesting games I have ever picked up. First person, hand-to-hand combat mixed with a world that will confuse and terrify the living ♥♥♥♥ out of you.And yet, I can't help but to recommend it for those curious types.			"

												An amazing, original fps brawler with a hint of shooting, Zeno Clash may of made me rage a few times (alot) but is worth it with the storyline that unfolds the more you play. With models you will never see before and the twist you will never forget, I give this game a 9/10.			"

												A great source-engine first person brawler game with satisfying and easy to use combat in a world that can be only described with Punk Fantasy at the least. Also has a great story with underlying metaphors which I don't care about, because you can falcon punch ♥♥♥♥ off of cliffs.			"

												First-Person-Wonkyness.This has got to be one of the weirdest games I've played in all my life. It ensembles a  not-so-vast but very quirky cast of characters along with somewhat faulty first person melee combat.The graphics aren't anything to write home about as it shares the source engine, but it's good for the artistic sense the developer was aiming for.Get it if it's on a discount and you'd like to try something.. Different.P.S. Story's interesting, but quite honestly its not jarring.			"

												This game is just unique.Graphics are quite beautiful and the melee combat is something I had never seen before, its what any game that includes hand to hand combat should be like, but where this game really shines is in the world it presents... it is just amazing, you can't stop looking around trying to understand how this bizarre world works, there's so much depth in it you just want to know more about it. The story is not bad all although it could probably be better.Zeno Clash is not very long, you could perfectly finish it in one sitting and I REALLY recommend you do.			"
