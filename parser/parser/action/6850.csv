												So, I owned this game back on CD until that one broke, and when it appeared on Steam, it didn't take me long to make the decision to re-acquire it.This game is one of the classics and my personal favorite of the series (maybe, mabye tied with Blood Money). Don't expect HD graphics as the game is fairly old, but they still hold up and the gameplay makes well up for it.The game mostly gives you free reign over how you deal with your missions, wether you go in guns blazing or infiltrate the building disguised as the milkman, take out your target and leave without anyone ever knowing better; the only consequence being a distinct shift in your overall mission ratings (though wether or not a Mass Murderer rating is good or bad is still technically up to you.).What you have to know is that if you play it quiet, you play it slow. Be prepared to wait for good whiles to learn guard routes or for your target to be in the perfect spot; be prepared to reload often (if you're a perfectionist) when things didn't go as planned, or quickly adapt to your new situation.So, overall, if you enjoy the thought of being the unseen angel of death that puts Altair and Ezio to shame, or if you played and enjoyed any of the other Hitman titles (and for some reason don't already have this one), this is a definite must-have.

												Hitman 2: Silent Assassin provides an estimated duration of ten hours (parameter now average), an in my opinion very addictive, definitely living. Fans would highly recommend it as it is the better of the two chapters on the history of Agent 47 while those new to the saga recommend you try it, maybe at your neighborhood store, to see if the setting menus and commands may be to their liking. If you allow me, a final warning: do not be discouraged, this is a title designed to be extremely difficult, at times slightly frustrating (spend three afternoons trying to accomplish a mission may also get tired!) And then, if you want to play with, arm yourself with a good patience ... good luck, agents 47!			"

												As my first experience with that genre, the Hitman series turned me into a stealth addict!I remember back when I was in college, I borrowed Hitman : Codename 47 from a close friend of mine. He told me : ""It's an amazing game, non-linear, and you can choose the way you want to complete your objectives and kill your targets. There, for instance, there is that mission in which you can disguise as a waiter and poison the food."" So when I tried that very mission a few days later, I would just end up on the roof, and snipe the target from a small concealed window, because screw the poisonned food : hiding on the roof like a coward was the way I did it, and it worked.This game was so much fun! I spent my evenings on it - almost didn't pass my school year because of that, but it was worth it. Sure, I was struggling with the hardest missions, but enjoying beating them nonetheless. Eh. killing a drug lord with a minigun has its own benefits. Two weeks later, I gave the game back to my friend and said ""Boy, that was INSANE.""You will easily understand how excited I was when he told me they did a sequel called Silent Assassin! The fangirl in me HAD to try this.(Besides, I'd like to thank my friend Liam sooo much for gifting me the whole Hitman collection for Christmas 2012. Liam, if you read this... you're awesome and I love you.) I then got the opportunity to try the second game, which improved a lot from the first. More freedom, an incredible amount of missions, a really clever plot, and a great difficulty. It's a must-have for all Stealth lovers, and some of the best Hitman missions are to be found in that second episode. I mean, you can murder evil twins, one of them eating crisps and pizzas in the basement of a Malaysian airport, the other relaxing in his jacuzzi at the top of a highly guarded skyscraper. You'll never see that again in your life.Then Blood Money followed. Graphically, it was a stunning improvement, but the gameplay also was a lot deeper : body hiding, weapon customisation, beverage poisoning, etc... Blood Money is the core of all good stealth mechanics. And those custom newspaper articles at the end of each mission are hilarious! That third episode is worth gold, and I really recommend your to play it!I finally acquired Contracts when it released on Steam, as known as Silent Assassin's spiritual sequel, which subtly links the events from the original game, with a certain chapter found in Blood Money's cutscenes. Apart from Contracts being a much darker game than the others, it's an awesome addition to the series. Half of the missions are remakes of the memorable ones from Codename 47; they were redesigned completely, so the layout of the maps and the buildings have changed, and there's even more places to explore, and exciting ways to finish your job successfully.Well, I could talk about Hitman for hours, or relate my funniest anecdotes, but the best you could do for now, is try by yourself and embody the well-known Agent 47 for the best assignments of your life.

												The Hitman series is a piece of history.  I think this game was the fruition of the stealth/action genre, and its effective implementation have inspired dozens of other games, including Assasin's Creed. Hitman 2 is my favorite, not because it's the best, but because it was one of the first PC games I fell in love with. The atmospheric mood, soundtrack, and art stylization really drew me in and have greatly influenced what I look for in the medium. While the gameplay has dated, the effective combination of other aspects have kept it consistently in my top 20, even a decade later.Gameplay: 5 In a post Assasin's Creed world, it has definitely dated.  At the time, however, the controls and AI were stellar.  Story: 6Nothing revolutionary, but it serves to draw together the wide variety of locations presented in the game.Art: 9The mood and atmospheres are incredible. No other game at the time captured the diversity of worlds so well with so little graphically, justifying literally hundreds of hours of slow sneaking - without ever feeling dry or boring.  This combined with the music makes it a classic. Music: 9Jesper Kyd is a master. At a time when most games featured popish midi synth, he had his soundtrack was performed by the Budapest Symphony Orchestra.Should you play this?If you haven't played this before, you likely won't be impressed. But if you like classic games and want to see a bit of history, enjoy it for the fantastic environmental moods the game creators were able to capture. For those of you who enjoyed it 10 years ago, you'll appreciate a replay.			"

Hitman 2: Silent Assasin - Rating: 8.8/10General ImpressionHitman 2: Silent Assassin is a stealth game, made especially for people who can keep silent. The graphics for the year 2002 are wonderful, the soundtracks are very enjoyable, the atmosphere varies from tunnels, buildings, cities and even more areas, also the countries vary, such as Russia, India, Sicily, etc. The gameplay is pretty much just to kill enemies, you have a lot of guns to choose from, such as pistols, shotguns, rifles, grenades and even melee guns, such as katanas, knifes, swords, etc. You can even get your enemy asleep for a period of time, with anesthetics. The story is about a Hitman who retired as a yard keeper, until the priest of the church got kidnapped by a Russian mob. He has to accomplish some tasks for his agent, Diana. After he accomplishes them all, he will have to fight through the church to kill the Russian mob and liberate the priest.GraphicsThe graphics are wonderful for the year 2002, a big improvement from the game Hitman: Codename 47. They are well optimized, and they are wonderful even on budget computers. They are set in natural destinations (such as Japanese mountains), where we may see snow, trees, rocks, etc. well designed. The guns seem to be well designed, as well as the sky, the buildings, in the city destinations. Even in tunnels, the graphics are still well optimized, not dark.AtmosphereThe atmosphere varies from countries such as Russia, Italy, Japan, Afghanistan, India, Sicily and Germany. This game has many areas, such as subways, sewers, palaces, mansions, mountains, cities, deserts, etc. The variety of areas makes this game complex, proving that the developers had a lot of inspiration and were able to create a complex game. The weather varies from area and country, such as Afghanistan (desert) where it's sunny, or Russia (city) where it's snowy, etc.Audio/MusicThe soundtrack of this game were composed by Jesper Kyd, a well-known composer for video games and movies. They tend to change often, such as if you have alerted the enemy, a dynamic music will play. If you are just making your way through, a calm music would play. The sounds of guns are pretty good, also the door closings and openings are realistic. We may also find weather sounds, such as raining or snowing. When you walk on snow, your walking will start becoming noisy. Also, explosions are well designed to be pretty realistic.GameplayThe gameplay is about a hitman who accomplishes tasks, such as planting bombs, killing important targets, eliminating all hostiles, introducing poison in an enemy, liberating characters, etc. In this game, you can not drive cars, which is a disadvantage, in my opinion. Hitman can kill the enemies in many ways, such as shooting him, punching him to death, killing him with a grenade, backstabbing him, or simply make him sleeping for a while. The enemies tend to firstly search for Hitman before killing him. If you give any clues to the enemy, such as a dead body or a wrong movement, they will be alerted. If they see you, they will start firing at you. The game has a lot of ranks, from Silent Assassin to Mass Murder. By making Silent Assassin, you will unlock better guns.StoryThe story is about a retired hitman called ""47"" due to the code which was imprinted on the back of his neck ""110706040147"". After his retirement, he got a job as a yard keeper at a church in Sicily. In a day, the priest of the church has been kidnapped by a Russian mob. Hitman has the task to do his agent's favors in order to know where the priest has been kidnapped. He has to fight through many areas and countries, killing important people, such as Generals, business men, etc. The game has 20 missions, each one of them taking less than an hour to complete (depending on the difficulty and on the style you want to play with).EnginesThe engines on this game are well optimized, I haven't met any bugs or crashes, neither screen freezes. The people's movements are realistic, starting from walking calm to running due to being alerted. The sky does not move, however, the snowflakes fall unlimitedly. The railings are also falling forever. In the cities there are a few cars moving normal. The water through the sewers can be well seen while it's flowing. In the desert, the dust can be well seen while the wind takes it through the air, among many other engines. This game can be played even on low performance computers, which give it a huge advantage.Other FeaturesThe user interface is pretty well-designed, simple but neat. The controls are well-chosen, which are not complex, and very easy to learn. The mechanics are pretty well-optimized, everything moves nicely, but sometimes soldiers hit the walls by accident (they go back to normal very quick, it just happens). Overall, it’s a pretty nice stealth-based game, which can be played however you want.Positive PointsPretty nice graphicsNo bugs or crashesGood soundtracksAwesome voice actingOptimized engineProperly made AIMany environments and areasMany ways to complete missionsMany weapons to choose fromA well-chosen endingNeutral PointsA multiplayer or a CO-OP option would be an amazing featureA mini map would probably improve the easiest difficultyNegative PointsIt is very hard to complete SA rankEnemy snipers are too powerful "

												Codename 47 was a success, a success that needed a sequel. And what do the good sequels do? Fix what's broken, evolve what's working. And Silent Assassin does that...kinda. Unfortunately, not always right. The overall structure of the game remained the same - you have a map where you need to do something, preferably unnoticed, and then, usually, leave the area. But how you do it is slightly different. First of all, and that is important for more... kind, i guess, players like me, - you can knock out enemies with a chloroform instead of killing them. This also means, that now you can knock out innocent people in the area and use their clothes almost without any consequences. Almost, because knocked out people do regain consciousness (quicker on higher difficulty), and because there is a new meter. Yes, starting with this game there is a ""suspicion"" meter in play. And it's rather stupid, unfortunately. When you are seen by enemy/guard-type characters, their ""suspicion"" goes up. It's universal for the map and it can only be slightly changed by what you are wearing at the moment. But it didn't work as well as in later installments, with lots of smaller ""if""s in play, where enemy/guard character could truly be described as ""suspicious"" and not ""crazy and paranoid"" and willing to shoot a hotel visitor just because he made a wrong turn (and yes, this can happen). What's also sad, is that the infamous jungle chapters from Codename 47, are here as well, only now you're in snowy Japan. Why would developers want to leave this kind of section in the game is still something i don't understand. But it's a solid game. Not yet as refined as Contracts and Blood Money, but not as raw and hardcore-ish as Codename 47. Definitely worth the play. P.S. Jesper Kyd's music is amazing as always. P.P.S. You can now save in the game, if that put you off in Codename 47. Amount of saves depends on the difficulty level. P.P.P.S. The game is ridiculous to play if you speak russian. Russian stereotypes in this game are amazingly funny. Game even starts with a very harsh russian profanity, it's the first thing you hear when you start the game.			"

												The only Hitman game that has a number after the title. Not as good as the original. I'm not sure why; maybe because stealth is not mandatory (you can easily just shoot everyone - which you could do in the original, but it was difficult). Or maybe because now you could save up to 3 times during missions, which takes some suspense away (it was the dawn of save-scumming).

												This is the game that got me into the Hitman franchise, and I wouldn't recommend it to new players. It's very difficult, the AI is buggy as hell, and you're not given much guidance on what you're supposed to do. But that doesn't mean it's not one of the best games ever made! IO Interactive took the basic idea of Codename 47 and made it ten times better when they made Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. You'll be blown away from the main menu screen to the end credits. At the time I had never played a game that was so open-ended. You're pretty much thrown into a map, told to kill a guy, and it's up to you to figure out how you're going to do it.I had seen this game in a store but originally passed on it. The idea of being an international hitman was appealing, but I figured it was going to be watered-down garbage. By chance I received a copy of Hitman 2 and now I'm glad I did! One of the best experiences I've ever had in a video game and one in which I've played for thousands of hours and lost sleep on just trying to figure out new ways to kill targets and complete missions in crazy ways.A classic in every sense of the word and you owe it to yourselves to play this game.

""Hitman 2 should be everything we wished of its predecessor – and that gives us extremely high hopes."" - PC Gamer, 2001Silent Assassin is where the Hitman series truly excelled. Codename 47 gave a great introductory to the franchise, Hitman 2 had so much to work with and delivered incredibly well. Without spoiling the ending to Codename 47 and the plot of Silent Assassin, Agent 47 finds himself in similar territory: to kill. Through a wide variety of challenging scenarios, 47 must overcome all barriers to reclaim something extremely important. Through this journey it outlines to 47 that he is incapable of finding inner peace and therefore must continue work through the ICA.Highly recommended. My favourite stealth game alongside Hitman: Blood Money.  "

												Like an epic flashback to the crusades, 47's return is marked with thunderous applause. Both due to the impressive new control scheme Hitman 2 boasts as well as it's theming.The premise is after the events of the previous game. 47 decides to live out the rest of his life as a priest. However adventure calls back to him and he gradually stumbles upon an epic plot of religious significance. The soundtrack is simply sublime and is full of dark moody opera music. It's as if your a religious plague set upon the legions of man.Add to that the series staple ranking system was introduced with this game. Unlike in the previous game you are not required to kill anyone except your target, and the game ranks you based on how well you complete a mission. The titular ""Silent Assassin"" being granted for perfectly completing a mission. Don't expect it to be easy though.			"

												Hitman 2 Silent Assassin is a game that i bought because im a really big Hitman fan ! And i had fun with it but it has some serious problems witch makes it in some cases better than the first one but in some worse !The good thinks+Amazing graphics for its year and it still is.+Very long for a hitman game ! Its about 20 missions and not like the other ones with 10-15 missions.+Alot of weapons ! +Big Maps+Amazing music ! Even better than in the first game!+Badass Protagonist+DifficultyAnd the bad things-♥♥♥♥♥♥ first person mode ! Its just so bad ...-Gets a bit repetitive near the end ! Because all objectives are the same and you dont have much ways to kill your target!-Very unfair Stealth system ! The game has a new Stealth system witch is very realistic but it breaks the game and makes it not fun to explore the locations because you just get caught ! The Stealth system makes disguises nearly useless ! Because if you go near a guard they will start shot at you because they know that youre not one of them ! So you need to find ways to get around the guards and be at the distance because if your too near you get chaugt ! Yeah its realistic but its also the biggest Minus of the game because it breaks everything !-Not much ways of killing the main target.Well still i had alot of fun playing this game ! It was an amazing experience for sure but these problems did sometimes disappoint me ! I give this game a 8.5/10 ! Everyone should try it but im sure that many people will not like it or play it to the end because of the unfair stealth System !			"

												Hitman 2 Silent Assassin is a game that one approaches with much anticipation. The original Hitman was a true classic and any follow up to that would have to be something extraordinary in order to meet the expectations.As Silent Assassin starts out 47 has retired and now lives a quiet life, tending the gardens in a Sicilian monastery. This all changes rather dramatically of course as your friend and mentor is kidnapped and you are forced to once again, take on the role of a professional hitman.The story in general leaves much to be desired and the extremely subpar voice acting does not to help it. The grating sound of foreign accents that might as well have all been done by the same American voice actor often takes you out of the game and it is a shame that the developers couldn't have sprung for a couple of authentic sounds along the way. The high quality soundtrack and some passable ambiance makes up for some of this shortfall but not all of it unfortunately.In terms of gameplay nothing much has changed. You travel from mission to mission, picking your starting gear and then going about killing a preset target in whichever manner you find to be the most efficient. Silent Assassin introduces a new rating system at the end of each mission that rewards you based on performance. Unfortunately the highest rating you can receive is usually only given out for executing a mission in a very specific way and this makes it very counterintuitive to the otherwise very open-ended missions.The mission areas are much bigger this time around and while this sometimes allow for more creative thinking in solving the missions it also tends to slow down the game's pace, particularly in missions where running might attract the attention of nearby guards.The developers seems to have paid attention to some of the fan feedback of the original and Silent Assassin has now been given a save game system. Depending on your difficulty level you are given a certain number of saves each mission and while this is still a far cry from what really should be standard in PC games it is also a huge leap forwards from the complete lack of in-mission saves in the original. A number of new camera angles are also available to you at popular request.Graphically Hitman is still a beautiful game, not quite as big of a step forward as one might have wanted, looking at what else is out there, but still good enough that it adds to the experience rather than detract from it.All in all Hitman 2 Silent Assassin is a good game, even a good sequel, but in many ways it is also a bit of a letdown. It doesn't do much to advance the franchise instead sticking with what worked in the original and mostly rehashing what was already there. If you liked the original Hitman then you are going to like Silent Assassin. Just don't expect it to do anything new or exciting.			"

												Hitman 2 is one of the the best stealth games that has ever released. I'll add that the foliage physics are now absent from this iteration that were previously found in Hitman: Codename 47. I also like how ballistics work in the game, it's unique. The level design, for it's time, is phenomenal. Such is the case with the storyline. It kept me immersed throughout my playthrough. The environments are enormous this time. And they're filled with NPCs, that may be civilians or enemies, so you won't get bored just wandering around. The animations, however, are a bit clunky. But, again, taking into account its release date, it seems fair. Besides, it's nothing that would keep you from stop playing. I really, really loved sniping in the game. Some may say that the game is ""hard"". But that's just casuals whining how they can't move the mouse properly. The game's difficulty is realistic when played at expert, the AI becomes even more clever. At professional difficulty the game becomes frustratingly hard, you'd have to be a pro to achieve a silent assassin rating in that!  I played it on PS2 and i have to say that ''Hitman'' series was my childhood and ''Silent Assassin'' one of the greatest parts .			"

												Before playing, I recommend using this widescreen resolution fix[pcgamingwiki.com].A follow-up to Codename 47, Silent Assassin improves the gameplay by adding various features and fixing some problems from its predecessor. While the story is not so interesting, the gameplay is unique which keeps you entertained until the end. There's an FPS mode to make this game more interesting (and you can see legs too!).

												This game is hard as balls, but it really is quite satisfying once you finally finish the mission the way you want. There are also multiple ways to finish most levels, which is neat. It also fixes a lot of the issues from the 1st game, like having better AI intelligence (1st game's AI was way too difficult, I often got killed for no reason, not to mention the fact that they have pixel-perfect accuracy since I never stood a chance against them in a gunfight). However, the AI is still too smart, in that sometimes even though I'm disguised I still get shot for reasons unknown to me, and more often, I get killed when I venture into areas I didn't know is restricted. There should be a warning system where, if you trespass, you get a warning, not shot to death. Not a perfect game as it has flaws, but it's still really fun.			"

												More freedom, more options, and the same intense gameplay of the original. The sequel is much more forgiving on gamers than its predecessor, but the gameplay still remains as addicting as ever.The game’s coup de grace, however, lies in the intelligence of the other characters you encounter.Sure, it could've been longer, and a multiplayer option wouldn't have hurt either, but even as it is, I really couldn't find anything wrong with the game - it's fun, intense, and most of all, highly enjoyable.If stealthy, strategic action intrigues you, Hitman 2 is a blast.

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWHitman 2: Silent Assassin is a sequel to the Hitman: Codename 47 and a real oldie but a goodie action stealth game that lets you take the control of Agent 47, a retired assassin, forced to get back to work after his friend, Father Vittorio, got kidnapped by mafia boss only to discover that they didn't want Father Vittorio but him instead. You choose your own playstyle, will you be hidden in the plain sight of your enemies or will you blast off everyone that stands in your way is your decision.The game features 3 difficulties, while not one of them is ""Easy"". You are also able to collect weapons that will make you replay missions a dozen of times searching for them.═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:Enjoyeable soundtrackWeapon collectingReplay valueBig open mapsMany ways to execute the missionCons:You will sometimes be spotted through wallsGame will crash sometimesFrustrating hard to get SA rankTo get some weapons you will have to exploit game mechanics or relay on pure luckThere are visible traces of removed beta content═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis is a stealth game thats meant to be played slowly, if you don't know English good enough you will face difficulties when trying to do some missions, other than that this game is also suitable for everyone that loves just taking out their weapons and roaming around killing every single NPC on the map. I rate this game 9/10, would not get Silent Assasing rank again.═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

 Almost as good as the original, this Hitman game has great levels and great stealth/disguise mechanics.

However, stealth is not required, and if you want an easier game, you can just shoot everyone. You can also save 3 times during missions. "

												Unlike most Hitman games where you just kill for money, this one has a different and more interesting plot.47 has 'gone soft' as Diana says, and is fighting his way to save a friend of him who got kidnapped. So basically he's getting back to the killing business in order to save his friend.For its time the game looks pretty neat, with good character design, decent textures, realistic and big maps for a lot of exploration. Same goes for the animations and sounds, not to mention the music. Its gameplay is a little more challenging than newer Hitman games and it's pretty hard to achieve the rank ""Silent Assassin"", especially in the harder difficulties (part of me believes that it's also the reason they decided to give the name Silent Assassin to this one). However if you do you get rewarded with unlockable weapons. Yes, you don't have to pay DLC for new weapons but to actually be good at the game. Then again there are multiple ways you can beat a mission so the stealth aspect could be considered optional. If you're mostly into the story and want to progress to save Vittorio, you can always go out guns blazing. So I highly recommend this game to everyone, whether you like stealth or not it's a great game that will keep you busy for a lot of hours.			"

												My first taste of the Hitman saga was playing the demo for Silent Assassin, way back on the PS2, on Anathema, getting me sniper rifle out and watching a grown man pee on a tree.

												It's definitely improved over the first game. The game is more forgiving, the UI has improved, and the game gives you a limited amount of quicksaves instead of a crappy respawn-checkpoint system that makes no sense. Stealth is still done somewhat terribly but at least the game doesn't mind you going Rambo 80% of the time. Guess that's why we call him Hitman, and not Stealthman.			"

												Damn. This game is GOOD! I'm really surprised of how much I turned out to enjoy it. I mean, the first Hitman was... a fun distraction, but this one improves on it in every aspect.First of all, the STORY: the first game had a story too, but it didn't seem to care until the last mission. Well, this one does a similar thing, but at least it explores a little more 47's character.The GAMEPLAY also has some much needed improvements: the controls are a lot more ""mainstream"", I had a hard time to find a suitable configuration to play Codename 47. Just like any other respecful Hitman game, you have tons of creative options to take out your targets. Poison, silenced weapons, sniper rifles, malee, the iconic fibre wire... Hell, you can even get some anesthetic and go for a non-lethal approach towards the guards (it is HARD AS ♥♥♥♥ tho). This time a loud and dumb approach can be an actual option, as I said there's tons of weapons to choose from, it's all up to you.The graphics...well of course they don't hold up, but the maps really give you a sense of scale. They're REALLY HUGE.THE SOUNDTRACK! OH MY GOD THE SOUNDTRACK! The music in this game is GLORIUS, and they know it, they shove it in your face as soon as you start the game up. There are soooo many epic tracks. It is SURELY ONE OF THE BEST IN GAMING HISTORY.Of course it has some minor issues, for example, it felt short, at least for me. I finished it in a little more than 10 hours, and I scored professional in almost every missions, even silent assassin in a few of them, which should take longer.Also it feels like 47 moves REALLY SLOWLY, especially in tiny hallways.But overall, this game is really solid. It's worth it just for the soundtrack. I'm listening at it while i'm writing this review and oh man... THE chills...Almost forgot: first person is a thing. Just in case you prefer immersion.			"

												Hitman 2 Silent Assassin is to my mind a true classic for me even though this game is now about 14 years old it is still an excellent game and a great source of entertainment. This game brings you into the world of Legendary Assassin Agent 47 who comes out of retirement and is plunged into the criminal underworld as the ulimate assassin all with you at the controls. The gameplay in this game is obviously quite dated by the standards of games today but in my opinion you should not let that deter you from buying or playing this game because the controls still feel great and are easy to learn and memorize.This game possess great variety in the methods to which you conduct your assassination attempts throughout the various levels. The great thing about the Hitman series is that the game gives you alot of freedom in how your aproach it you are in no way stuck to a linear setup in the levels and as such this game grants you a great deal of replayability as you can choose to play the same missions many times but go about them in very different ways ranging from the coveted Silent Assassin rank or to other more brutal and straightfoward methods. In addition to this you can take lots of different routs and use different tools and scenario's to perform your hits.With an exception level count of 20 missions which is the most in any Hitman game you will be playing this game for a considerable time even following a guide on how to go through this game still grants up to 15 hours play for just 1 playthrough but you could decide to take your time and study each map and try all the different methods which would great you up to 25 hours plus and that is just one playthrough you can do it a totally different way in another playtrhough.Now this game is not perfect and there are a few negatives such as glitches that can imped you from getting the best rank in some levels but they dont always happen so they are not to bad and also the AI can be quite finicky and strange at times which can be frustrating but once you learn the pattens of this its really not a huge issue at all.On another note i should bring up the outstanding soundtrack by composer Jesper Kyd who quite simply creates an amazing soundtrack for this game which so wonderfully helps to immerse you in this very fun game to my way of thinking soundtracks and game atmosphere are very important to a successful and enjoyable game experience and this game delivers that with flying colors. All in all i would highly recommend this game for those who are thinking about it its a true classic it may be old but it is excellent and still holds up well in todays gaming if you ask me you have to really think about what you are doing and there is alot of variety to keep it fresh i give it a solid 7.5/10			"

												Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the second game of the Hitman, with a story which is unremarkable, 47 is retired to a sicilian church with his friend, the father Vittorio is kidnapped, to save him, 47 needs to return to assassination businessPositive Things:+ It's the longest game in the series with the most varity of the mission location, every location is kinda differently, for example Japan, Afghanistan and Sicily are intense, because the AI is really sensitive, compared to Russia, Malaysia and India which is more relaxing+ Nice game engine even if the game is really old, and can even run on a toaster ( very low end computer/laptop )+ Contains the best levels of the series+ Old game but still the best+ A nice loadout of weapons+ The Marauder's map is decent+ The game ending is really nice+ The Difficulty is hard ( it's a stealth based-game ) so use your brain ;)Negative Things:- The rating system is horrible- Include some worst levels in the series- Most of the time the only possible disguise is a guard outfit- The prevous game, every target was memorable- The game contains some glitchesConclusion: this game is very sentimental, this game is very challenging and fun			"

												Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is the second game in the Hitman series. It follows the journey of a contract killer named 47 as he travels around the world, eliminating his target in order to save one of his few friends.Hitman 2 is one of the few game that manage to do a disguise-based stealth right, with tons of disguises you are able to use all over the game. However, that does not make the game easier, as the AI in this game are capable of seeing through your disguise if you even act one bit suspicious (and some of them are even capable of seeing it from far away, as the ninja's from the Japan level can attest. Dem Psychic ninja). This makes sure that the game can be intense as well as satisfying when you do manage to beat the level with Silent Assassin rating.This game also allows one to take multiple way to eliminate 47's targets. From disguising his way to the target, or going in with guns blazing high, there will be many ways one can do in this game, ensuring its replayability value.			"

												This game is one of the best games I've ever played.The story, the gameplay, the soundtrack, the atmosphere and environment, is all executed extremely well.  For a 2002 game, it was ahead of its time.The player gets to have control of a man who goes by the name ""47.""  He had worked as a hitman for quite some time after escaping an asylum in which he was born as an artificially made human clone, born and raised to be a killer for the wrong reasons.  He becomes accustomed to killing for the right reasons considering his targets wind up behind horrible people who do bad things.  However, his motivation seemed to be money and fulfilling his habit of professional stealth and murder.  But, he did eventually clear things up and manage to put an end to what was bad in the previous game.At the start of the game, our once notorious protagonist is an ex-hitman seeking forgiveness working at a church somewhere in Sicily.  He befriends ""Father Emilio Vittorio"", who is eventually kidnapped.  The individuals who captured him leave a note demanding money from 47 in return for his priest friend.  47 is to then rejoin his employers at the ""International Contract Agency (ICA)"" and work with his handler Diana Burnwood.  Throughout the game, she gives the player a contract or hit to perform in exchange for the agency's attempts at finding Father Vittorio.  Within these levels, the player is to take control of 47 and take in really huge levels with plenty going on.  Not only is there a target (or targets) within the level, but there are probably guards, civilians, security cameras, et cetera.  After realizing all this, the player must painstakingly calculate how he or she is going to get the job done and escape with as much precision and stealth as possible.  It is allowed to go in guns-blazing, however it can be pretty darn difficult, and it's not necessarily the ideal way to play the game.  If one were to play the game like it's normally supposed to be played by the means of stealth, there are rewards.  Such rewards happen to be new weapons that could be used to improve stealth abilities, or non-stealth abilities.  Every once in a while, 47 will wind up back at that church so that he could wait on another job by his work computer, or take a good look at all the weapons the player has unlocked throughout the game so far within the garden shed.  It is also important to know that 47 can take disguises on individuals that he either kills or knocks out, which is a feature in every Hitman game that is always fantastic.  It allows access to parts of the level that would be restricted otherwise.  But, if you're up for a silent assassin suit only challenge, be my guest.By no means do each level feel the same or repetitive, for 47's job requires him to work on a global scale.  The excellent level design also helps make each level feel like something new and difficult.  And by difficult, I mean really difficult.Even though it is tough, there are many opportunities within each level for the player to improvise and figure out within every level, and it is well worth the time.  Such opportunities allow the player to pick and choose equipment before starting a level, as well as using things in the environment that can be found to assist in performing the hit.  That is awesome.---The game isn't without its faults, though.  One thing that bothers me particularly are the possibilities of getting compromised and realized by enemies even when in a disguise.  It happens by the most dumb means possible...  If you were to run within a disguise (which is something players do in almost every game, because why would you want to be really slow...) you could be shot at.  And so, to avoid suspicion, you *must* walk when close to other non-played characters that happen to be guards or wearing the same clothes as you.  If you're in your original suit, you can run all you want.  But otherwise, nope.  And it does makes sense to get suspicion for it, but it doesn't make sense to be immediately shot for it.Thankfully, every other Hitman game does not have this problem, and the idea of there being suspicion is done a lot better.  But it is something to think about and prepare for before playing this game.  You could preform a glitch where you can quickly switch between running and walking and not get shot at for it, but it really looks stupid and it kills the illusion that the game is not just a game, but something seemingly realistic.  This poorly designed mechanic is really annoying.  But, if you have the patience, it can be overlooked and the game could still be a lot of fun.There is a notorious bad level in this game known as ""Hidden Valley.""  In this level, there is no target.  Which could have been okay if it were still fun and managable.  But it's not.  There is one disguise option.  If you get it, it still doesn't stop the difficulty of getting through.  It's not the fun difficult you'll get at every other time in the game.  No.  It's the stupid difficulty that only exists due to bad mechanics.  Every time a guard gets you in their sights, they run to you to check your ""ID"" or whatever, even though your face is completely covered up in a mask and you look just like one of them.  But for some reason, even though they could have literally run up the anybody else who looks the same and check their ID, they check yours.  I recommend getting through this misery as much as possible before you die of pain from trying to get a perfect ""Silent Assassin"" rating from completing it.  Ironically, there is no assassination in this level, making the idea of getting the Silent Assassin rating seem pointless.  Just get through it, and never play it again, unless you really want to, for some reason.  You might unlock a weapon from doing it, but you could probably find it and exit the level with it instead.  This is the worst level in the entire Hitman franchise, in my personal opinion.  Get it done.  Then move on.  It is really, really, bad.Another thing that rubs me the wrong way is the fact that you awkwardly have to load a level you last saved in, then exit it to get back to the menu, then be able to pick a level in order to play whatever level you want.  After you beat the game, it does save, so it's not that you would have to beat the last level over and over again, and that's great.  But still, this is something that is a little annoying.  Thankfully, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin, and the third game, Hitman: Contracts, are the only games in the franchise to do this.--The atmosphere and vibe from each level (except Hidden Valley) feel ecstatic.  Even though the graphics are dated, they're still nice to look at and are far from ugly.  Even if you don't have a super computer that allows amazing detailed graphics and insane frame rate, the game still looks cool in gameplay and in cutscenes.The levels are also beautifully designed, making almost every level a joy to complete.Not only did I feel like a professional assassin when I executed levels with intense precision and stealth, but I felt like one whenever the ICA moved me into these locations.  These locations range from being civil parties with wealthy scumbags to top secret locations where you need a disguise to not get shot on sight.  I always felt like I was on an important job, causing me to feel like a real professional.  If I wasn't a professional in the first place, I wouldn't be able to have the ICA send me on these jobs.  Trail and error is the key to success in becoming the professional this game will want you to be.  So have at it.--The soundtrack is some of the best I've heard in a video game, let alone a form of entertainment.  It was composed by Jesper Kyd, and it is perfect.--Overall, the game is really great.  The game offers a compelling story revolving around a character who manages to be a cold-blooded killer and a human being seeking justice.  Buy it.			"

As a part of the hitman bundle it was irresistable. I can't wait to play it again. Silent Assassin is an old game, and certainly has it's bugs, sometimes guards see through your disguise for no reason, start shooting out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and apparently know every other person in the world and you are automatically suspicious, but once you learn how things work a bit you're gonna have a great time with this game.

												47 is back and he is upset ( becase ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is a bad word). Having escaped the clutches of his evil father in the first game and found his inner peace he is once again thrust back into the world of hitmen for hire when his new best friend and mentor is kidnapped by the mafia. Going on a one man rampage may be the only way to save father Vittorio and restore his peace once more.Sound like an action packed adventure? Well there is a reason for that. This game takes everything the first game did and improves it, more action, more espionage and more awesome. And unlike the first game the enemies aren’t all psychic, just most of them. So while stealth is completely possible in this game and super gratifying to pull off it can still be frustrating. That being said the full rampage mode is great, a huge variety of guns on offer and each can be taken into any mission and used to rain death down upon your enemies.

												You play some bald dude, who lives in Sicily. One day your friend get's kidnapped by the Italian Mafia, which is payd by a Russian General, who want's to kill some guys in third world countries... and Japan (makes sense, because all countries that aren't the USA are the same). Our protagonists then quickly changes his profession from harvesting tomatoes to performing high class hits on international Warlords, Gunrunners and terrorists in exciting locations such as an office building that has only two offices in it, a hospital, that people are not allowed to enter (the hospital obviously doesn't lack hospitality) and a ♥♥♥♥ing tunnel somewhere in Afghanistan. Conveniently enough all these hits are ordered by the guy, who kidnapped your friend. So this guy will have to die too... and your brother... because why not. As you can already tell the story is amazing and totally not a reskin of the first game, but what is the gameplay like? Well, first of all the game glitches out, when you play in windowed mode, to ensure, that you're enjoying the gameplay on your whole screen. Then the devs also ensured, that the player has complete freedom of interaction with the world. Getting shot, getting shot again and getting shot are only a few possibilites, that the player can experience. It is also needless to say, that the game is not buggy and that things like map glitching and sliding don't exist. Overall ""IO-Not Interactive with our fans"" has provided an amazing game with lots of fun to be had.2/10			"

												Is better than the original, so it is an easy recomendation. Although this game is long and hard, it will need your extreme patience, most of the gameplay elements have being improve here, the stealth feels better due the the new disguise system, it makes thinks tense and harder overall, the gunplay feels awesome, the stealth still the core mechanic here but you can press F1 and have a solid FPS experience, sending an enemy to space with your silver baller pistols is unique and awesome as ♥♥♥♥, I was surprise how much fun I got by just shooting my way out when my stealth run went bad. The Levels are some of the greatest in the entire hitman series, and the worst. There's so much filler in this game it make the game feel like a drag some times, but when the game clicks it just clicks, personally I find this specially highly adictive, I could stop playing until I beat a level, and even if I was dead tired, I just want it to boot the next level. Finally this game looks amazing, is one of those old games that have a strong art style or knows how to use their graphics, but the enviroments are one of the best of any game, same as the music.Even if at a time this is one of the most frustrating games I ever played, it just bring me joy and good memories, I cannot write bad stuff about this game, this a god send for fans of the original game, a great start for the franchise, and overall a wonderful game,			"

												47 is back and he is upset ( becase ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is a bad word). Having escaped the clutches of his evil father in the first game and found his inner peace he is once again thrust back into the world of hitmen for hire when his new best friend and mentor is kidnapped by the mafia. Going on a one man rampage may be the only way to save father Vittorio and restore his peace once more.Sound like an action packed adventure? Well there is a reason for that. This game takes everything the first game did and improves it, more action, more espionage and more awesome. And unlike the first game the enemies aren’t all psychic, just most of them. So while stealth is completely possible in this game and super gratifying to pull off it can still be frustrating. That being said the full rampage mode is great, a huge variety of guns on offer and each can be taken into any mission and used to rain death down upon your enemies. Rag doll bad guys and high caliber weapons are the best mix.This game is a classic and well worth your time. Pick it up if you love stealth or action and you will have fun for sure.Have Fun ^_^			"

												Absolute classic, this game brought me to the world of stealth games, I've finished it many times on various difficulties and in many ways and I still love it. As a part of the hitman bundle it was irresistable. I can't wait to play it again. Silent Assassin is an old game, and certainly has it's bugs, sometimes guards see through your disguise for no reason, start shooting out of ♥♥♥♥ing nowhere and apparently know every other person in the world and you are automatically suspicious, but once you learn how things work a bit you're gonna have a great time with this game.

												Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is a classic. Ever since its release in 2002, the game has been received as a game that has a huge number of opportunities and ways to get your mission done. The storyline is not the absolute best, but it does not need to be. The game includes a very big amount of weapons and very distinctive, extensive level-design, that makes every level a big thinking exercise. Be wary of blood and gore though; if you're not a big fan of killing in a realistic way, this game might just shock you. A really good buy if it's on sale and you're looking for a gem!			"

												Hitman 2: Silent AssassinA classic entry in the Hitman series which sparked many sequels, Hitman 2 is a solid, fun stealth title.Positives:+ There are many different ways you can approach missions - poisoning the food or water of your target without being detected, choking them with fiber wire, using silenced guns or just running in rambo and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ up. Maybe you want to cause a power outage by turning a generator off, then slitting their throat in the dark. Fancy placing a bomb on a target's helicopter and watching it expode? It's all possible. The ability to choose how you will carry out your hit is pretty cool.+ Lots of unique disguises to use, which vary according to mission. From the typical bodyguard attire to dressing as a doctor to infilitrate hospital surgery rooms, or as a pizza delivery boy - you'll have many options to pursue when trying to reach your target.+ Huge array of weapons to select prior to each assassination. You do need to collect these guns throughout the game's levels to have access to them however. You've got submachineguns, M60s, assault rifles, crossbows, desert eagles, revolvers, silenced pistols, multiple shotguns...numerous sniper rifles - tonnes.+ I loved the variety of missions available. You'll travel to Russia for assassinations then to Germany, Japan, Singapore and India. Each segment contributes to the overall story of Hitman 2, which I thought was pretty clever (no spoilers on that).+ Awesome music throughout the game. Really helps you feel like an assassin and a badass one at that. Truly top notch.Negatives:- Graphics haven't aged well, but the game is old so no surprise there. Not a real problem but it should be noted regardless.- Clipping issues (at least with the steam version). Check my screenshots for examples. Enemies walking through trucks seemed to be the major one.- One of the biggest problems with Hitman 2 is the lack of information you're given on how the game works - how enemies interact with your decisions. If I dress up as a bodyguard, will civilians be suspicious of my outfit? Or will it just be other guards? If I dress as a doctor, will guards see through it easily or will civilians? No one tells you how the suspicion metre in Hitman 2 actually operates. Sometimes it seems to do whatever it wants. For instance, in one hit I placed a smoke bomb in a laundry chute to activate the fire alarms and then sneaked into the firefighter quarters, taking a uniform. I walked out and towards the metal detectors - then a civilian INSTANTLY recognises me (without the suspicion bar even rising) and alerts the guards. Why? I still can't figure out how this happened. Same deal with one assassination I had in a hospital. Dressed as a doctor, I shot a guard dead with a silenced pistol and concealed his body. But the nurse somehow alerts the guards, even though there's a ♥♥♥♥ing BLACKOUT because I cut power to the generator. Certain parts of the game don't add up logically.- Difficulty is outrageous on anything over normal. Enemies see through disguises straight away, leaving you no choice but to mass murder your way to the target. Pretty poor design really, making the whole point of the game (silence and stealth) impossible rather than a challenge.Overall Score: 8/10Quality game by a good company, Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is pretty enjoyable. Definitely worth playing if you never have before.			"

The Hitman Movie was amazing very touching, Here are the film titles "" Hitman (2007) - Hitman: Agent 47 "" and here are some great written Novels "" Hitman: Enemy Within - Hitman: Damnation - Hitman: Reborn "". everything is well thought out and the legend of hitman gets to live on now in this game.

It is buggy and poor at communicating to the player what they need to do/should do. Such was the way of old-school games. I don't mind it, but will admit it feels dated.

												This game is an old school Hitman! I personally enjoyed every second of playing this game, even though at some points it was extremely hard. The game challenges you and gives you many different ways to approach objectives. The missions on this Hitman game also have a large variety, in one mission you may have to infiltrate a snowy chinese castle, and in another you may be trying to assassinate a public figure in the desert.If you're a Hitman fan and you have not played this game, then you're really missing out! Although you may feel as though the game's graphics are not as good as you would have liked, it is expected considering this Hitman is old... I personally couldn't care less about it because the game overall was brilliant.I'd give this game a 10/10 and I would recommend this game to people.			"

												Hitman 2 was one of the premiere stealth-assassin games when it was released.The game has great level design allowing you to take multiple approaches to try and reach your target mark at the end of the level. Of course, you have the ability to play this as an action shooter game, but the real thrill comes from choosing the stealth approach. In fact, most levels can be completed by only killing one enemy: the mark himself.While many stealth games have come and gone over the years, Hitman 2 is generally going to be remembered as one of the original good ones. While it may not be as shiny as it used to be, it is still surprisingly decent after all these years.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												My favorite Hitman game by a mile. Yes, it can be btrutal at first - especially if you're not familiar with the game and jump to ""pro"" difficulty from the get go; but it's a beautiful game, with a cool story and it's much more rewarding than all the others.You're not a Hitman fan if you don't own this baby. I had it for the gamecube many years ago and just got it for the pc, with the Hitman Bundle. It's better than the HD version they remade a few years ago and, if you're playing this on a pc that can handle the newest installment of the series, you will need nvidiainspector to limit your framerate to about 80 FPS.This is a proper stealth game. And every level is a wonderful sandbox. BUY this game. If you love Hitman, you won't regret it.PS: I run it on Windows 10. No problems whatsoever. So ignore the noise and look into the details.			"

												It has the most missions in a hitman game and they are quite varied. Each level has multiple ways of accomplishing. They introduced saving and made controls better compared to the first game. I think this game really introduced us to the real hitman experience and each hitman has taken it's formula as a base. Really it is a fun game, it has it's own weird humor. If you like stealth games or want something different then look no more.Compared to the first game, I think the music is not so good, but that doesn't  mean it's bad.			"

												Fun, but one of the must frustrating stealth games I've played. Many other stealth games I've played have had a bit more leeway when it came to making a single mistake. Be warned that if you want a good stealth ranking, you have to go very slowly. Verrrrry slowly.			"

												Hitman 2 was one of the premiere stealth-assassin games when it was released.The game has great level design allowing you to take multiple approaches to try and reach your target mark at the end of the level. Of course, you have the ability to play this as an action shooter game, but the real thrill comes from choosing the stealth approach. In fact, most levels can be completed by only killing one enemy: the mark himself.While many stealth games have come and gone over the years, Hitman 2 is generally going to be remembered as one of the original good ones. While it may not be as shiny as it used to be, it is still surprisingly decent after all these years.6/10 ""Okay""			"

												This game is an old school Hitman! I personally enjoyed every second of playing this game, even though at some points it was extremely hard. The game challenges you and gives you many different ways to approach objectives. The missions on this Hitman game also have a large variety, in one mission you may have to infiltrate a snowy chinese castle, and in another you may be trying to assassinate a public figure in the desert.If you're a Hitman fan and you have not played this game, then you're really missing out! Although you may feel as though the game's graphics are not as good as you would have liked, it is expected considering this Hitman is old... I personally couldn't care less about it because the game overall was brilliant.I'd give this game a 10/10 and I would recommend this game to people.			"

												Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is one of those games that I would reccommend to some people, but not reccommend to a lot more people. In many ways, It took the formula of the first game and improved on it. However, there are too many problems  remaining to justify a positive rating. First, the positives: The graphics have vastly improved. This game, graphically speaking, has aged a lot better than Codename 47. The maps are large and are a lot more fun to play in than before. However, it's not perfect. The A.I. is really the only problem I have with this game, but it's a big enough problem to stop me from reccommending. The A.I. is unrealistically hard. They will kill you on sight for carrying string. They will kill you on sight if you look at them wrong. They will kill you on sight for running. You get the idea. They make this game more hard than it is supposed to be, which makes it almost unplayable. If you want to finish your hitman collection, or if you just want to find out what an unrealistic challenge feels like, then get this game. Otherwise, don't buy it. There are better hitman games you can play.			"

												Well, this is definitely a step up after previous game. Didn't had a chance to get it when it came out, so I played it just now. It is still enjoyable even all this years. Most of the problems of original was fixed. The story line in not particularly fantastic, but it's solid not to say the least. The game can be hard, but not relentless as previous one. And it's actually supports aggressive playstyle, so if you lost your nerve during the steath approach, you can just go in the outrage and kill everyone, that'll work too!Very solid project, you should definitely pick it up.

												I think Silent Assassin is my favorite Hitman game. Maybe even more than Blood Money. The various reasons include the continued use of a mission based system, where Agent 47 has his hub at the church and doesn't come back until a number of missions later when he's finished at a location from around the world. And the story is really strong here. Agent 47 is set to find his friend and guide, Father Vittorio, whom is taken hostage very early in the game. So 47 comes out of retirement and works with the ICA again, for their resources, in hopes that he can find out who took his friend hostage and where they're located. As per usual, the agency has 47 take contracts from around the world. 47 visits Palermo, Sicily in Italy. Various buildings in St. Petersburg. Mountainous Japan. The Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The little village of Nuristan, Afghanistan and a military base outside of it. And Temple City India. I have to commend IO Interactive for constantly choosing interesting and different locations for the missions.The missions range in difficulty. Some, I felt I had no choice, but to ""Rambo"" my way through (mainly the Japan levels where the ninjas magically see through your ninja outfit from fifty yards away). The rest are do-able, as there are many ways to go about fulfilling your contract. The last level is a big shootout. But all in all, great stealth game the outdoes the first game by...a lot. Blending in isn't always easy, but you also have to consider which outfits work better for a bald/white man.Music by Jesper Kyd, as always, is amazing. The audio and dialog throughout the game have great levels, so no complaints there. The graphics are so-so. I'll give it the benefit of age, it is over a decade now and with a 1920x1080 fix, it actually looks pretty good. Level designs are sometimes small where you don't have to go far to finish the job, the at least they're open.Great game though, absolutely loved the development of 47 from the first game.9.3/10			"

												Hitman 2: Silent Assassin was looking promising to me, mainly because it looks like Blood Money in terms of levels and mechanics. Sadly, this is not true. Silent Assassin has terrible level design for a stealth based game. The first mission started me out pretty far away from the place I had to get to, and there wasn't many options to get inside. At first, I tried to kill a mailman, get his clothes and his flowers for someone...I have no idea who, because the guards opened fire right when I went up to them.That's another problem, the AI. Guards are either ridiculously smart (up to the point where it just...insane, I don't know how else to put it. They are like gods.), or incredibly stupid (once, I was moving into an area, the guard pulled out his gun, started shooting, I went downstairs and was standing there, the guard comes down, he looks around like he was searching, looks right at me, and puts his gun away and goes back). Again, the level design is not even designed for stealth. It's more like...well, it reminded me of Goldeneye, but in 3rd person. After mission two, where getting upstairs is literally impossible without getting caught and murdering everyone, I decided to go rambo and just finish the game. The next few missions seemed EXACTLY like Goldeneye. You had your sniper, the areas were open and very large (still no stealth factors, here), and I just basically shot everyone down that got in my way.Hitman is not supposed to be this way.			"

												i assume this game is great and has a great story but on windows 10 it runs like ♥♥♥♥, you go through slo motion phases 75% of the time even tho the fps is so crazy high and dont get me started on the cutscenes, they go so slow it feels like its paused half the time, if you have windows 10, dont get it, or at least wait for a patch which i doubt will happen, if you dont have windows 10, then by all means, buy it			"

												Game that defined what Hitman is, a stealth-orientated espionage game which encourages you to stealth through levels in a clever way with a set of objectives you must complete and are free to chose how you go about finishing these levels, until Absolution came and ♥♥♥♥ed everything up...

												Hitman 2 may not excite anyone the days. It's older game with older graphics. Even in it's day the bugs are unpredictable and numerous. The saving grace to this game? It's freaking fun and satisifying to accomplish a mission on Silent Assassin despite the game's integral challenges. This game will have you replaying missions multiple times, just to see if you can do it a little bit better. Oh there are a few stinkers in here. ""Hidden Valley"" ""Jacuzzi Job"" But for the most part, this game is just freaking fun, and should be played by all fans of stealth oriented games.			"

												This was the first Hitman game I ever played. Hitman 2: Silent Assassin is what a true hitman game was back then before Absolution made Hitman too easy to play. Hitman 2 will give you a big challenge requires your mind to think of what to do next to avoid the challenge that is ahead of you. It will take many resets and saves to understand the mistakes you have taken. If you are starting out the Hitman series and looking for one to play for fun and understand how the game works, I recommend this game as it will start you off with challenges. I rate this 9.5/10 and hopefully the next Hitman will bring the challenges back rather than made a dupe of Absolution.			"

												A classic in every sense of the word. Originally released on the Super Nintendo by Mojang, Hitman 2 has seen many variations over the years. I'm happy to report that this is the definitive version, graphics rendered in beautiful 9000p resolution, breathtaking vistas running at an amazing 1500 fps, WOW. They've truly outdone themselves with this port.For those of you unfamiliar to the Hitman franchise, you play as Agent 3.14159265358979323846264338327950 or Agent Pi for short. In your daily life as an assassin of the silent variety, you must take out high value targets while keeping a stable family. Be warned, this is not a game for the casual gamer. The game is a unique blend of a golf simulator, a Sims game and a first person shooter. When you start out, you will find yourself failing. A lot. You'll either mess up a hit and find your family murdered when you come home (Funnily enough, this scenario actually has a whole spin off dedicated to it known as Max Payne, I might review that some day) or you'll complete all of your hits but neglect personal needs and die of starvation. If you can get past the learning curve, you'll find a rich and rewarding experience full of many twists and turns. In my playthrough, my third born son, Alexander IV was diagnosed with lukemia. I had to spend all of the money I acquired from hits to pay for his medication and neglect my own needs for the highest quality cocaine. Yes, this game often requires you to make the difficult decisions such as : My wife is draining my wallet dry but she cuts the time it takes for me to disguise in half, should I really get rid of her?All in all, this truly is a great game in every sense of the word. 1/10.

YouTube™ Video: Hitman 2: Silent Assassin Review Wide Screen 

			Views: 26,596		

			Greg Kasavin sits down to review the sequel to Hitman: Codename 47. ""Hitman 2 fixes virtually all of the problems of its predecessor and stands tall on its own merits as an outstanding action game.""		

An enjoyable Hitman/Murder Simulator experience. While not as good as Blood Money, which I consider the height of the series, its still an enjoyable game. While lacking some mechanics, stream lining, and smoothing out of the later games and being much more simplistic it still offers a core gameplay that I really enjoy and is why people play hitman games. Everything thats here is what makes Hitman games Hitman games and this is what Blood Money, Contracts, and I beleive the new 2016 Hitman game all build on (♥♥♥♥ Absolution).Unfortunately it can be fairly janky, it does not offer 1920x1080 as a display resolution though it did run fine on my Win7 64 Bit machine. The display resolution maybe fixable with mods but since the game ran fine I didn't bother. Occasionally NPCs will stand in the wrong place making it impossible to do something your supposed to and other stuff like NPCs animations not lining up and them doing weird funny stuff.  I did get a few crashes here and there especially when trying to alt tab, as was common with older games.  There is an inate jankyness to the AI and gameplay. Sneaking up behind someone is extremely difficult because you must be in ""sneak"" mode and AI really love to walk around. Sneak mode makes 47 move extremely slow so I did what I did when I was a kid and just ran up to people I wanted to strange while spamming the Fiber Wire, eventually you will fandangle yourself behind them and get the kill. Its easier just to use the 9mm silenced and just pop people unfortunately.Its still a fairly good game and has some interesting and fun points in the story. The games best if you play by the rules and try to be as stealthy as possible but there are points where you just can't stealth through a level or an area and have to shoot.. atleast thats what I found in my experience.  There are times you get caught doing something from someone who could not have possibly seen or heard you unless a glitch happened but for the most part you learn to adapt and overcome and save alot. You only get a certain number of saves per level so you can't just turtle your way through though. You are really free to accomplish the objectives by any means necessary and with any combination of tools at your disposal. You can load in with an M60 and blast everyone in the map or load in with only a fibre wire and kill the target with a scalpel while hes on an operating table after you shut all the lights off. Its really whatever you want to do and the world is atleast somewhat realistic in that people seem to go along with their work and day which makes the murder simulation that much funner. Accomplishing an objective with a silent assasin rating feels really good.   Another note, you having a ""base"" was really innovative for the time and is still cool and having the guns in your base actually plays a gameplay element in the late game. I don't think many other games did this. You could collect guns from levels and bring them to other levels. The guns you got would appear on the walls of your base and you could marvel at them at shoot the pigs and birds every time you got done with a mission using those new guns if you wanted. Its pretty similiar to Freedom Fighters , another great game, in that your base does play a role in parts of the game but to a lesser degree than FF. Both games came from the same devs so you see alot of crossover in sound and the way some things work.Hitman is one of my favorite series and I have played all of them. This ones definetly better than Absolution and Codename 47 but its not as good as Blood Money but its still pretty good. If you just want more Hitman after playing Blood Money and Contracts than this is worth a try. I can't say about the new 2016 Hitman game because I havn't tried it yet.I really wasn't a fan of the Jap missions though. Alot of the levels are just to big and its just to easy to shoot your way through it and at alot of points I had only a single path I felt. If you can get passed the mid game it does get better and has a decent finale.			"

												This game improves on all the things that annoyed me about the first one. Better graphics obviously, more freedom, a better map, more options for kills. But the biggest issue I had was the sneaking controls. You can either crawl INCREDIBLY slow towards someone which...will NEVER work. They always turn around before you're even a few inches away from where you started. Or you can do the sneak walk which is also...way too slow. It's pure luck trying to get a silent kill in this game. And the only way to get the ""Silent Assassin"" bonus is to not use your guns so....good luck with that! haha			"

												It's an alright game (bearing in mind how old it is); there's just a few things that are (very) annoying or otherwise enraging. Running is highly illegal but you walk/sneak/crouch so slowly it's like you're a 90 year old who lost their walker, which makes navigating the levels very, very tedious at times. Using silenced guns makes the game more like Star Wars with how slowly the bullets travel (Ninja tunnel level is most obvious). The AI are super touchy even without running, most interactions with guard AI result in either the guard dying or the alarm being raised and you restart or kill the whole level. This is on the easiest difficulty mind you. I got similar results in Blood Money, but that was on PROFESSIONAL for god's sake. Even then the AI was still more chilled, at least you can run without being immediately shot dead. One other thing that is driving me insane is this bug I keep getting, sometimes the game slows down a LOT in certain places, like I just get stuck or something.People say they love this game, it's the best, fanboi the hell out of it but I must be missing something.

												This was my first experience with Eidos Hitman series. I liked the concept and dived in when the game was on special. Fairly predictable on rails type of shooter. The suspect level indicator seems random, even when in disguise. Play stealth or rage with mixed results. The controls and cover system are basic and there are limited exploration incentives. Average graphics (2002).Score: 6/10 wait till its on special.			"

												Hitman AI puts me into a rage. Guards will shoot any running person immediately even if you’re a law-abiding citizen and want to jog around Nevsky Prospect. All guards may come to your spot after you shot the target with SVD while nobody saw you got there. But at the same time they don't give a sh!t when see a strange bold guy with SVD in left hand and silenced Beretta in the right.Here is my piece of advice. Forget about stealth. There is no stealth in here. Just take your AKS-74U (No, kid, it is not AK-47) and kill everyone you meet. Thanks to god you have plenty of health and ammo.			"

												This gem is a classic. One of the best stealth games to ever be released. Its very fun killing people in different ways, taking their clothes and disguising yourself, and finiding a different path through the level each playthrough. Very fun, Challenging, and has plenty of replayability... However, the value of this game is exremely degraded by the PC version. Maybe its just me and i should re download it, but one big problem is that it cuts about 1 in 3 cutscenes short on its own, without me pressing any buttons. This could of curse be due to damaged files in my download, but its worth mentioning. The biggest issue i noticed, is that the mouse sensitivity is absolutely insane. turning it on the maximum setting is STILL below normal on a regular game. And you pretty much have to turn it up to max to make it bearable. But then as soon as you pause the game or attempt to do anything in the menu, well lets just say good luch clicking stuff as your mouse flies across the screen at lightning speed. No clue if this is fixed by using a controller. This is still very much a good game, and i got it for i think $0.99 on a sale? this version of the game is very much worth picking up if you see it on sale. 5/10 for these issues. the original version from PS2: 8.5/10. If you can find a way to fix thee issues, id reccomend this game. If not, dont pick it up for anything more then $2.99.-Edit: i fixed almost every issue i had with this game. except the mouse sensitivity. i get that its to aim better since theres no ADS but good♥♥♥♥ is it annoying. playing around with console commands i had a little fun. enough to raise it up to a 6.5/10 for thr pc version. however i still cant recommend it because its $7 normally. i got it on sale for $0.99 or less. this version isnt worth more than $5. IF youre trying the whole franchise or a die hard fan then pick this up. otherwise im gonna tell you what everyone else in the negative sections says: pick up the superior blood money over this if you have $7 to spare, and youre interested in a stealth game or hitman game.

												This game is very buggy. I played on normal, got to the first level, and I failed it. I shot the delivery man, dragged his body away, and then stole his clothes. I put my weapons inside the groceries and tried to get inside. Suddenly, I'm attacked.All in all, this game needs some bugfixes to make it work the intended way. Even the cheats are bugged.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME UNLESS YOU ARE SOME WEIRD COLLECTOR. This game has not aged well, and the only reason I have not bought a later game is because my computer is a potato.			"

												Originally I had only played Blood Money and Absolution and those were fun in their own respects. I was made to believe that Hitman 2 was more akin to Blood Money before I purchased it. It is true in pen and paper but in execution it is not. Maps are huge in the best possible way but traveling them is pure torture.Guards attack you just for running in front of them which means you have to walk everywhere. That sounds acceptable but Hitman moves as fast as a boulder. Go look for the demo online before you purchase this game as everyone makes it sound awesome but I have had the worst experience with it so far. In Blood Money it was possible to get Silent Assassin in every mission without a guide but in this game you might need a guide just to avoid killing everyone in the level. Check out the demo first, you have been warned.			"

												Ok, this is better than Hitman 1, but it still has a long way to go. You can actually be creative about doing some of the missions, but there are still plenty of cases where there seems to only be one route to finish the level, and its just a matter of you executing it. It's not as bad as it was in the first game, but your ability to improvise is still limited. And there are new problems to face. Without the ability to (permanently) hide bodies or to have a briefcase to carry sniper rifles, you can get caught quite easily. A level early in the game where I got to use a sniper rifle to kill a target in a meeting was neat, but as soon as I picked up the rifle civilans freaked out and I had to kill them and some guards and take their clothes before continuing on to the target. If I had that rifle in a case so people didn't see it out in the open, I probably could have killed the target and nobody else. At least you don't get into gunfights as often, though if a body of someone you killed is found, expect to be spotted and attacked quite quickly.The developers learned from the first game, but this game still has its issues. For that, I can't give it a ""yes"" recommendation. But it is a better made assassin game that you can actually have some fun with. However, I still believe that Blood Money is what you really ought to be playing if you want to play a Hitman game.			"

												I hate it. I hate it so much. #MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS, STOP CRYING#After buying the collection for 85% or so off and buying Contracts I wanted to play through the whole series.But Hitman 2 just made it so hard. You can't run, disguises are practically useless (you get shot at even with clothes that completely cover your body, which doesn't make sense) and sooner or later one just ends up killing everyone just because the game pees one off completely. The plot istn't that great (at some place in the story they just say ""F**k Vittorio"" just to pull him out of the ars€ again), nope, even that is sh!te. The first two, three levels are somewhat fun, although you figure out the best way so quickly for them, but the rest are just ars€ levels. The only reason I beat the game was because I needed that feeling of completion.To make it clear, I like Hitman games, and I liked the first one, so the game being dated is not the problem. This game just plain sucks. Unless you are interested in the plot (which is, again, ars€), skip it and play any other game from the series.			"

The game is ignoring my framerate limit of 180 FPS regardless, so as I learned today, it's possible to actually have a game run TOO well.Congrats to my R9 280 for being so powerful that it broke the game. :\			"

Maybe back in the era the game was released, noticing how much the enemies are aware of you would have been more intuitive, but these days, we rely on body language and HUD notifications.

												Full Review: http://dagondogs.com/2016/11/09/killing-time-part-2-hitman-2-initial-impressions/TL;DR:The potential of the Hitman series becomes more visible with Hitman 2. The gameplay mechanics are improved over the first game to accommodate the type of gameplay most people expect from the series. Agent 47, while still stiff, controls a lot better. Plus, the production quality of the game is a huge leap forward with better voice-acting and better graphics. Yet, the game still feels very limited, the AI is too paranoid and scripted, and the levels themselves are still rather basic. Considering how it also took a fair amount of tweaking to even get the game to work, I say it's not worth your time.			"

												After messing around with Hitman 2 a little bit these are my impressions.The game that I'm comparing this to are the splinter cell games which I think are one of the best stealth games out there right now. I bought hitman thinking that it would be just as fun and while hitman does have some charm. Being able to pick up the outfits of other people and unique ways to fight people.  It really lacks in the coolest capicitys of stealth in my opinion and there are no rpg elements at all including currency and so I felt like other than a better ranking there was no real reason to complete objectives.

												Great game, to just boot up and have some bloody good fun. It was not only a sharp eye for me to discover this hidden masterpiece but it sure is fantastic, when you apply the resolution fix to the game.The gameplay is very unqiue and you can do many, cool and interesting things to make it change completely from aggressive to complete stealth. And the story plays well, but doesn't always lead in a good direction as it gets lost most of the time, with the slow and not so constructional cutscenes.Other then that, it is a absolute masterpiece to play, and is all round fun for a classic.

A fun game where you have the choice of sneaking up a strangling a unsuspecting guard, or running in guns blazing and leaving no man left alive. The mission variety is nice and each one gives you plenty of options to choose from like wether to steal a delivery mans uniform to sneak in or kill a guard whose outside taking a ♥♥♥♥ and take his uniform.

Which brings me to my giant problem, The disguise system, You dress as a soldier and walk near a soldier, Not even near and the soldier will pound lead into you. Thank god there is a way to avoid this problem. Just don't look at them and walk by. By their perspective you just want them to look at your barcode. If there was not a solution for this system this game is a Big fat ♥♥♥ NO. But thank god there is. This is way worth 7 dollars, a fantastic game in the trilogy			"

Also, you can save mid-mission now!So yeah, if you're willing to mess with the game just a bit to get it working, it's pretty good.			"

												What can i say about this masterpiece? Not as good as contracts (my favorite) But damn is it close. The story of this one though is easily the most intriguing and interesting. The gameplay is really fun and super difficult at times. Which brings me to my giant problem, The disguise system, You dress as a soldier and walk near a soldier, Not even near and the soldier will pound lead into you. Thank god there is a way to avoid this problem. Just don't look at them and walk by. By their perspective you just want them to look at your barcode. If there was not a solution for this system this game is a Big fat ♥♥♥ NO. But thank god there is. This is way worth 7 dollars, a fantastic game in the trilogy			"

												Really fun stealth game that holds up well with the original hitman. My only gripe with the game is the difficulty of it. In hitman codename 47, each mission was incredibly challenging even on regular difficulty. A couple of bullets and you were done for. In this game, normal difficulty is insanly easy. Some missions I could not sneak for a second and beat with ease. Your character has much more health and can take what seems like dozens of bullets before he dies. Therefore, if you want an experience similar to the original game, I recommend you play on one of the more challenging difficulties.			"

												Hitman 2 is a direct sequal to the original Hitman, after the events of the original game Agent 47 faked his own death and unofficially resigned from the ICA. For some time he has live a reclusive life as a gardener at a church in Sicily, Italy. Agent 47, tried to make amends to what he has done in the past by donating his blood money to the church and seeking guidence and forgiveness from the priest of the church, Father Vittorio. Despite 47's previous occupation of being an assassin, the good priest knows 47 is good at heart and assurs him that there is a place for him in the next life. Life at the church seem all well until a mysterious group of gun men came and abductted Vittorio. Leaving behind a ransom note for 47 to read, he knows the only way to find his friend is with the help of the ICA. Which means he has to reactivate his membership as a hired assassin once more. The ICA agrees to help 47's search for the priest in exchange for him to carry out orders requested by a client. During Agent 47's travels he will eventually learn that the man who abdupted the priest is someone who holds a serious grudge towards him, The sequal is a big improvement over the original game with not just slightly improved graphics but improved controls for movement and weapon firing. In this game the compass is intact to the screen rather than being an item to buy, the sneaking mode is improved, the map labels enemy locations as well as objective marks, and best of all you are finally able to do mid level saves in case you mess up on the mission! This was also the first hitman game to have the progress of collecting weapons out on the field. Which this leads to players being able to obtain newer weapons to use in later levels as well as being able to used these obtained weapons for previously played levels. Overrall, this is one of the best sequals to be superior towards the original and was the game that helped make Hitman a more well received franchise. A must play game for any third person shooter/stealth game fans.			"

												Better than the first game, I'll give it that! Definitely not on the same level as Blood Money in my opinion, but it was still a relatively good game.Graphics: Can't say too much about this, given it was released in 2002. I will say that many of the environments looked very plain and were not too pleasing to look at. Most of the levels used the same color palette for the whole level (all white for snow, all yellow for desert, all gray for city) and it just got boring after a while. Story: Again, can't expect too much from a Hitman game in terms of story. 47 was just as deadpan as always, but it seemed like they actually attempted to create some other characters and give them lines. Unfortunately, the lines were pretty horribly delivered and were downright comical at times, which was an awful contrast to 47's brooding attitude. The story itself seemed pretty straightforward: Rejoin the agency to save a friend, kill this guy, kill that guy, oh now there's this other guy, travel the world killing everybody, finally get your friend back at the end after slaughtering everyone. Like I said, nothing too special.Level Design: Coming from playing Blood Money, I was expecting some great level design out of these developers. While I praised Blood Money for having large levels, I think this game suffers from levels that are either too large or too small. There might've been 2 or 3 of the 21 levels that were decently sized and required a good amount of planning, but the rest were either so ridiculously big that I got lost constantly, or so small that I finished the level in a good 5 minutes on the first try. There was simply too much variation in the level design, which made it hard to enjoy the game. Gameplay: Also, I found there was a lot of guesswork to be had in this game. Blood Money did a good job of showing you certain ways to complete the level, or slightly guiding you in the right direction. This game, I found, would throw you in an environment where there was often one easy way to get things done, but that easy way was extremely cryptic and frustrating. And every other way to complete the level is near impossible. Again, just a lot of inconsistencies. Aside from that, it's general Hitman gameplay, which is clunky, but good.Overall, it's a Hitman game, which I've come to discover is generally a good thing: it usually entails large and complex levels, good sneaking, interesting environments, and entertaining gunplay. This game just barely fell short on just about everything. I still recommend it for anyone who enjoys sneaking games, but I would definitely say that Blood Money beats this game in just about every aspect. Not too bad, 7/10			"

												This game spends 95% of its length following 47 on what is basically a round-about rescue mission.  None of the Ort-Meyer clone plot shows up until the very end.  In my opinion that part of the Hitman mythology is the most interesting. Otherwise, the Hitman series is just an assassination/murder simulator.Gameplay is tight, the controls work smoothly, the missions are well designed but VERY short. The first time you play this game you might spend a lot of time running around with no idea where to go (especially in the jungle mission). However, on your second playthrough, after you've figured out what needs to be done where, almost every mission can be finished in less than 7 minutes as you make beelines to all your objectives.

												When I got this game for free, I was pretty excited. A great game series that I'd never played before. After numerous crashes, I got the game to start. When it started, I'll admit, I was impressed. 1080p 4K graphics, and gameplay movement to rival Black Ops 3. Except for the lack of jumping. And once i got started shooting losers, I was impressed at how realistically small the weapons were. Really made me feel like Shrek. And once I got and AK, it was CS 1.6 all over again. The nostalgia flowed over me like the perfect water textures. And the mechanic to strip dead people and drag them around, revolutionary. All in all, 10/10 GOTY 2016.

												I'm going to keep this simple because this is an old title. This game is hands down in my top three most satisfying titles to have beaten vanilla, no cheats etc. I'm not even sure if there are cheats for this anyways.This is a game for someone who actually has to think, plan, and fail and test their own patience. So if you're like I was when I was 14 and you quit playing Half-Life 1 for a month because you don't notice the switch next to an elevator, this game will make you throw kittens off a 3rd story balcony by the time you get to the second level.Besides that, this game can be a little wierd at times if you just walk in the place guns blazing. Sometimes guns send bodies hurling around like they're paper weights. However, there's nothing more satisfying than a clean kill with the disguised walk back where everyone's like WTF just happened?There's multiple routes to solve problems, each level presenting options to completely master the art of assasination or completely butcher any sense of elegance and go from a perfect execution to a ""F*ck it, you're all dead and I'm done with this level."" Mindset, if of course you're close enough to your exit.For it's time, this game goes down in my book as a masterpiece. I've beaten at least twice already and I bought it on steam because I know its going to take me months to beat all over again. There's times where I play a level once and don't play the game for a few days or a week. There's times I spend three hours failing at one level. But damn, does it feel good when you nail this SOB. If you have patience and a desire for a strategic challenge that's well rounded and extremely satisfying, get this game. It's worth every penny and will have you longing for more even after you've beaten it. Awesome replay value in my opinion. Unless of course you're a walkthrough ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												Hitman 2 is by far my favorite hitman i nave played yet. I have completed all the hitman games except blood money , blood money is a lot of people's favorite and it might be better than silent assassin i not sure , but as i have not completed blood money siilent assassin is an amazing and i would go as far to say that it is one of my favorite games of all time. If you are all about graphics and hate old games then go else where , but if you love the orignals of game series and you respect them for what they are then BUY THIS RIGHT NOW . I can put in to words how amazing this game is , now some people may be put off by the graphics and the pure difficulty of this game. If you use the map correctly it is not that hard at all. If you have heard this game is buggy its really not. It can be a bit on the funny side , but there are no bugs that make this title called buggy. I have completed silent assassin twice now i first done it on the playstation 2 and i thought it was great , but it was visually awul , but since i have got into pc gaming lately i thought i would pick this game up again on steam and i have to say this was the best decision i have ever made in my life. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE pick this game up it is truely amazing and changed gaming for everyone and everything , thank you for reading.			"

												Great game, to just boot up and have some bloody good fun. It was not only a sharp eye for me to discover this hidden masterpiece but it sure is fantastic, when you apply the resolution fix to the game.The gameplay is very unqiue and you can do many, cool and interesting things to make it change completely from aggressive to complete stealth. And the story plays well, but doesn't always lead in a good direction as it gets lost most of the time, with the slow and not so constructional cutscenes.Other then that, it is a absolute masterpiece to play, and is all round fun for a classic. They should be thinking of remastering this game, as it is in everyone's bucket list to do so.10/10			"

												I remember when I first played the demo of this game on my  laptop I bought the retail copy of this game at around the summer of 2010 and started playing around with it, after that I became ""utterly"" addicted after playing the other missions than that of the demo's mission, this game takes a lot of thinking, a lot of planning and a lot use of stealth, hardest mission? I would say ""At The Gates"".			"

												I like slow, tense games, ones where one shot can kill you and so the jeopardy remains constantly high throughout. Hidden & Dangerous 2 is a great example of this sort of thing. Hitman 2 doesn't quite have it. The creeping about hardly seems worth the bother or the engagement required since what's the pay-off? You're not defeating Nazism. Perhaps if there was a Hitman 3, where you get take out TV Chefs, I'd invest the time.			"

												I find it difficult to review this game. When I started playing it I got caught from the very beginning by the attention to details on almost everything. Some settings (mostly in Russia and Japan) are imprinted in my mind as realistic and gorgeous they were. Game plot is really nice and intriguing, guards AI feels far, far more human than the first entry of the series and sniping is not easy anymore because now you have breath simulation while aiming. Sadly they enabled (with certain limits) in-mission savegames but I strongly suggest you not to use them, reloading a savegame just ruins the atmosphere. Game graphic is top notch for a 2002 game, music is extremely good too (not to mention that is also 100% fitting). Just to let you realize how good this game is, when I completed the last mission I felt sad because it was finished and I wanted more, and more... strongly suggested to anyone, a must have.			"

												It might be a bit hard to settle into if you're only used to the more recent Hitman games, but Silent Assassin is the best in the series for me. There's a lot of variety in the levels; some are small while others are large and complex, and between the varied locations and the game's engaging story, it's oh-so-satisfying to off each of the targets. Jesper Kyd, the composer for the game's soundtrack, is at his absolute best and makes every mission totally immersive, even with the game's dated visuals. Strongly recommended, but know what you're getting into; some parts of the game take patience, and aren't as easy as the sequels. Even still, it's a large step up from the original game. Give it a shot.			"

Although the rest of the games do not follow this chronologically, contracts if im not mistaken is right before absolution while bloodmoney is last chronologically just play them all you will see what I mean.Anyways as for this game yes the newer ones improved on gameplay mechanics especially absolution, but I just couldnt get over the plot and how amazing the missions were in this game.Play it, so what if its over 10 years old you can custom resolution it to your new monitor and it wont look that bad, but the story and gameplay more then makes up for it.

												Amazing game, this Hitman is what made the franchise. Best in the series (Blood Money is second for me, but not by much) Had it on the PS2 played the ♥♥♥♥ out of it and easily had 100+ hours into it. The reason why I love this game so much is that it gives 47 a more human side, and a conflicted hero feel. The soundtrack is amazing, God bless Jesper Kyd. (If only he'd do the newest installments.)You can tell David Bateson is really feeling 47's situation, and voices him amazingly in this game. (I think he said H2:SA was his favorite.)Very interesting and difficult contracts to complete.The Silverballers really pack a punch. (ragdoll physics are out of this world sometimes.)Gameplay is addictive, the atmosphere is amazing.Overall this is one of my favorite games of all time.			"

The game starts where your in a church helping your friend which starts the game of when he gets kidnapped and brings 47 back to his old friend dianna from the agency where you follow ot contracts in order to recieve information about your friend.

												Agent 47 have return n this perfect continuation.The game comprises more than 20 missions. Though the settings and the details of each mission are different, most all of them share some basic goals: getting in, eliminating a key target, and getting out. How you meet your objective is up to you, whether by guile and stealth or by brute force, and most missions are cleverly designed to have at least several viable, even intuitive solutions.One of the big differences between Hitman 2 and its predecessor is that a forceful approach is much more viable in the sequel. At the normal difficulty setting, it's in fact much easier, and much faster, to just blast your way through most missions.For me perfect return of out bold friend with his so friendly face.			"

												Mr. 47 is back (well, it was back some years ago, back in 2002)... with a retired 47 who goes back to his old life because some circumstances at the beginning of the game. Mission mechanics are improved from its predecessor, now you have an assassin rating for each of the missions you complete; as in the previous game you can complete mission in more than 1 way; you choose whether to get start the mission and pop everyone and everything you see (you can shoot rats or pigs too XD) or go for full stealth and achieve the ultimate assassin rating - ""Silent Assassin"". If you want to make this game really interesting, complete all missions getting the Silent Assassin rating; make the game experience even better, because you have to time your moves, avoid exposure and so much more. I really had a blast beating the game getting this rating. Graphics are from some while back, but they look better than the first game. The Orchestral music and different music themes through the game add even more to the experience. An oldie but a good one!... I really recommend it...			"

It really seems like a great PC version of the game, and the gameplay is good, just a bit stiff since it is a bit dated. The story is great, and I would rather not spoil. The game lets you play stealthily and non-stealthily. Unfortunately I found the disguise system to be broken and didn't work right. Thankfully the music is absolutely stunning in this game. The game is also quite lenghty. I got this for free when it was some SquareEnix anniversary, and I am glad I did, because this game is a blast.

												If there is a game that ever made a franchise, this is it. Hitman Codename 47 was the first, Silent Assassin was what made the franchise great with vastly improved AI, rating systems, graphics and more. Blood Money took what was built in Silent Assassin to the next level. Travel across the world as a bald assassin and kill people the way you want it, fireman's axe, Katana or MP5. Still an excellent game despite it's age.			"

												Pretty fun action adventure third person shooter. As a stealth game, though, brutally challenging and unfair at times. It seems there aren't many routes to take for each target, since the only personnel that you can subdue discreetly will be doing something while standing still in one place (like urinating), and they take time and patience to reach unnoticed. The routes to stealthily completing a mission are very strict, and you'll have to stick to them if you wish to be able to do any mission stealthy.As a shooter game though, still challenging, but relatively fair and also lots of fun.Ragdoll physics make it fun to thin the opposition, though the only criticism I have about it is that bullets are way too slow. It takes about a second for just about any bullet in the game to cross 50 meters.			"

												When I got this game for free, I was pretty excited. A great game series that I'd never played before. After numerous crashes, I got the game to start. When it started, I'll admit, I was impressed. 1080p 4K graphics, and gameplay movement to rival Black Ops 3. Except for the lack of jumping. And once i got started shooting losers, I was impressed at how realistically small the weapons were. Really made me feel like Shrek. And once I got and AK, it was CS 1.6 all over again. The nostalgia flowed over me like the perfect water textures. And the mechanic to strip dead people and drag them around, revolutionary. All in all, 10/10 GOTY 2016. Please dont forget to leaf a like and shrubscribe. HISSSSSSSSS			"

												I got this game through a special promo code few days back even though I was not a hitman fan nor had I ever played the games. This game made me love the hitman franchise. There were missions where I ended up killing all people. There are different kind of nicknames you get once you finish the missions like psychopath, cleaner, professional, mass murderer. I ended up getting psychopath and mass murderer in most of the missions. The graphics are kinda hard to recongnize as the graphics are at the standard of 2006+ games even though it's a 2002 game. Gonna try playing this in hard mode with killing as least people as possible			"

												A typical hitman game a bit harder than blood money, if you got silent assassin rank with no walkthrough you have my respect. 47 The bald guy is so damn cold but a bit softer in this game.If your new to hitman it's a stealth game leaning on disguise over shadows unlike blood money the bad guys (or good whatever) are far more paranoid and smart , this can be frustrating ! But you can just go in there and shoot the place up (; you can choose how stealthy you want to be based on your tolerance levels but you may want to play through levels a bunch of times to make the most of them and learn the most fun strategies , a important thing to know is you only get 7 saves on normal and less on harder modes , this is because the game is really trying to turn you into a REAL hitman , you screw up you screw up, you don't have the amazing luck of reloading saves a min before, some players dislike this but give this game a chance , on sale it's only like the price of a starbucks xD and once you get into it's unquie and somehow realstic game play you'll want to play more hitmen games!, trust me..I myself admit only just been getting into hitman and blood money so far is my fav I highly recommend you get that one if you enjoy this one (= You may have also played this game on ps2 by in the day!

												I find it difficult to review this game. When I started playing it I got caught from the very beginning by the attention to details on almost everything. Some settings (mostly in Russia and Japan) are imprinted in my mind as realistic and gorgeous they were. Game plot is really nice and intriguing, guards AI feels far, far more human than the first entry of the series and sniping is not easy anymore because now you have breath simulation while aiming. Sadly they enabled (with certain limits) in-mission savegames but I strongly suggest you not to use them, reloading a savegame just ruins the atmosphere. Game graphic is top notch for a 2002 game, music is extremely good too (not to mention that is also 100% fitting). Just to let you realize how good this game is, when I completed the last mission I felt sad because it was finished and I wanted more, and more... strongly suggested to anyone, a must have.			"

												This was probably the first hitman game you played.  As Codename 47 was not well recieved at the time, and a pc only release.  The basic premise is try to infiltrate areas. Track your hit, figure how to take them down while attracting the least amount of attention.  Some levels are more open then others. The ones that are have numerous ways to to take out your target.The graphics are far better then thier console counterparts, and the looks still pleasing for a game from 2002.The controls are solid and was a real step up from numpad movement on Codename 47Ochreastal scores are tense, the blending of moods and atmosphere makes every moment feel nerve wracking as you sneak up behind your target with your fiberwire pulled ready to pounce and drag your victim away to take his clothes.The gameplay here was far more refined and stealth encouraged making every silent assasin rank thrilling to behold as you leave unheard and unseen.  This sheer joy is occasionally hampered by Japan and the middle east. These areas are hard and require tight timimg, This again does feed right back into the joy of firguring out what boils down to a multiple  choice puzzle. Changing disquises, posioning drinks, turning off the power, fake a fire, a deadly use of guns.  All as satisfying as they sound.If you love stealth. This is a must have along with all the other titles, (excluding the newest one, and codename 47 as it is not as fleshed out from here on out.)The only real issuies is jumpy AI that sometimes just goes bananas for no reason or stop their patrols and just stand somewhere you really need to go.All in all. This was just a blip compared to what would culminate in blood money. A deadly good game.			"

												This is the first hitman game I have ever played. It was in 2006, more than 3 years after it has been released, I still got very addicted. Later, I play every hitman games, and even pre-purchased absolution, and I must say that ""hitman 2: Silent Assassin"" is the most revolutionary, the most intense, deepest, and thus the most successful game of the series. It corrects most of the mistakes that the first hitman ""codename 47"" has, and adds a lot of successful features such as the diversity approach to complete the mission, the alert system that enalbes the enemy to notice you even after you change your cloth(in hitman: codename 47 as long as you change the cloth, you wouldn't be noticed by enemy), and these features shine through hitman 3 ""contracts"" and 4 ""blood money"". Therefore, this game is also the foundation of successful the sequels, especially blood money. Plus, the visual effect is amazing back in 2002, and the music delivers more richer atmosphere to the game that it really makes the play get into the game, get into the world of 47. Unfortunately, absolution somehow throws out some very essential features. I hope IO and its new parent company Square Enix would fix it and combine the best of old hitman(1-4) and absolution to make the 6th hitman game much better!			"

												A good starting point for the Hitman  chronicles. No, its not great. Yes its old, graphics are even older. Third person controls like tank. I could go on with the things wrong with this game. But I won’t. Too many people are critics. Too many of those critics are on Steam. However, it is a memorable game. For its story of a guilt ridden killer trying to find redemption and for its unique and challenging missions. The levels are vast and extremely open ended with more than one way to take out your target. You could play the same mission differently a dozen times. If you’ve played Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid or Thief you owe it to yourself to try out Hitman 2: Silent Assassin. No its not as refined or as classy as Blood Money but it is a decent start. For that I’d recommend it. "

												I like slow, tense games, ones where one shot can kill you and so the jeopardy remains constantly high throughout. Hidden & Dangerous 2 is a great example of this sort of thing. Hitman 2 doesn't quite have it. The creeping about hardly seems worth the bother or the engagement required since what's the pay-off? You're not defeating Nazism. Perhaps if there was a Hitman 3, where you get take out TV Chefs, I'd invest the time.			"

Game plot is really nice and intriguing, guards AI feels far, far more human than the first entry of the series and sniping is not easy anymore because now you have breath simulation while aiming. Sadly they enabled (with certain limits) in-mission savegames but I strongly suggest you not to use them, reloading a savegame just ruins the atmosphere. Game graphic is top notch for a 2002 game, music is extremely good too (not to mention that is also 100% fitting). Just to let you realize how good this game is, when I completed the last mission I felt sad because it was finished and I wanted more, and more... strongly suggested to anyone, a must have.			"

												I'm going to keep this simple because this is an old title. This game is hands down in my top three most satisfying titles to have beaten vanilla, no cheats etc. I'm not even sure if there are cheats for this anyways.This is a game for someone who actually has to think, plan, and fail and test their own patience. So if you're like I was when I was 14 and you quit playing Half-Life 1 for a month because you don't notice the switch next to an elevator, this game will make you throw kittens off a 3rd story balcony by the time you get to the second level.Besides that, this game can be a little wierd at times if you just walk in the place guns blazing. Sometimes guns send bodies hurling around like they're paper weights. However, there's nothing more satisfying than a clean kill with the disguised walk back where everyone's like WTF just happened?There's multiple routes to solve problems, each level presenting options to completely master the art of assasination or completely butcher any sense of elegance and go from a perfect execution to a ""F*ck it, you're all dead and I'm done with this level."" Mindset, if of course you're close enough to your exit.For it's time, this game goes down in my book as a masterpiece. I've beaten at least twice already and I bought it on steam because I know its going to take me months to beat all over again. There's times where I play a level once and don't play the game for a few days or a week. There's times I spend three hours failing at one level. But damn, does it feel good when you nail this SOB. If you have patience and a desire for a strategic challenge that's well rounded and extremely satisfying, get this game. It's worth every penny and will have you longing for more even after you've beaten it. Awesome replay value in my opinion. Unless of course you're a walkthrough ♥♥♥♥♥.			"

												A classic Hitman game that will never die and stay true to it's Hitman meaning. A stealth action game where you have to take out your targets. The fun part in that is you can stealthy take out your targets or you can go gun-blazing on everyone and everything. The way you carry out the mission is entirely up to you. My review of this game:Plot: 10/10Atmosphere: 20/10Voice Acting: 1000/10 David Bateson is one of my favorite voice actors! The voice actor who voiced Diana is phenomenal too! :)Weapons: 10000/10 Really fun weapons to use on the levels! (Especially the levels where you can go gun-blazing! >:D)Music: 50000/10 OMG! The music on this game with that Orchestra, kudos to them! (claps in honor of that beautiful music)This game is a definite must-have for any gamer who's into Stealth Action!			"

												It might be a bit hard to settle into if you're only used to the more recent Hitman games, but Silent Assassin is the best in the series for me. There's a lot of variety in the levels; some are small while others are large and complex, and between the varied locations and the game's engaging story, it's oh-so-satisfying to off each of the targets. Jesper Kyd, the composer for the game's soundtrack, is at his absolute best and makes every mission totally immersive, even with the game's dated visuals. Strongly recommended, but know what you're getting into; some parts of the game take patience, and aren't as easy as the sequels. Even still, it's a large step up from the original game. Give it a shot.			"

												In my opinion the best Hitman game. Yes, sir. It is fare more difficult, and is more stealth rather than shooting oriented. A true assassin's game.The game is quite long and there are many ways to perform a contract.So you can replay the game without getting bored. And it's cheap, what more do you want?			"

												An all around improvement after Hitman: Codename 47. Controls are more fluid and easy to have a hold on. A more comprehensible story with far more lore, larger levels, more interesting targets and level-design, better voice-acting and a better soundtrack, less glitchy physics, and a newer, shinier graphics engine.47 is back, and he's going to do what he does best.+ Large levels+ Many ways to kill your target(s)+ Variety of firearms+ Plethora of melee weapons+ Tons of disguises+ Easter eggs+ Voice-acting+ Soundtrack+ Plot+ Level-design+ Challenging stealth game- Large levels can be overwhelming at first- Not welcoming to newcomers- Trying to get the Silent Assassin rank can be a pain in the @ss.- Getting noticed SUCKS- Clipping issues- Ragdoll glitches sometimes cause bodies to get noticed, even after hiding them.

												Dated in a few areas but it still holds up and it's still a great stealth game. I love the freedom the game gives you each mission to take out your target. Its also one of the most satisfying games to beat because of how difficult it is. The limited times you can save during missions makes the game so intense. The ai is brutal in this game spotting you from a mile away it can feel unfair at times and the pace of the game is very slow because you cannot run while in disguise or you will be detected so a lot of patience is needed to play this game. The stealth mechanics feel clunky and dated now. The level design is great and memorable. The soundtrack and sound que's during gameplay are perfect and are masterfully done. Play it if you have the patience for it.8/10 (Great)			"

												My favorite assassin/stealth game ever made period.This game is hard and you can crank up the difficulty alot. Not only that you can complete the missions in different ways. The Hitman series of games truly are an art and something that stands out compared to the other stealth games out there.This game is unique and if you want a challenge go for it! I dare you complete this game on the hardest difficulty.			"

												Hitman 2 is probably my favorite Hitman game and one of my favorite games of all time.After the events of the 1st game, 47 retires and starts to work as gardener of a sicilian church. The priest, which is a good friend of 47, gets kidnapped and 47 has to return to assassination business to finance the search for his friend.Right out of the gates, h2 plays much smoother than c47. Movement controls are more basic, standard action game controls, camera angle is fixed and you can pause the game while using inventory. There's also in-game saving. Overall the game feels more modern with some minor changes and polishing.The big changes on the other hand are a bit more controversial. Now instead of getting money for successful hits, here we have a rating system... or an early version of it. You know how it goes: to achieve better ranks you must be unseen, no innocents killed, no alerts etc. You also have sedative to knock out innocents and to steal their clothes and that way avoid penalties. But there seem to be some problems with the system. You are allowed to waste only one bullet to achieve SA. And that bullet must hit the head of your target. If you kill with a bodyshot (n00b :D) you wont get SA because..? The system is also very limiting. I've found myself in situations where I planned my hit like a mastermind, killed my target like a ninja, totally useen. Nobody had an idea that I even was there at all -> professional. Seems like my sniper round didn't quite make it to the target's head, but his neck = no SA. Or maybe one guard raised his eyebrows too much when I walked past in my disguise = close encounter. Afterall, getting SA is very unrewarding since you achieve a firearm, that you must not use when trying to achieve SA. Really?Also an other controversial update imo is the change with the AI. Previously they used to be calm until you did something obviously criminal in their sights. Now, you're never safe. Even when you wear right clothes in right places, these guys might still freak out for things like running, standing still for too long, or whatever. The AI is totally evil. It's a good thing because it adds some great tension to the game. You feel like someone is constantly watching you, and you need to act calm and natural, like a real assassin, while blending to crowd. Howewer, when replaying, it makes things very tedious, since you can't run. It's really double-edged, I still can't decide do I like it or not.As for the actual levels. This is the longest and most varied game in the series. There are six countries to visit and each of them has different atmosphere in terms of music, visuals, level design, sensitivity of AI, etc. For example Russia levels could easily be from some cold war spy movie. Sicily reminds me of Godfather (obviously) with very private atmosphere and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guards. Malaysia is the most relaxing stage (still not a tourist resort for sure) with a quiet office building as the setting, followed by Afganistan, where you get a feeling that everyone wants you to die. India felt also a bit more relaxing than the others with more unsystematic security. Hardest and probably the worst stage has to be Japan. The first and last missions are very claustrophobic mansions, with very little freedom of choice, and two filler missions between them, where you must wander through snowy desert, with sniper towers everywhere and disguises serve no purpose. Most missions are more developed here than they were in c47, and there are less garbage levels. Some of favorites are Anathema, Invitation to a Party, Basement Killing and Terminal Hospitality. There are many favorites to mention, but these came to my mind.Imo h2 is despite all its flaws, the best that the series has to offer. It's hard, entertaining, atmospheric, grim and everything I like about this series. Once you find out the tricks with the AI, it isn't that hard to get into. The tension alone with no hide-a-body-boxes, closets, slow sneaking, slow lockpicking and paranoid AI is my reason to prefer this over the otherwise superior Blood Money. There aren't any accidents or ""safe ways"" to get SA. Also, when you play it more, it becomes even deeper, since it's fun as hell to find speedrun/glitch ways and give yourself certain challenges while replaying. This game is kind of an unpolished diamond, which might seem crappy at the first sight, but will become the most awesome game ever once you'll learn it.			"
