												Enjoy musical immersion like no other as your favorite artists attempt to murder you.Beat Hazard is one of the better bullet hell space shooters I've played, with fluid controls that really need no explanation. Jumping right in, you'll probably die horribly right out of the gate, but the game has a perk and progression feature that allows you to enhance your abilities as you go along.There are also in-game power-ups, which enhance the ever-important score multiplier, upgrade your weapons, and give you lovely bombs to destroy entire screens of swarming enemy ships. There's even a power-up that will increase the volume of the music you select.And that, the music, is the real draw of games like this, that depends on your personal investment with your music library to add an additional level of investment on the part of the player. While this may feel somewhat emotionally manipulative at times, I'm not going to knock the game for tricking me into enjoying it.Levels seem to match up to the music you're playing if you squint a bit. There's also a photosensitive seizure warning included at the start of the game, and with all the bright flashing colors and neon streaks of light firing everywhere, that's an appropriate warning. The visuals themselves may not be to your personal taste, though they're executed well, with a decent variety of different enemy types to shoot down.Ultimately, Beat Hazard fulfills a need I didn't even know I had; the need to murder waves of enemies while Sara Bareilles croons at me to say I'm sorry for what I've done. I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry. Please stop sending these giant worm monsters after me.			"

												Surprisingly entertaining and enchanting game! Also - it's one of the most beautiful games I've seen - in its own way. I absolutely love it! Consider it a creative way of listening to your music - or a way of falling into some sort of trance :P The shadow missions with the different ships are also loads of fun!Only downside is that you can't connect it to your spotify account, so I had to download all the songs I wanted to play :)			"

												Beat Hazard (along with the DLC) is one of the few games that I fully appreciate. It's definitely up there as far as quality twin-stick shooters go. There are just so many things that make this game good.Play your own music - This was the very first 'play your own music' game that I got on Steam. It's not the most special feature on Beat Hazard but it's the main reason I enjoyed it as a twin-stick shooter. I don't have a lot of experience in the genre so being able to play on my own pace depending on the song used was a major positive factor for me.Difficulty Adjustment - The difficulty is easily adjustable in a multitude of ways. You have your conventional difficulty settings (easy, etc, etc). Then you have visual intensity which to me is somewhat of a visual handicap (with benefits of course). Two other ways to adjust difficulty would be by picking songs with varied intensities or by playing with the new DLC content which adds ship customization complete with stats. In a game with this many options, it won't matter what skill level you are within the genre. It's still very possible to feel a small sense of accomplishment even as a casual player.Music Discovery - In this day and age, I no longer listen to the radio unless I'm really bored while driving from location A to B. Beat Hazard allows you to play while listening to various radio stations (custom or default added). In all honesty, I have discovered a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of music during the few months that I have been really into Beat Hazard.There's a lot more things that make Beat Hazard a wonderful game. For the sake of simplicity, I merely listed 3 of my favorite reasons.10/10It's nearly impossible to get bored in this game.			"

												The best music based game on Steam by far. Control your ship while blasting through waves of other ships, as well as a crap ton of asteroids and a decent variety of bosses. The later difficulties are likened to bullet hell style gameplay, however the hitbox of your ship is not small enough to carefully manuveur through the tiniest of gaps. Not that you'll be able to see those gaps anyway, with the intensity cranked all the way up to 300%. A decent achievement list and gameplay to keep you going for hours. A great game for all to enjoy.			"

												This game is freakin' addictive. When you combine twin-stick shooter mechanics with intense music-driven gameplay, you get Beat Hazard. Everything from the explosions to the type of enemies you encounter are all affected by the beat of the music. There's more to it as well. You can collect power-ups, get multipliers to increase your score and, of course, you can use your own music (You have to buy iTunes support, but it's only a dollar, so literally a small price to pay). You can also rank up and get perks that can give you a leg-up to shooting up the leaderboards. And then there's the DLC (Ultra and Shadow Operations) which add new ships, enemies, missions (getting [x] amount of points or completing [x] amount of songs on a certain difficulty) and even Steam Workshop support, letting you download even more ships and missions. Pausing's a little weird, however; with an Xbox 360 controller you have to press both Start and Back to pause. Other than that, this is easily one of the best music-driven games I've played. If you're tired of Audiosurf and want something different, this is for you.A word of warning, however: There are LOTS of flashing lights and visuals in this game (it even warns you when you start the game). So if you suffer for photosensitive seizures or the like, then you should avoid this game (Then again, if you suffer from such a condition, you shouldn't be playing games in the first place).			"

												I have played Audiosurf for a long time and I was not sure if Beat Hazard was a game that could stand out for me as a music-based game. I finally decided to give Beat Hazard a try after it was available for several years on the market. It feels like a game inspired by the classic game Asteroids, but with songs from your music library playing while you control your spaceship. So the basic premise of the game is you maneuvering a spaceship while avoiding asteroids and many enemy spaceships of varying types and sizes. There are many games of this genre in a crowded market, but Beat Hazard carves out its own identity with its challenging action and allows you to take on numerous enemies and other hazards as you enjoy the rhythm of the songs of your favorite artists and built-in songs.There had been criticism of Beat Hazard because of the lack of iTunes support. I strongly recommend buying the related Beat Hazard DLC that supports iTunes songs. I played songs from iTunes and they work just fine. The game accepts all song file types with the exception of CDs, so you will have to rip the CDs in order to play the songs. Another criticism had been that Beat Hazard doesn’t seem exciting enough on slow songs. I played many slow songs, including some pop/soft rock songs, and there is enough intensity in the visuals and the mayhem to make the gameplay exciting. It is beautiful to see your spaceship’s bright neon fire fill the screen while the explosions are so vibrant. There are times when the brightness of the visuals is a bit overdone, especially as the track progresses. When the visuals are too intense it can feel uncomfortable for those with sensitive eyes. Therefore, it would be best to take a break from the action if the flashing strobe feels overwhelming.There are several gameplay modes in the game and many spaceships to choose from. The standard mode requires you to play through an entire track until it is finished. Survival mode requires you to last as long as possible while trying to play through an entire album. The spaceships have their own specific missions such as accumulating a minimum number of points without getting the death penalty that would nullify some or all of the points you had scored previously. These specific missions for spaceships add to the challenge of playing this old-school shooter while enjoying the rhythm of whatever song you are playing. There is a boss rush mode that requires you to defeat wave after wave of bosses until you have no more lives remaining. The bosses become familiar after experiencing the standard modes since bosses appear at specific points of the song. These modes are exciting in their own way, but it feels like there aren’t too many other modes to further increase replay value. However, there is online play that allows you to play the various modes with a friend. The bottom of the screen adds a nice touch to the game by notifying you of your progress, your friends’ progress, and other players who are looking to playing with others.You can level up in the game and that happens as you progress through each track. After leveling up enough you will earn a new rank and you can see how you rank against other players on the global leaderboard. There is no leaderboard for individual songs like Audiosurf, but Beat Hazard’s way of leveling up provides a sense of progression. I played with the mouse and keyboard setup and it plays quite well. There is the option of playing with a controller.There are many powerups in the game. As you pick up volume and power powerups, your spaceship’s lasers become increasingly powerful, but the gameplay will also intensify. The screen fills up with a large number of small enemy spaceships and large spaceships to balance the gameplay and keep you from being significantly overpowered.I think Beat Hazard is a fun game that some players may find old after playing through their favorite tracks in all the available modes. However, this game is definitely worth the $9.99 purchase price plus the DLCs. You can’t go wrong with game that offers enough replay value that is as large as your music collection, vibrant visuals, intense boss battles, and lots of powerups.My Score: 7.5/10 "

												Love old school shooters like asteroids where all the action takes place on one screen,then you will REALLY like this one.Start playing and you realise that when you play your own tracks the ebb and flow that the game follows behaves differently every time.As you play and blow up more ships you get power ups such as bombs,more fire power ect,but i found myself heading straight for the ""VOLUME UP"" power up as soon as it appeared.Now i know exactally why this is,you get to play to your own music and boy oh boy it makes the game all the better for it.Finding yourself listening along to your favoriote songs and completely anihilating the enemy is rather exiting and extremely entertaining to the point that you just want to play along to your own music.The graphics and adequate for this type of game,there is no story at all (DOESNT NEED ONE) but its the music that will keep you playing as you destroy things to the sound of your own music and its that-that will cause you to become addicted to this simple yet great little shooter.Would reccomend to anyone that wants to shoot things and blow stuff up to their own music if thats not you then i wouldent buy this game,if it is welcome to the ""SOUNDS OF YOUR OWN DESTRUCTION"" (well it will feel that way when you get outnumbered and die enough anyway).

												Beat Hazard, A music game with similar gameplay to that of the classic Space Invaders but with a custom soundtrack. That's right you can use your own music in your library to play and it's a whole different experience for each song you have.Pros:- Classic shoot em up powered by your own music- Excellent replay value in terms of different enemies and bosses in - Many different ship types introduced in a DLC pack which alter how the game is played- A number of difficulty levels which determine how many enemies appear- Diverse gamemodes such as boss rush and survival (can you survive a whole album)Cons:- Many flashing colours in this game so be careful if you're epileptic- Multiplayer can be empty at times unless you have friends who play this game oftenVerdict:9.5/10Certainly one of the more fun games I've been able to try out and even though I don't play it as often myself anymore I would totally recommend it to others who love music games.

												Beat Hazard is a top down dual stick arcade shooter similar to the classic game Asteroid, but on neon colored steroids. Its pretty much contained in a single screen and the game throws waves of asteroids, ships and space worms after you. Since its a dual stick shooter, the controls are easy, left stick to move, right stick to fire the direction you're aiming. There are also bombs to clear the screen when it gets completely full of enemies. Beat Hazard has a major twist. Your rate of fire is controlled by the tempo or beats per minute of the music. Not just your bullets but the enemy speed too. If you don't care for the songs that the game comes with, you can play one of your own .mp3s or listen to Internet radio. The neon laser beams make the game come to life as more than a game. It could be a visualizer for your mp3 playlist.Every song is a level. When the song ends or your lives run out, you see your high score and the game remembers how far you got and your high score. So you can play it again for a better high score or to go further in the song. I'd much rather have the game go from song to song than force me to start up a new game for the next song. There is a survival mode that will keep going song to song, but its just a single life.The enemy diversity shines through in the game. There are simple ships that fly in long waves. Larger ships that take more damage. Even larger ships that explode into a hail of homing missiles. Still other ships have dual repulsor beams to push you around. Magnetic ships have dual rays that pull you in. There are segmented space worms, easier to defeat neon worms. It is a varitable feast. Not just that, but diverse bosses. Everything from huge space ships, gigantic worms to star fish that coil up their tentacles for protection. These enemies will fill your screen in no time especially on the upper three difficulties. The game has a way to keep your mind engaged as to how you can survive.Every score that you have go to your level or rank. The score is like experience. You will rank up and get to unlock a perk. You need to buy the perk once its been unlocked. Not just buy it, but buy multiples of it. Then equip it. There are perks that give you extra lives, extra bombs, and increase score multipliers. Other things that can get unlocked are extra difficulty modes for when 'hardcore' gets too easy for you.There are other layers of complexity to the Beat Hazard such as a risk reward system. If you don't shoot a set amount of time your score multiplier goes up. If you survive long enough without dying, the multiplier goes up again. Before you know it you're at 45+ of a score multiplier if not 100+ with perks. All the while enemies will drop things for you to pickup such as extra multipliers, money, bombs to use, power ups for your laser and volume increases. Its very risk or reward. Do you leave your safe corner of the screen, navigate through the madness to get your $10?The game is kind enough that when you die, it litters the area with items to get you back up and competing again. That is a downfall of other games that if you die late into a game, your underpowered ship is useless against the high difficulty enemies.If you get lonely there is 2 player and online multiplayer where you compete on a single screen against someone. Not just that, but the game will notify you if someone is trying to multiplayer at that time. You can interrupt your own game to play against someone. This ensures there's always someone to play.I say this game is well worth the $10 asking price.			"

												I personally wouldn't say Beat Hazard is a bullet hell game, sure there is alot of enemies on the screen as well as bullets and bosses, but it just isnt fully in the bullet hell genre, but with that said Beat Hazard is totally worth the time to play and worth the money. You can input your own music into the game and do survival or other difficulties, as well as play multi-player, you can also make your own ship with certain attributes to your liking as well as download other peoples ships. If that isnt enough you can also compete for the leaderboards.			"

If you are epileptic or if bright and rapidly-flashing lights have any sort of negative effect on you, for the love of all that is pure, PLEASE stay the ♥♥♥♥ away from this game. There is almost never a single moment in the gameplay where some part of the screen is not rapidly flashing and changing colors. Luckily, I am not sensitive to rapid flashes or anything like that. But, seeing as how this explosion of lights and color was enough to make my left eye burn to the point of watering over and hurting really badly after playing through just two different songs, it will tear a [flashing] light-sensitive person to shreds in just a matter of seconds. Play carefully, people.I give this fever dream a 10/10.			"

												I'm a little surprised I havent already reviewed this game, but simply put, this is one amazing gaming experience. Think of asteroids with modern graphics and visuals. The game adapts to and creates a new experience based on the music you play. You can use their in game radio station or use your own MP3's and other downloaded music files as well though. The game not only creates new levels based on the song being played, but it syncs to the dynamics of the songs as well. Truly an amazing experiencce that also capitalizes on RPG elements in the form of buffs/perks and upgrades to said buffs/perks, in addition to having various ships to choose from as you unlock them. The DLC gives you more missions and ships as well. there are points leaderboards, although I personally dont really look at those.Overall, I dont think you can find a better Arcade experience from the comfort of your own computer.10/10 and a must own, must play.

												Beat Hazard is one of my favorite games on Steam.  I've always been interested in the idea of music modifying a game to produce a game where you feel like you play your music. And honestly... Beat Hazard isn't that game.  It suffer the same fate as all these procedurally generated music games, like Audiosurf, where the music doesn't have a strong connection to the game you're playing.  When you play Beat Hazard, there is limited connectability to the the music. The Music in Beat Hazard pretty much affects the ""intensity"" of the game.   If you play some music with a high BPM enemies will move at a faster rate than a low BPM.  But even playing Happy Hardcore and other fast BPM music, the game doesn't appear broken, which is a good thing.  A VERY good thing, as I'd hate to see the game limit what types of music it can play. In addition, the game comes with a built in soundtrack, something Audiosurf doesn't really do, so at least you can play exactly what song the developer was thinking of when you play the game, and the fact is... it works and by that I mean very well.  There a variety of songs chosen but slow songs have a different feel from fast songs.  That's good. But you'll play through the 20 songs or so and then you'll have to play your music?  Right?    Well... not unless you want to, though you can.  There's also internet radio!   At least my copy (which is from the original launch) came with a few stations already set up and adding more is relatively easy, EXCEPT it requires editing a file, so steam boxes and anyone playing in a big picture mode has to go through a few hoops to make it work.  It's not awful, but it's an annoying few steps that I wish wasn't required. However the build in internet radio works, and works well, rather than ""play a song"" you instead play a time battle, 4 minutes up to 20 minutes I believe (and a survival mode for when you want to see how far you can go).  And again, it's YOUR choice.  I chose an electronica station, so I was loving the music and the game, and it worked... really well.   Well except for the fact there's a little disconnect between the game and the song, but you can use internet radio, and listen to great music as you play.So what's the game like?  It's a bit like Geometry wars.  Rather than fighting geometry shapes, you're instead blasting ships and flying dodging their attacks.  It's quite similar to bullet hell games, but there's a few major changes.  First the game isn't that brutally hard, and gives you multiple difficulty options (including a few you can only unlock through a perk system).  Second, there's power ups.  Enemy ships when destroyed can drop different items, some of them are for points, some of them are weapons you can trigger, and finally there's ""volume"" and ""power"".  Power does exactly what you think, it makes your ship strong, however Volume is different.  It increases the sound of the song you're listening to.  At the beginning your music is quite, but as you volume up the sound increases so you can hear your song at full volume.  This also affects the power of your ship (I think defensively) and when you max both you get a special mode, so both of these power ups are important. While that disconnect from the music for the game doesn't make this the game I dream of, the fact is the gameplay of the game is fun, and there's a decent connection when you're listening to music and what's happening in the game.  If a song goes from slow to fast and back, you'll notice enemies speeding up and slowing down.  The connection could be better, if you play a song two or three times, it's random how enemies will appear and attack.   However the gameplay itself is solid, and you are able to listen to music you like and have it make a minor effect on the game you're playing. But the game underneath is just a fun game.  I love geometry wars, and Beat Hazard I think might actually beat Geometry wars for replayability.  I recommend this game not because it's a stunning success in the world of music games, but because it's a fantastic twin stick shooter with a lot of depth.  The two DLCs (Shadow Operations Unit and Ultra) are both excellent add ons, and being able to get the whole set for under 20 bucks is a good value.			"

												I love this game, it combines two things I've always had a passion for, music and games. This is a space shooter that depends on the beats of your own songs. The enemies and your wepoans are either faster and stronger or slower and weaker completely dependng on the song you're playing. If you like dance / eletronic music you'll probably have a harder time playing it! I've had this on the Playstation 3 system and now own it on Steam, so it's safe to say I have around 50 hours in this. I can only write about Beat Hazard Ultra, because I've only played that version so far. The Ultra DLC adds perks and weapons in which you can upgrade using in-game cash. Honestly, Beat Hazard must feel boring without the Ultra DLC, it breathes new life into the game, a damn good one!Every DLC so far has not disappointed me (although there's only two o far), It just feels like a much better game if you have all the DLCs. Both will give you challenges and a ton of stuff to do. The new Shadow Operations Unit is also a great addition, introducing new ships and the ability of creating your own! Each ship will give you 3 challenges, in which some are actually pretty hard to complete! :DBeat Hazard is the game I'll always go back to it sometime because I'll miss its craziness and how good it feels to destroy enemy spaceships. It always feels different because everytime I go back to it, my musical taste has slightly changed. This game is cheap, and if you love music I think you'll like this game too, but be sure to, at least, get hte Ultra DLC, it will be a totally different experience. Beat Hazard (Ultra + Shadow Operations DLC) is an 8.5/10 for me, considering it an indie game and how cheap you can get it, the amount of hours you'll play this will surely not be wasted. :D			"

												After playing like 4 hours of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, I a humble gamer, also another blinded(literally) person, wanted to write a review! So, ""What is Beat Hazard?"". Beat Hazard is an action/arcade game where you need to blow up♥♥♥♥♥♥tons of enemy spaceships while maintaining your tiny♥♥♥♥♥ships ""one-hit KO"" HP. Sounds fun right? ...Right?OK. It might not be appealing at first sight but once you buy(or get) it and boot up the game, you'll find that you are going to need to move all your music to an easily accessible place. Because Beat Hazards file browser SUCKS! I kid you not, it really does. But worry not my friend who still has his/her eyesight, because once you get the hang of it, you will easily pick the song you want and start sending those spaceships to space junkyard, I guess.Alright, we booted up the game. Closed the game. Moved every piece of music we have in our PC to a better place. Opened up the game again. Picked the song. Now what? Now it's the time to have fun! Simply click anywhere to shoot while using WASD(Honestly I don't remember if I changed the key bindings so go check your settings before hopping into the game.) to move around. You might find that the power of your weapons, as well as the speed of the game, is dependent on the music that is currently playing. Ehem... BEAT HazardWhile playing the game you will die a lot, but don't rage you'll learn to dodge while slowly turning your loyal eyeballs into fried cheeseballs. No one said there is no price but if you really want to see for 2 more days go ahead and turn down the intensity of effects. Actually turn down the intensity because when you max it out(200% is the max value) like I did. You can't see♥♥♥♥♥♥ there will be literally too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on your screen. Enemies, FAKIN ASTEROIDS, You and last but not least bullets(or Danmaku 弾幕 if you prefer the original usage or you are a weeaboo like me). Let us start with the enemies, there are 6 type of enemies listed by their difficulty to take down;•Small grey ships, their duty is being as annoying as they can be while trying to flank and kamikaze you.•Medium sized red decalled white ships, their duty is sometimes shooting and sometimes trying to kamikaze you.•Big blue ships, their duty is shooting Homing Yellow Danmaku which can be destroyed if shot upon.•Armada(that's what I call them), their duty is coming in sizes of 20+ and cover the whole screen while shooting at you at once from all sides.•Boss, not much to say simple boss just shoot its weak points.•Twin Boss, little brothers of the Boss.About the asteroids in the game, what they are known for is getting in your way of having fun. Whether they spawn in the middle of the most epicest guitar solo of all times or bump into your ship in the most unsuspecting time. You won't expect it because you are going to be dealing with 513 enemies at once. ♥♥♥♥ ASTEROIDSNow let's talk about how the game uses your music to spawn enemies. Based on my observations the bassier the sound is the more action you'll get. I think the best example would be Orion from Metallica. There is a bass passage in the beginning of the song. This makes the game think ""IT'S SHOWTIME BABY"" and you'll end up getting your face melted before the song even started. Orion is the hardest song I have ever played in this game. Considering the piece is 8 minutes long with almost 4 minutes of bass solo. This means 4 minutes of non-stop action. My biggest disappointment was the system almost only takes bass as a measure. I personally enjoy listening to Power Metal, a genre which doesn't prioritise bass over treble. That's what you'll get FAKIN ASTEROIDS IN YOUR FAKIN GUITAR SOLOThe game is overall great and fun to play with lots of replayability. You can basically play until you run out of music if that's ever going to happen. The downside is you need to be relaxed and very careful like you are going to beat the world record of being careful to spot every little annoying pieces of ♥♥♥♥s Small grey ships and all the Danmaku while there is literally ♥♥♥♥♥torm happening in your poor screen. I rate this game 8/10 but this doesn't mean it's bad. This game is super cool and fun. Go grab it!			"

												[WARNING] NOT FOR PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY CONDITIONS NOR THOSE SENSITIVE TO STROBBING AND FLASHING LIGHTS! WHILE YOU CAN REDUCE THE INTENSITY IN THE SETTINGS IT IS STILL WAY LARGER THAN THE NORMAL AMOUNT![WARNING]TL;DR: Spaceship, meets star arena meet asteroid with your music providing the tempo for the weapons and enemies! Enjoyable for those who like to challenge themselves since the INSANE difficiulity is definitely insane!Review Starts HereWhat is Beat Hazard?Beat hazard is a 2D top down space shooter game in the veins of asteroid except you have enemies and boss fights. Pretty darn awesome. You have to supply it with your music though. 1:GraphicsNotice the [WARNING] thing above? well not kidding. Each effects is the same as a single flashbang and every shots and explosion from either you or the enemy will sear the screen as bright as the sun causing temperorary blindness and mania in the affected gamers. God forbid you crank up the effect to 200% like i did and played for 30 min straight.The actual graphics themselves are very good as far as 2D spaceshooting game is concern. Sprite move, shoot and explode brilliantly when they die. Meanwhile the 3D effects zoom across the screen blinding you with their colourful effects. And they are bright.2: SoundShooting sounds good, explosive sounds good. For anything else music, you supply it yourself.3:GameplayYou get 2 meter, power and volume meter, collecting powerup increases either the bar game which in turn either increases your shot power or shot intensity respectively. Mostly you want the intensity though because depending on the music the AI can really prove to be a challenge with them swarming you on all side so breaking through will definitely help more.At the start of the game you are provided with 3 bombs that clear HALF the map of enemies and not the whole map. If you die a bomb would automatically be used should one be in your possesion. Perks can be purchase with cash you collect as you destroy craft but only a limited number can be activated at time, they provide in game benefits when you activate them. As you play along the game sometimes boss can appear, these hulking monstrosity often has a gimmick behind thier sleeves that can prove to be rather challenging if you are terrible with them but killing them often provides money and powerups.The game will continue till the song ends so if you pick a long and beaty song at hard or above, prepare for a beating.4:Beat Hazard Ultra DLCCurrently there are 2 version on sale on steam, the normal edition and the one bundled with the DLC Beat Hazard Ultra. Genrally speaking, get the bundle. it includes even more bosses, more enemy types, more perk and generally more of everything that the classic beat hazard doesnt have! Also the effects are shinier in the DLC so yeah, poor retina.Conclusion.Great game with friends or by yourself. hopefully drunken friends that way you can play those super weird music as you blast spaceship in tune to the beat. Definitely a thumbs up.[TIPS]Cant find a hard enough music? Insane too easy? Go use white noises as the music. Dont say i didnt warn you.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupCheck out the Original Network Groups.

												Before reading: this review is about Beat Hazard Ultra, meaning the basic game + dlc. While I still recommend Beat Hazard on its own, it is more simplistic and lacks online co-op that the Ultra version provides, so I strongly recommend this game to be played with DLC.Beat Hazard Ultra is a fast paced space shoot'em up with bright colorful graphics. At first sight it does not look like much, however it has several features that have made it one of the most pleasant surprises in my library. The graphics look amazing at first, they tend to tire out your eyes pretty easily however, so it is not recommended to play for long sessions. There is an option to scale them up (!) or down inside the game menu though.The battle is fluid despite the abundance of color, enemies and the genral chaos that takes place on your screen especially on the higher difficulties. I have even played this on a linux netbook -yes it plays on linux and mac as well- with minimal capabilities and I was honestly surprised at its smoothness. Gameplay is fluid as well, regardless if you are playing with a controller or a mouse and keyboard. In fact, I even find myself preferring the mouse and keyboard mostly because the mouse provides more precise aiming than thumbsticks. The difficulty curve is just right, meaning you can choose from 5 different difficulty settings (easy, normal, hardcore, insane, suicidal) and play in whatever mode you feel comfortable with. This makes the game equally enjoyable for both hardcore shmup players as well as people who are new to the genre, or not particularly skilled. There is also a nice ""perk"" system implemented, where you can buy upgrades, such as a few special attacks, more multipliers, etc.Music is an integral part of playing the game and your ship's power as well as enemies generated depend on the music you are playing. This means that the exact same level will be generated when you play the exact same track. When the music gets more aggressive, so will your ship's lasers, but that will also make your enemies spawn and move faster. The opposite happens when the music gets mellow. This makes the game quite interesting since it doesn't exactly mean it gets easier on mellow music or harder on heavier music, but instead it manages very successfully to keep the game balanced on either setting so you can have a go on different tracks depending on your mood. The games build in track list is fairly pleasant to play, but why limit yourself there, when you can actually index and play any song in your computer or just play listening to your favorite radio station?What usually disappoints in this genre is the lack of online co-op mode. Well, Beat Hazard Ultra actually HAS online co-op as well as online versus mode where you can easily invite someone over your steam friend list and play together. You can even play listening to the radio, or play your own music as well, provided both of the participants have the same track indexed.To sum it up, if you like shmups or are just curious about the genre, you will definitely enjoy this game. For me, it is a small gem in my library, so I hope more people will discover it in the future. "

												Beat HazardBeat Hazard is a twin-stick shooter game powered by the tempo and bass of your music, each track gives a different challenge and treats you with a pretty light show.Pros* Addictive gameplay* Workshop support* Challenging gameplay* Great when killing time* You can control the visual intensity, meaning if you're epileptic or prone to seizures you can still playCons* Requires constant self updating because you gotta add your own tracksIn short, Beat Hazard will be the best 10 bucks you might spend on steam, it's an arcade style twin-stick shooter with a twist and perfect for music enthusiast, I'd pick this game up and give it a go if I were you, and remember if you don't like it you can always refund it, to those who start playing.

												I'm going to be straight forward with you. This is a really good game. It's algarythm is really solid, it's extremely easy to import your own songs, escpecially once you buy the itunes DLC, you have to pay because they had to buy the liscence to use itunes...However I do not recomend this game. On this page, this store page, it advertises Steam Workshop support. That is a blatent lie and false advertisement. Yes this game has Steam Workshop, no it's not included in the base game. Instead the develop is attempting to gouge more money out of you by making you pay 4.99$ for Steam Workshop. Yes you get some crappy other ships, but no one buys that DLC for the ships, they buy it for the Steam Workshop.The shear audacity of charging money for a feature that is FREE in every other game that supports it is incredibly daring and the Developer should not be rewarded for that. Because of this shady practice I honestly can't recomend this game to anyone, you should not be aloud to put a free feature behind a pay wall, especially when it's not even your work that your making people pay for. Sure make me pay for your ship designs, but dont' make me pay for other player's ship designs. "

This game for those moments when you want to listen to music but also you want to do something else or for moments when you want an epileptic seizure.Beat Hazard is a great scroll-shooter, which gameplay bases on a track you choose. Then louder track than more enemies you have (basically).There are many perks which increase your survivability or score.But honestly, I don’t recommend to buy this game without DLC. BH Ultra gives you tons of new enemies, perks, co-op, PvP and other cool stuff. Shadow Operation Unit allows you to change ships. 9 new ships + workshop with community ships. SOU opens rank system. With every new rank, you open new, more powerful, ships (obviously).As a result, we have another great indie project which is like to people who like hardcore and music			"

Just make sure that you can somehow get your favorite songs downloaded. (I recommend googling Youtube to MP3. you should find something that would work)			"

												To give you an accurate impression of the Beat Hazard experience...I'm going to describe my morning.When I woke up today I discovered that I had nothing to eat for breakfast. All I had was a tub of whey protein. The directions say to mix the whey with milk, water, or ""your favorite beverage"". I didn't have any milk and water is for weenies so I used Dr. Pepper. It was disastrous, the tiniest sip nearly caused me to throw up. So I dumped all that crap out and settled for a Rolling Rock and a few cookies. In other words: Beat Hazard is what you make of it.This is a treadmill-based twin-stick shooter. The idea is that as you play, the game will continually feed you unlockables and upgrades. It's all part of the process that keeps you on that treadmill. The entertainment typically comes from dodging enemies, their projectiles, and destroying them with a fully-loaded arsenal. Naturally this is a simplistic affair, but what keeps Beat Hazard interesting is the soundtrack. Pick a song, any song, and it'll work with the game. Even on the hardest difficulty, surviving usually isn't too difficult. Getting a high-score on the other hand can be interesting. Aside from the work necessary to unlock all of the score-based multiplier bonuses, you might also have to consider finding that perfect song. This song must be consistently intense, so that enemies spawn constantly, and not have any time-wasting lulls. I suppose a five-minute recording of a dozen jackhammers would suffice, but I don't play for score. Regardless, the meta-game is a unique experiment. It makes you feel like playing to the best of your ability isn't enough to hit the top of the leaderboards, you also have to seek out whatever music other people listen to to reach those hi-scores.Speaking for myself, Beat Hazard is the game I play when I don't have anything better to do. Admittedly, I have a backlog that consists of hundreds of videogames, but... anyway. The point is that I can turn this game on, burn through a few songs, and feel like I've made some progress. I can also pretend that I'm playing a rhythm game that I actually like, one where I can focus on destroying an armada of warships, not press random buttons to the beat. If I could make one complaint, it would be the lack of an option to drop the visual intensity to 25% or lower. The options only allow for down to 50%, which is still a little too much for my eyes. 90% of my deaths can be attributed to losing track of what's going on. Normally this would be a death sentence for a game, but well..I guess it makes sense for Beat Hazard. The more intense the track, the more intense the visuals and subsequent dangers that come with it. If you can't take the heat, get out of the kitchen, or listen to Adult Contemporary.All in all this is a fun game to play around with.			"

												I love Beat Hazard, and I'm not really a fan of twin stick shooters. I bought the game because it had an interesting premise, and I loved the game because it really succeeds in turning that premise into a great time. Beat Hazard has almost a Guitar Hero/Rock Band feel without the gimmicky side effect; it is a game that will have you playing for hours just because ""oh, (song name) had a great beat for this! I want to try (song name)!"" And this is as your spouse/friends/family is sitting beside you, watching you play while asking incessantly, ""Can I try? Can I try?""The playability is literally endless. Literally. Music will always exist and new music will continue to be made, and you can play this game to the beat of said music via the form of mp3s (among others) and streaming. Be prepared to download songs you never wanted to admit liking just to try them out in the game. Be surprised as you find that certain songs offer you more challenge than you thought they would. When Beat Hazard claims the gameplay flows with the music, they're not just saying that. The beat picks up, the enemies fly faster, the colors get brighter, the bullets shoot faster. This offers a new level of strategy unheard of in other games, because if you know the song you are playing well, you'll know when it picks up and slows down and you can play accordingly. A few last positives before I end the review. The game tracks your high scores for each song that you have (for downloads, at least, I haven't tried with streaming). The game is easy to learn and great fun even for those (like me) who don't tend to like twin stick shooters. Great to launch at parties/get togethers/game nights. Great game to jump in/out of if you only have a few minutes to spare gaming. Multiple modes and unlockables. ""Just one more"" type of gameplay. Can be humorous at times to watch the enemy ships react to the music. It's actually kind of cute to watch them all quickly file onto the screen in a song that picks up quickly after a slow start, as if they all were sleeping off the screen until the blaring beat shook them to consciousness.Overall, great game. I'm giving it a 10/10. Buy it if you like music. ;)			"

												A very simple game; yet tons of fun that can last you for ages.It has a similar mechanic to Bullet Hell games. Bad guys shoot you, you avoid bullets and shoot back; easy!It has a ranking system, which mostly serves it's purpose for showing off especially when you get to the elite rank, from there it's just Elite 1, Elite 2 and so on.There are plenty of perks to go about. More lives, an extra percentage to all points gained from an enemy, more missiles and superbombs.It would be nice to have a campaign of sorts with it; but the other modes make up for that with Boss Rush and Survival both which can get very hectic quite fast.And above all; it plays by your music which is something I thoroughly enjoy. Be it fast paced, blaring rock/metal or something more relaxed and gentle, whatever song you pick, the game changes in what enemies will spawn, how fast they shoot, how powerful your shots are etc.Worth giving a go if you want to just waste a few hours...or weeks.

												If you like music ( of your own choosing) , fighting enemies, and like psychodellic images, well this is the game for you. Real fun and you can even choose the pace (depending on what song you select , will enable the pace of the enemies and your own weapons.) This game is wonderful, easy to pick up and pretty fun at any and all times. Buyer Beware: if you play this for several hours right before going to bed, you may get flashes ingrained into the back of your eyes. It's still totally worth it!			"

												“10/10 would seize again!” - The Joy of Stiqs“A revolutionary tool.. [has been] invaluable in continued research” - National Epilepsy Diagnostics Foundation“A true thriller that had me shaking in my boots.. and then in my chair.. followed shortly by the floor.” - PartialSandwichTasteless epileptic jokes aside, this game is fantastic. Beat Hazard is a twin-stick bullet-mayhem shooter very much akin to the Geometry Wars franchise. While the mechanics are quite similar, Beat Hazard makes the game your own by allowing your personal music collection to generate the levels you play.The game comes with about 20 or 30 tracks (all of which are pretty awesome) but nothing quite compares to the screen going mental when the beat drops in your favorite song. Speaking of the screen going mental, I tend to be bemused by games that put the photo-sensitivity warning before the game begins. I don’t understand the mechanics by which a seizure is induced but typically games have that warning when the only light flickering is a lamp swinging and sparking from the ceiling. Beat Hazard on the other hand means business, I have never seen such chaos in all my life!But here is the incredible part: the developers have masterfully balanced all the elements of the game so that even amidst all the chaos you know exactly what you’re doing. It was truly baffling to me when I played my very first game. I don’t know how they pulled it off but the design of this game is top notch. A must buy in my opinion!			"

												First I will say I enjoyed playing Beat Hazard, its fun with the right music. But I cannot support this game with a developer that act like a kid, The developer keep banning people who ask questions, criticize him or anyone that agree with others while still refuse to speak about the fact he said Beat Hazard 2 was not going to take 3 years. He haven't even started on it and refuse to speak about it now after over 3 years. So no you cant trust this developer or think he will act like a adult.Is it so hard to tell the truth and why without looking like a smeaghead you now look like?I wont buy a game from you in the future and so wont any company I work with. Grow up or stop being a developer as you sure ain't good at it.			"

Never Ending Music Game! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]This game is unbelievable! At first I thought it was just another Geometry Wars clone (and in a certain way, it is), but due to the fact it is totally dependent on the music you let it play (yes, you use your own music!) it competes in a different league.The aim of the game is simple: enemy spacecrafts appear on the screen and you have to shoot all of them down; these will give you bonuses and powerups that will come in handy when facing the bigger and badder spacecrafts (the ""end level bosses"")!Gone are the days when you had to shoot while listening an annoying soundtrack, this time you have to shoot FOR listening your favorite song! Pop, Techno, Country, every genre translates in a different gameplay.Replay value is quite high: there are lot of achievements and at easier difficulties it is a good stress relief.I found the blinding acid graphic not distracting at all and simply amazing: another positive point for the game. It is the best game of this type on the market.The DLC is the icing on the cake, adding longevity and new enemies.Best played with X360 JoypadRecommended Buy Price < 15$Score 8/10 "

I suggest getting them together if you ever plan to play this game!If you have a decent library of loud music or enjoy that fast pace of gameplay with awesome visuals, you should definitely give this game a look.

												It's Asteroids, the Epilepsy Edition.Beat Hazard is a very fun arcade shooter where you pilot a ship, power it up, and destroy anything in your way, all to your own music. The control is great (allows for keyboard or controller) and the effects are pretty amazing, very bright and colorful. Also, there are many additional ships by designers in the Workshop, so experimenting around with other people's ships (and making your own) adds to the fun. The intensity of the enemy waves increases based on difficulty level and the intensity of your music. Obviously, some genres of music will be more preferable than others.If you're going to get this game, I highly recommend getting all the DLC. iTunes support will obviously let you play your iTunes files, Shadow Ops gives you objectives to complete in the game to raise your rank (allowing you to pick certain ships in the Workshop), and Ultra will add a wider variety of enemies (and probably other stuff, I don't know). Overall, Beat Hazard is a fun game that I keep coming back to periodically as a stress-reliever. Sometimes you just wanna blow sh*t up and listen to your favorite music, and this game does a great job of combining them both.			"

												First off if you have issues with strobe lights or any sort of light effected chance of seizures do not play this game. If you don't have any such problems, then play this game. Fast paced, up beat and very customizable it's a flashing ball of fun. I normally don't play shooters of this nature but this one has a nice learning curve for new comers, and more traditional crazy hard stuff for more experienced gamers. You can add your own music (which sets the structure of each level), use internet radio or just jam out with the music provided with the game. The amount of replay is almost endless because of this feature, with each new song creating a brand new level. As visiuals go, it's not exaclty the most advanced looking but man is it pretty. The constant flashing lights, ever changing colors and sparks remind me of a rave...or the 4th of July.			"

												This game is a nice HD spin to the classic Asteroids game of the 80s. Beat Hazard allows you to use your own music library which means no two play throughs are the same. This game does contain lots of strobing and flashing effects, so if those things bother you, it's best you skip this game. But for everyone else, if you like music and enjoy arcade games, this one is for you!			"

												Are you a fan of arcade action games like Asteroids? Do you like music? Then this is just for you!Beat Hazard combines the basic gameplay elements of the old classic arcade game Asteroids and mixes it with different kind of enemy types and your own choice of music. Every song has different kind of enemy waves so each song feels a completely unique experience and doesn't get boring after a song or two. Because the game is just pure arcade action the game never really lose any of it's replayability and feels fresh every time you launch up a new song in Beat Hazard.Consider picking up the DLCs! Enchants the gameplay and adds hours of content into the game.			"

												I like videogames.  I like music.  I like having my retinas assaulted by swirls of colorful space dust.If you enjoy treating your brain to videogames and music like I do, and are enthralled with the amalgamation of the two, then there’s a good chance you’re going to enjoy Beat Hazard as well.  The twist is that Beat Hazard uses your own music to create custom levels.Beat Hazard uses songs from your computer, so you can choose which song you want to play and the game creates a level around it.  Levels begin like the arcade classic, Asteroids, where you reduce large hunks of space rocks into smaller pieces with your lasers before some mean old spaceships arrive to provide put up a fight.  The unique aspect of the game is that everything from  the velocity of the asteroids to the quanity of boss ships you fight is dependent upon the music.Blasting enemy ships into space rubble provides power-ups, which increase your firepower and the volume of the  music.  Your weapons are also influenced by the tune of the music, so when a song is softer or hits a quiet spot, your firepower is greatly reduced.  It’s like the gunner on the ship is a little kid sucking down fistfulls of Pixie Sticks.  He’s running around screaming with his hands in the air one minute and the instant the song tones it down a bit, he is lulled to sleep.In addition to determining the patterns of the enemies, the game’s visuals are also greatly affected by the song selection.   As the ship is upgraded, its firepower is transformed from simple white blips into a seizure-inducing kaleidoscope of doom.  Spots in the background that initially appear nondescript also pulsate and swirl with colors to the song’s beat.  It’s something straight out of a Hawkwind concert (or Pink Floyd, for those not in tune with their ’70s space rock).  The background effects intensify the point where it can seem like you’re trying to play a game through a late-90s Windows Media Player visualizer.Did you ever watch those visualizers and imagine playing a game through it?  Me neither.  That’s because while the visuals are quite impressive and make the game infinitely more compelling for onlookers, they are also a serious hindrance to actually playing the game.  I frequently find myself dying thanks to something that I either didn’t see or assumed was just a part of the background.  I suppose it could be argued that the visuals are a way of increasing the game’s difficulty, particularly for longer songs.Crazy psychedelic visuals and customizable soundtracks are about as useful as a chainsaw to a beaver if the game feels like a chore to play, and thankfully the meat of Beat Hazard is excellent.  I find twin-stick shooters to be stressful at times because of the never-ending onslaught of ever-increasing enemies, but Beat Hazard is refreshing because your targets appear in waves.  Depending on the song, you tend to have a few seconds to catch your breath before preparing for the next attack.One of the unintended benefits of the game is that it gives me an impetus to root through my music collection and dust off some tunes I have not heard in awhile.  I love shuffling through my songs and thinking “Hmm, I wonder what this song will be like?”  I find that in general, songs tend to work better if they are more dynamic and have a lot of changes in their volume or beats.The game does a great job of tracking your progress and keeping a tally of how many songs you have beaten, or if you have finished an entire album.  Even if you don’t complete a song, the game still awards experience and you can still gain levels which add bonuses and a feeling of persistence.  Achievements would be a fantastic addition to this game, but unfortunately are absent through no fault of Cold Beam Games.Despite it being a little too mesmerizing for its own good, Beat Hazard is an amazing experience and quite the technical accomplishment.  It is easy to recommend laying down the $5 for gamers who are music enthusiasts.  Outside of the allure of playing your own music,  Beat Hazard is an exciting and unique shooter and a great addition to the Indie library.Recommended "

												An excellent frantic arena shooter with a new level generated for each song that you play. The Ultra DLC adds so much more to the game that it is a must buy if you don't already own it. More enemies, more weapons, more game modes and more scoring perks.Now expanded even further with the Shadow Ops DLC, more ships to choose from separate leaderboards for each type of ship and a shadow mission system adding missions to complete for each ship. Also not forgetting workshop support.In my opinion the best play your own music game out there. Blow the crap out of your favourite songs and make your eyes bleed all at the same time.			"

												I played this well into the night of Christmas Eve, into the early morning of Christmas itself many years ago. I was too anxious to sleep since Santa Claus was on his way, so I opted to venture into the living room in the dead of the night while everyone else was asleep. I had just recently bought and installed Beat Hazard and decided to have a go at it. In what seemed like five or so minutes, I was hooked like I was on drugs, this game is like a combination of LSD, Cannabis, the Magic Mushrooms and all that hippy stuff that makes you see the purple rhinoceros.Eventually, the computer crashed since it was a piece of junk, and I continued staring at the screen for several minutes. Just staring at the pitch black monitor. I finally came to and looked at the clock hanging on the wall. It was 5 o'clock. I had just experience what was perhaps the most intense, colourful and psychologically damaging ecstasy ride I might ever feel in my lifetime.When you play this game, you don't blink, you don't breathe, you don't do anything but watch, play and think of nothing. Your soul is absorbed into the monitor as it displays the flashing lights of hypnotism that is Beat Hazard and just when you think it couldn't get any trippier than that, you realise the light intensity goes past 100%.If I had to make any critical points against this game, it would be that there was no evil mastermind attempting to control the world through the amazingly vivid colours that this game shoves into your brain.*Caution: This game contains the side effects of fur growth on the eyeballs, misplaced eyebrows and occasional brain-freezes. Please consult a doctor if you do not experience any of these symptoms as you may be playing the wrong game.*			"

												This game is equal parts Geometry Wars, Guitar Hero, and visualization software. Similar to Asteroids, the perspective is top-down, and you have free reign to move your ship in any direction (however, you are limited by the borders of the screen). The ideal way to play this game is with an Xbox 360 controller, as it is a twin-stick shooter (similar to Smash TV).The major selling point is that it is also a visualizer. So, your ""stages"" are actually music tracks. The game ships with several dance/house/edm tracks, however you can add to that listing with music saved onto your hard drive, and for $1.00, you can add iTunes and m&a support. Because it's a visualizer, everything pulsates with the beat of the music; shots, powerups, and your ships lights all thump with the beat. Because of this, certain genres resonate better with it than others (club/hip hop/dance/edm/dubstep/soul/funk/pop being the best, with metal/psychobilly/punk being the most spasmatic). Interestingly, the game will sync enemies and bosses with the music, so when a song gets to a really intense part, you may suddenly get hit with twin bosses and similarly when there's not much going on in the track, you may wind up staring at an empty screen. The game also takes more detail into the game from your music selection by making adjustments to things like enemy/bullet speed, how many of your guns fire during the quieter segments, and how fast time-based score multiplier meters fill up.The ideal purchase to make for this game is the Mega Bundle Pack, as it contains all of the DLC (including the aforementioned iTunes/m&a licensing). These include online co-op/competitive play, new bosses, and perks that can be applied to your gameplay, and the Shadow Ops Unit DLC, which adds a rank progression system, ship-specific goals (like destroy 100 asteroids, reach 1,000,000 points in a track), leaderboards for each ship, and even opens up the ship creating system to you. The higher you rank in the Shadow Ops Unit, the more points you get in creating a ship. It also lets you select an image on your hard drive for the ship and upload your creation to the steam workshop for others to download and use. This also means that you can download ships that other users have created (I've seen quite a few Millennium Falcons, Starship Enterprises, X-Wing Fighters, and Tie Fighters, but have also seen the Planet Express Ship, ships from other shooters, and even the Tardis).However, due to the nature of this game's fast moving, brightly colored flashing particle effects, this is not something for epileptics to play or be around, as it will made them seize faster than Axl Rose would find a reason to not play a show. For the rest of us, the $16.99 price point for the Mega Bundle pack is really cheap. While there's virtually no story, it is quite fun to see what the game makes of your favorite music as well as push for the oldschool arcade goals of getting a high score.			"

												A fun game with a fair price and a great way to pass the time. IF you ever need an excuse to listen to mp3's for hours on end this will give you one.A small tip though; even though it seems counterintuitive- slow music increases the difficulty greatly! The softer music keeps your ship from firing at full power while heavy music is a blast-a-thon.Recommended Music:Nightwish. KMFDM. Industrial and EDM in general. For increased difficulty go with Radiohead, Flaming Lips, Classical, etc. Avoid Country music as it causes your pilot to get depressed and eject from the ship.			"

I do not suffer from epilepsy but at times i've got dizzy and my eyes simply got tired from all those unnecessary explosions of dazzling vomit.4) There's no in-game chat.5) Gets repetitive fast.I would still recommend it for those who do not own audiosurf 1 or 2, or got friends to play with (you will need those, because its already dead and you can hardly find any matches online).

												The game goes like this: you go PEWPEWPEW, bad guise go BOOMBOOM and your eyes bleed on higher difficulties.And now for realsies: It's a twin stick shooter, in which your ship is as powerful as your music. There's a selection of perks to suit everyone, unlockables, global scoreboards and pretty smooth co-op/versus mode. Oh, and it's really colourful and shiny, flashing all the time in your face, epilepsy warning at launch truly is a necessity.TL;DR: It's like Asteroids. On steroids. Squared. My eyes burn and I'm loving it!			"

												Unoffical subtitle ""The Epileptic's Nightmare"".Beat Hazard is a game that lies along the same vein as Audiosurf, only instead of a racing game its a space shooter (think Asteroids, that really old game with the triangle ship).  You can use the music you have on your computer to power the battlefield as you blast away your foes.  It's a simple, but addicting game, especially with the DLC that adds the Shadow Missions (objectives for you to complete with different ships).  The gameplay is simple: you shoot the living crap out of anything that moves on-screen while trying not to get exploded.The only major issue I have with this game is that the visuals are sometimes too distracting.  I usually turn the visual intensity option down to 50% when I play, because otherwise it actually kinda hurts my eyes.  This also makes it hard to see some of the projectiles coming towards you, resulting in some really cheap deaths where you literally couldn't see what blew you up.  Since you basically die in one hit, it can be a pain, especially if you're trying to complete a Shadow Mission.Other than that it's a load of fun to hop in and blow up enemies while listening to your favorite music.  It's well worth the bundle that includes all the DLC as well if it goes on sale.  Buying it full price really depends on how much fun you think you'll have with it.  It's definitely more hardcore than the likes of Audiosurf.  If that's your thing, then put your money down and get shooting.			"

Is I use a dual shock 3 which emulates a 360 controller, and for somereason the game has set the motion axis""as in the controller motion like a wii remote"" to set off super bombs, so on many rounds my bombs just get used up and wasted.

												It's like an advanced Asteroids to your own music. Much Fun, especially with the right music. Almost had as much fun trying out the different songs/styles of music and seeing the effect. Big freedia Ya'll Get Back Now was awesome, so was modern pop stuff, and old Psychobilly (Meteors and Nekromantix) and punk (seriously if you have some Black Flag play to it!). If you enjoy old school asteroid like shooters and your own music than this will probably be a good pick for you.Excellet when you only have a couple minutes to play and you don't want to do something more involved.

One of the awesome & great games that I enjoy on Steam ever!This game is very awesome to play with our favorite music ever, especially it's similar to Geometry Wars since we:  Move around in the zone. Shoot down the enemies and deadly asteroids. Dodge those enemies' damn attacks and hulls. Kick those awesome giant ship bosses' engines. Lose all lives and fail the current stages/music.Since this game is a music powered game, it's also suitable for the fans of the video game music remixes and the music from the Newgrounds Audio Portal including that epic hardcore song ""Through the Fire and Flames"".The two ships ""Star Runner"" and ""Dragon Fire"" are very good for the suicidal difficulty and I still consider it as very good skill. But it isn't even part of faking expert skills.Not to mention that this game is actually rated E (for everyone) by ESRB.Here also comes my facts involving myself for this game in this reviewI had chosen this game as my primary favorite game of the music-based procedural generation game collection because I wanted to enjoy shooting down the enemies & bosses, dodging their attacks & hulls and especially avoid losing lives & failing the music.What I actually enjoy in this game...is by absolutely playing my favorite video game music remixes, metal covers and medleys by Jonny Atma, DJ the S and the OverClocked ReMix community. Not just those kinds but also my favorite music from the Newgrounds Audio Portal since I've also known many of my favorite music from there since my childhood and even my favorite I Wanna Be The Guy fangames. Nintendo game, Touhou and Castlevania music for the win too!It's also pretty funny that...I identify gender for the ships as I refer the star runner ship as a female and the dragon fire ship as a male but even every bosses as males too. But enemies are genderless or maybe males also, I decide.I also do YouTube videos of my completion runs of every songs I play in this game like replays and memories both together but on my alternate channel about getting high scores on the songs in the music powered games like this game ""Beat Hazard"".Anyway, I am hoping that I can complete all of my favorite video game music remixes/metal covers/medleys in this game ever. It will be an epic piece of the sweetest cake and even a mastery diamond medal for doing all of those on the suicidal difficulty. I'll nail it. (Get the hint about a mastery diamond medal? Yep, mastery mode from Bloons TD 5 on platforms rather than web and diamond medal from Bloons Super Monkey 2 on mobile)You and I should actually start off with the GaMetal music of ""Beware the Forest's Mushrooms"" (from Super Mario RPG) and the Touhou Remix Project music ""Miko Xanadu"" (by DJ the S) if we are really fans of Nintendo and Touhou though. Cool, huh?			"

+Using your music as the soundtrack is not just a gimmick+Perks and upgrades give you a reason to keep playing+Classic pick up and play arcade style gameplay-Visuals will give some fatal seizures (do NOT play if you have epilepsy)-With perks it can become easy-Your music taste will affect your enjoyment of the game.If Geometry Wars and Winamp had a baby they would name it Beat Hazard.

Once you get a good feel for it, it quickly becomes one of, if not THE MOST intense games you'll ever play...depending on what music you play of course...But if you know me and the music I listen to, then you can safely assume that every song I play is virtually guaranteed to give anyone 10 or younger a seizure.

												After 10+ hours I can say one can't GET epilepsy. So I will still play the game :DStill this can't be good for eyes.-----------------------------------------------Edit to add something as someone didn't like my suggestion (1/2) so turning it into a review:The game is pretty fast paced. And slow songs won't make the game easier. You can play with any song and the game includes radio stations. The key of surviving a song is how  long it is as you don't get extra lives during it, but extra bombs every X minutes. On regular songs once on the middle.You can adjust the difficulty level and you can unlock harder difficulties.You can adjust the visual impact 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 and 200% depending on how mad you want to become after your session.There are powerups to increase damage and volume of the music and point multipliers. You can unlock to get more bombs, increase the multipliers for not shooting and surviving and get powerups from the start of the level.Some achievements are easy some are hard and other seem impossibru. Maybe on easier modes, but then you will get bored of the level to get them. I played on difficult all the game but had to move to suicide -there's a harder mode- to be able to get more than 1 million points on a short song (1 m points on all default songs achievement). Will have to reduce difficulty to be able to survive a long enough song to defeat 8 bosses, they appear not regularly, you may not find any on 3-4 minutes and suddenly be fighting two at the same time.I always liked those ships shooters and I enjoyed this one a lot. I can't do other thing than recommend you all and invite you to survive to your favourite songs on this excellent game.I'm going to try to get the dlc on a cheap price during sales to get the new ships with different weaponry.

												Beat Hazard is a fantastic idea. You get into a game, with a smooth gameplay with a rather odd idea, combined with a nice arcade game. This combination somehow turned out great, the game runs in harmony with either music from their libaries, radio or your own music library. Gamespeed dependent on the speed / strenght of the current playing song, that you choose yourself. I find it fun, challenging and a nice game to make time pass by with. You will probably also end up battling your friends in the Deathmatch mode, to see who's got the best score. Worth the money, if you're looking for a small fun casual game.			"

												Beat Hazard is a top-down procedurally generated shooter which takes your music files and generates waves of enemies that synchronize to the music. The purpose is to get a high score, while using various power ups (volume, multipliers, points, etc) to facilitate this score. As you play, there are a series of upgrades which can modify your game to allow for different challenges and playstyles.Ultimately, it's a fun top-down bullet hell shooter which has a good bit of variety. Worth a look if those sorts of games interest you.			"

												A great game to kill time, pretty easy though even at the hardest difficulty, If you let yourself get distracted then of course it will be hard, you just have to be concentrated which of course can be hard after a while but the game itself is pretty easy and can be fun to play sometimes.I'd suggest it to any arcade, Shoot 'Em Up and casual games who likes having their music playing while gaming.7.5/10			"

												Fast paced music-driven bullet hell game where you pick any song from your computer and an unique level for that mp3 is generated. This 360° shooter will require the finest reflexes and coordination at the higher difficulties. As soon as the beat drops, your screen will be filled with amazing light effects (epilepsy warning!). As you progress through the game, you will unlock perks to maximise score as well as higher difficulties.			"

												A twin-stick shooter, mixed with an Audiosurf-style music engine, mixed with a dance party. Beat Hazard is a flashy, spectacular, intense game that looks glorious on your big-screen TV... unless you're epileptic. Its built-in soundtrack is a groovy electronica mix of various indie artists and styles, but in Beat Hazard you can never complain about the crap music, since it hooks in to your own music library.As a twin-stick shooter it's more style than substance. The controls are decent, your weapons range from tiny lasers to huge lasers (depending on the intensity of your music at any given time), and there's a range of enemies. But it's not the game you play when you want a twin-stick shooter.It's great when you set it on ""Easy"", put on some music you like, get a drink, treat it as a WinAmp visualiser, and chillax the heck out.Get the ""Ultra"" version, which makes the shooter part of the game a bit more varied.Recommendation: buy.

												Beat Hazard was one of the first indie games that really stuck out and stayed with me, even after five years. It has a staying power that the likes of Audiosurf doesn't have, because unlike the aforementioned, Beat Hazard has an overwhelming sense of style with the blinding, epilepsy-inducing light show it puts out and the fast-paced carnage that plays like ADHD bullet hell on the higher difficulties, except the enemy ships are the bullets. Audiosurf is more of a pretty looking acid trip with confusing and distracting color-matching mechanics, while Beat Hazard stays true to its concept of an arcade space shooter that turns everything up to eleven and adds some bass boost in the mix. Once the hours you spend into the game pay off and you start to master the highest difficulty, all the chaos comes into place in full clarity, and you suddenly play the role of conductor in a controlled cacophony with a stupidly big grin on your face.The result is as approachable yet always thrilling as it is visually arresting and immensely replayable. A combination of classic Asteroids mechanics and procedural generation by music, included in the package are tons of unlockables and power-ups, online play and co-op, modes like survival and boss rush, great additional content, and Steam Workshop.Simply put, it's one of my favorite indie games of all time, and the best twin-stick space shooter there ever will be, in my opinion.

												If you love music, space action, and the thrill of the risk of having a seizure, then you will love this game! The difficulty of the higher settings may be a turn-off to some, but If you play at a comfortable level it's a blast to play. While it is essentially a very flashy and syncronized game of Asteroids, it is something to behold if you enjoy both games and music.One thing you want before this game is fast, energetic music. Slower songs tend to be a bit of a drag to play, and really slow everything down to a screeching halt. If all you listen to is acoustic guitar ballads and the occasional ambient music, this game may not be for you. This game works best with faster music, obviously, so if you have some dubstep, punk, high-energy electronic or metal on there you will have a blast.			"

												one of the most original ideas for a game. got this 50% off on a sale and its well worth it.your ship is literally powered by the music although sadly if you like slow and relaxing music you are gonna have a hell lot slower and weaker gameplay.pop in some loud,pumpy songs and your screen will blast away with colours everywhere(might want to tone it down a bit for people that can get seizures and a little dizzy with too much flashes on screen like me, which thankfully they added the option to)but lets be honest, this game is pretty much just 1 game with 1 area. yes there is randomized enemy and bosses but the level variations will only keep your attention for so long even when playing a cr@p ton of songs. which is why im not exactly willing to spend full price on this one and so is the dlc.dlc seems to add a bit more in the game so if you like it, then getting the dlc is recommended since it adds a bunch of new stuff like bosses and etc. this game is also supported with staem workshop but for now there are only mods for your plane skin and such.fun little game that can probably kill a few hours depending on your songs.

Beat hazard is my dream come true. Before Beat Hazard I would Cry in the corner of my room wishing there was a game where I could fly around space blowing everything up while blasting weeaboo and simultaniously melting my corneas.  Then one day while browsing through the humble bundle, there was Beat Hazard. I instantly emptied all of my money into this bundle just for Beat Hazard and the next thing I knew I was taken on a journey through space blasting space junk to Van Halen's Runnin with the devil. All while breaking analog sticks on my controller and bleeding through my eyes. Would definitely recomend for the full price.10/10 would shoot spaceships to a recording of Morgan Freemans voice again.			"

""I'm better than this,"" I thought; I retried and my little spaceship just crashed and crashed and crashed, and apparently I wasn't better than that.Then I played some more, and eventually gained some levels. I got bonuses helping me to survive.  I started to be able to discern my ship amongst the chaos of drifting blocks and waves of enemies and homing missiles; I killed the first boss and then another; I completed the first song in survival mode and I just couldn't stop playing.Stupid addictive game.

The game is a source of untold joy, having brought the wonders of synesthesia and/or ocular hemorrhage to you kids at home. It has shown entire generations the true meaning of life, and, in one case, actually caused a blind man to see again, albeit in an enitrely new spectrum not known to mankind.In summation, the game is the beautiful love-child of Asteroids, Geometry Wars, Audiosurf, and an epileptic seizure in a neon paint store. Spend the ten bucks, you cheap dou­che, and your eyeballs and your ears will love you forever.Or you might go blind. It's hard to tell.			"

												UPDATED - New SHADOW OPERATIONS dlc has been released and thus has changed the scoring for this game.Game: Beat Hazard UltraGenre: Music ShooterDeveloper: Cold Beam GamesSystem: Steam (PC)Total Score: 88/100Value Score: 8.8/10• Story: */10o The game has no storyline whatsoever.• Characters: 8/10o There are no actual characters in the game but the objects within the game feature themselves as a type of character. You have several types of enemies with all sorts of appearances and attacks that come in many forms and shapes. There are about 3-4 different type of bosses each with unique form and attack. There are also mini boss versions of the bosses. There's also the player character or player characters if you go multiplayer. UPDATE - There are more ships now to play as than before and now the option to play as community created ships makes the selection quite appealing.• GamePlay: 10/10o The game is like a Japanese side scroller shooter which you play as a vehicle and destroy objects that come towards you in the form of meteors, debris, enemy ships, or just giant creatures. You must destroy them to get points and power ups which can do a multitude of things such as a multipler which can increase your score, a P power up which increases your attack power, a VOL power up which increases the volume of the music (in which affects your basic shooting attack pattern and burst shot). You can pretty much use the built in music collection or import your own tracks to play in the background of the game. The music affects your shot attacks, affects the enemy presence and how some power ups are distributed or appear - it is all based on Rhythm or the beat of the game. You have the choice to play single player, multiplayer, boss mode (which you fight bosses non-stop), or even the ability to play the classic Beat Hazard game upon start up for a different visual appearance and different UI. There are ranks which you can achieve based on raking up points from each game you do along with the fact you can unlock/use bonuses in the form of perks you can equip to make things interesting such as increased difficulty or giving you a boost of power in the beginning of a game.• Graphics: 7/10o Although the game isnt as graphic intense as most other recent games the game shines at its own creativity. The music itself develops the intensity of the lighting and special effects - depending on the rhythm different colors and splashes may occur which adds variety to the game and gives you a adrenaline rush feeling. However its best to stay back otherwise you'll have a high chance of getting a Seizure (as the game warns you as well when you start it).• Sound: 7/10o The game has basic sound effects for explosions, attacks and going through the menu. It feels and sounds like you are literally in a early 1990s or a late 1980s game which is quite nostalgic. There are no voice overs or anything unless you count what you hear in the music or the built in radio.• Music: 10/10o The game features a set of tracks already built in along with some radio stations for players who have no music on their computer. The reason why this aspect receives a perfect score is the ability to add your own music to the game which is the ultimate option for this aspect.• Length: 6/10o Because the game consists of a side scroller shooter with limited music (and you can add more music) with no direction or storyline the game's length is quite minimal. There are ranks and bonuses in the form of perks you can unlock however should only take you no more than 3 hours to get everything unlocked. UPDATE - Due to the inclusion of the Shadow Operations DLC - there's more to unlock in terms of content (ships) and ranks.• Replay Value: 10/10o Although the game has no direction, it allows you to pave your own direction with the ability to put your own music you can play this game and get a different result each time you play. Every game is absolutely different. If single player isnt enough to satisfy your hunger you can do multiplayer co-op or even competitive. There's also boss mode and of course you add music tracks of your own to change up the pace of the game. You can also unlock additional difficulties through perks.• Player Value: 10/10o This game is absolutely recommended especially for fans of the music genre, love music and loves shooters. The game is also a great multiplayer experience as you can play all the modes in competitive or co-op (this includes the boss rush mode). You can import your own music or use the built in music or radio stations to give you a different experience each time you play. This is a great game for both hardcore fanatics who want to brag about points or compete with each other and super casuals who just want something to spend time on even if it is for just one game.

												Beat Hazard is a fun shmup with the enjoyable aspect of combining your music with the game play. I really enjoy that there are preconfigured techno internet radio stations built in that I was able to just click and play as I do not keep music on my system. The leveling component of the game is also quite enjoyable as it gives you continual rewards for playing what basically amounts to an arcade game, while at the same time modifying that game through the unlocked modifiers. Also particles are pretty...			"

												Its alright for a few minutes at a time.  Gameplay is interesting in concept, and the music idea is fun.  BUT, the controls are very average, the levels fairly repetitive so far, some of the controls dont seem to work properly (Ive never been able to fire a bomb or whatever other crap the game has).  Remapping the keys helped.  The visuals are REALLY annoying and just serve as a distraction to gameplay.  The game also ""rewards"" you by having the bonuses / power-ups sometimes shoot off screen so quickly, I often dont bother even going for them unless they are close.So far, levelling up has given me no noticeable improvements other than ""perks"" which dont seem to do much or the game has done a very poor job of explaining how the perks work.  The built in music is REALLY repetitive too, and while I like dance / trance, these tracks all sound kinda the same.If you pick up this game on a super special for $1 or $2 then get it, otherwise dont bother.

Tons of bright lights and loud music is exactly this kind of thing I love, however, and if you think you might as well, give this game a shot.

												I'm not much of an Audiosurf fan, but this game is awesome. I love shooter-sidescrolling games and survival challenges and music, so it's a lot of fun to play when you want to kill some time and listen to music before going to work. I love the bosses and the different enemy types. They really make you work hard when trying to survive, especially when you don't finish them off and your whole screen is covered in bosses trying to kill you. But, people with seizures and epilepsy and sensitive eyes- this game will definitely give you a headache. I've had to use motion sickness pills in order to play it. Worth it, though, to have something fun to do while listening to your favorite songs.			"

												Beat Hazard was one of the first indie games that really stuck out and stayed with me, even after five years. It has a staying power that the likes of Audiosurf doesn't have, because unlike the aforementioned, Beat Hazard has an overwhelming sense of style with the blinding, epilepsy-inducing light show it puts out and the fast-paced carnage that plays like ADHD bullet hell on the higher difficulties, except the enemy ships are the bullets. Audiosurf is more of a pretty looking acid trip with confusing and distracting color-matching mechanics, while Beat Hazard stays true to its concept of an arcade space shooter that turns everything up to eleven and adds some bass boost in the mix. Once the hours you spend into the game pay off and you start to master the highest difficulty, all the chaos comes into place in full clarity, and you suddenly play the role of conductor in a controlled cacophony with a stupidly big grin on your face.The result is as approachable yet always thrilling as it is visually arresting and immensely replayable. A combination of classic Asteroids mechanics and procedural generation by music, included in the package are tons of unlockables and power-ups, online play and co-op, modes like survival and boss rush, great additional content, and Steam Workshop.Simply put, it's one of my favorite indie games of all time, and the best twin-stick space shooter there ever will be, in my opinion.

												Beat Hazard is a lot of fun to play in short bursts, but gets samey after a while (unless you're the sort of person for whom beating a worldwide high score is as gratifying as seeing your child's smile). If you often find yourself in situations where you need to kill 15-30 minutes, Beat Hazard will do the trick nicely. The Ultra DLC is worthwhile and changes the gameplay in significant ways, Shadow Operations DLC is basically extra grind.Keep in mind that the game does not support Unicode, so if your music files are tagged with non-Latin characters, you will be staring at rows of question marks instead of artist and track names.

												This game is extremely addicting. One time my brother was playing while we were in the car, and we had a wifi hotspot you know, and we went through this safari thing that you drive through, and he was just playing beat hazard on his laptop when a giraffe stuck its head through the window and licked the boy's hands, tragically glueing them to the keyboard, we had to swing the car around, tire tracks dug through the dirt, kicking dirt into all of the animal's eyes as we rushed to the emergency room for my crying beat hazard obsessed brother who got a new laptop that day. and new fingertips. (im doing this for a badge but in all seriousness this game is hella fun)			"

												I bought this game since I wanted to partake in the Steam treasurehunt. Not exactly my kind of game, but it was really cheap. I started the game, managed to play for about 30 seconds and then lost horribly. ""I'm better than this,"" I thought; I retried and my little spaceship just crashed and crashed and crashed, and apparently I wasn't better than that.Then I played some more, and eventually gained some levels. I got bonuses helping me to survive.  I started to be able to discern my ship amongst the chaos of drifting blocks and waves of enemies and homing missiles; I killed the first boss and then another; I completed the first song in survival mode and I just couldn't stop playing.Stupid addictive game.

												Just a heads up: Do NOT buy this game if you suffer epilepsy or something like that. There are a TON of flashing lights in this game.I remember a year or so ago that I first heard of it in a video I can't remember what it was about. I decided to get it since I was kinda curious and I liked the idea of gameplay based on music, as I enjoyed audiosurf myself. It kinda just sat there for a while. And with a while I mean over a year. So now I tried it again and played some vidya tunes on it. And I must say, it's quite enjoyable.To put it simply, this is a 2D, dare I say arcade-like shooter. But the 'levels' to put it like there are based of the soundtrack you choose, and the more intense the music is, the more things happen on the screen. There's probably also something with the rhythm, but I didn't notice it all that much. But I'm probably missing something. There are different enemies and bosses. Most of them vary from size, projectiles, and movement paths, to put it like that. That's really all I can say for the enemies. Oh right there are bosses as well I suppose.There are also perks you can unlock by playing (or that is part of the ultra DLC pack. Which I think it is.), Which are basically bonuses to help you out, or unlock some new stuff.In the end. I can recommend this game if you have some money in your steam wallet which you don't know what to spend it on, if it's on sale, or you are just curious. I myself think this is a pretty good game to play if you're bored and want to shoot things while listening to any song from Metal Gear Rising or any Pursuit theme from Ace Attorney. That's simply the best thing.			"

												Beat Hazard is a top-down procedurally generated shooter which takes your music files and generates waves of enemies that synchronize to the music. The purpose is to get a high score, while using various power ups (volume, multipliers, points, etc) to facilitate this score. As you play, there are a series of upgrades which can modify your game to allow for different challenges and playstyles.Ultimately, it's a fun top-down bullet hell shooter which has a good bit of variety. Worth a look if those sorts of games interest you.			"

												Beat Hazard is a game that is difficult review because everyone is going to have a different experience. So  I'm simply going  to share my experience with Beat hazard. Beat hazard is my dream come true. Before Beat Hazard I would Cry in the corner of my room wishing there was a game where I could fly around space blowing everything up while blasting weeaboo and simultaniously melting my corneas.  Then one day while browsing through the humble bundle, there was Beat Hazard. I instantly emptied all of my money into this bundle just for Beat Hazard and the next thing I knew I was taken on a journey through space blasting space junk to Van Halen's Runnin with the devil. All while breaking analog sticks on my controller and bleeding through my eyes. Would definitely recomend for the full price.10/10 would shoot spaceships to a recording of Morgan Freemans voice again.			"

												UPDATED - New SHADOW OPERATIONS dlc has been released and thus has changed the scoring for this game.Game: Beat Hazard UltraGenre: Music ShooterDeveloper: Cold Beam GamesSystem: Steam (PC)Total Score: 88/100Value Score: 8.8/10• Story: */10o The game has no storyline whatsoever.• Characters: 8/10o There are no actual characters in the game but the objects within the game feature themselves as a type of character. You have several types of enemies with all sorts of appearances and attacks that come in many forms and shapes. There are about 3-4 different type of bosses each with unique form and attack. There are also mini boss versions of the bosses. There's also the player character or player characters if you go multiplayer. UPDATE - There are more ships now to play as than before and now the option to play as community created ships makes the selection quite appealing.• GamePlay: 10/10o The game is like a Japanese side scroller shooter which you play as a vehicle and destroy objects that come towards you in the form of meteors, debris, enemy ships, or just giant creatures. You must destroy them to get points and power ups which can do a multitude of things such as a multipler which can increase your score, a P power up which increases your attack power, a VOL power up which increases the volume of the music (in which affects your basic shooting attack pattern and burst shot). You can pretty much use the built in music collection or import your own tracks to play in the background of the game. The music affects your shot attacks, affects the enemy presence and how some power ups are distributed or appear - it is all based on Rhythm or the beat of the game. You have the choice to play single player, multiplayer, boss mode (which you fight bosses non-stop), or even the ability to play the classic Beat Hazard game upon start up for a different visual appearance and different UI. There are ranks which you can achieve based on raking up points from each game you do along with the fact you can unlock/use bonuses in the form of perks you can equip to make things interesting such as increased difficulty or giving you a boost of power in the beginning of a game.• Graphics: 7/10o Although the game isnt as graphic intense as most other recent games the game shines at its own creativity. The music itself develops the intensity of the lighting and special effects - depending on the rhythm different colors and splashes may occur which adds variety to the game and gives you a adrenaline rush feeling. However its best to stay back otherwise you'll have a high chance of getting a Seizure (as the game warns you as well when you start it).• Sound: 7/10o The game has basic sound effects for explosions, attacks and going through the menu. It feels and sounds like you are literally in a early 1990s or a late 1980s game which is quite nostalgic. There are no voice overs or anything unless you count what you hear in the music or the built in radio.• Music: 10/10o The game features a set of tracks already built in along with some radio stations for players who have no music on their computer. The reason why this aspect receives a perfect score is the ability to add your own music to the game which is the ultimate option for this aspect.• Length: 6/10o Because the game consists of a side scroller shooter with limited music (and you can add more music) with no direction or storyline the game's length is quite minimal. There are ranks and bonuses in the form of perks you can unlock however should only take you no more than 3 hours to get everything unlocked. UPDATE - Due to the inclusion of the Shadow Operations DLC - there's more to unlock in terms of content (ships) and ranks.• Replay Value: 10/10o Although the game has no direction, it allows you to pave your own direction with the ability to put your own music you can play this game and get a different result each time you play. Every game is absolutely different. If single player isnt enough to satisfy your hunger you can do multiplayer co-op or even competitive. There's also boss mode and of course you add music tracks of your own to change up the pace of the game. You can also unlock additional difficulties through perks.• Player Value: 10/10o This game is absolutely recommended especially for fans of the music genre, love music and loves shooters. The game is also a great multiplayer experience as you can play all the modes in competitive or co-op (this includes the boss rush mode). You can import your own music or use the built in music or radio stations to give you a different experience each time you play. This is a great game for both hardcore fanatics who want to brag about points or compete with each other and super casuals who just want something to spend time on even if it is for just one game.

												Pros:Incredibly hard difficulties are opportune for those who are well practiced in surpassing impossible odds.Fast music means fast gameplay, and stong elements of bass, wild riffs, and resonsant harmonies ALL add to the overall power of your guns. I highly recommend going to bandcamp and getting The Helix Nebula - Meridian.LOTS of arcade style replay value. If you're into arcade gaming, and this style of game that is.Lots of records to beat, and things to unlock. I love unlocking things in arcade games.------Cons:DLC is too pricey at full price for what you get. Recommend spending no more then 2-4 for Ultra, and 2-3 for Shadow Ops.They make you pay for access to workshop elements. I mean seriously... I don't really use workshop on anything, but... WTF?Bosses and waves occur at same times every song, every game. Not much variation, and would be cool if it synched bosses with the strongest points of the songs. Some songs have lulls aligned with boss fights, and that's a death sentence.Full price for game is much like the full price for DLC. A bit too high.------Would I recommend this?...If you like arcade games, or hate not being able to listen to your own music with your games often, YES.If you get tired of repetitive challenges, Don't like to challenege yourself with insane difficulty settings, or focus too much on the negatives of things rather enjoying what you've got, No. This game has simplicity, and should be enjoyed with simplicity.

Along with the added variety of the extra ships offerd in DLC, the hilarious custom ships you can download and even just hanging out and listening to some tunes.

												Audiosurf meets Asteroids. A quirky combination that provides for a very different take on your usual music and rhythm game. Various powerups, enemy ships, and bosses allow this game to be different from others in its genre.One note though, I would recommend picking this game up as the Complete Collection, as you won't be able to use your iTunes library without the converter DLC, and the Ultra DLC provides bonus game modes and difficulties. I was able to snag the whole package during a Steam Sale for under $5, if that helps.			"

												[9/10]Best game about music i've ever played. But be careful with this game(after 1 hour my eyes was like a bullsh*t).But anyway its good game. You can play with your friend on 1 pc(but you need controller for this. Also here is online multiplayer,so you can play with other people all over the world. After update developers added workshop! Now people creates ship for themselves and community! I realy like this game but you should be careful(dont play a lot or your eyes will explode).			"

												I'm sure i cant say anything that hasn't already been said about this game. Its a very common type of shooter with its own unique (and rather wonderful) twist: it plays to your music. Every album you own becomes a fight for survival as you dodge lasers, asteroids and giant boss ships, and fight back with guitar riffs and heavy bass. Did i mention its also very beautiful to look at? The amazing use of color makes it feel like a graphic equalizer as your lasers pulse to the beat. play to your favorite songs, or play against your friends and try to beat their high score for their favorite. (when writing this) I haven't even played for an hour yet and i can tell this is a game i will be coming back to often.Pros- Varying difficulty for different skill groups- neverending replayablilty - each track is a new challenge- visually good to look at- with the Shadow Operatives DLC you can fly whatever ship you want. care to pilot an X-wing while listening to the Duel of Fates? Or maybe you'd rather fly a hippie van while chilling out with Jimmie Hendrix. If you have even a little skill with photoshop or even free software like gimp you can turn a png of your vessle into a usable spacecraft.cons - i dont want to imply this game is Perfect for everybody, but i cannot find any real flaws in this game... except maybe for those people who try playing to Taylor Swift...

												Beat Hazard is a lot of fun to play in short bursts, but gets samey after a while (unless you're the sort of person for whom beating a worldwide high score is as gratifying as seeing your child's smile). If you often find yourself in situations where you need to kill 15-30 minutes, Beat Hazard will do the trick nicely. The Ultra DLC is worthwhile and changes the gameplay in significant ways, Shadow Operations DLC is basically extra grind.Keep in mind that the game does not support Unicode, so if your music files are tagged with non-Latin characters, you will be staring at rows of question marks instead of artist and track names.

												Pros:Incredibly hard difficulties are opportune for those who are well practiced in surpassing impossible odds.Fast music means fast gameplay, and stong elements of bass, wild riffs, and resonsant harmonies ALL add to the overall power of your guns. I highly recommend going to bandcamp and getting The Helix Nebula - Meridian.LOTS of arcade style replay value. If you're into arcade gaming, and this style of game that is.Lots of records to beat, and things to unlock. I love unlocking things in arcade games.------Cons:DLC is too pricey at full price for what you get. Recommend spending no more then 2-4 for Ultra, and 2-3 for Shadow Ops.They make you pay for access to workshop elements. I mean seriously... I don't really use workshop on anything, but... WTF?Bosses and waves occur at same times every song, every game. Not much variation, and would be cool if it synched bosses with the strongest points of the songs. Some songs have lulls aligned with boss fights, and that's a death sentence.Full price for game is much like the full price for DLC. A bit too high.------Would I recommend this?...If you like arcade games, or hate not being able to listen to your own music with your games often, YES.If you get tired of repetitive challenges, Don't like to challenege yourself with insane difficulty settings, or focus too much on the negatives of things rather enjoying what you've got, No. This game has simplicity, and should be enjoyed with simplicity.

												PEW PEW PEW PEW!!! imma space ship ! haha die other ships AHH SEIZURE!!!!a brilliantly addictive game, easy to learn how to play hard to master. The BIGGEST annoyance i had with this game is that you cant turn the visuals down more 50% is still pretty damn intense for someone who has severe light sensitivity playing this game for the first time not know what to expect other than there might be some flashing images, i was nearly blinded. so a more adequate warning would of been nice.another reason it would of been nice to have the viual intensity as a scrolling bar going from 0 to 250 ( who the hell played like that) if because even at 50% the viual intensity can cause you to lose track of where you are very very easy, a lot of the time when i died it was because i couldnt see where i was.if you can get past the visual raving seizure fest then inside this flailing package is an amazingly addictive game whos legnth is only determined by how much music you havereveiw word of the day : SPELLING!

Originally posted by CynicalPopcorn:OH FOR F*** SAKE I DIED RIGHT AT THE END OF THE SONG F***... F*** this game. I love it.CynicalPopcorn's HIGHLY Recommended! | 9.75/10Good value for money? YES!WARNING:The game has a LOT of bright, flashing lights and as such people with photosensitivity issues should take this into consideration.Beat Hazard SummaryA twin stick shooter not only powered by music, but powered by YOUR music! Beat Hazard takes your songs and puts you into a world of intense, twin-stick shooter action. The music you play really impacts the flow of the game from the enemies that spawn to how fast and frantic movement on the screen is, especially when taking into account the wonderful, very bright visuals.The game alone, ""regular"" Beat Hazard is awesome, however for the TRUE feel of the game purchasing the entire set of DLC is worth every penny. The ""Ultra"" DLC adds more ranks, new enemy, higher difficulty and improves the game all round. Then, to add to this chaos, the ""Shadow Operations Unit"" DLC adds a VERY nice element of challenge that adds a new ranking system along side the normal one which rewards the player for completing challenges. This, however, is not easy as a death during a challenge will set you back. Be it that the current song does not count towards a total of songs completed on 'x' difficulty, or that you lose ALL (yes, all) progress in that challenge, deaths are even more unbearable than usual.Please note: In order to use songs from iTunes you will need to purchase the ""iTunes & m4a file support"" DLC. It's cheap, and I understand why they've done it. You're best off buying the mega bundle anyway as all the DLC is worth it.ProsExcellent top-down, twin-stick shooter powered by your music library!Good difficulty curve that gets VERY tough at high difficulties.Incredibly fun to play!Great replayability - Many different enemies, bosses, gamemodes and each song is unique.Co-op or Competetive multiplayer fun.Gamemodes are very interesting and well done!Custom made ships that are actually quite balanced!ConsFlashing lights. Very bright flashing lights to be precise. A BIG WARNING to those who suffer from photosensitivity issues.JudgementBeat Hazard gets CynicalPopcorn's HIGHLY recommended judgement with a score of 9.75/10.The game is extremely fun with very high replayability. Difficulty is fair and the visuals are lovely. All-round well made twin-stick shooter that should not be overlooked by those who enjoy similar games like Audiosurf (music aspect) and want to try it with a bullet-hell twist.Also, yes that is a genuine quote. This game and I have an unstable relationship of me mostly yelling cause I play poorly followed by myself immediately crawling right back to it.			"

												A twin stick shooter that was made by a man who loves addictive gameplay as much as he hates epileptics. It's like Audiosurf's more aggressive and rave-y cousin. Very fun and overlooked, with its only real flaws being that it works best with very fast-paced music and that visual intensity affects score. Comes with a nice default library of songs that are fun to play and surprisingly good listening.  It also has a very interesting perk system that forces you to decide between the safety net of extra weapons/power-ups and boosting your multipliers to get the highest score possible.			"

												At the time I was clueless as to why I was sitting in the holding cell. I had finished another terse interrogation consisting of a lot of shouting on the part of my interviewer and my characteristic recalcitrant silence. I was thrown back into my cell and made to await more verbal abuse from the world's greatest state sanctioned gang. Suddenly, there was a great cacophony that sounded like trumpets and dying men. The walls around me crumbled and my interrogator had lost his eyes and was bleeding from them. An angel bore a standard on his wings and it was the sign of the cross. Finally, Jesus Christ had acknowledged I was the true savior of the universe and my time here was done.			"

												Beat Hazard is probably one of the more unique bullet hell style games, with a monstrous fit of strobe lights thrown in. That being said, it does go well off of the beat of the music, and of course the volume is pretty well worthless, but if you want to max your firepower, you need it. Outside of that, it's really fun, and quite challenging if you have lots of lulls in your music.			"

												Beat Hazard, in its current state, is just fun. Few frills and straight to the point, this game does what you'd think and delivers on its promise. It's sanely priced, developed by an indie programmer (as indie as it gets, in fact; it's one guy working by himself), and very slim on file size, so it's a purchase that'd be hard to regret.So, if you're looking to kill time in between more expansive titles or feel you're not exploiting your music collection enough, this is almost a no-brainer.

Depending on the intensity of the music, that's how much you can shoot and how aggressive the enemies are. If you get hooked to this thing, it will absorb you for a looooong time.Best played with really intense music that pumps you full of adrenaline. Try to beat one of your favorite epic rocking tracks on Insane or Suicidal. I DARE you!WARNING: Not reccomended for people prone to epileptic fits.

												Either I'm high, the end of the world is near or this is all a dream and I've taken the role of Bruce Willis because any of these situations would make more sense than a game like this one actually being enjoyable. Beat Hazard is your standard Bullet Hell game where you are once again playing as a genocidal spaceship shooting down anything that doesn't get swallowed up and added to a multiplier. However the special twist it's got to keep it from being run of the mill is that it prides itself on being ""powered by your music"" . Now I know you've heard it a million times before and every single time it was just ""your music plays in the background when the function decides to actually cooperate"" cleverly disguised but Beat Hazard actually stays strong to the claim. There really is a very noticeable difference between playing classical music and playing fasted tempo trance. Beat Hazard is truly a fun Bullet Hell game and I am going to have to wash my mouth out for reading that aloud so this better at least convince someone to try it.			"

												If you love music and video game shooters, this is the game for you!I never play anything like this genre because I'm not into such, but boy do I love this one, not only the shooting can be really fun, but you can also play your favorite music!It's quite a beautiful game to look at, all the colors and the effects are amazing, just be careful with the intensity of the lights, I choose 50% (min), but you can go up to 200%, but I don't recommend it because it ain't good for your eyes and on top of that it's harder to play.Which brings me to difficulties.Playing on easiest it's just for chilling really, but you can go as high as Suicidal! Best way for me personally is hardcore, because I love my music to be heavy.I got this as a bundle years ago, but it's totally worth the asking price, if this review doesn't sell you over, try it out for a lower discounted price as it is now, but I'm sure you won't regret it!And to the developer, thank you so much for bringing two of my favorite things ever into an awesome package!

												Developed by Cold Beam Games in an underground bunker where a separate team was trying to resurrect Jesus Christ. This may or may not be relevant.A game so utter in its simplicity, yet so GLORIOUS in its execution, Beat Hazard has resulted in thousands of murder-suicides across the globe, the perpetrators generally reasoning that the rest of the world is now ""just one big letdown"". The game is a source of untold joy, having brought the wonders of synesthesia and/or ocular hemorrhage to you kids at home. It has shown entire generations the true meaning of life, and, in one case, actually caused a blind man to see again, albeit in an enitrely new spectrum not known to mankind.In summation, the game is the beautiful love-child of Asteroids, Geometry Wars, Audiosurf, and an epileptic seizure in a neon paint store. Spend the ten bucks, you cheap dou­che, and your eyeballs and your ears will love you forever.Or you might go blind. It's hard to tell.			"

Deciding to make the workshop available ONLY with DLC was a LAME unnecessary and greedy choice for this developer. Workshop content can keep a game fresh and new thus keeping it alive with community driven content. Making this a PAY feature was a very poor choice and I can only hope other developers don’t start a trend of making the workshop a pay feature as well. That aside, the game is fun and coded expertly and at times just amazing to watch.			"

												If you're searching for a rhythm game which at least somehow relates to the music you play to (in comparison to some other games *cough*), Beat Hazard is in my opinion the way to go. Along with the currently available DLC's, it adds up to a versatile casual game you can enjoy your music to (Or smack kitties with your keyboard if you try to get all of the achievements/perks/unlocks/whatever).GAMEPLAY:The gameplay is rather simple. It's Asteroids with the pace of the game adjusting to the pace of the music you chose. This could be local music or online radio streams (Great Addition, but restricted to the Ultra DLC). There is a little annoying bug which sometimes made my game not play any music anymore when i was playing to radio stations though. Give the game a restart and it was gone. Still annoying.The game also encourages you to play on until you got'em all. Perks, Upgrades (Beat Hazard Ultra DLC) and Ships (Shadow Operations DLC). If you're a completionist, that is. There is no specific reason to get all the unlocks after all.I'd give it a 8,5/10 because of the annoying radio bug (maybe only appearing to me) and the replay value (40 hours for few bucks is quite okay i guess).HOWEVER if you want to enjoy the game to the full potential i would really recommend getting the DLCs as well. It adds up to the game experience greatly as for new, different ships, online radio support, more enemies, more bosses, more modes and so on.			"

I like the variety of gameplay the many different ships add to the game--and there are a nice selection in the base game. With the community's ability to add more ships, though, the possibilities are endless. I've seen some extremely cool community ships in the Workshop that I'll definitely be checking out soon!If you like space shooters and enjoy your music time, I *highly* recommend picking up this game. The price is just right in my opinion, and I'm sure future updates will make the game ever better!			"

												June 4, 2015A solid shooter, not exactly dependent on music. Music intensity affects the spawn of enemies and your firing rate, slowing to a crawl in silent parts. It's nice to play with your music, but this isn't Audiosurf-style interaction. I know the meme is to play with high visual intensity and abuse yourself, but just turn the visuals down to 50%. I wish there was a lower setting than that, as the visuals just cloud everything. No one cares what setting you use.New weapons make tracks more interesting, but the progression system makes the game hardest at the start. I wish there was a difficulty option between Hardcore and Insane, as there is a fair amount of time where you don't have the ship upgrades to reasonably beat long Insane songs, but Hardcore becomes too simple. The Shadow DLC is compelling, adding new ship options and support for auto-fire ships to further increase the variety. However, the DLC does not change the musical interaction, so the gameplay is identical.It's easy to pick up and play, and pretty enjoyable. There's good replayability in theory, but I don't think the shooting is varied enough to come back to it regularly after finishing off all the challenges. Audiosurf has more gameplay options to keep things fresh, but this is still an enjoyable shooter with all the DLC. I'd say $10 USD for the full package would be a great deal, so 30% off everything is pretty fair when that happens.			"

The game could react to the music a bit better sometimes, but it's definitely not worse than any other music game I've played in that regard.I don't see myself playing this for hours, but as something you jump into for a few songs just to turn your brain off for a bit it works excellently and I wholly recommend it.

												Nevermind the seizure-inducing graphics, once you get past the first few headaches this is a really good game. It completely replaced Audiosurf as my go-to music game. It can be easy and relaxing as well as immensely challenging. The game could react to the music a bit better sometimes, but it's definitely not worse than any other music game I've played in that regard.I don't see myself playing this for hours, but as something you jump into for a few songs just to turn your brain off for a bit it works excellently and I wholly recommend it. It's also really really fun.			"

												One of the best games I've ever played.1) Beat Hazard is completely fair, sometimes challenging, well-designed and addictive game.2) The atmosphere of the game welcomes you from the first minutes of your in-game time, because it automatically starts a random song from your computer instead of using special music for menu.3) It will definitely not leave you indifferent, because it uses YOUR favourite music.I actually feel like I fell in love with it <3			"

												Awesome game for people who love to play games that use their music as input. This is one of those Indie games that is really underated. In essance you fly around in a ship, and shoot other ships, and asteroids. The fun thing about it, is that it is randomized based on your music. So if you play a fast song your experience with that level is going to be very different than it would be if you played a slower song. The fact that your music is in essence your randomizer makes this game very replayable.			"

												If you like Audiosurf and if you like Asteroids, Smash TV, or Geometry Wars, you'll like this game.  The modes and powerups are very fun, and the way it plays with musical dynamics to formulate strategy is pretty cool.That said, the game is very intense graphically.  I recommend turning down the effect level (which they wisely allowed) if it makes you uncomfortable (and there's no shame in that.  It takes it up to 11.)That said, the song tends to have less of an effect on the gameplay than I would like.If you like the idea of music fueling strategy for combat, I suggest Touhou Sky Arena as well.

												If you love to listen to music while playing games then this is easily for you.This game almost has infinite replayability since it goes off how much music you have. The only repetitve part is after awhile you'll notice the pattern on enemy types and breeze through it. Beat Hazard allows you to connect a controller to play using dual sticks to move and shoot, I find this to be much easier than using a mouse and keyboard combo.Beat Hazard is a very casual and Hardcore game at the same time due to difficulty stages and your music. If you plan to get this game then you should also get the dlc for it, it allows you to create and play other ships that are on the workshop.			"

												Depending on how intense or soft your music collection is, Beat Hazard is one crazy game.Intense music pushes the limit by adding fast-moving asteroids along with blood-thirsty ships out to destroy you.You try to score as many points as possible while playing your song. If you make it through, you'll move on to the next. Score point and your rank will increase. Every time you reach a new level, there will be favorable bonuses which make you earn points in larger quantities much faster.As your music gets more intense, so do your weapons nad the amount of enemies. The flashing lights may be disorienting after a while, but luckily there's a relax mode like in aaAAaa.The powerups really help you, but I recommend that you clear out the enemies until you go for the powerups.The boss battles are cool too. Depending on your tracks you're playing, it may produce two mini bosses or one big boss.If it goes on sale, I recommend this for everyone.			"

												I have a thing for music games, geometry wars, and asteroids.  Effectively, Beat Hazard is a ombination of all of those things.Because the gameplay is generated by your music your mileage may vary by a lot.  This isn't like Audiorsurf, where each song is playable if boring: certain songs are not playable at all.  The reason behind this is that sometimes nothing can happen in the song you're playing, or worse, monsters might spawn just before you hit a slow point.  The biggest issue with this game is that the music not only dictates monster spawns but also has a direct influence on your basic attack: You will not be able to kill things during quieter parts of the song.  This is absolutely game breaking at times.Still, if you know that you can avoid the problem, and honestly I really like the gameplay.  Beat Hazard has changed a lot over the years, to the point that I don't really recognize it from when I first played it.  There's an overall level up system and some perks, but they're not so important to the gameplay (at least that's my opinion).Unlike audiosurf this is hardly a chillout game.  This isn't something that I'll boot up when I just want to listen to music and maybe have something to do in the background: the gameplay gets pretty intense at times.  It's not necessarily difficult, but it does remind me of how harrowing geometry wars can get.I like this game but I don't play it very often, and gameplay isn't so different between songs that it feels unique.  For the most part each song plays out pretty similarly, which is good and bad.At the end of the day I think you should have this in your library.Oh, but the ♥♥♥♥ing ad that pops up as you're closing the game?  The one that reverses the accept and cancel buttons?  That screen can ♥♥♥♥ off.  Press A to exit, press a to exit, PRESS A TO GO BACK TO THE ♥♥♥♥ING MAIN MENU AND START AGAIN.  Gets me every god damned time.			"

												I'm a huge fan of music in games or games that revolve around music. Recently i started to play Beat Hazard again and purchased the Shadow Operations Unit DLC.GameSo what is this game about. You choose a spaceship, the basic one or the different ships from the Shadow Operations Unit DLC. Then you choose a song, either your own songs or the different ones from the radio stations provided by Beat Hazard. The gameplays consists of you floating around, shooting different enemys to the beat of your favorite songs. There are  four more different game modes.Standart: you basically choose a song and play it.Boss Rush: again you choose a song, but instead of normal enemys you fight only bosses. You have a timer for every boss, meaning if you take your time you can easily have up to 4-5 bosses on screen. Also dont worry the song isn't going to be repeated. You choose a song. From there every song in that folder will be played.Survival: Choose a song where you start off from. After that you basically have to survive wave after wave, like the name of this game mode already suggest. Like in boss rush you start with the song you chose, after that every song in the same folder will be played.Chill out: The same as survival but without lives and scores. You just keep playing until you have enough :DAlso like in boss rush you start with the song you chose, after that every song in the same folder will be played.Perks: While playing songs you collect money that you can use to buy those perks. There are various perks to enhance your overall score for every song, perks for different weapons and shields. The last thing you can unlock with the money are 2 more difficulties.Shadow Operations Unit DLC.The DLC adds different spaceships to the game which all have their own missions. Per spaceship you have 3 missions. You rank up everytime you complete one of those missions. ConclusionBeat Hazard is a really fun game, gameplay is simple but entertaining. I spend 50 hours on this game,  getting the achivements, play the different gamemodes, play multiplayer with friends. The only thing i would have to mention is the DLC. Personally i dont think its worth the 5€. You only get a few different spaceships which, lets be honest, all have the same missions: ""collect this x times""  ""Kill x enemy x times""  ""get x points on x songs on x difficulty"". The ships are kinda interesting and fun to play but i really don't think its worth 5€ considering that you can get spaceships from the steam workshop for free..Nevertheless Beat Hazard is a really good game and will keep you entertained for lots of hours, even without the dlc.

												Beat Hazard is Geometry Wars, but less geometery and more... lights.  Lights everywhere.  Don't play this game if you have a history of Epilepsy.Beat Hazard is a simple game of moving and shooting.  Imagine Galaga with an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of music that the player can import or choose from a variety of music that Cold Beam Games has for it.You control a ship equipped with a laser gun and super bombs.  These can be upgraded later.  Simply point and click to fire your gun.  As you destroy ships, you can collect score multipliers, and bombs.  Along with these you can pick up Volume and Power that adds devastating power to your guns.  As you progress, you encounter a ton of bosses that add challenge and variety to the game.All in all, Beat Hazard deserves more than a mere 70/100 Metascore.  There is very satisfying music with more satisfying guns, and progressive upgrades that add fresh twists to the game amps the replay value. "

												Awesome music-based shmup!The pace and graphics of the game depends entirely on the music playing in the background, so pump in some techno/metal track to get some seriously challenging game ahead, or put in your favorite classical piano piece if you want a more relaxing game session.You can compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards. You can also play cooperatively (Co-op) or competitively (PvP) with a friend, it's extremely fun, especially if you both have the same taste in music.This really is a fun game to pickup and play just a song (or a full album!) every once in a while.I highly recommend getting the Beat Hazard: Ultra DLC (it adds new weapons, new bosses, new game modes, etc.). But since the DLC changes the core gameplay so much, the game still let you choose to play either the Classic or Ultra version on startup!However, I would definitely not recommend this game to people prone to epilepsy. *winks* *winks* *winks*			"

												Beat Hazard is one of the few games out there that actually implements your music and uses it for the enemies in the game. The more powerful your song is and the louder it is, the more damage you do to enemies. Once you've powered up your beam and hit the 'Beat Hazard' level, you'll have no problem taking down enemies with max power!The new Beat Hazard Ultra DLC brings perks, Boss Rush and many more small things to the game. It really adds to the crazy visual effects as well and adds newer bosses, different kinds of enemies and 150% stronger visual effects, too. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who loves music!			"

												8/10This is a fun little time-killer with sick visuals.(I must warn you now that in some cases they're sickening visuals, if I play too long I get a migraine, so be careful)It's a shooter where the waves of creeps and bosses are determined by the music track you choose to play to. If you want a hardcore bullet hell, play a gabba techno level, or some Willie Nelson for a mellow ride.			"

												Muzikos klausimas niekada nebuvo toks įdomus, bosai, priešai, papildomos galios. Visą tai žaidimui suteikia savotišką kabliuką. Tikrai puikus indie žaidimas. Kam patiko Audios Surf ir Simphony patariu išmeginti ir ši žaidimą. 9/10 // Music issue has never been more fun, bosses, enemies, extra power. All this gives the game wonderful atmosphere. Definitely a great indie game. Who liked Audios Surf and Simphony should try this one. My rating 9/10			"

												While i may not get any seizure it still gives my eyes a acid trip.Astroids and music mashed into one,and your own tracks to boot or if you do not own a lot of music you can stream internet radio! Bonus if you love Christmas music they have achievements for that.I love the game it is a good way to relax and listen to music at the same time without it getting annoying like in most games.You can also just let it play music and enjoy the visual if your into that sort of thing,i sometimes double it as a music player.Pros for Beat Hazard classic+Fast paced action with a old school feel for Astroid games+Smooth game play and neat visual effects+Ships to unlock or download from workshop+It is a blast with a friend+It gives you a reason to annoy your neighbors,crank it up!!Cons for Beat Hazard Classic- Can only select songs by folder or individual no options for custom play list- Wish it had an option to customize what type of enimies you face- Can be hard to keep track of things on screen when things get crazy- Wish it had more play styles like Ultra doesPros for Ulta +Fast paced action with a old school feel for Astroid games+Smooth game play and neat visual effects amped up even more+Ships to unlock or download from workshop+Perks system and a hanger to check out your ships with +Last FM built into game+Keyboard Configuration+It is a blast with a friend+Can play the same tracks with friends as long as you both have the same one+It gives you a reason to annoy your neighbors,crank it up!!Cons for Ulta-Can be even harder to keep track of things going on screen even when you turn down visuals-Can have issues with saves due to syncing with cloud issues,i had to delete my save to get it start after re-installing game to play it again,lost progress because of it.- Level 5 badge to unlock a ship:ship is cosmetic but still have to spend money to reach level 5- Can only select songs by folder or individual no options for custom play list- Wish it had an option to customize what type of enimies you face would love to face different ships depening on song and so on but eh again a mior gripe.Make sure you enable Steam cloud servies before launching Ultra or it will just loop at loading screen,why this is not fixed or an issue is beyound me but it is a minor gripe.Over all i  love the game and bought this game because i have to face the fact that  i am terrible at music rhythm games and i tried Audio Surf and i just did not care for it,I checked this game out and watched the video and it reminded me of Retro Evovled only with my own music,so i bought it and do not regret it one bit.Then Humble had a bundle that had the Ultra content and i had to buy it and love Ultra also.Though i do have issues at times of keeping track of everything going on screen and die because my ship blends in with everything else even with visual turned all the way down.I know this is not a issue for everyone but i did find a lot people did have the same issues and asked if more could be done,but nothing has and fell on deaf earsThat being siad that is a minor thing and does not take away from the fun but it can take away from the competitive side knowing you died not by your mistake but by merely losing track of your ship because to much visual effects.In the end regardless if you like astroids or music i think you will love this game if you love music based games.Also if you love Retro Evolved and would love to play something akin to it with your own music then you must gets this!!Anyhow i know i am not always the best at making reviews but i am trying to improve on that.I hope at least one person finds this helpful,Enjoy the game,have fun and stay safe!

												OMG OMG OMG OMG THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!This game soo god dam trippy with all the effects of it. Beat Hazard uses ur music and the effects go off the beat of your song. If you buy this you MUST get the ultra dlc. It makes the game sooooo much better!!!Its a great game to play when you wanna listen to music but wanna play something (like audiosurf) but beat hazard takes it to a new level. Recommend to all and especially to a certain friend they know who they are ;)			"

												Beat Hazard is a very cool arcade game based off of the older game ""Asteroids"" but there is one very good reason why I do not recommend this game.In terms of graphics, performance, gameplay, and the DLC's such as ""Shadow Operations Unit"", the game is great. However, the one major flaw that gives me reason to not recommend this game is due to the repetition in the gameplay.When I first got Beat Hazard, it was a very fun game. I spent a bit of time on it, leveled up a lot, and a few days later I bought the Shadow Operations Unit DLC. Now, a month or two after I initially downloaded Beat Hazard, I never open the game anymore because it plainly becomes boring-- the gameplay is always the same: shoot and survive. Yes, there's goals such as those with the Shadow Operations Unit, but that doesn't change how repetitive the gameplay gets after a very short time. The gameplay is designed well, but it needs more variety, options, gamemodes and so on to prevent it from getting old as quick as it did for me.I personally find the game very boring now, due to how incredibly repetitive this game is. In my opinion, the $9.99 I spent on it was not well spent, and unfortunately due to my 3.7 hours on record I am unable to refund the game. If the developer were to add more gamemodes and variety to the gameplay so it isn't the same old thing, I would love to get back into this game again. I could also settle for a lower price assuming the repetition in the gameplay does not change. But until any of that happens, I probably won't be spending much if any time on Beat Hazard.Thanks for reading my review and I hope any possible viewers take it into consideration before purchasing this game.Ciao!

												I'm going to be pretty harsh here tbh.I played a little bit of it after buying it on sale, figured I'd give it ago.I was hoping for something like AudioSurf only with an arcadey space shooter twist.What I got, was far from what I was hoping, and it was very underwhelming.First, I stumbled around trying to find music, it starts with music I guess from the games built in library or something?So I went into options to find my own music, okay, i need to index it, and this was the first negative for the game.When you have over 2,000 songs in your downloads folder, indexing songs like this over having it as a browsing thing like what Audiosurf does makes it take a very, very, very, very, very very long time for someone who has lots of music, I ended up getting tired of waiting for it to finishing indexing the music at around the 4,500 song mark, this is not even 10 percent or less of my library as I believe last count I had over 20,000 songs.It also appeared, to find a song, you need to browse through them using the ""N"" key, which is ENTIRELY impractical for such a huge amount of songs.Alright, so maybe the actual game will offer what I am hoping for, so I went to play one of Abigor's songs since it was a very fast song. I was hoping to see some very fast gameplay and colors and flashes all over the place.HHAHAHA... Nope. You're basically just floating around in space with random objects spawning at you and shooting you, the song did not dictate how fast the gameplay was so it was basically just playing in the background.Oh, and to make it worse, you need to pick up powerups for extra volume..Very misleading if you ask me.I do not recommend this game if you are looking for games similar to Audiosurf as this, is DEFINITELY, not it.0/10			"

												I was unsure if I'd like Beat Hazard-- wasn't sure if I was ready to go back to the 'pointlessness' of the arcade. But for a chance to listen to my music and play a game? I wanted to experience it.And indeed, without the DLC, Beat Hazard has very little overall goals. Shadow Hunter helps a ton in making manageable goals and giving variety to gameplay.Lovely visuals.I like how it includes a visualizer-- but I dearly wish it could be implemented seperately into media players. :(Sound effects OP but can be turned down. Meaningful customization.I think this would also be an excellent study tool-- turn on an audio book track and listen and play. Emphasis on important parts would follow the game. Hee hee. "

												Two recommendations are posted here, one for the Shadow OPs DLC and my original one for the Beat Hazard Ultra.Shadow Operations recommendation (18 Apr 2014):A very fun DLC that lets you create your own ships, upload the ships to the workshop, and download other player's ships from the workshop. When creating your ship, you can choose from several attributes such as the ship's size, how fast/slow it accelerates, top speed, how fast/slow it decelerates, how strong the bullets are, how fast the bullets move, position of the guns, whether or not you repel or attract perks, how many beams (1-3), and more.  You also get to set up to three missions for your creation so you can make them easy, hard, or a mix.  As you gain higher ranks, you unlock some nice cosmetic attributes such as flares and engine thrust colour. It really is a lot of fun and it gives you new ways to enjoy Beat Hazard.Any song with the Shadow OPs icon next to it has a chance to spawn what you need for missions. Additional info from a quote from Starg: ""The 'play random track' and 'one I've not played before' will also automatically choose a song that fits the current mission criteria.""Original recommendation I wrote for the game (23 July 2013):I bought this before the sale ended, after having played the demo, and I have to say, it's pretty damn fun. I explode a lot but that's part of the fun for me, destruction to all!!! mwahahaha. The game is wicked cool and I'm glad I bought the complete package so that I have all the nuts & bolts to fiddle with. It's interesting trying out different songs from my computer, some of them get so intense that there's so much going on on the screen that I lose track of, well, everything. Some of my songs have lulls in them where I'm sitting in space twiddling my thumbs getting the Daredevil (and the other one, I forget the name), counting up. I've only played around 26 minutes so far, as far as the in-game counter goes, but it's been fun.			"

												Honestly, this is an amazing game. I barely know where to start.As a gamer, this is probably my new favorite way to enjoy my music. The gist of this one is that you can select your own music files to ""play"", which adds personality and variety to your game. It works like so: You choose a directory where you keep your music, and you can select any and all music on your computer to play with. Once you select a track, the game loads up and you're in. It should be noted that the visual effects are seizure-inducing (the game warns you this when it starts up), but this is not a problem for most people. I got past it after my first couple of games.Playing a certain music file is like playing a different ""level"", albeit with very similar enemies. Most of the time you will fight a ""boss"" ship towards the end of the level that will have a large amount of health and some very dangerous weapons. During the fight, small enemy ships may attack you as well. The best way to deal with the boss is to try and outmaneuver its weapons while keeping it under your concentrated fire.It is kind of a difficult game, and it resembles a generic arcade shooter. You have a small ship with a decent amount of firepower and a set number of lives to begin with. Taking a single hit will cause you to lose a life and most of your powerups, but some of the lost powerups drop in the middle of the screen in a cluster and you will have a few brief moments of invulnerability, allowing you to pick them up when you respawn. Power and Volume are your best friends in this game; they increase the amount of guns you can have going at a time, and the intensity of the damage you deal out, respectively. You will notice that the visual effects as well as your damage increase quite a bit when heavy bass or loud, sharp tones play in your music. This makes it ideal for dubstep and metal in my opinion, but as long as your music has a sick beat and a high enough volume, you should be fine. The visuals can be distracting at times, such as when your music becomes more intense and everything gets two or three times brighter. This makes it harder to see what your enemies are doing, but picking up on certain visual cues will help. One such cue is that one of the main indestructible projectiles that is fired at your ship is always red in color, and is always round.Even if you don't want to play the game, you can use the game's built-in visualizer in ""Chill Out"" mode to just listen to music and watch your screen do its thing. It actually is pretty relaxing.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys listening to their music, or even just likes arcade shooters. In my opinion, it is worth the money whether you want to blow stuff up or just kick back and relax. If you're lucky enough to pick it up while it's on sale, it is a total steal. As long as you don't run out of music, you will not run out of fun with this game.			"

												I listen to a ton of music. I have a huge music collection, and I love games that allow me to use my own music for gameplay. Thus far, this game is the most fun, the most visually striking, and the most exciting. That's not to say that other titles that use your own music for gameplay are bad, that's just to say that this one does it the best. It's a simple idea, you're in space, you're in a starship, and you're killing enemies and blowing up rocks, but you're doing it with flashing rave lights and your own music controlling the ebb and flow of the entire game. This isn't just another space shooter, it's not just another music game that goes with the beat, it is truly spontaneous artwork in a visual medium - and it's done better here than anywhere else. Though not the most original idea, it is definitely the idea perfected. It's predecessors and the games that came after it with a simple concept aren't bad, but they aren't this good. The (very) recent release of a new DLC with more options and playability really caught my attention after not playing the game for a few months, now I don't know how I'm going to sleep tonight. 9.5/10 - easily. Worth twice the price, highly underrated.			"

If your bored and just looking for something to play or looking for a cheap game (I payed $1 for it in the humble bundle and also got more games :D) I would recommend this.  It's also great if you enjoy music; it really gets you into it and gives you a feel for the music. Once you get the hang of it, it's a great passtime if your waiting for a game to download or if you want to listen to music and do somthing else at the same time.  So overall, GG 10/10			"

												Tags : Casual - Twitch - Music Driven           Sidescroll ShootEmUp/Bullet HellWhenever I test out a ShootEmUp from some greenlit indie game, I always think... does this have anything to offer that Beat Hazard doesnt do better. 90% of the time at least the answer is no.Beat Hazard is an excellent ShootEmUp, with the music driven twist that adjusts the number of ennemies as well as your rate of auto-fire to the rate of the music playing. Its not always perfectly spot on but for the mos part this feature works very well.Being able to play with your own music is very enjoyable, and helps give each game its own tone and sense of progression which otherwise would sometimes be lacking certainly and become repetitive much quickerI am not very good at ShootEmUps but there are a lot of game modes from just casually going through with fewer ennemies to rogue-like permadeath style games with much harsh victory conditionsI find not cranking the difficulty to the max is usually better as your own music can become distracting and this is not the kind of game that is forgiving at higher difficulties to distractionA con is that the flashy effects are sometimes a little over the top and can obfuscate a lot of the screen and even daze you quite a bit especially on higher difficulties where you spam heavy bombsI would recommend this game. I see it as one of the few references in the genre and I am glad it is in my collection			"

 My new arcade favorite First of all I bought this game at the summer sale for 1,39€. I don't think I would buy it if I had to pay over 5€, but let's get into it.The download took about two minutes, and I could enjoy the game right away. I picked up my Xbox 360 controller and sat down after I had a quick coffee. I was met with the most flashing and colourful startup screen ever, and even the menus were pretty intence. This game is not for people with epilepsy, so don't even try it if you think you have it. Now the menus and settings was pretty easy to navigate, as you would expect from an arcade shooter.The musicThe game came with a lot of music, but it clarely wasn't my taste, so you probably have to download some yourself. It can be hard if you don't have much technical knowledge though, as you have to browse your folders and find your music manually.Anyways, I bought the Mega Bundle, so I could play m4a files from my iTunes folders. But you can actually just convert your iTunes music to the mp3 format to play them, so the DLC s pretty useless. I did miss a Soundcloud implementation though, it was pretty good in Audiosurf 2.The gameSo I selected 'Wake Me Up' by Avicii, and gave it a go. The start was very similar to the good old Atari game, Astroids. Big astroids came flying by and became smaller pieces upon destruction, as you would expect. But after some time, the game became something pretty different.Lots of spaceships attacked my ship and performed the old art of kamikaze. Most ships doesn't shoot projectiles, but they try to destroy my ship in many different ways. Some ships gather around me and try to squash me, some try to pull me like a vacuum cleaner and there is even a ship that will try to choak me like a king cobra. So there is obviously a big variety of enemies.The best part was probably how the game adopted to different songs. I could play almost any song I wanted and the gameplay would still be awesome.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Pros and ConsPros:Fun and addictive gameplayGreat variety of perks and powerupsCool colours and graphic effectsMany levels, unlocks and achievements Local and online cross-platform co opNo bugs/glitches (after my experience)Pros:No Soundcloud implementationToo fast to level up at the startA little too pricey for an arcade shooterUseless iTunes & m4a file support DLC----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall rating: 9/10 "

												It's like Asteroids ♥♥♥♥ed Touhou on LSD and had an Audiosurf-baby. This game is pure sensory overload, it's almost pornographic. Throbbing music, flashing lights and colourful explosions galore, it's overwhelming and ridiculous, and just a little bit amazing. Might be a bit much for some people, and it's definitely best consumed in small chunks, but it's super enjoyable in my opinion. Controls feel natural, gameplay is fairly repetitive but all-in-all a great pickup, especially if it's on sale.EDIT: Grammar			"

												Beat Hazard, A game that is literally ""Powered by your music"". Beat hazard is a game in which you pilot a space ship and avoid incoming enemy attacks from missiles and lasers to rockets and crashing. Your weapons are powered by your music as well. Have a silent song, and your gun will be weak, have a loud song such as heavy metal, and you will be blasting enemies from all directions, but sometimes, you need more than just big guns. Obatin powerups such as superbomb to eradicate enemies or get out of a sticky situation. This game has inspired me to dive deeper into the music industry. The game also has a Co-op or Head-to-Head feature. Team up with your friends in taking enemies down, or see who can take on more, and rise above all others. But there are some enemies, that cannot be taken on alone....My Overall rating for this game  -  8/10			"

												Great game, incredibly fun and perfect for small game sessions.The best thing on Beat Hazard is to choose the songs you want to play and see the colors and light intensity and the amount of enemies increase or decrease depending on the song.The game offers several difficulty levels and game modes for when you want to have fun while listening to your favorite song (in the Chillout mode) or play a intense arcade shooter, with thousands of enemy ships and bosses filling the screen.In addition to a simple level counter, the game has an efficient perk system, allowing you to adjust the gameplay the way it pleases you most.Totally recommended.

												Do you like music? Do you like the idea of playing a game that tailors itself according to your music? Do you like twin-stick shooters? Beautiful lighting and excellent gameplay. Recommended for music freaks and arcade lovers alike. Don't play if flashing lights hurt your head.			"

												It's a fun game, I won't deny that. But do note that the music analysis system isn't as in depth (detecting beat or tempo) or accurate as you would expect. It is very difficult to keep track of your ship and the game does like to pull a lot of lame moves on the player. But should you get this game, I highly advise you also purchase the iTunes DLC (should you use iTunes).			"

												If you like to shut off your lights and stare into the glowing screen while a zillion colors flash at epileptic seizure inducing speeds while playing your music at levels that will probably give you permanent hearing damage, then this game is for youuuuuu. Load up your MP3s and the game will hurl space junk and enemy ships for you to destroy without mercy. Collect powerups like Volume Up and Power Up to make your music louder and your shots bigger and more powerful.You've also got sort of a levelling system where you can unlock abilities like Shields, Homing Rockets and a concentrated blast of energy. If that's not enough for you, you can set the effect level to 200% and enjoy the burning feeling of flashing lights into your eyes. It's even got online and local multiplayer to boot.I can't really think of any glaring negatives to the game. It'll run on anything, runs with keyboard and mouse or controller if you so desire, and even supports online livestreaming play, so you can play forever on your favorite internet radio station.Buy it. Like, right now.			"

												One of the best game for me !Play a survival stromboscopique spaceship action game on your best and favorite musics ! Light effects are stunning and beautiful and you can play on the radio you want, you have normal or endless mode, a shop to up your spaceship (shield, life, new weapons of the dead, more bonus in game...).During the battle, collect gold, power to up your firepower and ""sound"" to up the volume of the sound and in the sametime your ship because more the song is good more ennemies are presents and aggressiv !There is different levels of difficulty but hardcore is the best !Try it you will love it			"

												This is a simple but wonderful game. If you're going to listen to music, why not trash a couple thousand space fighters and a giant space worm while fighting your own case of epilepsy? I'd say this game can't be compared to Audiosurf, it's on its own tier- and maybe even a higher one. It's just so much more... interactive. And it's a lot more difficult than jumping over hurdles or playing musical tetris. XD I recommend this game, it'll be a gem for you music-game lovers.			"

												If you want to know what this game is think asteroids on steroids to your favourite music tracks. This is my go-to game whenever I just want to zone out and kill some time playing something while listening to music, but don't feel like starting a new game or concentrating on a story, etc. This is my Tetris.This perhaps isn't the best game if you only want to kill a *little* time, since it plays your music collection (and therefore has the best sound track ever), everytime you say ""I'll quit after this round!"" it goes and picks yet another great track and you end up saying ""Well... maybe after this one!""What I love about this game is that can be customised to suit your mood - harder difficulties are *HARD*, easier difficulties are easy. The intensity of the game depends on the intensity of the music track you play. You can unlock perks and assign them to help in different ways. After a high score? Put your perks into score multipliers and sacrifice the extra weapons. Feel like a challenge? Assign your perks to weapons and bump the difficulty up (I'm actually pretty good at Suicidal difficulty now ;). Want to just take it easy? Lower the difficulty and put on some relaxing music.The game actually comes with a decent selection of music from a range of genres, which I discovered while unlocking the Music Tour achievement. Of course it has a fair bit of electronic music, which you would expect from a game like this, but I very happy to see it actually has some decent alternative rock & metal tracks as well. It can also stream music from a number of Internet radio stations (no idea if it's possible to add more), but of course you will really want to bring your own music collection to enjoy this game the most. For me, that's European style Symphonic Power Metal \m/The perks can be a bit of a grind to unlock, and even more so to fully upgrade them. Unlocking them just takes score, but upgrading them can only be done by picking up in game money - and that only drops $10 at a time. That's not really a problem as the low-mid levels are fairly cheap and is all you need as long as you aren't trying to play on Suicidal difficulty, but maxing them out does take a fair while.Let's talk weapons. Like most asteroids type games you have a generic laser that can be upgraded by picking up POWer ups. This one is actually pretty good - it has a decent spread and can take out a large number of enemies pretty quickly. The unique thing about this game is the intensity of your weapons also depends on the intensity of the music - picking up VOL+ powerups increases the volume, making your weapons more powerful, but at the same time it also spawns more enemies and makes them faster.Your second weapon is of course some kind of super bomb, also known as the ""OH GOD TOO MANY ENEMIES!!!"" panic button to take out most of the nearby enemies and give you a few seconds of invaulnerability. Then you have the reflective shield, homing micro missiles and the Ultra Beam to quickly eradicate a large group of enemies in a given direction. I love that none of these weapons feel like duplicates and they all have their place - knowing which one to use when becomes very important in the higher difficulties.You remember back in the nineties how games used to have warnings on the box & the first page of the manual not to play them if you suffer from epilepsy? Well, I do. Anyway - I think this game actually means it, it uses a lot of very intense strobing visuals which (other than causing epilectic siezures) can make it pretty hard to see incoming projectiles - when I first started playing half the time I couldn't see what had killed me. The visuals can be toned down (or increased to epic proportions!!!), but personally I kept them on 100% and just got used to them.If you are going to buy this, get the Beat Hazard Ultra DLC - some of the stuff I mentioned here is specific to that DLC and the base game does not have a huge amount of variety in terms of enemies, weapons, etc. The only reason not to get the Ultra DLC is to try it out a bit and see if you like it. As soon as you are convinced, buy the Ultra DLC.I've been playing this on and off over the last two years. Finally managed to unlock all the achievements - it was a long run, but totally worth it.

												If you want to listen to music, but also want to occupy yourself while you do so, Beat Hazard is an alright game.The game is very simple. It is a two-dimensional, top-down, static shooter. You pilot a ship on the screen while music plays, a lot of colors flash and strobe on the screen while enemies pour in from the edges trying to destroy your ship. Your mission is to stay alive for the duration of whatever song is playing and get the highest score you can. The flashing colors, lights, enemies etc., go along with your music. So if you have a slow song playing most everything will be going slowly (this includes your shots, though not your ship) and if the tempo suddenly picks up, so does everything else. Occasionally a boss enemy will come on the screen to fight you. There are also various power-ups you can grab as you defeat enemies.Your score is tallied over time and added into what is essentially an experience bar. Every time you go up a level you can choose a new perk to add to your perk list. You can then go to the perk list and activate a small number of perks to use in each match. The perks are simple things such as score multipliers or more interesting things like different weapons (micro seeking missiles, a massive laser beam, a relector shield).Music:Some music is included, if you're into dubstep, and some online radio stations are included as well if you'd prefer to stream music. If you have music on your computer you can easily add folders or individual files into the games library.A warning:If you are susceptible to strobe effects and flashing lights, etc., I would not recommend this game. You can lower the effects by up to 50%, but even at 50% I often find myself having difficulty seeing anything on the screen due to the effects. That is really the only negative aspect of the game to me.The game can be a bit repetitive as the locations never change, it's just always the same box of seizure lights and the same set of enemies. I enjoy the game because I have difficulty listening to music and focusing on other things at the same time, so this is a way for me to listen to music, but still keep myself occupied with something.

												This is a fantastic game IF you like gaming to music.  It reminds me a lot of Asteroids, only far more difficult, musical and psychodelic.  If you're going to play, make sure you aren't prone to epiplectic seizures.  The bright colors and flashing effects might induce a seizure.  I wouldn't play if you've got a migraine of headache in general.  With the possible exception of Audiosurf, I'd say this is the most entertaining music-based game on Steam.  There are numerous achievements to gain and I believe you can play it two-player.  I think it's local co-op, so that means you'll have to use the same PC.			"

												Beat Hazard is Asteroids on crack and set to music. It can get quite challenging and is also a good bit of fun, allowing you to pipe in your own tunes that will affect the progression of the level. Everything about the game is well done, but it feels a bit too thrown together; and again, in many respects an Asteroids clone. The algorithm that spawns enemies based on what music you choose likewise seems a bit questionable, and many songs I tried out didn't really elicit battles that I felt fit with the rhythm of the music. I'd end up lazily floating about picking off weak enemies during adrenaline pumping electric guitar solos.I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to people either. It's a cool concept, but what was delivered was merely passable; nothing to get terribly excited about.			"

												Beat Hazard is Asteroids on crack and set to music. It can get quite challenging and is also a good bit of fun, allowing you to pipe in your own tunes that will affect the progression of the level. Everything about the game is well done, but it feels a bit too thrown together; and again, in many respects an Asteroids clone. The algorithm that spawns enemies based on what music you choose likewise seems a bit questionable, and many songs I tried out didn't really elicit battles that I felt fit with the rhythm of the music. I'd end up lazily floating about picking off weak enemies during adrenaline pumping electric guitar solos.I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but I don't think I'd really recommend it to people either. It's a cool concept, but what was delivered was merely passable; nothing to get terribly excited about.			"

													Photosensitive Seizure WarningA very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in video games. Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these ""photosensitive epileptic seizures"" while watching video games.These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms - children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures.			"

												Beat Hazard is a twin-stick shooter that generates levels based upon intensity of certain levels of music. You choose a track, then proceed to fights hordes of enemies until the selected tracks plays out. During that time you pick up score multipliers, bombs, volume uppers, and power uppers. Every now and then bosses will appear. These are much larger than standard enemies. Some times you can even get through songs without ever seeing a boss, but that just depends on the intensity of the selected track I guess.I love everything about this game, except the lack of leaderboards for actual artist/song titles. Yes, I just wish the leaderboards were more like Audiosurf, that way I could be more competetive in a game that is just screaming to have people compete for specific scores on songs and several difficulty settings.But that's essentially it. It's Robotron combined with Audiosurf. Online is fun too, assuming you snatch the Ultra DLC. If you have a friend who has similar music taste, you can index your whole music library and play the same songs assuming you're both competent enough to be snobs about correct track info. You wouldn't want to end up playing completely songs, would you?I highly recommend this for music snobs, and arcade junkies. I also highly recommend the Ultra DLC to go with this to. It really brings some more life into the base game.			"

I personally play this with my metal or dubstep tracks, and I have to say, it's intense if you have the volume up loud enough and you're playing it on the suicidal difficulty with max visual effects.  I wouldn't recommend this for anyone epileptic at all, as it has a large amount of flashing.			"

												The base game of Beat Hazard is excelent. Er...no. The base game of Beat Hazard is GOOD. Screen-obscuring lighting effects that blind you from being able to actually see the action even on the lowest possible setting, occasionally unfair hitbox issues (which result in an enemy's ""tell"" effectively lying to you), and a few generally aggravating game behaviours - most notably the AI patterns of certain bosses - prevent it from being ""excellent"". Nonetheless, it can be quite entertaining, and being powered by your own music means that it automatically has the best soundtrack ever...all your favourite songs! There's a fair variety of perks, which means you can tailor your ship to your play style, whatever that may be, and if you're the competitive sort, the leaderboards can provide you with goals to strive for, even if it's just being the best out of your own circle of friends. That you can use an internet radio station if you get bored of your own music is a nice added touch as well, which can add hours more play time.That said, a special mention needs to go out to the Shadow Operations DLC. DO NOT BUY THE SHADOW OPERATIONS DLC, UNLESS YOU ARE BOTH A HARDCORE COMPLETIONIST, AND LOOKING FOR NEW GOALS TO EXTEND THE LIFE OF THE GAME. Otherwise, it's just not woth it. I cannot stress this enough. Shadow Ops. adds a lot more ""challenge"" to the game, in the form of new ""missions"" with arbitrarily difficult requirements, but doesn't do much to change the overall gameplay. Even with the new ships, the ""fun factor"" just isn't much improved. Unless you love pitting yourself against massochistic difficulty, you're going to more than likely be disappointed. There might be some entertainment in the user-created ships, but by and large they are either completely overpowered, just a reference to some series or other, or ""lulzy"" (read as ""deliberately stupid""), and still don't add much to the game, unless you are easily amused, a serious Star Trek/Battlestar Galactica/Touhou/Etc... nerd, or both. Even as cheap as it is, you should really just consider the DLC to be nothing more than a generous tip to the developers, and treat it as such...only buying it if you really want to give them more money for the sake of it.

												One of the most fun games that your  play is dictated by your music! Symphony is another. This though has more variation to it. The downside is it is very vivid from a graphical standpoint and may make you feel uneasy. Other than that it is worth picking up, especially during a sale.			"

												Imagine Asteroids with fancier graphics, powered by your music.That's bascially what Beat Hazard is.It is a twin-stick shooter, which not only uses your music to determine the firepower of your ship (and all those flashy effects on the screen), but also enemy appearances, although that may not be as obvious as the other stuff.If you like shooting not only asteroids and a wide variety of enemy ships, but also rather huge bosses, all to the best music possible (because, you know, it's YOUR music), then the game might be for you!What is missing is some sort of song-by-song leaderboard like Audiosurf has, which would make the game quite more competitive.

You can use the great music that comes with the game or play along to any of your own music or many internet radio stations.  lots of bright deep colors and flashes along with a tone of action.  it will probably kill you for real if your an eppileptic though.  solid game for what it is and your steam trading card sets actually get you in game benefits.  I would definatly rate this highly.			"

												Note: Below exists an update. Here's the review from 2011-10-18: Can be played solo or coop/competitively over the 'net.  Both players must have the same song (length and metadata must be the same) locally, or they can use last.fm or another online music stream.  Different songs are supposed to produce the same experience each time, if the song file and the game settings are the same. Beat Hazard is a top-down two-stick (or 1 keyboard, or mouse+keyboard) shooter with a lot of variation. The variations become even more diverse when you consider that the gameplay changes depending on what musical track you're playing in the background. The degree to which the music affects it can be adjusted, and the frenetic visuals can be turned up or down independently. The various Beat Hazard Ultra (the only version still being developed AFAIK) perks and weapons change how the player must react to the various enemies (depending on which the player has purchased (cash is dropped by slain enemies) and enabled--I'mouttaroomhere--Update 2014-06-25: People will call the visuals seizure-inducing. That seems like a good description when describing overwhelming visuals, but it's literal only for people who have seizures triggered by the visuals common to this game. I imagine there are some who have photosensitive seizures who will not be bothered by this game, or only by the visuals prompted by certain songs. I have had stress-induced seizures, but I've never been photosensitive in the slightest, to this or any other visual stimulation.This is an awesome game, with many awesome things added to it since my first review a few years ago!Note (2014-10-08): The main game's title appears to have reverted to the original Beat Hazard (some months ago).

Whether its playing to the solid beats of techno or simply gliding through a sweet serenade, Beat Hazard will have you playing for hours. With the new Beat Hazard Ultra, adding new enemies into the mix and a new online co-op, and the highly anticipated Shadow Mission DLC coming soon,  this game will continue to prove to be a keeper!

												In short: This game is astroids on LSD, and I love it.  As with any good review, lets start with the postives.  First, this game looks quite pretty, especialy on a nice screen the colors are vivid and suit the game nicely.  Second, Its fun, truthfuly this is the most important part of a game.  It has a nice face paced gameplay (least with the songs that I have put through it).  It gets quite chalenging once you unlock the higher teir skill ranks, im not usaly a fan of skill unlocks, but I got the highest in like half an hour so i guess its fine.  Its crazy fun to have your screen filled with colors, not knowing which are things to avoid or is simply your laser of death, you might not like that but i find that it adds to the excitment.ok, its cons time!  The game is a pretty slopy Xbox port, they didnt even remove the button promps, but this game feels more like its supposed to be played with a controler, especialy with the keyboard scheem and split screen (Yes, split screen!).  This is the worst part of the game: you have to buy a DLC, sure ill buy a good DLC like Tinny tinas assult on dragon keep, or a good Bioshock DLC, but I dont want to pay money to unlock a game mode (boss rush and online multiplayer) the DLC also unlocks various diffrent types of ships and the steam workshop.  It also bugs you when you try to exit the game telling you to buy the DLC.  This is really my biggest grip though, all in all this game is a blast to play.			"

												Holy cow!This premier seizure inducement application is a fun way to exploit those old tracks that you already used in Audiosurf and a variety of GTA games. Gameplay is simple, enemies are tough and/or aplenty, graphics are entirely adequate. If you intend to go on a transatlantic flight and wish to have fun onboard, look no further than Beat Hazard.

												Very fun bullet hell in space. The fact that you can use any music on your computer makes this game about 10 times better. The game is pretty fun, but the only issue is that you pay for a demo until you buy the DLC's. Other than that, the game's pretty enjoyable and you should pick it up whenever it's on sale.			"

Be warned, you have to buy the DLC ultra to be able to play online with your friends. They should of put that in the description.			"

												It's been on my wishlist for a while and it was gifted to me recently - and unfortunately it's a lot less fun than I'd imagined it to be! I'm biased for these kinds of games since I like challenging arcade games and music-powered games, so you'd think I'd like this one. Yes, well... not really.(Mind you, I'm in no way photosensitive like some others who have left a negative review on this game have been, and I can handle rapid flashing just fine, but if it becomes gameplay-inhibiting, then the design is absolutely flawed.)Problems with the game:* Often screen-filling visual effects that prevent you from seeing what is going on. You can't dodge bullets if you can't see them...* Overboard on the ""flashy sparkly fireworks"" effects. I mean, way overboard, and then some. It's not ""cool"", it's not ""attractive"", and it gives you a headache if you're not careful.* The music plays very soft. I have properly balanced music files and they simply don't play at a decent volume in the game - for a music-focused game you'd expect the audio component to be at least adequate and give priority to proper playback without having to amplify it into clipping ranges.* Scoring is meaningless: levels are random, so what rewards you get and points you score for a song is not dependent on the music at all. Score is determined by chance and not by skill, as a result.* Music-based firepower will favor even, loud songs. You get a dynamic song with breaks and softer parts and you're pretty much at the mercy of whatever random fleets of ships are thrown your way with no way to fight them off. And woe if you hit a quiet spot when a boss is thrown at you. Good luck with that, get ready for a grind.* Screen-filling visual effects that.. Ohwait, I already said that. :P Yes, it's a problem. Worthy of mentioning twice. It kills the ability to properly play a ""bullet hell"" game. Period. "

												If you ever played a game like Asteroids or  any other space shooter then you should generally understand Beat Hazard, however, Beat Hazard has 2 main things that no other space shooter has.The first this to know is that as it says, this game is powered by your music, the more songs you have, the more potential for fun this game has, your weapons power, enemy strength and attack patterns are determined by the music.The second thing you should know is this game uses high levels of strobe lights that respond to the music, this game should not be played if you are suseptable to any sort of a seizure from flickering, blinking or flashing lights.

I personally love it.(partially because of the music i listen to)Give it a try loads of fun ;D			"

All you have to do is follow these simple stepsStep 1: Play Beat HazardStep 2: Repeat step 1And that's it!In all seriousness this game is very fun to play and pretty to look at. I love listening to music and usually I am not doing anything while playing so this gives me an objective while listening to whatever i feel like. Or if you want some real fun just download some hardcore dubstep or whatnot and turn the visual effects to 200% If you're even questioning whether or not to buy this game, buy it, you will not regret it.

Whether its playing to the solid beats of techno or simply gliding through a sweet serenade, Beat Hazard will have you playing for hours. With the new Beat Hazard Ultra, adding new enemies into the mix and a new online co-op, and the highly anticipated Shadow Mission DLC coming soon,  this game will continue to prove to be a keeper!

												My only complaint, is that music starts quiet, and to get the music really pumping loud, you have to either turn up your speakers or simply be good at the game... I sadly cannot be bothered playing enough to learn how to not die, ever, soooo I think I'll just go ahead and leave it at this.Beat Hazard, is probably the best 'music simulator' ever. As a game that takes your music collection, and makes it 'playable' I still think Beat Hazard is the best. It's challenging, yes, but it's really just an eye test. After a while your eyes get lazy, and tired, and you'll stop noticing things. Vital things. Like bullets coming for you. Unlike certain bullet hell games, this isn't really a bullet hell game. It's more like Asteroids. You need to avoid the enemy space ships which seem hell bent on ramming you, and all the scrap asteroids, which break apart when shot.If you're looking for a gimmicky game which takes advantage of YOUR music collection, and NOT the potentially sub-par music of the indie game itself, and for SURE your own tastes, here you go, I think this will whet your appetite better than other games, such as Audiosurf, which although fun, is far too easy for my tastes.

												This game is basically Asteroids for the 21st century.  Twin stick shooter that reacts really well to the music track playing.  It comes with a decent selection of tracks that work well, but you can use any music you want...even internet radio stations.  Great particle and lighting effects.  Turn the slider up to 100% and try not to blink.  I bought it at $5 on sale and was pleasantly surprised.  Check my profile, I play it often.			"

It's got the gameplay and visceral feel of a classic arcade shooter, with the endless replayability of levels that are generated according to the songs you feed the game.

												Beat Hazard is a unique shoot'em up. The levels are the songs on your computer. How does it work though? When you start playing, you don't really see how it goes at the rythm of your songs. But after some time playing, you'll start to realize that it really does go at the rythm of your songs. It's hard to notice though, since Beat Hazard require quite a lot of focus on the ennemies and incoming projectiles. Despite that, Beat Hazard is a hardcore and very addicting game. If you love shooters, this is an excellent game for you.HOWEVER, I do have to give some warnings. DO NOT BUY IF YOU SUFFER FROM EPILIPSY. This game has A LOT of flashing lights and effects. And when I say a lot, I really do mean a lot. If you do not suffer from epilipsy, please, take breaks after an hour of play. I know, I sound like someone who says you should take break after an hour of playing video games, but no. Beat Hazard is a special case. After playing for like 1 hour, I started to have an headache, and plus, my eyes started to feel tired. And I'm not making this up. So please, if you're going to play this excellent game, take care of yourself, and take a break after an hour of consecutive play.Overall, you should buy this game. I highly recommend it. I also recommend that you play with a controller. ;)			"

												Beat Hazard can be described as Audiosurf meets Asteroids on something highly illegal.DO NOT PLAY IN THE DARK! The flashing lights of the game will give you a headache if you don't have good lighting in the room in the best case, and a seizure in the worst.That aside, it's a lot of fun and a good way to get more use out of your music library. Just be careful of loading up slow tracks as they tend to produce hard levels.Be sure to get the complete pack for the best experience. The added features of Ultra make an already good game much more interesting.			"

												""Gameplay powered by your music"" I think not. This game is just a simple, basic shmup with a storm of visual effects. Music has no influence whatsoever on the gameplay (maybe just the speed). It's a bit like watching the visualizations of a media player. I've played a lot of different genre of music and ennemies spawn, boss, etc were always quite the same. Overall, even with a hard techno track in insane difficulty the game was just too easy and boring. I really am disappointed.			"

												Beat Hazard, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Particle Effects.Now before anyone reads this, I should mention that Beat Hazard IS ACTUALLY A GOOD GAME, it's  fun and well designed, I just can't reccomend it, personally.Beat Hazard is a victim of great potential, poor execution. I'm not a huge fan of shmups, but when I do play them, being able to have the tempo of the level set to my own music was an idea I was fast enamored with. The game works as advertized, I suppose and it's relatively fun. That should be enough to get it a thumbs up... but I just can't do it. Beat Hazard suffers from a terminal case of a complete lack of gameplay clarity.If you at any point start chatting up a games developer, there is a good chance that at some point, they'll tell you that it's generally a good idea that the player feel responsible for their own failure. If failure in a game is beyond the player's control, they will quickly start to resent the game for it. Failure is rewarding if it gives experience towards doing better next time, but failure in Beat Hazard often comes from not being able to tell if a piece of debris is a particle effect or a broken chunk of dangerous meteorite. Failure comes from being hit by a missile indistinguishable from the sparks coming from your ship, other ships, powerups and even parts of the freaking user interface, which are lit up more flamboyantly than a mardi-gras fireworks show.EDIT: Yes, I did turn down the particle effects in the options menu. It did not help.The biggest letdown to me though, was the fact that the music only really affected the strength of your weapon (and the intensity of the godforsaken particle effects) and not the size and tenacity of the enemy. Enemy ships will probably appear in greater numbers on a 180 bps drumstep track compared to a 40 bps suicide anthem, but the intensity of the song has little to no effect on how fast the enemy moves or what kinds of bad guy appear. The slow spots in any song do slow down the action, and buildups are often oddly quiet which is a nice touch, but it honestly doesn't feel like the track you select makes a noticable difference in the level.In perfect honesty, short of Audio Surf, Beat Hazard is probably one of the better rhythm games out there, due mostly to the fact that it's powered entirely by your own music, and can do so competantly. That being said, I'm not going to reccommend a rotten game just because it's slightly less rotten than everything else in the fridge. Beat Hazard is a pretty standard shoot-em-up that could probably be marketted more successfully as a music visualization program. Imagine playing ""Operation"" while being shot in both eyes with a rapidly flashing, high intensity laser while in a moving car, with a stereo stuck at 90 dB playing dubstep and you have a pretty solid idea on what Beat Hazard is like.

												""iTunes ain't got nothin' on this!"" 5/10Looking for a new way to spice up your music listening sessions? If you answered yes, then this is the game for you! Because 'Beat Hazard' is basically just a music visualizer with lives. And if you don't have enough lives to make it through the song, well, then you don't hear the end of that song; it's as simple as that. Finally something that makes listening to music more challenging! Ugh, we've seen this game a thousand times before, literally, there are a thousand other versions of this game out there already. Like 'Asteroids, Geometry Wars, Darius Twin, Giga Wing, 1943, LifeForce, Gradius, Raiden, Super Stardust, etc. You get the point, there are a lot of spaceship shooty games on the market.Sad to say however, 'Beat Hazard' adds nothing new to this already saturated genre other than allowing us to play along to our favorite songs. But we could already do that by listening to our favorite songs while playing better versions of this game with the sound off. It was a nice attempt but 'Beat Hazard' falls really flat, no pun intended. There is just too much going on visually, even when turning the effects down half-way, and sometimes it's much too difficult to distinguish from what will and will not hurt you as debris flies all about. Not to mention the graphics look very cheap, especially the spaceship, and with a game with so many visual effects, it seriously hinders the experience, at least for me.Overall there is still some fun to be had here, but pick 'Beat Hazard' up on sale, because ten bucks is just too much to pay for this generic pile of visual poppycock. The 'Survival Mode' is the one aspect that may keep you coming back, but other than that, avoid this game for something better like one of the titles mentioned above, because honestly, the one thing this game promises to do; power itself with your music, it doesn't even do very well.

												This is a nice shooter, but it tends to get repetitive after a couple hours of gameplay. Also, the music menus are incredibly annoying to scroll through. I try to go down to select a song, but instead the selection goes all over the place. Makes me wonder why the windows explorer selection option couldn't have just been the default.			"

												I personally found this game... underwhelming.The issue stems from what the game promises, or seemingly hopes, to deliver to the user. A radically fun experience powered by your own music. The description of the game made me hope to have a racing and heart-pounding experience much like audiosurf, but it felt more like drinking a Red Bull compared to doing cocaine.To put it bluntly, Beat Hazard is a space shooter. Your lazers, the enemies spawn points, and their flight patterns, are all dictated by your music. You only have about 2 powerups that just change the potency of your weapons, and the volume of your music. You collect money, which is used to buy and upgrade perks, that only increase your score and nothing else. You 'rank up', a leveling system, based on your scores from the songs you've played, but don't get much out of it.All in all, Beat Hazard is a seizure-enducing, messy, and underwhelming experience. Only electronic music could really fit the game's theme, and the game by itself is entirely obsolete without the DLC. And even THAT is obsolete thanks to Beat Hazard Ultra. The game encourages you to create it's steam badges to get new ships that are only minor changes, and a majority of the fun features isn't available without Shadow Operations Unit DLC.The game is fun for a length of maybe 15 minutes, while the player holds the mouse button and waits for the level to be beat. The enemies may as well be made of clay, the lights and particles blinding the entire screen, and the explosions even less exciting. Beat Hazard is like taking ecstacy only to be immune to it after it wears off forever.Going back to Audiosurf.			"

GAMEPLAY: 7/10STORY: There isn't oneA  headache inducer. For real. You can turn down the effects, but for me it wasn't enough at the lowest settings. All of your bullets pulse with light, which quickly becomes overwhelming.  It's a shame because the gameplay is nice and simple Asteroid-style gameplay. As to what your music affects, it most notably affects your rate of fire. Possibly (I couldn't really tell) the rate of enemy spawn. A neat concept.However I am unable to play more than one song on it at a time. Even one song makes my eyes hurt. I cannot recommend a game that is physically painful to play.			"

												If I had to chose just one word for this game it would be 'cluttered'.  Even with the visual effects turned down to the lowest you still can't see what going on.  Every explosion ends up just obscuring the screen so you can't see anything, worse is the level's music makes these unnecessary effects even more flashy and annoying.  You'll die more often than not to bullets or foes that where hidden by these effects. If they could be turn them off this game would have no challenge what so ever.Speaking of the music, this game's soundtrack is standard issue techno crap, it sounds like it came right out of 2003.  The whole thing where your own tracks make new levels, that sucks too.  The only think music determines is how much of the screen you can't see.  I have notice that the enemy waves follow the same pattern if you use the same song, so it does have some factor but  couldn't tell you how it works.  Every time I tried one of my own tracks what happened on the screen didn't match the beat or tone or anything at all.  Hell, half the songs I tried had absolutely nothing was going screen for 10-15 seconds.Doesn't waste you money on this game, get a real bullet storm game, like Ikaruga.			"

There is unlimited replayability, every game is different (things change depending on the songs, I'm not sure how it works exactly) and there are lots of perks to unlock as well that will help you along the way. One of the cooler things about this game is you actually get 2 ships for the badges you earn for this game, why don't more games do something like this? It's nice to get a reward for the badges. The only thing I didn't like was that you have to pay to get iTunes & m4a support but I'm guessing that's a licensing thing and not a big deal.

It's a tad shallow for 10 clams but the music twist was really well executed. You begin fairly weak with the volume purposly set to 50% and as you collect more goodies to become more powerful the volume grows until you hit 150% while the computer throws more baddies your way. Then just jam along while you crank your high score up to 11 and you've got Beat Hazard in a nutshell.			"

												It's one of those games where you load a song into it and you get a different level depending on which song you used (think Audiosurf). The main difference is that, while games like Audiosurf have a kind of gameplay that complements the music you're listening to for maximum enjoyment, Beat Hazard doesn't always hit that mark. I definitely would not recommend this game for the PC, but if you really want to play it, try picking up the Android version, which is much more enjoyable.			"

												Beat Hazard is a game that's primarily flash and relatively little substance. The main gimmick, the music detection, only really results in three distinct modes: During very quiet sections, very slow enemies pile up on the sides while you struggle to do any damage to them. Otherwise the various technicolor explosions, blur effects, and strobing lights constantly going off only range from ""excessive"" to ""blinding"", even with effects turned to the minimum setting. Enemy fire tries to stand out against the visual barrage, but mostly fails to do so. Smartbombs are used not when you are about to get hit, but instead when you can't tell if you're going to get hit or not. The game then follows this up by encouraging you to grind perks for more smartbombs to fight the Excessively Flashy Bright Menace with your own excessive flashy brightness.I recommend Assault Android Cactus instead for your twinstick shooter fix.

												Bah. No wonder I haven't played this game in so long, or very much. I love music, and this was supposed to be a awesome way to get immersed into a game with your music. It gets a big ""No, it's doesn't"" from me. With the other noises going on, it's a huge distraction from what using your own music in this is supposed to do. The single worst thing that enflames that aspect though, is the volume power-ups. So, even if you start out with something huge and blasting, well, too bad. It's going to play it softly until you collect the power-ups to make it louder so that you can actually hear the music that you put on. On top of that, it often doesn't matter , since sometimes when you blow something up, it dips the volume for a bit anyway, as if it needed some kind of sidechain compression between the music and game audio for some reason. Completely breaks the immersive experience, and so the game just comes along as feeling cheap and gimmicky. Especially since, without the music hook, there's nothing that makes the game stand out. Go buy Audiosurf. It's also very simplistic, but if your looking for a game where using your own music actually adds something to the experience: It's much better.			"

												I've tried giving this game a chance 2 times now. To me it's just a visualizer software that reacts to the music with merely particle effects. I would have wanted the enemy patterns be spawned in sync with the beat to make the game feel more reactive to your music (Tried different genres: metal, house, techno, ambient). Right now it just feels that the music and gameplay are in completely different layers and that doesn't work for me.One could argue that there is some spawns reacting to the music but it doesn't feel that way. Often times you get bored and frustated when you start thinking all the things the game could have been. The spawns are too vague and unresponsive. I feel the main intent in design was to analyze the song length, create some sort of an enemy buildup into that timeframe and then spawn enemies with an intensifying interval towards the end. It's not a really elaborate system but a really generalized one.  It doesn't feel reactive to the music or feel particularly interesting.Here are a few examples that I wanted to see: *Having the enemy sprites pulse to the beat at times and giving you extra stuff if destroyed in a swollen state.*Having different enemy types pulse to different beats in the music.*Having certain archtypes of beat sequences built to the system. For example in house music the rythm, buildup and lead are quite predictable, those could be used as standardized information and made into gameplay events.*Every hi-hat spawning a small single enemy from a corner starting from top left and ending in bottom right.*Every bass hit it could spawn a round pattern of small popcorn enemies etc. Maybe if the core gameplay were more engaging, I would not have cared about enemy beat sync, meaning the lack thereof, that much. Right now I don't feel like it really holds it's own though. It feels there are many enemy archtypes that could be used to make the gameplay more engaging and less predictable.Also the enemy sprites look clumbsy and lack animation which gives me a somewhat unfinished feeling while playing. They stick out.To me this game was not enjoyable due to lack of polish and expectations not being met.			"

												If any epileptics are going to play this one, make sure you turn down both visual intensity settings (flashing, one for the game and one for the menus) down to 50%.

												Wow what a turd don't read this don't play this game ZERO STARS REVIEWBeat Hazards is a game that takes every chance it gets to insult and talk down to the player. It puts the old adage “show, don’t tell” to work by by showing your eye ball sockets what it’s like to be brutally violated. This is not a vulgar and childish joke, I mean violate in the strict dictionary definition. The game shows clear disrespect for and oversteps the bounds of the players’ eyes. Even aside from the eyes, the game gives the player no quarter and from the boot up pumps the player’s BOSE headphones full of fat Jams. You would expect Jams to play an integral role in the “gameplay” (more on this later) but instead they react more to the menu.The menu is outright impossible to behold. I mean this in the worst sense possible. A player may start up Beat H. expecting to see beats or hazard in a visual feast for the eyes and is instead subjected to a visual assault. The ‘feast’ is turned up to a prepaid buffet where the player is forced to consume far more than is reasonable in order to make the bill seem worth it. I’m saying that the menus are a horrible and traumatizing experience. The player is encouraged to get away from the title menu and dive right into the “gameplay” only to make it stop. By reducing the visuals option slider the figurative laser pointer goes from green to red, but still isn’t something I would point at an eye.The gameplay in Beat El Hazzard is Asteroids in a pretty dress with an okay wig but she still smells like cigarettes and hey your drivers license says you’re older than my parents. #1reasonwhyIn summary the gameplay is something I have seem a million times before. S.P.A.Z. did not cause me real life pain from playing so it could be the TOP DOG Asteroids clone in the stunky oniondustry. Sometimes all you need is a jam and a space ship to shoot the rocks and UFOs. However WE are not so simple-minded. It is telling that the metacritic score for the title is a 404 error.Has:- Last.FM support. Get social! - Enjoy from your home theater with BOSE digital headphones!- Twitter & Leaderboard support.

												NOT RECOMMENDED.  This is an awful game.  Beat Hazard is completely unplayable with any music that isn't normalized to high amplitude all the time because the♥♥♥♥♥♥that comes out of your guns is directly proportional to how active the music is.  You'll be doing well and then all of a sudden it's like someone just turned the valve on your faucet; little sputters come out in place of the usual soundless streams of color, and you are just ♥♥♥♥ed.It's also impossible to even see what's going on.  The game tries so hard to be extreme that it just peppers the entire screen with identically colored glittery flashy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that prevents you from seeing enemy bullets.  I hate the scoring system, too.  Oh, and the whole enterprise is phenomenally ugly, just a bunch of samey cardboard cutouts.  Even the swooshy menus♥♥♥♥♥♥me off.The fact that Beat Hazard has been a success seems to say something dire about how susceptible people are to the music generation gimmick.			"

												Beat hazard is a very simple game. You play as a tiny space ship in deep space; you float around the screen shooting lasers at unsuspecting asteroids and ships. This game is basically plays exactly like the classic game Asteroids. The art style is very fitting for the game, with song beats as soon as you enter the main menu of the game. Sadly people with chronic epilepsy cannot play this game. The flashing colors might actually kill them; in fact it almost killed me. I have a massive headache after getting all my achievements. This game’s replayability value is similar to that of Audio Surf, it’s totally dependent on whether or not you have anything better to do.			"

												This game is trying to combine a 'bullet-hell' arcade shooter with a game that reacts to and changes with a chosen music file, and honestly, it is mediocre at both.  A few specific examples of things I don't like about the game:- When you die, your ship drops a number of powerups.  There have been many times where I've died early in a level, and ended up better off for it because of the drops (I've even had my score multiplier increase after dying).- The levels are randomly generated, even with the same song, so high scores per song are basically meaningless.- As far as I can tell, the only way the game 'reacts' to your music is by slowing down the enemies and your fire-rate (and weakening your weapons it seems) during slow or quiet parts of songs.  A major downside of this, is that for songs that are slow and/or quiet by nature, it is nearly impossible to kill anything because your bullets are so weak and shoot so slowly.- A side note, if you don't like games with excessively bright and flashing lights, do NOT buy this game.  I have the visual intensity set to 25% and it is still a seizure on the screen.All that said, if you want an arcade shooter whose soundtrack is your own music library, then this is the game for you.  Although you'd be better off buying a real bullet-hell game, muting the game's music, and playing your own.  If you want a game that generates levels based off of your music tracks, then check out Audiosurf.			"

   Overview   Beat Hazard (Ultra) is a music-based game that centers around music, primarily your own playlists, often via iTunes or other media libraries. The game itself has you piloting a ship (or one of many with DLC) whose goal is to score as many points as necessary within the length of any given song and to avoid dying. You'll face enemies ranging from stray asteroids and basic enemy ships, to mines and even bosses in the form of large monsters or battleships with a multitude of weapons at their disposal. The game rewards you for staying alive by supplying you random powerups and score multipliers that dropped from defeated enemies. If you die, which you can by being hit just once, you lose some  of your powers and score bonuses. At the end of the song, your score is tallied and as you score more points, your piloting rank will increase. Increasing your rank gives you the option to select bonus perks, weapons or even extra lives based on your play style.The difficulty can be adjusted based on two parameters: The song you play and the base game's difficulty. Since the game's pace is based on your music's pace, speeding up and slowing down as the music does, creating a different play through for each song. You can also ramp up the challenge by selecting ""hardcore"", ""insane"" ""and suicidal"". I found ""hardcore"" to be a nice base for causal playing if you're looking for something that won't stress you out. ""Insane"" is great for a challenge and ""Suicidal"" is, well, suicidal. If you're looking to test your reflexes, it will show you no mercy. In my eyes, the visuals are what make this game so enjoyable. Even with roughly 40 hours of game play done at the time of this review, the visuals have yet to bore me. The visuals, much like the pace of the game, will fluctuate between slow and erratic, constantly changing colors. Players can adjust how strong they want the color effects from the ingame menu, helpful for those with sensitivity issues or that have a difficult time determining enemies from balls of light in the background. While your overall enjoyment and replayability may differ, the game is well polished and provides comfortable atmosphere and challenging game play. I've enjoyed every moment of this game.    Pros    Music - The game syncs to your media library, offering you as many songs to play against as you have. Track Diversity - The waves of enemies you meet and the pace you meet them changes on each track, keeping you on your toes. Visuals - Colorful, bright (sometimes too bright :P) and, frankly, pretty to watch.Challenge - The game can offer a constant challenge.    Cons    Without music on your PC, the game would be a shell of its former self. Aside from internet radio and a few built-in tracks, you'll not find much fun after a few play throughs. Having your own music is highly recommended. Overall, if you're a fan of music-based games, then I'd highly recommend looking into Beat Hazard.			"

												Literally hurts my eyes to look at.  There's a seizure warning before the game starts, and they're serious about it.  But the quick explaination is that it's like Audiosurf, where you pick one of your own songs and it generates a game for you to play, except instead of a guitar hero style rhythm game, this is like ... Asteroids?  Which is sort of a weird choice.  The two don't mesh well.			"

												I was put off this almost instantly.The visual clutter makes it nearly unplayable. I can't stress enough how hard it is to even see what's going on. Also in the limited time I did play (one very short session) I couldn't see any real connection between the song playing and what happened on the screen.Also, it has a windowed mode, but there's no way to actually scroll your mouse off of the screen to another tab so... that's... not actually what a windowed mode is for? What is this?Anyway, I was really turned off this quickly. Disappointed. I've never played a music/rhythm game before and this was a pretty bad first time.			"

 It's not about a music rhythm, it's about music as a track that scripts location of all enemies and asteroids in the game with pop-up bosses.  A huge disapointment with ""Shadow Operations"" missions, for example: ""Farm 40 000 000 points"" and if you die-that costs minus 1 000 000 points and, beliveve me, you will die  a LOT  in this game because of all the blinking, flashing lights and seizure effects. I do not reccomend to buy this game.			"

												Beat Hazard is a fun twin stick shooter where you select a track from your music library as your level selection.  While playing, you'll hear the track you selected and the enemy waves will be generated based on what you're hearing.  It happens in such a way that a given track will always play the same, allowing you to learn and get better at a specific track.The graphics are great, and the gamepad controls are perfect.  If you don't have a gamepad, you can attempt to make due with mouse and keyboard controls.Beat Hazard is also the only game I'm aware of that has in-game rewards for crafting its Steam badge.  You unlock a ship skin with the level 1 badge, the level 5 badge, and the foil badge.  These ship skins are purely aesthetic changes, though the width of the firing pattern does vary slightly between them.DLC:Beat Hazard Ultra completely transforms the game and makes it better in every way, adding more enemies, more bosses, and a perk system, as well as making enemy waves far less predictable.  Highly recommended.iTunes and m4a support is only necessary if you have music in these formats that you want to play.  Otherwise, you can ignore this DLC entirely.Shadow Operations Unit adds extra ships to the game with different stats and their own separate leaderboards, and Steam Workshop support for creating and sharing your own ships.  Each ship also has a set of missions (read: challenges) to complete.  Highly recommended.			"

												Beat Hazard is a glorious epileptic seizure inducing  ballet with spaceships, lasers, missiles, bosses, and space junk all waiting to be destroyed to the soundtrack of your choosing. Each level is configured around the song that you choose to play it to. The music list is limitless, because you are able to use music from your PC, the Beat Hazard soundtrack, and internet radio. I bought this game when it first came to Xbox Live Arcade and I was ecstatic that it was brought to PC. This is one game that I can sink a few minutes or an hour into simply because I can listen to great music while doing so! I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of playing their own soundtrack in a game.			"

												This is a game that is driven by your music. At first, it will take some getting use to the intense lights which make it hard to distinguish enemies and their fire. You'll soon find yourself immersed in the music and the more intense the music, the more powerful your ship's fire power! Don't worry if the only tracks you have on your computer are from Barney's Soundtrack (although the 'I Love You, You Love Me' song is surprisingly intense), Beat Hazard provides a nice sampling of music to play with.There are survival and 'chillout' modes, in addition to track by track play. The game rewards you via a ranking system so the more you play, the more points you score, the higher up the ranks you'll go. Ranks earn you bonuses in-game, giving you better starting stats, better score multipliers and more ways to stay alive.Putting all epilepsy jokes aside (no seriously, don't play if you are prone to seizures) this music+arcade shooter game will have you mesmerized from the start!

												Fantastic little time waster. If you're a particularly big fan of music, or music games, and like games like Asteroids, you'll probably like this. They have some built-in tracks if you don't have much music, and even have support for Internet radio. I don't know if it supports custom stations, but the selection is pretty decent without them.

												Trippy space battles with your music blaring in the background. This game is a fun joyride at lower prices, but most people won't get any more than a few hours out of it, before they grow bored.This is a game I definately suggest you wait for it to go on sale, before buying. Also keep in mind that trying to add too many tracks to the game library, actually seems to crash the game. A pity. I only got to about 4,000 tracks before mine started crashing.			"

												Excellent game, really incorporates the music well. I recommend using a controller if you have one, as that makes general controlling a lot easier.I recommend this game if you're into music or space shooters, but please avoid this game if you're sensitive to bright or flashing lights or have epileptic seizures in the presence of flashing or intense lights. The game is still a bit too intense for my eyes even at the lowest settings.			"

												This game has about a dozen serious flaws and countless minor ones. Being completely blasted by neon rainbows any time you do just about anything will probably make you want to rip your eyes out halfway through your first song. Even if it doesn't, there's basically no way to see any important information on the screen, like small ships and hazardous debris. More than half the time I die, it's not because I failed to dodge a bullet or enemy, but is instead because of something that I never saw at all.Power-ups will appear for a short duration, but the warning that they are about to disappear might as well not have been bothered being added given it's lack of usefulness. By the time they start to blink, unless you're practically on top of them already, there is no way you could possibly make it to pick them up anyways. This happens extremely frequently given that they drop randomly from enemies, and the enemies will frequently appear in extremely long strings from off screen. As a result, the enemies you kill will drop power-ups you can't reach because they are obstructed by other enemies.The stream of enemies from off screen is also frustrating, as like many top-down shooters in a box, enemies can appear from off screen right where you are without warning. As a result, you are really restricted to an even smaller play area unless you'd like to risk rage and frustration.Song volume seems to be a cosmetic power-up with no tangible effect in game. Added to the lack of significant differences between enemy appearance (there are about 5 non-bosses, with 3 beings practically identical), the game feels like it suffers from a shocking shortage of creativity. All in all, I highly recommend you avoid buying this game. Despite liking this style of game (both top-down arcade shooters and dynamic music driven games) I feel like I wasted my money even though I picked it up for just a few dollars during a sale.			"

												A really enjoyable bullet hell twin stick shooter. The music aspect basically comes down to everything speeding up when the music gets louder, and slowing down when the music gets softer, but the gameplay itself is solid. I've bought this game on both iOS and Steam, and both are excellent, although I prefer the Steam one as the virtual sticks on the iOS version can occasionally get frustrating to use. My biggest issue is the amount of potentially seizure-inducing flashing lights in the game by default, but thankfully you can turn down the visual intensity.8/10 So nice I bought it twice			"

												What's better than a Arcade Style Twin-Stick Shoot 'em up? The soundtrack that gets you pumped up in the game. This is one game that people who enjoy games and music should own. You'll never be ""done"" with this game, because your music makes the levels, and your high-scores are for each track. That means as long as you keep getting music, you keep getting more to do with this game. Then there is also the multiplayer co-op, versus, online, survival, and boss rush modes and many more options and perks (<- no really, you unlock perks), that keep the game interesting and challenging. Also makes for a nice background if you are into throwing parties with flashing lights and colors.			"

												The ability to put your music into a game and have it generate something out of the data it receives is nothing new.  However, having it actually create something awesome may very well be.  This arena shooter can range from mild to ballistic in terms of difficulty, and the methods in which the mobs and shots are spawned can be strangely accurate to the music playing.  One bizarre occasion, I was playing ""Army of Me - Bjork"" and near the entire level was just masses and masses of insignificant small mobs, which more or less describes what the song is about.  (piddly little problems that aren't enough to take me down) Stuff like this and the pheonomenal visuals make this worth anyone's time.  X360 controller very recommended.			"

												After playing Guitar Hero and Rock Band, to see another rhythm game available made me go, oh not again. After seeing the initial video of Beat Hazard, all that went out the window. When I actually bought the game and started playing, it blew me away. To actually have a game that alters the gameplay based on what music you choose is actually quite amazing. Add in the recent DLC, including iTunes support, and someone like me who has a pretty large collection of music will not get bored with the game. I really recommend not only getting the game itself, but also getting all of the DLC available, which will give you practically infinite hours of things to do in the game. New ships, new weapons, and even new enemies!			"

The game is absolutely fantastic, and if you have any taste and decency, you'll add it to your wish list at once. It's a bit like Audiosurf in that it uses your own music library to craft a game, but rather than a weird puzzle game, it's a visually stunning shmup that gets more and more crazy as you pump up the volume.

												Beat Hazard is a fun twin stick shooter where you select a track from your music library as your level selection.  While playing, you'll hear the track you selected and the enemy waves will be generated based on what you're hearing.  It happens in such a way that a given track will always play the same, allowing you to learn and get better at a specific track.The graphics are great, and the gamepad controls are perfect.  If you don't have a gamepad, you can attempt to make due with mouse and keyboard controls.Beat Hazard is also the only game I'm aware of that has in-game rewards for crafting its Steam badge.  You unlock a ship skin with the level 1 badge, the level 5 badge, and the foil badge.  These ship skins are purely aesthetic changes, though the width of the firing pattern does vary slightly between them.DLC:Beat Hazard Ultra completely transforms the game and makes it better in every way, adding more enemies, more bosses, and a perk system, as well as making enemy waves far less predictable.  Highly recommended.iTunes and m4a support is only necessary if you have music in these formats that you want to play.  Otherwise, you can ignore this DLC entirely.Shadow Operations Unit adds extra ships to the game with different stats and their own separate leaderboards, and Steam Workshop support for creating and sharing your own ships.  Each ship also has a set of missions (read: challenges) to complete.  Highly recommended.			"

												Beat Hazard is a arena dual stick shooter or arena shump if you prefer; mind you seeing how it's for PC is more or less keyboard and mouse shooter but don't let that take away from what this game actually is or dose.Graphically this game isn't anything special (let’s be honest this isn't the reason why you play it) it's the visuals; oh the visuals are just amazing due to it being a ""visualizer"" it does just that. Remember Apple's and Microsoft’s visualizer or maybe you're one of those people that still put that on. What IF you wanted to play a game in that cluster f***? Well you can!Controls (I personally like the keyboard and mouse so I mostly know them) are smooth and responsive as hell, the keyboard controls the ship and abilities, the mouse fires and also uses abilities; they're fully bindable. The controller plays just as you expect, one control stick controls the ship and the other fires in the direction, the abilities are used with the triggers (I think).The gameplay is well... you’re put in an arena; you listen to your music AND YOU SHOOT EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE UNTIL YOU GO BLIND or YOU DIE. Sounds simple enough, well it's just that honestly. Depending upon the song this can be easy as hell or so hard you just wanna kill someone! The online is a bit weak due to ""you must have the same copy of the song"" due to piracy; co-op isn't bad; I only really played an hour on co-op.While the game is fun and awesome there are some things that just fall flat on its face. The fact that Ultra is DLC; this isn’t a bad thing but compared to the original the Ultra DLC offers WAY more in content and gameplay, I’m not saying the original isn’t fun but it comes across kind of lame in comparison… at least for me, there are quite a bit of people who just like the original more. Once you beat the game, level to the highest level and get all of the achievements it offers very little to come back to. Some bullets are VERY hard to see considering what it is and that’s the point but sometimes you’ll be wondering what just killed you!? The games difficulty is great and all but it also leads to certain songs being balls hard while some easy as hell.This game is one of my favorite music based games and it’s completely fun but it offers no reliability or even an incentive to even come back to, some may find that not such a big deal considering the price of the game but once you’re done… you’re actually done… of course there is a leaderboard so… there’s that I guess. The visuals are great but can lead to mystery deaths. Songs can be way too hard or way too easy, sometimes you can’t find a middle ground. Is the game worth it? Yes, but I love music and at times play games with my music. This game really depends if you can stand a lot of visuals, love music.(My first review)			"

												If you're a fan of either music games or twitch arcade shooters you'll probably love Beat Hazard.The mechanics are esentially a homage to the classic arcade Asteroids... except made completely insane by more visual stimuli than the human eye can probably process. The real hook of the game though is that every level is generated by whatever music track you've selected. It's easy to zone out as you steer your little ship through bullet hell while jamming along to whatever it is you fill your iDevice with.Bottom line is that the game is fun as hell. And it's replay value is roughly whatever the size of your music collection is (although the included tracks are actually quite good). Just be aware of the photosensitive warning at the game's start. This game isn't messing aorund. There will be colors flying everywhere constantly.And did I mention this game was made by just one man? Indie game win.			"

												The best game that deserves it's siezue warning. Neat mechanic where your ship's laser power is dependant in large part on the speed and volume of the music chosen to be played. Don't bother attack during slow bits. It's shockingly bright and colotful and that seems to be what kills you more than enemies themselves being dangerous.			"

												Another ""goes with your music"" game. Like Audiosurf, it has almost unlimited gameplay depending on how large your music collection is. Very fun game, if you love music and epic space battles, give it a try. The only drawback is that the game is much better if you have a 360 controller. It's much easier to control and shoot than Mouse/KB.			"

												As a game that uses lots of strobe effects and tons of objects, it looks like a turnoff and a headache. But going deeper in this game, it is actually a very fun ship shooter experience. The usage of music is nice by using changes in intensity, which the game encourages by putting Volume powerups to increase the music volume. The enemy types are varied well, from asteroids to dummy ships to more interesting tentacles and gunships. Each enemy is weak or very powerful and able to deal massive damage. The music not only afffects weapon powerups but subtly the light intensity and enemy speed. This game's built in collection of music is a more hardcore experience best suited for the gameplay, but using your own music is also in itself very fun. Certain songs can be funny and give unexpected results or a good song for a game.Though the graphics might be too much for some people, Beat Hazard combines addictive space shooting with the power of users' music.

Just play it on a hard difficulty mode with a lively track, and you'll sometimes find yourself wondering where your ship is.It can be played with either the standard mouse+keyboard combo or an xbox controller.Cold Beam Games is slated to release Beat Hazard Ultra at sometime during the second quarter of 2011, which will include online multiplayer (opposed to local only, as it is at the moment) as well as other nifty features.It should show up as DLC, but it might be a separate game so keep that in mind.

												I found a work around on a forum online, I still cannot launch the game from steam, but I now can at least run it. With the steam sale going on I'd recomend getting it. If its not onsale, until they can fix the issues you might want to hold off, but I enjoy it enough to say get it. ""The Current version fails to load with an error regarding my video settings, but crashes and does not allow me to change in game said settings. So disapointing since the game is quite fun, however until that is fixed I cannot reccomend the game.""			"

												Honestly I love this game, it itsn't overly addictive (for me at least) but it's a lot of quick easy fun (if that's not your deal there's always the harder difficulties to conquer). It comes with quite a few good tracks and the ability to use your own which is great. It has great replay value since it isn't about the storyline or unlockables, just each level and even if it's the same song each expirence is different.Great game!			"

												Quick pros and cons rundown-+Works with any song (within a number of formats) fairly well.+Seizures+lazers (right?)+easy ship customization (DLC)+replayability, good to pass time+visually pretty spectacular+works with replay gain-DLC's should be free-I wish at times it didn't go through the included music.-Don't turn up your volume on the first level-More perks that are harder to get-visual theme (menus) could be packaged a little cleaner-no linux icon (not a big problem, but it'd be nice to have)I've played this game for about an hour now, and so far I'm really liking it. At first I didn't get why there was no music on the first game, and then I got VOL's and nearly shattered my eardrums, it's a first time thing, but I think there could at least be a first-time warning. I also began to realize that my music was being drowned out by explosions and gunfire, which can be turned off, but I think they're a bit much to begin with. There are some cool options, my entire library works perfectly (with replay gain, that's definitely a big plus), and this game is definitely worthy of the seizure warning on the front, if you haven't already gathered that. I think this game would be pretty good for passing the time, especially after you get a new album or something. Thing is, I got the entire bundle on slae for $5, and while this is a great game, I would pay the $10, but I really think that should inculde the shadow ops stuff and the ultra stuff as well. The ship creator that comes with shadow ops is very intuitive from what I've seen (I haven't made anything yet), but it looks like you can upload any image and tweak the stats to your liking. Issue being, again, I think that should be built into the game rather than DLC. Visually the game is fantastic, but I think the whole theme could be wrapped together a little nicer, as it's a little all-over-the-place. In game it looks very nice, and I LOVE how the clouds and stars pulse to the music: that aspect is perfect. What isn't perfect is that the enemies don't sync into the music as good as they could, and it seems like, in comparison, Symphony does a bit of a better job, but I've only seen videos, so I can't confirm that. The perks system is cool, but I think there could be more, as your selection is kind of limited, and I also flew through a ton of ranks really quickly (and I'm not super good), so maybe those should be harder to get. Also, it will randomly go through the included music in the menu, which I think isn't.. exactly... adequate.... Overall I think it's a neat casual-to-hardcore game with some great replayability and a price that could come down just a bit.			"

												 - PROS -I got absolutely stunned by all the flashing lights, the colors and the music that was already in the game, it is your own personal Rave Party ( without the girls ;) ) You open the game it has the warning about the visual effects and it's generally addiciting and fun aswell as being able to upload the songs and even challenge a friend on your favorite tracks. It's pretty well optimized and doesn't require anything. It is just as noobfriendly as it is challenging for some Counter-Striker Swedish E-sport player. - CONS - The game's effects is both a blessing and a curse, the curse about it is when it actually gets in the way if you put it on too high % of the effects. The game can also slowdown if you have too much stuff on the screen if you're using a lower PC-Rig.I am also gonna note that be careful when you're using a controller because at one point I had the controller in and put it out and the game just flipped out and was on the xbox controller menu like you constantly pressed the A button aswell as going down in the menu automaticly, maybe it is my controller config but that's a warning nonetheless.- CONCLUSION -Overall the problems with the controllers are gone and it's definetly a fun and amazing game to try out if you're just bored and want to listen to music. Do not play this if you have a confirmed epilepsi. I had Epilepsi when I was a child but it is gone for me but that's a good advice. It's a great game and its worth a shot and grab Ultra while you're at it. Worth every penny.VIII of X  Pyros! "

												This game for me was quite a surprise, a great surprise.  I do not normally play these types of games, but this game to me feels like a mix of the old Atari game Asteroids mixed with the music you normally listen to.  On top of that, it is like Asteroids on steroids.  At first I never thought I would be able to complete a mission on Hardcore, but as time went on my skill improved and I recently finished a mission on Suicidal.  This is one of the most fun, addictive games I have ever played and I am so happy I found it.This game has several difficulties, perks that you choose to help you defeat the enemy, different ships you can select which have different fire patterns, speeds, inertia.  This game is so challenging on so many different levels, add in your own music and it is simply one of the best games ever.			"

												This game may be simple, but it is one of the few games that I have never played the same way twice. You have as much freedom as you could possiblyneed, since it is powered by your own music library. Not only is it visually impressive, but the levels of difficulty are greatly matched to give you a wide spectrum of options. Most of the fun comes from creating your own challenges and goals. Try going as long as you can without firing your weapon, or only move your ship to the beat of the music, things like that.This game is fun by yourself, but also has great party game potential. Plus it into the living room sound system, and you got music and entertainment covered			"

												Beat Hazard is quite the interesting game. It offers some rapid-fire shmup action combined with multicolored flashing lights and the ability to integrate your own music library. Altogether, it offers a fast paced, ever changing audiovisual experience.Yes, the game has its flaws. Gameplay is rather straightforward, and there is not much offered by music integration, aside from some frustration when calm sections result in an extremely weak ship. For many people, the visual effects are too distracting, and in some cases, can cause aching eyes or seizures.Beat Hazard is not for everyone, particularly those uninterested in shmups and those with epilepsy or similar physical handicaps related to flashing lights. And if your music library is entirely composed of ballads and lullabies? You should definitely avoid this game, or at least think twice about purchasing it before you tire of the games included music selections. However, if you enjoy rapid space stick shooters, have a fancy for light shows, and/or own a decently sized collection of upbeat or high-energy music, then this is the game for you.			"

												Very fun game when you're just wanting to chill and listen to some tunes.While playing I noticed that when there are heavy base elements (drums and the like) little tiny explosions of color go off all over the screen. This is where things got ugly. I decided, ""Hey, I'll play some Metallica!"" I browsed through my media and landed upon Death Magnetic (an album known for how incredibly loud Lars' drums are). I put on ""All Nightmare Long"" and set it for normal mode with 100% visuals. During a large boss encounter Lars' drums sounded with a bang, and before I knew it I was englufed into a sea of beautiful explosions, then I died from a seizure. I am dead now, God let me use his PC to type this review in the hopes that lives can be saved. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT play any tracks from Death Magnetic with 100% visuals, you will die.			"

It's your average space old-school shooter game combined with INSANE visual effects that go with YOUR music. ANY song, reads its bpm's, peaks and lows and then manages it to put into a unique, fast-paced action shooter. The enemies move according to the song, the pace goes along with the song, your shooting style goes along with the song - everything in a perfect and beautiful sync. The game is never ending since you can play it with any song on your computer - and every run is different. JUST BUY IT10/10			"

Nothing will not appear, and it will kill you multiple times. This is not an error, it's not a glitch; if you move over a completely empty space at a time dictated by the game when nothing should be there, nothing will kill you and render the game pointless to play.There is no point in playing a game when the difficulty is decided by random chance with no possibility for any comeback, skill or strategy to take place.

I spent hours on end playing this game just to see how many hordes of enemies some of my favorite tunes generate.

												I love this game. As a metal head, my music really makes the game shine! This game seems like a cheap personal project at first glance, but once you get into the game with your favorite songs loaded up, you can see how brilliant it is and how well the aspects of the game tie in with the music. The gameplay overall is fairly simple, but still challenging and fun. This will be my go-to game when I want to waste time enjoying my music and playing games, without having to worry about hearing whats going on in the game.			"

												I don't particularly like the font used for the menus.That's seriously all I can find wrong with this game, it's flawless. Definitely worth the buy.For music I recommend Two Steps From Hell and Boxcutter, but I've tried it with everything from The Mamas And The Papas to ELO and it's always great.			"

												This game OH MY! where should i start....If you love music you will love this game, it just gets more and more intense the more you build your playlists. The biggest thing for me is I write alot of my own music...and I can import that in here too and that is soo cool to use your own music to a game, or write music for a video game like this, but anyway! this game, you should buy it because it has that huge nostalgia feel of top down flying shooters, and then with the whole music dynamic MY WORD that is all i can say...BUY THIS			"

												This game is on sale right now (6/26/14) and you should probably buy it. Or any time in the future it comes on sale. I haven't had this much fun with a random purchase sale game since Anomaly, and boy is it worth it. Don't rock the epilepsy and I'm sure you'll have a blast with this game, either included music or your own. You don't need to play it with just your standard electro pop that you think might be most appropriate, one of my most frentic games was when I played Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes. There is a fair amount of skill involved, and you'll need to heighten your spatial awareness to pay attention to what's going on (one of the DLC's includes an option to downgrade the visual effects, if you're that kind of person). There's even a persistent upgrade system and missions and leaderboards and online play (which I haven't tried yet) and local multiplayer (which I also haven't tried yet). It's a fun♥♥♥♥♥bundle of a cheap game that'll rock for you if you've got music on your computer, or want to rediscover the music that's already there. I can't recommend this game enough, there's so much to it. I'd like to think that if you projected it on a screen at a dance party it'd be a ♥♥♥♥ing blast. It's beyond competent and extremely colorful, a great break from whatever dark gritty open world zombie survival crafting game I'm sure you've been playing recently. 9/10			"

												This game...This one. It's one of the ones you'd find in the dark depths of the ocean, accompannied by several other good titles that aren't very known.Even though the game can become an eye sore, with all the seizure-capabilities it has, its all really up to you.The main objective of this game is to undergo a bright physical manifestation of music you choose.For example, dubstep can have many ""blams"" and ""booms"" and can have multiple colors on the screen. There'd be many enemies to destroy, and, since dubstep is fast beats, the gameplay will be difficult and rapid.On the other hand, classical music, for example, will have slow gameplay, and powerful ""clings"" and ""wozow"".Yeah. I believe you should get this. Unless you are epileptic.Then I strongly urge you not to buy it.			"

												Being someone who loves music, loves space shooters, and loves strobing lights that would give the ordinary person an epileptic seizure even if they have no prior record to it, I have to say that I love this game. The only problem is when you've already beaten the songs you have, you have to find more, since the enemies that spawn don't change as far as I can tell within a single difficulty for a given song. However, finding new songs is always a good thing, and whenever you do get new songs, it's fun to fire up Beat Hazard and see if you can beat them.			"

												Pretty awesome rhythm-based game, where the songs on your own hard drive determine your gameplay experience.  Anyone familiar with Audiosurf or Rhythm Zone should understand the concept.  What you get with Beat Hazard is essentially a really fun, effective mix of Asteroids and Audiosurf, complete with great, vibrant graphics, high replayability, and fun gameplay.  Each song you play will generate a different experience, with your guns and the enemies getting stronger and quicker as the song gets faster and more intense, and will also generate boss fights randomly throughout.Beat Hazard comes with single player, two-player, online co-op and competitive multiplayer, and lots of perks (upgrades) you can equip in your ship's slots, tailoring the game to your style.  Really enjoyable game overall, and worth it if you have lots of songs on  your computer.  There's a demo on Steam, so check it out!			"

As asteroids and foes fly all around you, bosses attack, you see (quite litterally) how your music goes. Even in the music/stage selection, you hear one of your songs. Try this one game out, it won't dissapoint.  Just don't play it if you suffer from epilepsy : lots and lots of strobing lights.			"

												As a Bullet Hell Shooter, it's one of the smoothest I've played, and doing it to my music is really fun. However, the ultimate 'thumbs down', however tentative (consider this a 6/10), is because the game pisses me off so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ much.Mainly it's the Shadow Missions; they're just way too unforgiving. As in, 'you will probably wake up covered in someone's blood' levels of unforgiving. Say, for example, a Shadow Mission saying ""Beat 3 Songs on Insane Difficulty."" Fine.Songs only count if they're 3:30+ long. Fine.If you die ONCE during this song (considering you have like 5 lives from the outset so if you're any good you should seldom fail a mission) it won't count towards your mission progress.This is where you're gonna get angry. REALLY angry. You could get to the last 10 seconds of a song and die to a missile you couldn't see due to the game's patented Seizure-o-vision, and the game will flip you the bird and your time will have been wasted. If it was an instant game over when you died, it would be a bit more bearable, but as it is? You're gonna swear, you're gonna break stuff, you're gonna fantasize about meeting the people who designed these missions and kicking them repeatedly in the crotch.Back to the topic of the flashing lights, I started getting a headache within SECONDS of hitting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed MAIN MENU. The photosensitive seizure warning at the start doesn't do justice to just how much eyestrain you're gonna experience. On top of that, the obnoxious flashing lights make it near impossible to see the, say, red glowing seeker mines or the tiny missiles that'll kill you and give a solid 'F U' to your current Shadow Mission.I'm perfectly fine with games being difficult, so long as they're FAIR. Super Meat Boy is fair. Dark Souls is fair. In both of those games, when you die, it's YOUR FAULT. Here, though, you could die to something you couldn't even SEE through the flashing lights, and the game will essentially kneecap you.I'm sorry but, for whatever fun I was having, I'm more likely to remember my foaming rage than I am to remember any enjoyment.

												A music driven game that thrives on the thrills of shmups! blasting enemies at the speed of the song currently playing, you can up the level of difficulty with not just the regular game but also with the DLC ""Ultra"". I do not recommend if you have seizures, or if you get headaches from flashy lights of different colors. You can turn down the flashy, but only to 50%. It seems tolerable and not as bad on the eyes at that rate, while still keeping the effects it gives off.A plus is being able to use your OWN music! :D			"

It’s quick, visually stimulating almost to the point where you lose track of your own ship only to crash into an enemy taking one of your lives. With the ability to select your own tracks from your computer, reminding me of other “song-driven” type games like Frets on Fire and Beat Mania, allows for the game to feel new and refresh every time you play.http://iamericm.com/2013/05/beat-hazard-ultra-indie-game-review-2/ "

Now my thumbs are bleeding from the extensive playing, five days have passed, and I'm only about five percent through my music collection. I may not survive this journey.			"

												I love this game, but I'm not 100% sure it's for everybody. If you ask me, the fun to be had in this game is directly proportional to the player's fondness for music (Measured on a scale of 1-100, with 100 being a devout musical fanboy or girl of all genres, one who never complains about ""music not being as good as (x years) ago, always being happy with what's being played at any given location, etc.) multiplied by his/her library of songs. The fun in this case is measured in ""ET-ites"" where 10 ET-ites would mean that a given game is 10 times more fun than playing ET. for the Atari 2600. For me, this game measures in at around... 40 Kilo-ET-ites.			"

												Beat Hazard is one of those twin-stick shooters that you can have a literal ""blast"" with your music.  While the controls works best with a controller, they're still solid with a mouse & keyboard.The difficulty with the game & the stages vary based on how you equip your ship with power-ups, items & unlockables.  This really makes it easy to play the game with your music.  If you don't have a great music library on hand OR want something completely different, tap into an online radio station & play with whatever they happen to be broadcasting (one way to keep you on your toes)!While the DLC is mostly optional, I do recommend picking it up for the best experience.

												Two-stick-shooter, score multipliers, power-ups...visually disorienting...I've heard it described as ""Asteroids on acid"". I cannot disagree with that.Reminds me of my days as an arcade-rat. In a good way.I've tried Beat Hazard with speed metal, hardcore punk, various electronic stuff, Beatles, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, African trance drumming, ""new age"" stuff, comedy songs, 70-80's pop (Loverboy, KISS etc.) and some classical.Custom level for every piece of music, yet the same level every time you play that tune. ♥♥♥♥ing brilliant algorithm, really. It's interesting to see how it interprets songs.A slow, yet sonically rich, piece will yield as much of a challenge as a high-speed-blitz kind of song, just...different.Motorhead? Sigur Ros? Duran Duran? Yes.			"

												Wasn't too happy with my last review, so I'd figured why not write another one. Beat Hazard, is by far one of my favorite game of all time. Even though I barely play it, I've been having so much fun with the game. As soon as a friend comes over, the first thing I show them is Beat Hazard with any of my favorite songs, it brings many lol's, believe me. Beat Hazard is an arcade game (very similiar to the asteroid games on Atari back in the day), with a mix of epileptic light flashings and your own music pumping to the beat. A very fun game and total recommend.10/10			"

												Of all the games that use your music library to create a stage to play on, Beat Hazard tops the list.  It's not just a simple platformer or racing game like the others, but it is instead a side-scrolling shooter where your enemies, their strength, and your power-ups are determined by the songs you play.Combine this with good support for multiple file types and internet radio, and you've got a fun casual game that uses music really well for some dynamic gameplay.  Pick this game up if you want a fun side-scrolling shooter to play with your music!			"

There is even an upgrade system that alows you to become more skilled at bringing death at every and any beat.

The flashing strobe lights are NOT good for your eyes xD. I dont mind, because i dont have seizures or anything xD.Play it in moderation though, take it from me xD "

												Beat Hazard is a very pretty and colorful game/mp3 player. Yes, it has a music player feature as well, with access to a few radio stations as well, making it neat to have open during parties. o_o Personally, it is my favorite music-based game so far. Of course, the gameplay is fairly simple, and yet complicated. Shoot things, and survive till you reach the end of the song you're playing. Go for a highscore. Simple enough concept. The complications are involved within the music, as your music selection may make the song/level easier or harder. The louder the music, the stronger your ship's firepower is. There are power ups that can help you, and upgrades for them. With the Beat Hazard Ultra DLC, it adds many more to the game like more power ups like missiles, beams, and a reflector shield, as well as different types of enemies to shoot at as well. Add to that, additional features such as new modes, online co-op, etc., makes it a fairly solid game.			"

												A very fun twin stick shooter (can't imagine playing it with just keyboard controls).  Every track of music is a level, but they're all essentially the same, so this is a game you play for high scores, achievements, to level up your perks, etc.  It's not a game you beat.  I had a lot of ufn listening to songs from my library and shooting stuff while doing it.  Check out the free demo.			"

That being said, this game is definately not epilepsy friendly.			"

But instead of surfing your song, you are fighting it. the song drives many parts of the game play, from what enemies spawn, to what weapons bosses might be equipped with, all the way up to just how much power your own guns have.If you like the Shoot'em up games, and you like the idea of audio surf, then this might be the game for you. and i challenge you to try your favorite comedy routine.

Get with a friend in this arcade style game and you'll have a blasty blast while listening to your favorite music. The ridiculous lights and explosions will make anyone say ""ooooohhh"" as you destroy space junk and enemy ships. The game has several modes to play as well, giving you several ways to enjoy the game. Leaderboards are included, as well as ways for you to see how you compare against your friends. It's a great game to play in your spare time if you’re bored or want to listen to your music a little more interactively. For only $10 (or even better when on sale) it's worth the fun and the lightshow.			"

												This game has great visuals and gameplay that is a throwback to the old school game called Astroids. The vallina game has upgrades that allows you to gain more points and make the fights more intense as you decimates entire waves of eneimes depending on the the song you used as well as the difficuty. The Ultra DLC is a bounus to the basic game by adding ""Perks"" for you to buy and choose depending on your play style. It also adds more types of enemies into the mix that makes the game more challenging to play. There is also new weapons for players to destroy enemies with which includes: Ultra Laser, Homing Missiles, and Ultra Shields each lasting for a few seconds. The games modes include Standard play, Endless mode, ""Chill Out"" mode which has infinite lives and no score, and Boss Rush Mode(Ultra). It even includes local and online co-op. It is also helpful to buy the iTunes and m4a support DLC as well.Please note that this game (just as like as any rhythm/music game in general) is limited to the amount of songs you have in your library. As playing the same song over and over again will get repetitive even if the online leaderboards give the incetive to play the same song again to get a high score. The options here are little left to be desired as the visuals here is quite stuning and flexable when running on older PCs. And the config file outside of the game have a few more advance options for the user to create. There is also rebindable keys and buttons for controlers which support. There is an option to use last.fm if the player has not many songs to choose from. Beat Hazard is a great alternative to the well known Audiosurf and can provide tons of fun and challenge to the player in a top down twin-stick shooter fashion.     "

												Awesome game. I've wasted many hours on it.Beat Hazard plays best with electronic music, but it works very well for nearly everything if most of the song isn't quiet and slow (with slow songs the game plays more like a bullet hell shooter, but with more ships instead of bullets).I suggest turning off V-Sync. Doing so should double the number of particles on screen, making the game that more beautiful and hectic.			"

Some songs are more challanging than others, and completing a song can be difficult.  It's a fun little spaceship game that I would recommend for anyone.  However, it's also a very flashy game, so if you are prone to seizures, you may want to avoid this game.  Give it a try.  It can be addicting!			"

By doing so, you get an absolutely beautiful lightshow and a song of your choice that tailors what your experience is like! It takes the idea of Audiosurf and puts it on a new level. I'm sure i'll get plenty of hours out of this, and you will too if you have a solid library of electronic songs. If you don't, they also have radio stations you could play along to!			"

												Considering my first 5 minute test run of this game turned into a 40 minute shoot fest, I have to admit this game is pretty downright addicting! Pros: -Simple Gameplay mechanics so it's quick to learn-No longer having to decide between listening to music or playing games-As both the enemies and your guns are affected by the music, there is always a very fluid balance-As many levels as you have music-Plenty of growth with bonuses, unlocks to keep you interestedCons:-VERY visually overpowering (I have it set to 50% and it's still pretty mind numbing so take the siezure warning seriously)-3/4 time songs are a pain to do.... Death Waltz has new meaning!-Any song that goes quiet for the bridge is DEADLY-The money system is not quite intuitive.... I end up with less money than I collect over the level (this is probably me being dumb though)-Not so much a con but it would be nice to be able to link youtube videos or music websites the same way we can do internet radioFinal thoughts:This game is awesome! The level generation based on music is done beautifully making it difficult but never impossible. It is visually overwhelming but in the most beautiful way. Give it a try and I hope you find your 5 minute game sessions bursting into hour long adventures as well!			"

Get with a friend in this arcade style game and you'll have a blasty blast while listening to your favorite music. The ridiculous lights and explosions will make anyone say ""ooooohhh"" as you destroy space junk and enemy ships. The game has several modes to play as well, giving you several ways to enjoy the game. Leaderboards are included, as well as ways for you to see how you compare against your friends. It's a great game to play in your spare time if you’re bored or want to listen to your music a little more interactively. For only $10 (or even better when on sale) it's worth the fun and the lightshow.			"

This seems like a simple thing to add.- There aren't that many types of bosses. I would love to see more because it helps mix up the gameplay "

												So first purchasing the game, it seemed to be quite a refreshing buy from my norm, and it's good to get out of one's comfort zone, but not like this. I cannot sit through these kind of visuals, it's unimaginably bad. Big random particle effects are not fun, they strain the eyes. But when you turn them off, you see the games dull interior. Stock ships and static icons to go around. I tried playing the hardest mode to see if the ships really could be differentiated, but alas, no. Even if the artists of the game make each ship a different color, they would still look the same.That's on top of the fact that they use the same ships over and over again. There is one scout ship design, but there could be 30 of the things on the screen. It just looks ugly. But when you get to a boss, that's the really kicker. They start to shed hundreds of the same little yellow and red triangle looking thing, until you get to the gross interior of this thing. It makes it even worse by the very black background. Puke green on black, awesome.The meat of the game comes from it's one gimmick: your music fuels the game. Yeah right, more like background music to boring game play. I put in one of the most techno songs I had, it had a base drop and everything, and the game didn't even follow the beat of the damned song! You put in ""Marry had a little lamb"" and you still wouldn't know how the song and game play correspond. The ships come in at random, and you shoot them. I thought the lasers would of had a beat to follow the song, but no. Nothing of the sort came my way, only disappointment.This game is nothing but a bunch of static images shoot particle effects. This game should be for like 2 bucks, but it's 10. Plus, it's necessary DLC, Shadow Operations Unit. That. unlocks the steam workshop and missions. It might of done something else, but not as far as I got. The first thing I looked at before even playing the game was a logo that looked like it was made in MS Paint. It was an unskippable text cut scene that felt like 15 minutes.I was genuinely surprised that some of the most basics things to a game were DLC, which made me wonder when the DLC came out. Turns out Shadow Operations Unit came out 4 YEARS after the games initial release. What? It took these smucks 4 years to add missions and a leader board? That's horrible. M4A file support wasn't even available at launch. (just as a side note, there is an option to play the game in classic mode, but I couldn't even get that to work)But wait! There's more! The game didn't even work for me for the first hour after buying it. It kept crashing, so I had to go find the file, and change it's properties, and then create a different file to put in the roaming folder to make it windows and HOLY CRAP. I should not have to do this much computer work to make a game work properly. Even after that, the game still crashed during game play. I am running win8.1 and even games that ran on XP work, so this is inexcusable.If you skipped down to the bottom to get my verdict here it is: it's bad, eye straining, and doesn't even work properly. Everyone should treat this game like it's a hazard.			"

												This game is well designed and incredibly fun. Audio is replicated as sprites on screen that are used to create an 'Asteroids'-like scene. You control a small ship that has to take everything on the screen, out. Graphics are edgy and audio is... your choice. Well worth the buy!			"

												I picked this up for $2.50, and a couple UI and file navigation issues aside, this is a really fun game/visualiser/screensaver/whatever. At the very least it's one of the most entertaining ways to listen to a new album you just got. But then again I am a big fan of games where you dodge and shoot stuff.			"

												The best music game ever made.  Your music affects your weapons and the speed of the game. Faster music will be frantic and you have to really focus on making sure your ship is in the right place with all the crazy light effects. Slower songs will require an intense focus and precision movements.			"

												Now let me tell you something, I'm the sort of guy who picks up even AAA titles at usually less than $5 prices. I will wait YEARS for them to get such deep discounts. Not prone to impulse purchases at all!BUT THIS GAME....OMG! As soon as I was done with the demo I went straight to the store page and CLICKED ADD TO CART IMMEDIATELY on the Mega Bundle! I didn't care how much it was! This...never happens with me. This game is just that good!If you're like me who likes to be doing something while listening to music - buy it! If you like pretty space shooters - buy it! If you like bullet hell games - buy it! If you have friends to play with - buy it for them too! The only reason I can think of for not getting this game is if you're prone to seizures because of strobing lights and bright pulsating visuals. Seriously stop reading and go get this one!			"

												It's music-based, mind-numbing, time sink. Fantastic fun, especially with a friend. The enemies and your weapons are driven by the music (that you supply), so it won't be quite as exhilarating to sonatas as hardcore electronic or rock music.			"

												The graphics are really intense even if you aren't epileptic lol i recommend setting the intensity to about 75%. the gameplay is best on hardcore mode and higher.  overall? the idea of me adding my music is so awesome and the gameplay/graphics are beautiful. it looks kinda like an old school arcade shooter but with sorta next gen graphics. it's really cool to me! 10/10			"

												Amazingly relaxing game, reminds me of audiosurf in a good way. The artstyle is a bit off to me (flying objects/enemies don't seem to match the rest of the visuals and background), but honestly it's not too distracting from the pretty flashing lights/lasers or the actual gameplay.			"

												This is a new take on the classic asteroids game with music. What defines it apart from every other clone of this really old game is that you can use radio stations, the in house music, or your own to have your tailored experience in which no one else will be able to reproduce without that musical piece. There are five difficulties in which the lowest has the least amount of enemies on screen and allows you to virtually stay in one place while playing on the hjighest difficulty there will be so many enemies on the screen  you will be constantly forced to move out of the center of the map just to get that maximum bullet spread. Do be weary of staying on the sides, as just with the orignal game it is spawned out of, enemies will pop out of the other side in which you cannot even do. The difficulty is also controlled by the tempo of each of the instruments and keeping to such the enemies, your rate of fire, thier rate of fire is all controlled by that so hold on to the seat of your pants and find the highest bpm music you can find. The electronica genre is very good for this type of adaptive difficulty.However, there are a few minor flaws, just like almost every other game in its genre since the SNES days, and that is once things get crowded enough you cannot even see the bullets that are being hid behind all the strobing light effects, explosions, and everything else flying around the screen. This would not be so bad if turning the intensity of the effects didn't also effect the intensity of the light of the bullets being shot at you.Overall, I would recommend the game.			"
