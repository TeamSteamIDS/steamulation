												FINAL DOOM is a package of two highly acclaimed “megawads” or collections of fan-made levels. In all you get 60 very well-designed levels, which equals about twice the length of DOOM II, or nearly the combined length of DOOM II and THE ULTIMATE DOOM. It’s highly recommended you play those two games before touching this one.FINAL DOOM adds literally no new mechanics or anything to the table. It’s kind of just an extension of DOOM II -- sort of like the difference between SUPER MARIO BROS. and SUPER MARIO BROS. 2 THE LOST LEVELS. Another reason the comparison is apt is because of FINAL DOOM’s increased difficulty over id Software’s original creations.What makes the maps in FINAL DOOM so good is that they were designed specifically for people who’ve already completed the first two games and are thus already highly accustomed to how DOOM works. The fan levels manipulate enemies, items, and the gimmicks of DOOM in ways beyond what id explored.Between the two megawads, “TNT Evilution” in particular manages to feel tough but fair. It spends a lot of time using enemies in ways DOOM and DOOM II didn’t prepare you for, messing with preconceived notions and tactics that may have gotten you through those games.You may end up in tight quarters with a Hell Knight or a corridor with a Revenant, subverting how you usually fight against them. Despite stuff like this, the levels are designed to where you can always find new ways to deal with old problems. In this way TNT manages to always keep you guessing.The other megawad -- “The Plutonia Experiment” -- on the other hand, feels a little bit cheap in my opinion. It definitely feels possible to beat, but ramps up the difficulty pretty much as soon as you begin and puts you in a lot of downright crappy situations without warning. Whereas TNT gradually ramps up the grade of enemies and weapons, Plutonia throws Revenants and Mancubuses at you on its first level. I also think it overuses chaingunners. If you’re a stubborn kind of gamer you can still enjoy it, but it’s noticeably more frustrating than TNT.FINAL DOOM is sort of like an ultimate mastery of old school DOOM, its levels making the most of DOOM’s mechanics and requiring the most of the skills you developed in the original two games. That, and being basically twice the content of an actual official DOOM game, make it one the most valuable collections of commercial fan content around.			"

 Disregard the playtime. I was playing this through Zandronum. (Well, at the time I had 0.5 on record, now I play it through GZDoom) In my opinion, I think this is the best installment in the Doom series. This has an end to things as it is the ""final"" chapter (duh) to the Doom series, it's so refreshing to play a classic FPS game once again. What do you get in this masterpiece? Two new episodes, Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment with 32 maps each, 64 maps in total. Complete with its own custom soundtrack, a conclusion to the original Doom story. It is essentially a Doom 3, before Doom 3. Team TNT and the Casali Brothers did an outstanding job on the maps for both episodes. If you thought that Doom 1 or Doom 2, or even the Master Levels in Doom 2 weren't challenging enough, pick this game up. It's definitely worth your money. If you want even more of a challenge, play this on Black Metal difficulty in Brutal Doom or Ultimate Complexity (I think that's the name) difficulty on Complex Doom. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Even though is old, it is so much fun!The game was released year 1996 (According to Steam) which is a great reason to the pixelated, Psyche-3D graphics.However, because the game is old also comes with positive sides. For example:- Lossless gameplay- Nostalgia- (Pretty) Simple game controls.Lossless gameplay:Means that the game has nothing that breaks the gameplay at any point. You press ""New Game"", then you're already in the game. Nothing in the middle at all. And that's how the game is all the way until the end (Because then you've finished it).Nostalgia:It speaks for itself. If you're familiar with the 90's FPS games, this will have effect. As the game was released in 1996 (As I said before), the way the game looks like and is played is like all the other game from the 90's. Note that the game has a lot of secrets and tricks. These will help when you need it, but you need to find them first (The best way is to just mash space at all the walls in the room).(Pretty) Simple game controls:The buttons used aren't many. Arrow keys, W, A, S, D, Control (Ctrl), Shift, Alternative (Alt), Space. If you want (Highly recommended), you can activate the mouse by pressing the scroll wheel. Then you can look around with the mouse and shoot with Left Click. You'll find this really useful, as it's easier to aim at the enemy with this setup.Also, the game is really hard. But here's some helpful hints you can have use of:- Move. Like an idiot. The most lethal shots are not instant, and sends a projectile that can be avoided.- Use multiple save slots. Using only one can get you in trouble.- Scavenge. If you're low on health, go back and try to pick up stimpacks and first aid kits left behind. Try also to find secrets.- Pay attention to sounds. If you do, you can sometimes foresee if there's an enemy behind a door or not.- Save frequetly. Every time you've cleaned a room, save. If you're low on health, save in a different save slot.This is not necessary, but I recommend using ZDoom instead of the original game. Why is because it runs much smoother and looks much better. ZDoom is also free, but requires you to buy the original game first (Otherwise it doesn't have the files required to run the game).			"

												All time best game.  This is a so old game that you may consider to be outdated. However, it is a big mistake. In those days, there were no graphic techniques, but this game was organized very well based on dev's many testplays and senses. The game has the most enemies in number, which makes the game is the most exciting than any other games in the series. In that point, this game is very ""final"" doom.Dodge, hide and shoot. The essentials of FPS exist in this game.			"

												If you somehow managed to beat Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 on high difficulties and say I want MORE challenge, then congratulations, you've found your fix. Two full mega-wads of content, it has two games worth of content with all the Doom 2 trappings, with more level experimentation and upped difficulty from the initial release of Doom 2.That said, something tells me that if you bought Doom 2, and you're looking at buying this, nothing I can say is necessarily going to KEEP you from wanting this game.Either way, rip and tear!

												64 of some of the best and most challenging levels for Doom 2 for only 5 dollars, can't beat that.  By challenging I do mean challenging.  The first levels are packed with some of the hardest enemies in the game, none of the slowly introducing enemies throughout the levels while you pack up on ammo and weapons that you'd find in Doom or Doom 2.  Save frequently because you never know what is going to trigger a mass spawn of enemeis when you're least expecting it.  Only cons would have to be the graphics which are somehow slightly more pixelated than the original and the weird controls.  Both of these apparently can be fixed by playing on a source port instead of this dos box version.  You also may have to alt tab out and go back in to get the mouse to work like I sometimes have to do with games that use dos box.Not recommended if you haven't played Doom or Doom 2!  Play one or both first!			"

												The game is great, without any doubt. The amount of hours I wasted in my childhood playing DOOM games is absolutely insane and would be enough for a second life. So the game is a rock solid 10 out of 10, no questions asked. And if you have not played it yet, DO IT!But not this Steam version, which is kind of unplayable due to bad pre-configuration or the fact that Steam, otherwise than GOG, just throws old games like these barely playable on the market.Tip: Google and install GZDoom, ZDoom or any other source port, copy the *.wad files from your Steam installation to that folder, add some BrutalDoom / Project Brutality mod to it and you're good to go.This way you'll probably waaaay more fun, believe me :)Edit: I've seen that the first two DOOMs are now available on GOG (Good Old Games). I bought them there (because I hate DRM as much as I love GOG) and guess what? They run. I installed the first two DOOMs and they just work like they should. That's the reason why Steam isn't really the best adress for old games like these ones. They don't try to polish them (in terms of ""make them playable"") or try to uphold the functionality like GOG does. Besides that, they are always overpriced. GOG = <3			"

												Final DooM, aptly named, is the final essential game from the DooM franchise, created by Team TNT and the Casali Brothers over a course of 4 months and split into two episodes. The levels featured in this standalone 'expansion' were designed in mind for people who had completed the original two DooM games on Ultra-Violence and were looking for more of a challenge. Final DooM not only achieved what they set out to do but did it with class. There are some terrifically obscure masterpieces among this collection and the difficulty these maps provide generally doesn't come from swamping the player with massive hordes of enemies, but from cheap/clever monster placement.This offers a far greater challenge seen in the original two games, so much so that if you were comfortable with completing the originals on Ultra-Violence without 'Save Scumming' or dying once throughout entire playthroughs this would be sure to kick your ♥♥♥ atleast a few times... hard... While there are a few maps here I disliked slightly, the good ones far overshadow them and progression welcomes you to new, unique challenging combat situations which bear a demonic grin while trying to brutally slaughter you.Final DooM should be played on Ultra-Violence or higher, playing it on anything easier defeats the purpose, if you feel it's too hard, rather practice with the originals until you get good enough to do so to appreciate and experience the full terror and panic the level designers have laid out for you. All in all some brilliant levels and high challenge is the centre point of this game, of which it achieves flawlessly. Play it Now.

												!!important note!! To have the best experience with the final doom episodes, I highly recommend you download a launcher called zdoom, which is free, which will provide loads of customization to the controls and it will make the final doom playable on both windows 10 and 8. There is a link below to zdoom.What I liked about the game •	Loads of cool levels. 64 levels in total, 4 of those are secret levels. You get a lot for £3.99, well worth the money. My favourite episode was TNT: Evilution.   •	Loads of secrets to be found throughout the game.•	You can play this game with brutal doom or project brutality, which I highly recommend.  What I disliked or was disappointed with •	Some of the levels are ridiculously hard. If I were you I would play both doom and doom 2 first on ultra violence before you play final doom. I would also recommend you play evilution first before Plutiona •	The final boss fights are disappointing and very challenging.•	The secret levels on plutiona aren’t very good and are ridiculously hard. My conclusion Final doom is very challenging. If you liked doom and doom 2 and you are looking for more of a challenge, I highly recommend you play this game. Make sure you try out brutal doom and project brutality.    70/100      Zdoomhttp://zdoom.org/DownloadBrutal doomhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom "

												Final Doom is a curious little game. It's not an officially produced sequel, but it was officially sanctioned. It's levels ape some of the original two games, but others are so bland that you'll have trouble mustering up the energy to proceed. One episode has an incredible soundtrack, but really shoddy level design. The other is fairly solid, but lacks any defining features.Back in late 1995, ID Software was gearing up to take the world by storm with the follow-up to Doom, titled Quake. Since the game was hit with a lot of delays, they decided to comission some of the communities best modders into making a highly polished MegaWAD for Doom II. This led to the creation of two 32 level WADs called Final Doom.I have a lot of memories playing through TNT - Evilution as a kid, so I started there. As I mentioned above, one of the WADs has a custom soundtrack. Evilution is that one. The new tunes are excellent. There are a lot of funky bass lines, extremely heavy riffs and tunes that totally morph the atmosphere.It makes traversing the otherwise bland levels fun. You can get lost listening to the constantly changing bass or feel ready to rip some heads off to the rockin out guitar solo. It's a case of where the flaws of the WAD can be overlooked simply because the game feels fun.The level design, itself, is too spaced out. Everything is massive and it takes upwards of 15-20 minutes for most levels. It feels like being lost in a maze with no real clue of where to go. It's like the worst bits of Doom II mixed with the final episode from Ultimate Doom, except it doesn't introduce anything new (apart from music).There are also a bunch of cheap deaths from the overloaded enemy count. If you're playing on Ultraviolence, you'll be seeing Revenants as soon as level 4. It's insane, especially without the proper equipment to deal with them. A lot of the times, I just ran past everyone and hoped I could find the exit.The other WAD is called The Plutonia Experiment. This mod has dramatically better level design, but it lacks new music. It mostly recycles the original Doom soundtrack, which isn't bad. It just sucks that I can't remember a majority of the levels since the music is burned into my mind with Doom I.Regardless, the levels are loaded with tough enemies at nearly every turn. While I love the Revenant, it's insane how he's placed on the very first level of Plutonia. Then there is how he shows up at nearly every turn on each level. It kind of sucks the fun out of seeing him.Plutonia offers some of the gimmick style maps that made Doom II special. About mid-way through the campaign, you get stuck in a narrow maze with 16 Arch-viles loose. It's incredibly tense and often infuriating. There is also a pseudo-remake of the first map from Doom II with an insane amount of Megaorbs and Cell ammo; it's essentially a powertrip.There are a bunch of new textures, so Plutonia ends up looking distinct enough from the official Doom games. There are a lot of greens and blues with things modeled after plutonium. At least if the music doesn't suck you in, you won't be lost in trying to figure out where to go.Again, the enemy count is just a bit high in some levels. It's tough to fight through a lot of these encounters simply because health isn't readily available. I know the entire goal of Final Doom was to create the hardest possible levels for Doom II, but I don't feel like the balancing is correct.I should also mention the history behind TNT - Evilution. That WAD was originally being developed by Team TNT as a free  MegaWAD for Doom II before ID Software bought the rights to it. The community was then split on wether the mod should remain free or if Team TNT deserved to get paid for their work.It remains one of the more infamous mods for Doom, which is a shame. It's not the best thing around, but it certainly doesn't deserve the hate attached to it. Like I said, I love the music and it's still got the solid foundation of Doom's gunplay. I just wish the enemies were cut down a bit.Still, on Steam, you can get Final Doom in a bundle with The Ultimate Doom and Doom II for $15. Along with those games, you get Master Levels for Doom II. I wouldn't recommend that on it's own (or if you only have an interest in the official releases), but Final Doom is fun enough to warrant a buy.7/10			"

												Huh. Final DOOM, huh?I'm sure id wasn't planning on DOOM 3 and 4, were they?Final DOOM is a collection of fan-made maps gathered by id and strung along with a story... and god, does it show. The story to both map-packs (TNT: Evilution and The Plutonia Experiment) are pretty much interchangeable. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure the paragraphs between levels are almost word-for-word the same thing as well. But the difference between these map-packs is almost night and day, when we're talking about the actual levels.TNT: Evilution is arguably the best 2D DOOM game I've played. It's got everything from DOOM II that made it good, but with much better designed and more aesthetically-pleasing levels. I've gotta say, the people who made the levels in TNT: Evilution kicked some serious a** by using the old graphics on the Doom engine to make some really creative levels. Some locations you go to are just jaw-droppingly beautiful. Well, as beautiful as abandoned space stations and Hell crypts can be.On top of that the music in TNT: Evilution is pretty damn good. There are several new tracks that keep the same metal feeling of the original games' soundtracks, and they fit in well. If I were just reviewing TNT: Evilution, I'd easily recommend it as my favorite DOOM campaign.Plutonia Experiment on the other hand... makes things a bit trickier.I didn't really like The Plutonia Experiment as much. The levels aren't as creatively designed, there's no new music, and a lot of the places you go to are very labyrinthian and cryptic... but not in the good way. As in ""The worst parts of DOOM I and II, but in most of the levels of this campaign,"" kind of way. It honestly feels like more DOOM- which isn't bad, of course- but it feels kind of stale after a while. And once you get to the same final boss as TNT, and get the same death-credits as TNT... you're just kind of tired of playing DOOM for a while.Now, I'll just play some more DOOM 2016!For what it's worth, Final DOOM is a solid game. It's just knowing that half of it is like the strawberry half of a sundae with nuts and whipped cream on top, and the other half is filled with cheese cubes. It just depends on what you personally like the most out of the DOOM games, and either TNT or Plutonia will cater to your desires, whether its aesthetic design or cryptic design. It's still worth a recommendation, and I'm giving Final DOOM a 7/10.			"

												Don't mind my minutes. I play this through Zdoom (more on this later if you don't know what it is).THIS! IS! SPAR... DOOM! As we know and love it. Levels are like mazes, and they're filled with demons. I always play Doom on Ultra-violence difficulty settings (the second hardest),. Adds demons, lowers ammo pickups and increases enemy damage. It makes you switch weapons much more often, there are times when i'm shooting in the distance with some long-range weapon like chaingun evading melee attacks, then quickly switch to chainsaw to conserve ammo on certain demons who are near, because i know i'm dead if i waste too manu bullets/cells/shells.  The hardest difficulty, oh boy, it just spawns enemies forever. You better be quick in completing the levels.This pretty much sums the whole experience how my friend put it once:""You know, i was at 17% health, i had like 20 bullets in my chaingun left and i saw a crate of bullets. I was so desperate! And happy to see them so i went there without thinking. Then i heard it... The dreaded ""door opening"" sound, quickly turned around and there were demons pouring on me from every possible direction! I survived with 3% health and 6 bullets left. fml""This is a old game, containing the map packs of Plutonia Experiment and TNT Evilution. It plays just like Doom I and II. There are no new weapons, items, or enemies, just maps. But who cares! The maps are awesome. And imo they are harder than the ""originals"".  Since the game is old, Zdoom (source port software) is advised. This works almost perfectly without it (at least for me it did on win 10) if you want to play it like that. Only bug i encountered when exiting the game, it freezes for a while and then exits. Runs on Dosbox. Zdoom adds mouselook, but it won't make the game any less easier (since the old one had pretty easy-to-exploit autoaim). Zdoom also makes the resulution bigger, vanilla version is pretty hard on your eyes with todays monitors.Now excuse me, have to cut this short. I hear some imps shrieking, where did i put my boomstick...			"

												This game here, Final DOOM, is based off a DOS game named ""Doom"" and ""Doom 2"". It was about you fighting through hordes of demons, and it was released for DOS. But now, they've ported new WADs into it and ported it into Steam and PC! Now you can pay 5.99 for two WADs!So, Plutonia isn't too bad, the levels can be quite challenging and they aren't too puzzling. But, the difficulties for some of these levels are just rediciously stupid. It's like, for example: Level 1 was hard, then Level 2 is easy, then Level 3 is hard again. It's sorta like that, just a continued pattern over and over again of difficulty. The puzzles can be also quite random, like for example (again), what if you had to do a speed-boost jump to get a keycard? Either way, this one isn't too bad.TNT: Evilution is another fun one. If I had to pick between the two, it'd be TNT. The levels are fun to do, it's not too hard or easy, and the puzzles are good.Overall, this game is great, it's worth the 5.99 and you can even play with the classic controls. I recommend you buy this if you play retro games.			"

Rember though i suggest useing mods such as Brutal Doom which enhance the game expecence without ruining the classic game feel! This game as quickly made me a personal fan of the Doom series and cant wait for Doom 4!			"

												Final Doom is a stand-alone huge mission pack based on Doom 2 in 1996. Or more exactly, it consist of two big IWADs, both having 32 levels, both fan-made, both not bringing anything new or changing core gameplay. And both are harder than your average Doom 2. The names of these two level packs are TNT Evilution and Plutonia Experiement.It also had a PS1 port, which takes only some of Final Doom levels, puts some levels from Master Levels, toned down difficulty and then applied a dark horror-like atmoshpere to it, with low brightness and ambient music. I feel that it's much superior experience for those who aren't complete Doom 2 fans, instead of dragging thorugh 64 levels.As usual, Steam version was handled in same way as other Steam versions of classic Doom games. That means ""badly"".Once again you have to edit ""ddraw"" line to ""opengl"" in conf files to make DosBox run without lags. Adn once again setup.exe wasn't included, so you have to manually edit cfg files for controls and music. Yes, uses Soundblaster by default too. At least Steam still gives you option between ""classic"" and ""with mouse"" control scheme when launching game.Specially for Final Doom, configuration isn't the only thing that got screwed up. You see, in Steam version both level packs use same exe file. And that exe is from Plutonia. Not every data is kept in wad file, some were in exe too. What it means is that TNT Evilution uses Plutonia's story for occasional text intermission and it shows Plutonia's level name on same slot on level's automap.Oh, and they share save slots too. Loading another's pack save crashes the game. You better be careful not to screw up progress by overwriting wrong save is you are beating both packs.Now, for gameplay of those two packs themselves:Made me want to yank Chaingunners out of Doom mappers hands, along with their arms. 10/10Just kidding. Well, at least this common complaint it true for both packs.TNT Evilution is slightly harder than Doom 2 and is uncertain of what kind of level style it wants to have. It's quite a mix, not exactly all fun one. It can't decide if it wants to have tricky ""gotcha"" maps, hard crowd stuff, linear layout or confusing mazes. Maps 19 and 20 are really something, as they get out from Doom's abstract style and look like a real place, with office rooms, truck, what looks like actual warehouse boxes processing. It's actually quite nice. And then pack will throw you into huge empty level. So yes, uncertain. It does make use of new textures though, here and there, most memoriable being blood patches on occasional wall. It also includes new music, which helps to give it a personality. They aren't bad either.Plutonia Experiement is a different beast, that wants to rip you apart. It's more in line with Doom 2 style, only slightly less dull and brown. Mazes are also complex, but in a good way, it doesn't make you run over map in search for a hidden button. It also rarely uses new textures of green color, as well as reuses Doom 1 music. So, in some ways it's a bit better than Doom 2 when it comes to level design. Heck, it even has a map that is maze, filled with archviles that are aware of your existance, hunting you down as you figure out the ways that various doors are opened.And it's also hard. It's a main point of this IWAD actually, to be hard. And cheap, occasionally, not going to forget situation where I was teleport in front of two teleporting archviles, that you can't break a line of sight from unless you decide to just run away into near pit and try to snipe from down there. So yes, it's very hard, which in PC gaming with saving means abusing quicksaves every few seconds, not the most pleasent grinding.Multiplayer doesn't seem to be supported by Steam version. You should use Zandronum source port for that. Eh, you will figure it out by yourself.I actually wanted to not recommend this game at first, since it's kinda more of same Doom 2 but harder, didn't see appeal of playing 60 more freaking levels that hate you. But that was before I properly played it in single-player.After beating it, I can say that Doom 2 gameplay is still fun, even if using Super Shotgun on everything and having Chaingunner in every room gets repetive. So yes, Doom nuts should get this one.			"

												Did you find Doom and Doom 2 a little too easy? Did you find the levels a little uninteresting?Welcome to Final Doom! Featuring two 30 level mega WADS, FInal Doom is the ultimate Vanilla Doom experience. TNT, the first WAD features more puzzles, instead of difficulty, with smart level design and puzzles that aren't too abstract. You don't need youtube to figure things out. You just need to pay attention.Plutonia is known as the most difficult WAD in the official Doom games. Plutonia features insurmountable odds, traps, traps, more odds and great level design. The Plutonia Experiment was made for veteran doomers who beat the first 2 games on nightmare.If you're a Doom fan and/or classic games fan then just do yourself a favor and get this!			"

												If you already finished DOOM I & II and want more, there's no better choice than Final DOOM.These are two DOOM II megaWADs (that means 32 levels each) with a higher difficulty than the original game, so get ready to have one hell of a fight (pun intended). This is still DOOM II, so there's no new content aside from the levels and a few new textures, but DOOM doesn't need anything else to be awesome, does it?Also, a warning: play Evilution first. And play The Plutonia Experiment on Hurt Me Plenty or below on your first playthrough (unless you want to get your ♥♥♥ kicked, your choice). DOSBox works like sh*t! I highly recommend you to get a source port if you want the game to run properly. ZDOOM and GZDOOM are the most used, but there are several more. I want more DOOM! If you still want more DOOM, check out Master Levels for DOOM II, and if that isn't enough, you can always visit the /idgames database frontend in Doomworld where you can find thousands of WADs to play.

												Make no mistake, this isn't a whole new Doom game, it is merely a set of two map packs with 30 levels each (32 each if you count the secret levels). If Doom II wasn't your style, look elsewhere, as this is more of a map pack than a sequel. However, it is certainly Doom at its best, so if you enjoyed the others, this will most certainly be something you'll love.			"

												Basically I love my start was the 360 port of doom 1 and 2 and later got the Doom 3 BFG edition (which mad the previous two perchases useless) However, with my teenage mind I can list why i like it and this game as this one is not on the 360. first the colors and details really pop compaired to other shooters and it has aged well. gameplay is different in the fact that the early dooms focus on dodging projectiles unlike cover based shooters today and every kill is a rush of joy. the only thing is that for some reason this like doom 64 is more focused on ""puzzles"" on the second level there is a cannon where you have to fight a bunch and you have to cross it and the only way to do that is to find the invissable bridge which can interrupt game play but over all I liked it and I say if you havn't played doom get this, doom, doom 2, and doom 3 (if you want something more like dead space.)

												Two new mega-wads from TeamTNT (TNT: EVILUTION) and the Casali Brothers (The Plutonia Experiment). The maps are pretty difficult in nature, and it's not reccomended for new players to Doom.TNT is probably the hardest, with maps as early as 11 ranking up there as some of the hardest official levels I've ever played.Plutonia is rather normal in difficulty, but gets harder towards the middle.Both iwads are created with love and attention, just like the folks at id made theirs, so this doesn't really need to be excluded from your Doom collection if you are a fan.

												Doom we finally meet again, it seems that it was only yesterday when i held a mouse and keyboard with both of my hands only to be amazed and graced with your beauty.Doom it's highly condecorated as ""the best first person shooter of all time"" and it's for good reasons, the game has an excellent (if not flawless) gameplay formula that keeps the player in his seat ready for the next level, the music is excellent, combine that with the wonderful power up system and the intuitive level design and you got yourself a formula for perfection, the game also carries along one of the best shooting mechanics of any first person shooter that i've ever played, each power up, each shot, each step that you take to the mazes that compose the levels, each and every single detail absorves you into the universe, and it serves right into making you truly feel like a marine that is battleing against the evil forces of the devil, this propagates until the end of the game, wich once that you reach it you would remember each and every single one of your moments through the journey of the thousand levels.Despite Doom beign an old game, it still manages to hold up perfectly up to this day, it's like a refined wine that only gets better as time goes by, and im glad im one of the few that tasted that wine more than ten years ago, and until the end im glad that im tasting it again.

												No Call of Duty, no Medal of Honor, no Battlefield, NO ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!!I've just completed the game (28/03/13) and I must say that this is possibly the hardest and longest expansion for a game that I've played in my entire life. The ""take home message"" it's quite simple: this expansion is only for experts in classic Doom games that still have the oldschool style from the 90' in their blood. Basically, this kind of FPS it's too hard for a player that is used to the actual FPS like COD, etc.The levels are really well made (the distribution of the space is good in general) and it give you lots of hours to play (giant maps with lots of secrets, hidden levels, puzzles, etc.). The enemies are from Doom 2: Hell on Earth but they are on higher number (I mean literally troops of enemies) and they appear in moments or spots that are just a pain in the ♥♥♥ for the player (I mean that, strategically, the situation is much more complex).If you want to play this game, keep in mind this advice: SAVE THE GAME MANY TIMES!!!

Yes, it's pretty simple and just the same if you've played Doom in the past, countless times, but with Final Doom, there's so much more to take in... and kill.

												The first thing you should be aware of is that this game is not updated or changed in any way. Starting up the Steam shortcut will actually attempt to open your CMD prompt and run DOSbox. Unless your running this off a dinosaur, your computer probably can't run DOSbox very well, and you will need to use a DOOM emulator, such as Zandronum[zandronum.com], GZDOOM[www.osnanet.de] or Chocolate DOOM[www.chocolate-doom.org]. If it says I have 0 hours on record, I don't, I've just been playing the game off of Zandronum.With that out of the way, any DOOM or DOOM II fan needs to buy this. The WAD files are extractable for Ports or Modding, and the level design is for the most part pretty good. TNT has easier, more colorful, less consistant maps, while Plutonia has harder, brown-ish, and consistant maps. There isn't much else to say, because the game otherwise runs exactly like DOOM II would. If you liked DOOM II or The Ultamite DOOM, you'll love Plutonia and TNT: Evilultion.			"

You run fast, shoot fast, all the guns are awesome, and for some reason the atmosphere is still kind of surprising and creepy after all these years.Obviously there is no jump button, AI is dumb, and some of the levels suffer from poor color choices.

Out of all my hours on record, 90% of them were on Plutonia.			"

												Final DOOM never struck me like the first two in the series. However, when I first played this game I wasn't disappointed. Final DOOM has some of the hardest levels in the official series. You can only replay the original levels over and over so many times before they become just simply too easy for you. Final DOOM threw a wrench in the gears and the levels became larger, more difficult, and threw the big baddies at you sooner and in greater amounts.Can't get over that. Can't get enough DOOM. I just have to live with this game for the rest of my life. I can't imagine a life without it. If you have played DOOM and not Final DOOM you need Final DOOM. Though I don't why you wouldn't have them all.They're just great. Buy this.  :)			"

												TL:DR: An arguably unfair duo of MegaWADs that the hardcore fans might want to grit their teeth on for a challenge.Final DOOM is a series of 2 32-level MegaWADs produced by members of Team TNT that were released by id Software as a full spinoff game to DOOM II. The first WAD, TNT: Evilution, was made by all the members of the team, while the second, Known as the Plutonia Experiment, were made solely by two people to add on to the product.The question remans; is this game good? The answer: Somewhat.Unlike the earlier Master Levels collection that kept things mostly manageable, Final Doom has levels that require insanely low kill-times to ensure your survival. While this can be done, the major problem remains in its rediculous amount of Chaingun-guys and Revenants that pepper you with bullets and homing rockets in areas with little to no cover. This could be awesome for those looking for a test of grit, to me it hamers down an otherwise solid set of levels and, in particular, TNT: Evilutions killer original soundtrack. Give this a go if you're looking for a WAD with a challenge or if it came in the affordable Doom bundle; otherwise, it can be left alone.			"

												First of all let me get this out of the way, I really like DOOM.  I think its one of the few classics FPS's that still hold up well today and i've played it and DOOM II dozens of times.  But Final DOOM is not a good game.  Final DOOM feels more like a mod.  like it was a fan made game designed to be as frustrating as possible.  This game pulls all the worst kind of ♥♥♥♥ moves.  It will start the level by teleporting you in surrounded by enemies, it will have massive ambushes come out of nowhere all the time, it will throw death traps at you that will require you to die before you know its there.  Enemies are placed in such a way as to be as big of a pain as possible.  There are chaingun zombies EVERYWHERE!!! and they will snipe you from across the screen.  there are a couple of levels that are basically nothing but tiny stepping stone walk ways over a huge acid pit. and to top things off there is even a level that forces you to cross a chasim via an invisible walkway that you just have to know is there.I like challenging games but this was just a slog.  every level takes forever and you will spend more time pressing quick save and quick load then pulling the trigger.  There are a handful of okay levels.  one that takes place in a city block is kinda neat and there are a couple of ""hardcore"" hidden levels that are basically waves of cyber demons and minions but the majority of the levels are going to test your patience rather than you skill.   I only beat the game to see if there was somting neat at the end.  Nope.  they use the last boss from DOOM II but in a more dickish level and then its the same boring ""you beat the game"" text scroll followed by the role call where you shoot each of the game enemies and then your self over and over again.This game wasn't fun even with the the brutal DOOM mod  I can't even imagine how much it must suck playing it the normal way and not being able to aim up or down because most of the enemies are at different elevations in this game.  save yourself a headach and skip the damn thing.

Natural point to follow, when you completed Doom and Doom 2 and are craving for more.The Plutonia Experiment is kinda ♥♥♥. It's one of these mappacks, where you memorize enemy locations, closet monsters and scripted events, and then use power of hindsight to not die to them.			"

												Steam forgot to include the setup files for all their wrapped DOSBOX ports of all DOOM games, so you will have trouble changing many options if you buy it here.Luckily GOG didn't completely eff their releases of the games up, so I would say you should buy it on GOG instead of Steam, unless Steam decides to fix it someday. They probly never will. If you're running the WADs in a source port this won't affect you at all, but if you want to emulate DOS properly you kinda need these files.Released on my 12th birthday in 1996, although I am just now getting to play it.The episode ""TNT - Evilution"" is really good and would stand on its own as the core content for this expansion. Most of the music is new and it's amazing. Lots of fun.The episode ""The Plutonia Experiment"" uses old music from DOOM I & II and the presentation suffers for this. Most know it as not being as good as Evilution but it's also quite hard so I'll reserve criticisms until I've made more progress in it, but it's obviously a bit rushed. I've also heard it described as ""undecorated"".I think the whole of Final DOOM would have been better had Plutonia not been included, or some additional content had been included to round the experience out. A commercial expansion of the time, ""Perdition's Gate"" was said to have been in the running for inclusion within Final DOOM, but I guess they didn't finish it fast enough and were told the window had closed, so they formed Wraith to sell it on their own. What I mean to say is that the Final DOOM package may seem to lack cohesion. I prefer to think of Final DOOM AS Evilution, and The Plutonia Experiment being just what it's called, an experiment, albeit less polished, that TNT showed to id, and id said ""okay we'll buy that too."" SO, bonus content, really, and nothing more.I started with Plutonia, until I read a review on GOG mentioning for difficulty scaling, start with Evilution, since Plutonia is harder, and after heeding his advice, I find myself appreciating FInal DOOM quite a bit more. As for the name, is this the be-all, end-all DOOM experience. The Final chapter? The best it ever gets? Nope, not at all. As officially licensed mod content made by a team who arguably have better megawads on the net for completely free, FInal DOOM is just the beginning. But if you're not one to ♥♥♥♥♥ about paying for a mod, it's a great introduction. I recommend running this game in the GZDoom source port, with dynamic lighting enabled manually in the INI, and Sergeat_Mark_IV's Ketchup mod on default settings. For maximum immersion I also suggest using Eternal DOOM Status Bar by Team TNT, from one of their other megawads. You can use SmoothDoom as well but I can't be arsed to tell if it's working or not yet. And if you can find a mod that changes the music, but only for Plutonia, go ahead and do that too. Go buy this game. It's good. It's more DOOM, and if you've played DOOM, you probly want more of it. Now if you'll excuse me I need to go practice shooting demons in the face for when I die and go to hell.			"

												Over 60 new levels for Doom 2, this standalone expansion is made up of 2 massive episodes full of Doom goodness. I highly recommend beating doom 2 before playing this game, as it demands a experienced player. These levels are rock hard and I also suggest playing them on Ultra-violence for the full experience. The levels themselves are very well designed, particularly the later half of TNT. If you want a more challenging Doom, this is the place to go. Oh and I hope you like Chaingunners.			"

												Two very challenging, very fun campaigns for Doom 2. TNT will bombard you with more Zombies than Doom 1 & 2 combined, while Plutonia draws its challenge from carefully placed high-ranking enemies (three arch-viles in the first level!), with levels seldom breaking 120 for enemy count. Plus, Plutonia has a sweet custom soundtrack.Both are a ton of fun and are a must-have for any Doom fan looking for a challenge.Downloading the GZDoom sourceport to run the game is strongly recommended as it will help with most issues you may have getting it to run on a modern system, greatly expands graphics and control options, and supports the vast majority of mods.

												TNT: Evilution and The Plutiona Experiment are two of the best megawads ever made for a DOOM game, and that's why they were included in this sequel. When I first heard about Final DOOM I wanted to cry of excitement, and when I got it in my hands I remember I played Plutonia first and it was so dark in mood, not like the other campaigns, it was really something more mature and serious - if you don't believe me check the super secret level which resembles DOOM II: Hell on Earth's first level, Entryway - than the previous installments. And then TNT was a real challenge, it was all hi-tech but with several puzzles and many monsters, it took me a while to finish it, specially the last chapter.Games like these are the ones that mark your life for good. I wouldn't be who I am without all three original DOOM games. So yeah, if you ever need a really BUT REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING REALLY GOOD ♥♥♥♥ING GAME, SEARCH NO ♥♥♥♥ING MORE, THIS IS THE GAME YOU'VE WAITED FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE AND IT IS 20 YEARS OLD, AND YOU DIDN'T PLAY IT BACK WHEN IT WAS RELEASED AND YOU DON'T DESERVE IT BUT HE'LL LET YOU PLAY IT ANYWAY BECAUSE DOOM IS AWESOME.I WANT A BIG ♥♥♥♥ING GUN NINE THOUSAND NOW TO KICK SOME CYBERDEMON'S ♥♥♥.

												From Imp's to Revenant's, this game is by far the best Doom ID software has released. Final Doom's maps are far more complex than Doom (1993). Way back when this came out on the PS1 (1996) - it was by far the scariest game I played when I was a kid. Best gun by far was the Super Shotgun. The lighting effects on the PSX was top notch.I prefer the PS1 version to the PC for reasons such as the soundtrack was more atmospheric on the PS1 whilst the PC didn't fit the atmosphere at all. The soundtrack only put me off on the PC version but difficulty wise, PC was way more harder which is what I like in a game - a challenge. PC version - 8/10PS1 - 10/10			"

												Doom is one of the first games FPS, anyone who likes FPS and have not yet played in the classic FPS should play it. Final Doom consists of 2 Megawads, TNT and Plutonia.This wads are difficult, demanding and would certainly recommend.			"

												It's DOOM II, but more so. So, if you liked DOOM II, snap this one up. But be warned... if you thought DOOM II was hard... you're really going to struggle with this one. Very well designed - I'd even go so far as to say that many of the levels in this pack are better than those in DOOM II itself.			"

Final DooM			* 9/10Final DooM On Steam		* 0/10I already didn't recommend Any other DooM release on Steam with the same review Copy-pasted because of the same problems.A little statement first. As already mentioned in my other DooM reviews the 0/10 rate is related to the Steam Release. Consider that I grew up with doom, I was 6 years old when the shareware was being widespread all over the world, and still nowadays I own The original DooM, DooM II and The Ultimate Collection DooM 95 (With Ultimate DooM, DooM II And Final DooM). All of this to state I know and Love the game I grew up with. Despite all this I regret to NOT Recommend this RELEASE (Not THE GAME, mind you). On a Side note: all the DooM chapters have been released on Steam like this, so I'm not recommending Any other chapter, specifically The Ultimate DooM, DooM II: Hell On Earth and Master Levels for DooM II Bonus Pack. My same Review will be posted in all those releases because of the same flaws.This Pack includes the 2 famous TNT Evilution and the Plutionia Experiment expansions. Both made of 32 maps still my favourite one is the TNT pack as it's the only one that used original music, which is really badass or gives great atmosphere. I'll just copy-paste the cons of the other releases, which still apply on this one. It's not worth a total rewrite...+++PROs+++The Following Points are the reason I MUST recommend this Game
 EXPANSION. More levels for one of the first and most loved FPS. They kind of renew the level design with some tricks or challenges (a Cyberdemon in the very first level of TNT at the highest difficulty levels... XD). MUSIC. This is my personal favourite aspect for the TNT expansion pack. I love those songs so much I've even played some covers on youtube. Nothing beats the first level track, as in DooM or DooM II, but they still rock B-) MODS & COMMUNITY. Yes, a huge enormous load of mods, levels and so on. There are even lots of custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with solutions to all of the CONs I've listed.---CONs---The following points are the reason I will NEVER recommend this release on Steam.
 STEAM OVERLAY. This release runs directly with dosbox, so obviously the overlay won't work. THE PORT. Actually this release has no ports... It's the usual game that runs on DosBox... Which is not the best solution because it's just an emulation of a DOS Environment which means that you can easily experience some minor LAGs, both on video and audio. Not to mention the inferior Midi quality. On top of that it has 2 options, the classic input and the DEFAULT ""Modern input"" with WASD Movement AND Mouse MOVEMENT...Not Mouselook, MOVEMENT. So obviously you can't use the mouse because it goes in conflict with the WASD keys... And you can't use the arrows because ONLY Left and Right are Binded... WHAT THE F**K?!?!?!?!? WHO THE HELL IS THE INCOMPETENT THAT WORKED ON THIS $H17 AND APPROVED IT?!?!?!?!? AND THIS C**P IS THE DEFAULT SETTING!!!! I know there are solutions inside steam's community discussions and guides, but I don't care, releasing a product of the importance as DooM in this state is SIMPLY RIDICULOUS. And you want to know something? Do you remember the Excellent DooM 95 Port where you have a simple window with tidy options and settings? You even have settings to add Mods. Do you know who worked on that project in his Microsoft's days? GABE NEWELL. And here on Steam I have to find this Garbage on DosBox... I could have Downloaded from google in 2 minutes both the WADs AND a DECENT Port IF (i repeat) IF MY ORIGINAL COPIES  Of DooM, DooM II And ""Ultimate Doom, DooM II And Final With DooM 95"" (Yes I DO OWN ALL OF THEM) were somehow misteriously Burnt out... Steam doesn't consider profitable to ask microsoft a deal to use the best BASIC port for DooM? Fine, Use another one, or make something decent yourself, it's really ridiculous to get such a great game released in such a bad and approximate way... And maybe I'm mistaken, Steam is just a digital distribution platform and the quality of the product released relies on the Developer. It doesn't change anything. The fact that Whoever worked on this release setted the game to play by default with a SELF-CONTRADICTORY INPUT SYSTEM is still RIDICUOUS ... And a reason BIG ENOUGH to AVOID this release LIKE A DISEASE... (Ho-ho-ho, I'm a poet... XD... But seriously, don't waste here your money...) "

Simply convince you there was no more Doom when infact there indeed was ,plenty more Doom. Infact so much Doom that we wondered if there infact would ever be .. a ""Final"" Doom. Well I can say now from the bottom of my heart that there is a Final Doom now . Yes indeed 2016 was the launch of another Doom which finally ends the IP and rather well too. Ok Im completely lying . Infact there wll be more Doom because quite frankly we love Doom and now its a shiny new fancy graphical update Doom , we want even more ..Doom. So here we have Final Doom . But not really.

												First and foremost, steam totally screwed up the configuration on this game. Even though my laptop might as well be a gangster vending machine with a turf war's worth of bulletholes in it in comparison to some of the stronger gaming PCs, it can still handle games that take up more space on my computer than this Final Doom. Though I assume Final doom is indeed a good game as I've heard all doom games are, I cannot for the life of me get the game past the start up screen. I would not buy this if I were you, you can get far better doom emulators and such on anything from any digital distrubution site other than steam to a good graphing calculator.			"

												Doom has been a part of my life for a very long time now and the doom franchise is one of my favourites, and when I saw this was on sale I was so excited! I actually made a steam account 2 years ago and must've had the doom games on my wishlist because a month ago I received an email notifying me that a game on my wishlist was on sale. Excited, I create a new steam account because I couldn't remember the details for my old one, and I buy this just to be extremely disappointed. Maybe the version I downloaded was glitched or I don't know but damn the music is just... it sounds so cheap. Nothing like the original music. The graphics are so awful I can't distinguish shotgun dudes from walls, and the controls.. oh the controls. I move with wasd and look with the mouse, but I also move with the mouse? Why? I'm also slightly peeved because my refund for this game was denied. I highly recommend just buying the BFG edition if you want to play the original dooms. The quality of these doom games are pretty awful. I had to stop playing after 8 minutes because I just could not stand how utterly terrible everything looked.			"

This which I suppose is the original PC version is still good, but keep in mind that its absolute crap if you play it ""as is"". The only way to really experience any of the original doom games is to extract the WAD file and use one of the official doom emulators which allow better resolution/graphics, and game options.Buy this for the WAD file.

												Cons:-Just like every other version of DOOM on steam, this is an outdated dos version running in dosbox. This is probably older than the version you played in the 90s, if you ran a windows 9x port.-No OpenGL.-No DirectX.-480p only, no widescreen support so the whole game is stretched unless you make your monitor squish the picture.-Final DOOM contains two mission packs which are fun for the hardcore doom player, but much too unforgiving for casual players.-Level Design just isn't as good as DOOM 1 and 2 irrespective to difficulty and other concernsPros:-My mouse is actually detected and the old 1-handed mouse movement/aiming scheme still works wonderfully. I mention this because it doesn't work in any other version of DOOM on steam.This is slightly better than other DOOM games on steam emulation-wise, but it's still the dos version running in an emulator. To make matters worse, this is the weakest of the original DOOM engine games.I recommend Final DOOM, but not the version Steam is selling. Buy this on GOG or track down the DOOM classics CD-Rom and get a source port.			"

For only a couple reasons.It has some strange mouse controls where you end up having your mouse control your movement along with the arrows keys. Even on what the startup options window calls 'classic controls', I still had the mouse move my character. I couldn't figure out a way to disable it.The game is also prone to frequently crashing at random.I'd rather play SNES Doom than this.Just download GZdoom, that way you can play all the levels without weird-♥♥♥ touchscreen controls!

The Plutonia ExperimentYep. This is just exactly just more of Doom 2.Yep. this is the same amateur\sequel\add-on style of level design of that era, with trolling, random riddles and giant unending levels. With the main idea being shoot more stuff coz shoot more stuff. Compared to base Doom 2 it is not even artistically coherent\correct and very gamey. Visually levels are pretty plain, uneventful and not memorable. And of course final boss would be an icon of sin which was bad even in the original. If you want just to play more levels for doom without regards to quality — it is for you.TNT: EvilutionIt starts very strong, with some new visuals and new music, but then it slows down at 2\5 mark to be as generic, trolly and poor as plutonia, after which it suddenly has a row of extremely short and plain levels. And overall Evilution is not thematically coherent, having you run around prisons, offices, warehouses, sewers and other boring real-life stuff. Though, sometimes you can find something truly amazing and great between them. Something which is very doom with all it's cultural zeitgeist and non-explicit references. Some parts are even surpassing both original Doom 2 and the Doom itself, some levels are legitimately artistically and technically great. And the final level is somewhat improved, with dumb puzzles, cyberdemon fight, and icon of sin (yes, again) being more combat heavy and sensible. I was on the verge of recommending it, but this release crashes in one place, and it doesn't display evilution text screens, instead it just uses plutonia ones, so you will never see the story of this add-on.They tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter. Some great stuff is spoiled with bad parts, after which it's ruined by the release, and on top of that there is the plutonia's dead weight.			"

												Final Doom is just more of the same. It may be an “expansion” to the classic Doom II: Hell on Earth but it adds virtually nothing to the gameplay of the original. Final Doom consists of two multi-level maps, no new guns, new monsters, and no new challenges. The story of these two brand new maps is nothing to write home about either; they are bland and are very cliché in the sci-fi department. Unless you are a massive fan boy of the Doom games, there is absolutely no reason to play this. With Doom 3 BFG coming soon, this game is even less relevant.			"

How to run ports\mods through Steam using ZDL 
A Guide for The Ultimate DOOM
By: Bunnings Wharehouse

			A guide to help people run modern Doom ports through Steam using ZDL, this enables Steam Overlay in the modern ports and keeps track of gaming hours.		


Takes only a couple of minutes, but with this, you can choose a port of your liking (I like ZDoom) and run it with Steam overlay and screenshots enabled.Now that *that's* out of the way, let's see what we have here.This game is basically two large map packs for DOOM II, one called ""The Plutonia Experiment"" and the other ""Evilution"" (weren't the nineties great, lol). I haven't finished both map packs, but I played enough DOOM both recently and back in the day to know where this is going, and I've played enough to say without doubt that I like it.Both map packs offer genuinely challenging levels with a few cool new tricks (e.g. I love how despite the limited verticality of the DOOM engine, they still manage to make ""ladders"" somehow), and if I had to choose between this and the Master Levels, I'd say this is a much more streamlined experience and it feels more like a DOOM ""sequel"" and less like ""here's 20+ maps we didn't put in the game"". There were a few maps where I cursed the creator's apparent love (dare I say fetish) for spamming chaingunners (or, as I like to call them, ""hitscanning f#%kheads""), but for the most part, these maps really bring out the essence of what DOOM is: learning enemies' attack patterns, prioritising who to take out first, choosing the right gun for the job, finding that friggin' keycard/skull key, the works. It's more of the same, really, but it's done well. Rip and tear!Oh yeah. There are two secret levels (I'll give you a hint: the entrance is near the end of ""The Twilight"" map) that will KICK. YOUR. NADS. Seriously, I think that's A) the most time I've spent playing two DOOM maps and also B) the most fun I've had with two DOOM maps alone. It's hardcore, it's difficult, it's over-the-top, it's ridiculous, so yeah... it's DOOM alright.			"

												Is this game good? Of course it is.  My only suggestion is that you buy it right now then spend the next hour or two looking up which source port of this game you want to play.  I'm not going to try and explain how to use one of the many source engines as a lot of it is personal prefference, so best advice is to look it up your self, try a few and make your own mind up.Enjoy.

												This is the game I have the least amount of hours in I know ok. That doesn't matter because this game is like all the Dooms but with mods. So amazing. I havent put many hours in because I didn't want it to ruin the story. Yeah Doom has a story, not a good one but a story none the less. I don't think Bethesda knows what final means though. So time for the pros and cons.Pros: IT'S DOOM its fun to playIT'S DOOMit has held up aged incredibly well.IT'S F***ING DOOM. Cons:oh wait there are no cons. Why are you still reading this, buy the game.			"

												You and a squad of marines enter a base to dispatch of any threats. Upon arrival, you find death everywhere.Your commanding officer orders you and a fellow marine to stay and guard the entrance. You think it's just another physcopath or traitor, so you think nothing of it at first. you put your hand on the steel door but your fellow marine grabs it and she says ""This isn't our job, private."" before letting go, seemingly worried about her friends inside. Gunfire erupts from inside, making you jump and nearly drop your gun but you keep your cool just in time. Hours go by and patience wears extremely thin outside. Angrily, you kick the wall and hurt your foot as your fellow marine laughs at you to your expense but suddenly the battle turns silent. You turn to your fellow marine who has a distressed look on her face as you signal to go in and rendezvous with your commander. Unfortunately, you find all of your squad have been mutilated inside out by the time you get to the battle point. Suddenly a soldier appears from cover and opens fire on your squad mate, filling her with bullets until she falls to the ground with blood pouring from her head and chest. Luckily you get a direct hit on the traitorous soldier, killing him instantly. Further inspection shows that a demonic presence was controlling him to fight all earth-spawn causing him to kill your squad mate. You suddenly realise this is more than just a routine break in.It's hell.			"

												You can take my recommendation for Doom 2 and more or less apply to this, word for word. However, there are a few things that make Final Doom stand out from Doom II and Ultimate Doom that deserve pointing out.One, this pair of megaWAD's (yes, you get two 32-level games in Final Doom) wasn't made by iD Software. Rather, they were developed by TeamTNT and published by iD Software.Second, those who are bothered (for whatever reason) by the more abstract level design found in The Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 will find that the level design for Final Doom (especially Evilution) resembles real buildings and places. This doesn't take away or detract from the fast-paced gameplay the series is known for, in my opinion.Third and finally, if you thought the difficulty was too easy in Ultimate Doom and/or Doom 2, then Final Doom should remedy this. This is especially true for Plutonia Experiment, where you're facing tougher monsters and lots of them early on.I'm obviously quite biased when it comes to the Doom franchise. However, I'd still recommend getting this. Again, it's more of the same, but that's not a bad thing especially if you like fast-paced, hard hitting twitch shooters like I do. :)			"

Upon arrival, you find death everywhere.Your commanding officer orders you and a fellow marine to stay and guard the entrance. You think it's just another physcopath or traitor, so you think nothing of it at first. you put your hand on the steel door but your fellow marine grabs it and she says ""This isn't our job, private."" before letting go, seemingly worried about her friends inside. Gunfire erupts from inside, making you jump and nearly drop your gun but you keep your cool just in time. Hours go by and patience wears extremely thin outside. Angrily, you kick the wall and hurt your foot as your fellow marine laughs at you to your expense but suddenly the battle turns silent. You turn to your fellow marine who has a distressed look on her face as you signal to go in and rendezvous with your commander. Unfortunately, you find all of your squad have been mutilated inside out by the time you get to the battle point. Suddenly a soldier appears from cover and opens fire on your squad mate, filling her with bullets until she falls to the ground with blood pouring from her head and chest. Luckily you get a direct hit on the traitorous soldier, killing him instantly. Further inspection shows that a demonic presence was controlling him to fight all earth-spawn causing him to kill your squad mate. You suddenly realise this is more than just a routine break in.It's hell.			"

												Doom is quite simply the best shooter ever made and it's not just the nostalgia talking. The pure unadulterated ultra-violence is still as raw and visceral as it was when it was released in 1993. In terms of pure enjoyment in the form of fast paced action, this game delivers in spades. It is what every shooter today pretends not to be as they try to disguise themselves under thinly veiled attempts at plot and character development, a no-brainer all out gore fest. It gives us what we want from a shooter with no unnecessary bells and whistles too often used in modern FPS games to cover up the fact that the game play is simply lacking behind the masquerade of fancy graphics and tedious cut-scenes that ultimately get in the way of the fun, I'm looking at you Call of Duty. I love intricate stories and fully developed characters in games, notable examples of these are the Mass Effect and Witcher series, but this is a genre that has never been about that. This is a genre where the only time you should get a break from the action is the loading screen between levels. Moreover, thanks to the dedicated and thriving fan base there are a plethora of mods and custom WAD files that are constantly breathing new life in to this game. 21 years later and there are still multiplayer servers active, that alone is pretty impressive.

												And addition to Doom II: Hell on Earth, and it's much harder than Doom I and II. It's not as hard as Master Levels for Doom II but, it's still challenging. Yet again more enemies, and more levels in Hell. Bring it on!			"

												I've never played Final Doom before. I've only played Doom 1, but I've seen gameplays of Final Doom on YouTube and that already made it my favorite Doom game, because it has the weapons and demons from Doom II and still takes place on another planet, other than Earth, so I had to play it for myself. But after I first installed it, it was always very hard to get started up and whenever I would get it started up, it would lag a lot, the doors wouldn't always open, and just like in Doom 1, there was no way to change the controls in the Options menu, since it was made back when joysticks were commonly used, which makes it a lot harder for me to play. But I was planning to install the Brutal Doom mod to it, anyway. So, I installed the source port, Zandronum, to my computer, then copied and pasted the .WAD files of Final Doom to the Zandronum folder, and then extracted the files of Brutal Doom to the Zandronum folder, and not only did Brutal Doom work on Final Doom, but Zandronum also made Final Doom much more playable, making it much easier to start up, getting rid of the lagging, fixing the doors, and adding way more options in the Options menu, including options for the controls, so now, I can actually have fun, playing Final Doom with or without Brutal Doom. And it's still my favorite Doom game.			"

												Terrible demons came streaming from him, throwing the shade of the death onto the base. All of your comrades were slaughtered quickly or it was transformed into a zombie. The survival does not rush this time. But the revenge and this game is awesome !   "
