												Same problem like the first iteration, ""Blazing Angels Squadrons of WWII"", this game simply will not work on other Operating System except Windows XP!Blazing Angels 2: Secret Missions of WWII supports WINDOWS XP ONLY. I'm on Windows 8.1 Pro x64, tried to run the game normally -the option window opens up but tells me out-of-date graphics drivers- and can't recognize the running Windows. I tried to run the game in the Compatibility Mode (Windows XP SP2, SP3, Win Vista, Win 7) and still won't start. Maybe it could run on ""Windows XP Mode"" or in some Virtual Machine but at this now, there's no point in fiddling around trying to make this ""OUT OF DATE"" game run.OVERALL:DON'T BUY THIS GAME ON STEAM IF YOU DON'T HAVE WINDOWS XP!!!!RECOMMENDATION:NONE! DON'T BUY THIS GAME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE WINDOWS XP... until if someday, this game get's updated for modern Windows then maybe it could be worth a shot but as of now, stay away from this game.RATING:0.0 / 10			"

												gg @ 2nd mission. Playing this on Win 7. Works perfectly fine. Pro: as of 2007, everything looks fancy. As of 2016, brings me back memories of Lucas Arts' Secret Mission over Normandy. Con: as of 2016, which is almost 10 years later. none. 1. You cannot edit controls. 2. Some controls (i.e. Mouse control) don't work at all. If it doesn't work, why do you even include in tip?3. Ubisoft sucks (playing other old games such as Prince of Persia which has similar control issue). Most of Ubisoft games are based on console controls. If you have console controller such as xbox, it should work. 4. Mission 2, train hitbox is so small that you have to fly low, slowly (yet still faster than train because, it's a plane), and right above the train. If you are off the train by 1 inch, the mission resets. This train hitbox is seriously a pain so if you are looking for some easy action WW2 game, stay away from this. If you are good with console controllers, do grab this game. Otherwise, play War Thunder.  "

												A decent game that is hampered by its indecision on what arcadey flight game it wants to be. It has elements of Rogue Squadron and Ace Combat, but mixed in a way that is unwieldy and slightly worse than either on their own. Almost every single mission has some sort of gimmick requiring a certain plane or tactic, such as one mission requiring you to fly a divebomber that doesn't have any guns. Basically it has loads of unique setpieces, which can be fun, but usually aren't that interesting the second time around. The game is at its best when it has large airbattles and dogfights which allow the player to choose any plane and weapon loadout. Unfortunately there are only two or three such missions.Unlike the first game, Blazing Angels 2 tries to have a storyline, which is told through filtered photos with speech bubbles like Max Payne. Most of it is really campy and not intended to be taken seriously, so it is hard to hate.Overall a fun distraction, but lacking in replayability.			"

												In my case, this game won't work on Windows 8.1. So any WIN8.1 user should think twice before buying it.Even if launched successfully, it is very hard to play without a control pad. Mouse control is very weird, and overall control is sluggish.If you wanna play this game, find a local arcade. Maybe there is one. That would give you a much better gaming experience.			"

												I loved this game played it so much on PS3 i burnt out the disc but i have some bad news for those who have Windows 8/10 this game will not run at all so please don't waste your money.As for those who are still on Windows 7 or Older please buy this game you'll be hooked for hours playing some of the best dog fighting and missions you've ever played in a World War II fighter game.

												I don't know why people say this game will NOT work on windows 7 when I played and finished the game on my Desktop running windows 7 Ultimate without any problems. Now that I have Windows 10 I'm not sure if it will work now but like I said I finished the game so no need to install it again to find out.                                                                                                                                PS you might have to install old PhysX Driver for older PC games as I did when I played Fuel Of War.			"

												Perhaps it's just me, but I found that this game is becoming increasingly more difficult and I can't find the fun of playing it until the end. Luckily, I've got the cheat for this game so that I can at least go through the levels more easily (though it's still difficult indeed).The control of this game is uncomfortable for me, and what makes it even more uncomfortable is that I need to map the control manually to my XBOX 360 controller, which is a great deal of stress for me.The graphics is, I can say honestly, just average. Not too good, and not too bad. But, I like the sound in this game. I really like the main background music.I also heard that it is only available on XP. Well, luckily again, I still have Windows XP on my hand, so I can play this game without any problem. I haven't tried playing it on another OS, though.Overall, this game can potentially become a fun experience, but the uncomfortable control and hard missions are a real turn down.I can only recommend this game if you have Windows XP, and are an avid fan of this type of game. It's worth to include to your collection. But, for those who want real experience on this type of flight combat game, I suggest that you look for better games in the same genre.My overall score: 6 out of 10.			"

												I have Windows 7, and Blazing Angels runs perfectly. I have not experienced the problems everyone else has seemed to have with this game and Windows.I thoroughly enjoyed Blazing Angels on PS3, and I have been able to play it as if it were on PS3 with my Windows 7 PC and PS3 controller.This game has unique story telling, much like a comic. Multitude of upgrades for your planes and squad, which you will most likely fully acquire a couple missions before the final mission. Easy gamplay mechanics; it has a simulator setting in the controls as well for those who like that, versus arcade. There is some amount of replayability, certainly more for anyone that plays multiplayer.Great to buy on sale.			"

												An old game I used to have on the 360 (yes, crucify me for playing a game on the 360). And this game was pretty fun.  The Graphics weren't too bad, a tad bit generic, but nice. The scenery and small details were rendered beautifuly. The story: not too shabby. A bit cliched here and there, but nothing to really rave over, but nothing that's cringeworthy either. The music was heroic and fit the events occuring around you quite well and was quite enjoyable. The Menu theme and end overture are my favorites. Now what you've been waiting for, the gameplay. While it is sad that there is no controller support, the controls for the keyboard are intuitive, but are a bit tricky to get yourelf adjusted to when you first start playing. The tutorial is nice and unlike most other games, is not shoehorned in. The difficulty curve is nice and balanced. The spikes in difficulty, if any, are far, few between, and are negligable. A very enjoyable WWII Dogfighting game indeed. I recommend you pick it up.			"

												NOT recommended. The stupid automatic roll correction hampers your control over the aircraft and the manuevers you can perform by forcing you to use the over-powered yaw, which is dumb. Try another flight sim or look for mods to remove this feature if you want, otherwise for flight-sim die hards its a waste of time to play and a waste of money to buy, same as BA1			"

												I won't give any introduction since it doesn't worth any, just Let me get to the subject, If you really think of purchasing this game; please don't, it's a wast of money and time. Firstly, there're a lot of crashes, every time I tried to install the game it simply freeze at the "" creating local cash files "" then gave me this  message ""connection timed out "" there was no thing wrong with my connection, I've tried 2 other games and it worked properly, it took me like 3 hours until finally I was able to install it!!! I don't even know what was wrong with it Secondly, about the crashes you will encounter a lot of them during playing the game, it will take you like a day just to know how to apply your xbox or joystick configurations Finally, till this moment I don't know how to play the multi-player mode, there's no  simple or easy way to figure out how to play it, every time I insert the cd key that is required to play the multi player mode it simply tells you "" the key u entered is invalid"" I'm really disillusioned with this game. I was dying for it and I couldn't wait to install it but It seems that this game doesn't even worth to be played for free			"

												It's a good game with a decent storyline in a similar vein to Blazing Angels. Unfortunately, it lacks the arcade mode for single player that the original had, so as solo you've really only got the campaign missions.I have this game working on Windows 10 (64-bit) thanks to someone on the Steam discussion forum who posted about a dll that you need to download in order to get the game to work. Without that the game does not work on anything higher than Windows Vista, so buy at your own risk.			"
