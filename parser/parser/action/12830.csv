												This game could of been great if we weren't lied to. When it first came out the servers weren't up and running. We were told very soon and we'd be seeing a patch first. Guess what, no patch, no servers no nothing. It took about a month before we saw the first patch and were told the game wouldn't be supported.Talk about a kick in the ♥♥♥. People were so upset that CodeMasters started banning everyone who complained on their web site. They are a company who doesn't give a damn about it's PC customers.

												Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is one of those gems that is overlooked by most players.  Personally I think the way to get the most out of this game though is running multi-player Co-op.This is no Call of Duty or Medal of Honor shoot 'em up, but rather a tactical combat simulator.  If you are a solo player I would probably skip this title.  However if you like to roleplay and really get into your job, then team up with up to three others and run this game in multi-player campaign mode (Co-op). There are four roles to choose from. Engineer, Medic, Sniper and Squad Leader.  There is only one squad leader and he sets up and calls out the waypoints and strategies through the missions.  The game can be a bit glitchy at times, but the fun factor far outweighs the technical glitches.  The first mission is probably the worst, so if you pick up this game don't let the beginning stop you.  By the third mission you will be wading through the foliage calling out targets for your sniper while your engineer sets some demo up on an enemy APC.  I cannot emphasize enough that this game is best played with others and is definitely not a solo affair.  You will need to use 3rd party software for headset chat.  You will need to use a headset as well as the in game communication is very poor.I always played Squad Leader, as I was the host for our game sessions.  One of the most memorable moments in this game for me was when our sniper got pinned down behind a wall and was getting hammered by a .50 cal from an enemy technical.  I sent in the engineer with this heavy weapon and before he reached the wall he went down hard.  He was still alive so I instructed the medic to lend support to the engineer while I drew fire from the technical.  The screaming going on over the headset was intense.  The medic got the engineer back on his feet and behind the wall while our sniper bugged out of the area.  I was getting attention form that .50 cal and hiding behind a tree and was also drawing fire from some infantry that heard the ruckus and started closing in on my position.  Just when I figured that I was going down the technical blew up thanks to our engineer's heavy weapon and the inantry closing in on my position started dropping like flies from our sniper.  We were back in business doing what we did best. When it comes right down to it, it's times like this that I game for.  I would highly suggest this title to anyone that likes to game with friends.  Operation Flashpoint: Red River is even better and provides a smoother ride.  If you can pick this title up on a steam sale with Red River I wouldn't hesitate.			"

												Dragon Rising is the result of Codemasters' attempt to focus the open world, squad based, combined arms, realistic tactical shooter ""Operation Flashpoint"" series development around gaming consoles rather than personal computers, in contrast with Bohemia Interactive's ""Arma"".As a result, the command menu was simplified into a more controller appropriate quadral rose, the group size was reduced from a 12 man squad to a 4 man fire team, and the number of entities permitted on a map at one time was reduced from hundreds to around 60.Compared with Arma or OFP:CWC & R, the OFP:DR AI move slower and more cautiously, are more alert, flank more effeciently, and yet are less likely to hit the player (exception given to AT weapons). Voices are clearer and more natural. Physix, a more advanced tiring system, and individual medical kits were used in this before being incorporated into Arma (3). Overall, the Arma games have more to offer though, with an easier to use mission editor, greater mod friendliness, continued support, the ability to lean, customizable faces and voices, free editing software for a user to produce their own content, aiming without having to constantly depress the aim button, and much more.Here are some comparison videos:

												So many negative reviews! This game is perfectly competent. It's not ARMA and it's not CoD. The co-op and multiplayer (if  they're still up and running) were a blast. Lots of fun to be had with a few friends fighting over the bridge or playing together against waves of stupid AI. The AI will blunder often, but it's got a fair amount of content, a reasonable campaign even when played alone, and smooth enough controls to be a perfectly reasonable middle ground between two vastly different genres of shooter.

												Dragon Rising is a case of developer and publisher apathy. This was a pretty solid tactical shooter at its core, but the inability for Codemasters to give a ♥♥♥♥ at the time has relegated it to an ""OK""To be certain, this game is *NOTHING* like the original Operation Flashpoint. That's ArmA. In fact, there was a lot of hope for this game since ArmA 1, as in Armed Assault: Combat Operations, was so poorly received.  However, ArmA 2 dropped and made this utterly irrelevant.1.) ArmA 2 got a demo before it launched2.) Dragon Rising got a demo after it launchedAnd, to top this off, the game's biggest drawback is that it suffers from consolization. The control responses for inventory management are painfully slow.The AI, is also, hit and miss. At times, its competent. Other times it craps its pants and rolls in the grass. It always sees through cover, through brush, and through smoke.In all, this could have been a great beginner's tactical shooter. But, it's just so gimped. For the price? Yeah, it's not bad, at all.

												What a buggy piece of crap. This was Codemasters attempt at outdoing Bohemia Studios (the original creators of Operation Flashpoint), and it is ♥♥♥♥♥.+ Missions will fail because of the moronic AI + Checkpoints are often when you are under heavy fire - often meaning you are reloading again within seconds+ Cover and concealment mean nothing, because the enemy can track you regardless+ The mission designers hate gamers, because every single flag point is puts you into unnecessary enemy fire, when some perfectly viable tactical routes exist - such as using dead ground.Some bugs are so painfully evident, it is obvious that the QA /playtesting was rushed, and Codemasters have not done good by their customers by fixing the issues later.The scenario is straight out of Monty Python, that the USSR begs the USA to help them. To take a little island.Apparently, this is because Moscow does not want to cause an international incident, but completely glosses over the fact the Chinese would simply carpet bomb the US off the island, because they would view US troops on their soil as an invasion.I love good military sims, but this is really not worth your money. Ever.  "

												My main concern when buying this game was if I were going to be able to play coop with friends. Although you will not find any multiplayer servers online, you can still create servers and play with friends cooperative campaign games on LAN (or multiplayer if you have dozens of friends). Setting the lan server was very easy and I didn't have to do any special configuration even having wifi and cabled ethernet adapters. If you know how to forward ports on your modem you might even be able to play over the internet using direct ip as well.If this is your goal as it was mine, you will be very happy with the game. Good value for the price.			"

												Operation Flashpoint: Dragon RisingPositives:+ Super realistic squad based gameplay. You're always against the odds and rarely can you relax, one bullet can be fatal. The game is challenging and difficult if you don't play tactically. This is great fun for those who enjoy strategy and realism, you need to stay prone, kneel and take cover.+ Cool weapons, but limited selection.+ Co-op mode so you can play the game's campaign with several friends.+ In singleplayer you can give orders to squadmates, such as flanking and supressing the enemy, defending a position, medicing, repairing vehicles and retreating.+ Graphics look nice, the water, forests and buildings are aesthetically pleasing.+ Around 30 hours of gameplay in singleplayer, less however for Co-op mode.Negatives:- Issuing squad orders can be annoying amidst a battle with the enemy and is often an inconvenience. I didn't use any squad orders for the entire duration of the game because it was far too difficult to multi-task while being fired at. The concept is sound, but the execution was poor.- Flawed checkpoint save system which doesn't do justice in the place of saved games.Overall Score: 7/10Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is an enjoyable first person shooter and resembles a military simulator.

												Wow, the Steam reviews are unfair. The negative reviews are mostly because there's no multiplayer anymore and it's not as good as the original Operation Flashpoint. I agree with those two points, but I don't believe this game deserves a ""thumb down"" because of it. It's still fun to play and provides a very nice ""realistic military shooter"" experience.

												Underrated game in my mind. I played this originally on the Xbox 360 back when it released, then later on purchased it on PC within a Codemasters Bundle that was on sale.A lot of people like to say negative things about this game, but honestly, I really enjoyed it. I thoroughly enjoy realistic tactical shooters and milsims, and this game ranks high on the list of available games. That's not to say it doesn't have its problems. The AI isn't the best (although there is a mod to remedy this), and the resolutions are restricted to 1280x1024 as the highest option. To fix this, you'll need to download another .exe and replace the one in the game installation folder. The guides section has this fix explained in detail with links to the file.The game has a great campaign, and in fact, it's easily one of the best single-player campaigns I've experienced; very enjoyable and expansive missions that feel very immersive and challenging in a very unforgiving manner. Screw up just a tiny bit, and it'll cost you greatly. There's a few side missions available independently from the campaign, plus you can download a ton of mission packs off of modding websites to further enhance the single-player longevity.Multiplayer is no longer officially supported, which is unfortunate, however, there is a very simple workaround. Simply use Gameranger and host LAN games and you'll be completely set. Now onto my gripes. These two issues are single handedly my biggest problems with this game, and if they weren't there, this would easily be one of the top military tactical shooters out there, and would be something I'd put a LOT more time into. These issues are FOV (Field of View) and mouse acceleration. Absolutely unforgivable to not have proper support in these areas. The FOV is locked at around 60, which is horrid. There's no way to change it, at all, by any means. Now, I did get used to it, and didn't let it ruin my experience too much, and I'll get to that in a second. As for mouse acceleration, once again, no fix available. You're stuck with it, and it sucks. In this regard, playing with a controller is actually superior, although your aim will undoubtedly suffer from it. Now if it was one or the other, it wouldn't be that much of a problem. For example, if you could increase your FOV to around 90, but the mouse acceleration was still present, it would still be annoying, but it would be less annoying. If there was no mouse acceleration, but the FOV was still locked at 60, once again, less annoying. But the two combined.... just, it's terrible, and as I said, unforgivable in a PC game. Aside from that, this is easily one of the most optimized games I've ever played. The performance is outstanding, especially on any PC stronger than an Xbox 360. I mean think about it, last gen consoles could run this game. Naturally people would compare this game to Arma, and in the realm of performance, there's no comparison. The EGO Engine is outstanding, and the visuals still hold up well even today. In fact, I'd compare the visuals to the newly released SQUAD, and in some ways, it even looks better. To be completely honest, after playing this game through again just recently, I'd say it's very similar to SQUAD in gameplay style, and even the HUD elements (compass, weapon selection menu, etc.), only it has a very detailed single-player experience.To rap things up, it's an excellent game, hampered down by two glaring issues that can be mitigated if you play this game the way it was designed... as a console game. What I mean by this, plug in your Xbox 360 controller, sit back farther than usual, and the FOV will be somewhat more tolerable, and mouse acceleration will be a non-issue since you're not even using a mouse. If you can get past those two issues, you're in for a great military shooter experience. Calling in artillery and mortor fire is easily one of the most satisfying things you can do in this game, among many other things. So with that in mind, given its price, I'd recommend it. Plus with Steams ability to refund, you'll be able to experience enough within 2 hours to determine whether or not you'll want to issue one.			"

												This game, and its Sequel Red River, got me into a different mindset of military shooters. Originally I only had an Xbox360 and found this game on a shelf and gave it a shot. It was interesting to play a military game without having a hollywood story attached to it. Open world map and having command of a squad give you freedom to attack objectives in different ways. The enemy AI isn't too tough but can give you a hard time if you wind up without cover. Great game to play with a gamepad as it's built around it. If you are new to military simulations then this could be a good start.			"

												Fun, decent game.Good gameplay mechanics, if a bit noticeably developed for controllers rather than a mouse and keyboard.Decent...story. Was fun enough to set the stage for some awesome gameplay moments but...not good enough to actually be memorable.The co-op is HORRIBLE. What developer thinks turning checkpoints off in a co-op mode is a good idea?The game overall was clunky and became a bit of a pest to play at points. Was unfinishable for me and my friends on co-op but I finished the game in single player. Was fun but...there's much better games out there.That being said, this is till a fun game that I would recommend playing if you can get it on a sale.6.3/10 - Decent enough if you can get it for a cheap price, could be better though, but it's not so bad that you should avoid it. It was fun enough that I can confidently recommend this to a single player, but don't buy this for its co-op, you'll be disappointed.			"

												Operation Flashpoint is the original namesake to the Arma series.  When Bohemia and Codemasters split, they both had their go at a combat simulator.  Bohemia made Arma, and Codemasters made this!  I would compare the feel of this game to BF2/BF3, but with an Arma twist.  Missions are reminiscent of Detla Force, with clear-cut objectives often interrupted by enemy patrols that can very quickly get overwhelming.  Combat is pretty visceral, though I think a sound-pack could really bring it up a notch.  All in all, this is very different from Arma in terms of mecanics and gameplay, but the same feel is there.  Good fun for a few bucks, that's for sure!			"

												Being pretty different from the original Operation Flashpoint, Dragon Rising is still a decent game. Compared to the first game and the Arma series, it is friendlier and is a great game for people not familiar with ""realistic"" shooters, because it nicely displays modern combat, better than most military shooters nowadays. The game's world is a single location, a big island, and unlike similar games there's no draw distance limit. Despite this the graphics are nice and well-optimized (for 2009). The story is nothing special and is pretty short, but the missions are fun. You drive vehicles, command your squad, use different firearms modeled after the real ones; a level editor is also included, as in the game's predecessor. The game's development probably was pushed by the publisher, so it can feel unpolished, there's cut content (some of it can still be found in the game's files), some annoying bugs, and not so good AI. I recommend Dragon Rising if you want a game that balances between ""Hollywood action"" (à la Call of Duty) and military simulations (like Arma).			"

												Oh god... the fixed FOV... the constant headbob... I feel sick.Weapons feel un-satisfying, UI forces you to stand still (Even ""quick"" weapon switch), AI is stupid and slow and that is just the first level... This feels like a game made for console and badly ported to PC.I have not had the ""delight"" of playing the Multiplayer however... I was too nauseous to continue. (Apparently it is dead though... thank ♥♥♥♥...)3/10 As of 2 hours played.			"

												First of all, let me be clear--IMO all positive and negative reviews on Steam stand CORRECT. Yes, this game is just as good as people claimed, and as aweful as some have criticized.Skip to the end for TL;DRThis game is the bad brother of ARMA, but good enough to truly realize what CoD MW1 could have been on a next level of size, depth, and lethality. And I think a few things should be covered so that those who read on will know what to expect. note* I still have not dived myself into mission editor and not enough players for PvP, so no comments on these.Missions--Campaign is similar to CoD, the missions do cover some of the most basic of types: ambush, night raid, charge and hold town, diversionary strike (support)...etc. Each mission would be a blend of these, so expect some time to be invested, especially if you do take things carefully. These missions are quite standard and relatable to what most contemporary armies would do, and yet both CoD and newer Battlefield doesn't quite capture the size and freedom that OFDR offers. The enemy do go on a patrol path, with another patrol that overlaps to provide constant oversight. It is a very reasonable design that challenges one to think ""how can i approach this defense before 12 men start stacking grenades on me?"" I truly appreciate this design work, but more on that on the AI behaviour.Size/Gunplay--Since this game is loosely similar to ARMA, semi-open world travel is a key feature. All missions range from medium to large area of terrain. players must travel most of the time on foot to get to objectives. Luckily, the designers have put enough enemies along reasonable key points, hilltops with machine gun nests, and ammo crates to make things more interesting. Pick you routes, plan ahead, use your binoculars to SEE WHERE THINGS ARE, and proceed to walk your own path. No restirctions other than enemy fire, and you will be ambushed if you make a bad move.See the issue is that camoflage in this game works. I am both impressed and traumatized at how enemies can sneak right into your face and shoot your at point blank range. And that is because there is no minimap, no Friend/Foe tags (need this more in shooters), and the bushes are such a well blend of colours especially if the graphics are set to low.While this game is not as hardcore on the simulation side, the sway of the gun when moving, lack of jumping mechanics, and recoil system does give a very hard time to aim, if only I can see. While this may turn some of you away (door on the right, please help yourself), I certainly loved it because i actually felt like firing a gun for the 1st time. Granted, I still have yet tried ARMA 2, but at least OFDR gave me my first time. Taking the stinger from your shoulder also requires loading time, cuz no one ever puts an explosive near their head during bullet fights (do these things blow? if anyone knows plz inform), nd the same goes for putting it back on the shoulder.And to fellow soldiers: please LOOK, then DO. if you don't know what to DO, stop and don't panic, LOOK MORE.AI--their designs can go from baffilngly stupid to insane manhunt machines. They will duck if suppressed, alert if bullets fly by, flee if crushed, and will run a circle to catch you in the back 10min later. They will always spot novice players (like me) before you even see their muzzle flash. And yet, AI teammates will also stand in one spot and receive grenades while you, the leader, try to heal yourself. Im not too experienced in AI mechaincs, so I can't give a full analysis, but just bear in mind that they are very good shots over 300m+, your health doesn't count much across the various difficulties, and they will nail you when given the chance. Try to keep moving in unpredictable directions and keep far away from imminent danger; works alright for me. Multiplayer--please, for the love of God, either hate it and don't play it; love it and Google how to fix it. There are pinned Steam forum posts on how easy it is to register and setup Tunngle. No knowledge on hosting servers, just install, launch and login, find the right OFDR server, and all your friends will be in the same public room. one of you host a LAN game, and everyone just jump in. My experience with coop is delightful--me and my bud had so much fun killing fellow PLA soldiers, getting bullet skinned by PLA soldiers, sneaking around in forests, and hiding behind bushes while the magnificent AI takes care of the rest. Think that says enough?Guns/Characters/Vehicles--When entering coop and single playergames, you get pre-assigned by the game to a 4-men squad. The only thing you can choose is class: stand. rifleman, Spec Ops rifleman, grenadier, engineer (explosives), AT,  sniper, medic, and squad automatic. It covers most classes like Battlefield, but no weapon choices like Battlefield. Quite sad, but I guess Defense budget got cut again. The first player/host will always have to be team leader, thus limiting player weapon choices even further. Luckily enemies do drop standardized weapons from the PLA side, and you can use that method to switch weapons if no ammo crates in the vaccinity.Vehicle numbers and types are also very much lacking: jeeps, APCs, ENEMY tanks, choppers. This is a major disadvantage for OFDR, and I will not smooth this one because it is just that lackluster. Also, since Codemasters have quite deserted this game, it is ironic that the very 1st original OF (later ARMA CWC) has more available mods than this game. Shame...Conclusion--I LOVED this game. My AMD HD6450 can actually run this pretty smooth at 900p (windowed), I had hours of blast on coop with my buddy, and completing the missions are actually a worthwhile experience. I am a diehard coop fan, and this FPS has provided me with enough assets to make a game challenging, walk a whole lot, plan ahead, fail my plan miserably, and try new ways at how to deal with crazy AIs.As for others, please don't buy if the gun sway, heavy recoil is not your type; I understand, after all every boy wants to be laser-aimbot spec Ops. Also, this not not truly open world, lacks modding, very little ingame assets, and bascially no LAN players unless you have friend(s). Since Tunngle is basically hazzle free, please no further b*tching on that, or just be honets about how much you hate CodeMasters, which I won't mind.			"

												This game.Oh lord, this game.Let's start by saying that my hour count isn't representative. I bought the original retail version of this game 4 years ago, and I've played it for days.Do you like shooters? Do you like them little bit tougher and more tactical, but are you scared of ArmA's complexity and bored of Battlefield's simplicity? If you answered yes to all the questions, then I've got a game for you.Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, along with its slightly hotter sister Red River is basically a ""revival"" of sorts of the old series Operation Flashpoint. The concept stays the same since the first game. A tactical military shooter, which throws you into a big, open world and gives you goals. You can either complete them to advance the campaign/mission further, or you can just ♥♥♥♥ around in the big open world with vehicles ranging from jeeps to helicopters.Graphics are really pretty for an open-world sandbox that came out in 2009, albeit a bit brown, the shooting is solid, vehicles handle like real vehicles, albeit a little simplified, enemy AI is actually smart (I've seen enemy soldiers laying supressing fire on my squad, while the rest of them flanked us and attacked us from behind), your AI companions follow your orders well and are capable of handling themselves quite easily (seriously, for the first 30 or so minutes, you  will  depend on these guys, they saved my ♥♥♥♥ multiple times even as an experienced player) and the story is quite interesting for a military sandbox.Sounds good? Because it is, but it's  not  perfect. Not at all. My first major gripe with this game is the tutorial. Or the lack of it. The game throws you into a mission without any explanation of the basic controls, and you better have Google opened on the Steam browser, because you will have to look up controls for yourself. The second big problem is the artillery support the HQ can give you. It makes the game way too easy sometimes. Seriously, you can just call in a barrage 90% of the time and it will solve your issues instantly.Third (more of a nitpick than anything though) issue I have with this game are the aforementioned team-mates. While their AI is good, they sometimes do nothing until you give orders. Which can be a huge problem if you get downed, because the medic  will  not help you by himself sometimes.Over all, I recommend this game. It's dirt cheap, and great fun when you get used to the strange controls, harsh weapon physics and brown-ish graphics.8/10, this game along with its sis is a great sequel to a masterpiece of a game.

												Personal rating: 9/10Replayability: HighBudget: Worth every penny.Lenght: A few days. This is hands down the best military game I've ever played. The interface is and the gameplay works almost flawlessly compared to other titles in the genre (military simulation FPS). Many people wrongly compare the game to other good games like Arma and such, and opt to take sides in the clonflict between the two gaming companies. I find this silly, as one could easily enjoy both games and simply be glad to have twice as much game. The game presents very realistic military scenarios and gives the player a lot of choices about how to handle their objectives. The levels are quite huge and the bullet drop in the game works quite well. The few things that work poorly would be (as always) a fairly limited AI (still decent), weird driving physics (avoid cars, or stay on the road! Off-roading even a little can be fatal - it's not a big deal if you just use cars to get from A to B quickly, using the roads, but don't let the AI drive. Only the enemy AI can drive properly) and the lack of ability to pre-select equipment, despite it seeming like this feature was meant to be implemented. Also, on the multiplayer part of the game, it seems like it was intended for it to be possible to me quite a few players in each mission, some taking a more ""RTS"" like stance on the game, as they play officers, but this also seems to have been cut from the final release. Finally, several missions in the game are only available by essentially typing in certain codes, which is weird... These codes can only be found on the internet. Also, it took me and my friend that I play with months to figure out that the game had a few non-campaign related missions that you could play when playing co-op. They're tricky to find, but they are there. The game is best played co-op with 3 friends.			"

												A very good,challenging,teambased coop campaign and multiplayer FPS game.Whatever difficulty level,youre gonna end up killed a dozen times anyway.Especially impatient run-n-gunners will have problems not raging in this one.I love the challenge it brings,and despite every animated soldier looks the excact same,and the graphics in general are ""some years old"",the soundtrack,the various missions etc makes this into a FPS classic.Okay,if youre a stone cold operation flashpoint - cold war assault fan,now better known as Arma,of course you will be complaining all day long on this game.....for some odd reasons. Trying to compare it to Arma.Stop.....stop! Arma is a simulator game,this is a standard FPS game. And just because Codemasters and Bohemia Interactive went separate ways back in the day,doesnt mean that you cant enjoy both games. Sure,it has elements from Arma in it.....Codemasters did a few games based on theyr first release,with BI. But just get over it allready.What i will point out in a negative way though,is that this requires a prepaied windows live account/it should work if you have a xbox live subscription or something,that you play both xbox and pc,to actually use its MP/online coop features. Also,you cant save the progress whenever you want......its an reach a certain checkpoint autosaver in the game. I would prefer to have British spec ops squads in a british developers game (Codemasters are british) Other then that,if you want a FPS game wich really dedicates itself more into tactical play,and not just the ususal fairy dusting BS,i highly recommend this both if you and your friends have xbox live subscriptions,or dont have a problem paying to play online. Loads of fun cooping with friends,and by yourself in the campaign. And for a cheap amount of money as well.Look for other gamers reviewing this,for info about where to download a fix to continue having fun in multiplayer.			"

												From what I've read, OF: Red River sucks because it sold out and tried to be like COD.  That is not the case with Dragon Rising. This is a great tactical shooter.  It's not an over-the-top, interactive movie like the COD: MW franchise games.  It's more like a mil-sim; a more user-friendly ARMA 2.  There is a lot of freedom so you can be creative and adaptive in how  you complete or blow your missions.  It's not a kiddie game where you play Rambo.  Not only do you have to watch your own ♥♥♥, but lead and direct others.  You'll be happy just to successfully complete a mission with your squad intact.  At least that's what I found on the Hard level.			"

												An oldie but a goodie. Set in an alternate 2011, you play as various Marine fireteam leaders, part of a USMC task force dispatched to liberate the fictional Russian Island of Skira which has been occupied by the PLA. AKA the Peoples Liberation Army. AKA the Chinese. If you have played this game's sequel on PC (Operation Flashpoint Red River), you will be happy to hear this title escapes the windows live integration with which it is burdened. Thank God! I remember playing this when it first came out on the XBOX 360 and even though I may be a little nostalgic over this title, I think it defiantly holds up and would still toughly recommend it, even at non sale prices, if you are looking for a solid tactical shooter. Though keep in mind you will pretty much be buying a campaign at this point as the multiplayer is dead.The connection to and comparison with the ARMA series is kind of unavoidable and while this game lacks a lot of what made up even ARMA II, it also excels in many respects too. Compared to the ARMA series, the multiplayer was never really heavily populated and lacked some depth. The other major point of comparison is that of mod support. Something which has kept the ARMA series going strong throughout those game's life cycles has been the ability to mod the ever loving ♥♥♥♥ out of those games. This is something Operation Flashpoint Dragon Rising (OF DR) lacks and so its replay value is greatly diminished, something which contributed to its sharp drop off in players. Though there have been some mods developed for the game since its release, these have been somewhat limited in scope compared to many mods you can find for ARMA.However it is unfair to characterise this game solely by its negative aspects compared to the ARMA series. There are many elements in OF DR which were done very well and are still better that the ARMA series even to this day (ARMA III). One of these elements is the AI. I am sure many of you are familiar with the frustrating AI in the ARMA series and while the OP DR AI is not perfect, it achieved in 2009 what we can only dream the AI in ARMA was like today. They use cover, support each other, as well as you, make intelligent call outs and assault buildings very effectively to name a few things. The only major downside I found with the AI in this game is that they often do not seem to be able to engage enemy infantry past 200m, though this is rarely a real problem. Other aspects in which OP DR surpasses ARMA include the better modelled vehicle interiors and fantastic character animations. I particularly love the reload animation for the launchers which I have never seen anything which comes close in any other game.Releasing in 2009, though a little dated, its graphics still hold up. The character and weapon models are very good and the terrain is beautiful. Throughout the campaign you are given a number of different weapons with various different attachments to play with and the sound design for all of them is quite excellent. The campaign takes place on the fictional island of Skira (a faithful recreation of the real Kiska Island) and features a wide variety of missions including; platoon sized assaults in the day as well as the night, infiltration, rescue and assassination/sabotage missions all of which are very fun in their own way. Despite the game being on console it plays perfectly on PC and the need to adapt the control scheme to consoles resulted in smooth and intuitive gameplay. The highlight of which is the command wheel. This command wheel is how you command your aforementioned AI and is very simple to navigate while at the same time, offering a lot of depth to the player in commanding how he wants his squad to act. This includes; movement, fire discipline, formations and spread to name a few.I did however have a few other issues with the game though none are major things and some had been in hardly any games in 2009 and so could be considered unfair criticisms but this is looking back from today’s tactical shooters. One issue I had was the limited weapon handling the game gives you regarding ranging and aiming your weapons. What I mean by this is that when using iron sights, there is no way to adjust zero and the game doesn't tell you your weapon’s zero with any sight or scope. Though this is less of an issue with scopes as there are often mil-dots to adjust off. When using some sights like the ACOG, it is also impossible to use the backup iron sights on top of the sighting system, making it tricky to engage targets close in. The last complaint I have with the game is that it is only possible to change the weapon/equipment in your hands or give an order using the command wheel while stationary. Although you can give a limited amount of orders on the map, this often put me in the position of having to stop dead while under enemy fire to execute an action or issue an order.Despite the small number of criticisms I have of this game, it is one of my all-time favourites. Overall as I said at the top, I would highly recommend this game if you are interested in the tactical shooter genre and want to play an interesting and fun campaign outside of the ARMA series.			"

												This is a tough one. The original Operation Flashpoint GOTY game was one of the greatest 'realistic', tactical, sans-health bar FPS games of all time, with two fantastic expansions which both added huge amounts of content to the game (in much the same way Morrowind was improved by Tribunal and Bloodmoon) and a wonderful gameplay style that gave the game tremendous replayability and gave the player tremendous scope to imagine the world around them.Of course, after that original title the companies that were responsible for the game split up - Bohemia Interactive making the ARMA series (eternally disapointing in kind of the same way Gothic was: just not refined, polished, bug-free or fun enough to match the technological ambition) and Codemasters making this game.Dragon Rising was many years in the making, and while you can say that in certain ways it was a better shooter than the ARMA titles, you can say that it was nevertheless dissapointing and an inferior title to the original OpFlash in terms of how it contrasted with the titles already available.If we are to compare this game with ARMA then you might say that the game is a bit more stable, the missions a bit more cinematic and well paced, the guns a bit more realistic and satisfying to use. These advantages are real and enjoyable, but none of them represent industry leading iterations of the features - the original OpFlash lead the industry in map size, replayability, freedom, difficulty (if you so desired) and scope, but Dragon Rising doesn't really set the world alight in any one way.This does have to do with the bugs that, while not as annoying as in ARMA 2, for example, are still present. I once played a mission where a tank somehow got stuck to my soldier by an invisible, 10 meter pole. no kidding, I walked around the map with a many tonne tank spinning wildly ten meters above my head, smacking and clattering into the ground incessantly whenever I tried to get in a vehicle but, somewhat disapointingly, refusing to crush the squad mates that I tired to hard to splatter. Another time I had to give up on an entire playthrough as a certain mission bugged and was simply impossible to complete.The zones are still big, the soliders still responsive to orders, the enemies still reasonably deadly, but the island of Skira fails to burst into life in the same way the original OpFlash island of Everon did, largely because the game is let down by instability and unconvincing scenarios. It is a huge shame that this game failed, and while some admirable advertising almost convinced me to give Red River a go it was apparently even worse than DR, and as such sadly I fear we must lay this game to rest.I am reminded of the classic xBox shooter BLACK. Quite forgotten now, it had a really polished feel and really immersive, solid missions. It is perhaps where the ingredients that would have made Dragon Rising a really good game snuck off to.I still recommend this game, because it is better than ARMA 2 for as long as it lasts before it bugs out, and it just has a better title, let's face it.

												I think there's something seriously wrong with this game, luckily I spent only $5 during a steam sale to buy this after having played some Arma 2 and hoping this would be more of the same with better graphics. It comes with loads of great addons, maps and mods which give it the potential to be a very varied and exciting gameplay experience but I've only been able to complete a couple missions out of over 30 I played. The check-pointing system doesn't let you save just anywhere and the checkpoints are way too far off between each other so you end up wasting 10min over and over just reaching the objective and trying to setup a good tactic only to be killed withing a couple minutes of being spotted. One time I snuck into a town in one of the missions and I was right downtown unspotted with my squad, I finally give the command to start assaulting some buildings and I start firing from behind a house and some destroyer ship out to see just goes and blows up the building Im standing behind and then 3 others to kill my teammates withing 2min, would a destroyer seriously start firing artillery on their own base to rid it of just 3 guys?Your teammates AI:They are terrible, you tell them to drive to a shore about 30 degree's to your right and they go and run into the side of the island and keep trying to shortcut the boat across land, instead of going around the little area, all the armored vehicles seem to be susceptible to small arms fire, the AI wont shoot at enemies when your in a vehicle even though the enemy is in perfect range, if you tell them to board a vehicle and they beat you to it they start driving it around like morons nearly running you over while your trying to get in so you have to give them a stop order. One time I took a couple guys and put them in a chopper and another couple and put them in a different chopper, I jumped on a boat and gave the order to assault an area and I find myself halfway there and them still parked on the beach unable to move. Or sometimes theres extra AI soldiers not part of your squad and your trying to get a strategy going to get a guy in a tank and flank another set around the otherside and the AI you cant control just starts running in like maniacs getting killed, alerting the enemy to your presence resulting in your own squads death too, other-times they wont back you up. Your guys will stand out in the open alot, not start running faster when under fire or just stop altogether and commit suicide practically, they wont crouch or prone and you give them an order to go somewhere and they just stand there. This is even while using a single-player AI enhancement mod.The enemy AI: They can see you before you can see them from over 800m away while your crouching in tall grass or between trees in a forest, its almost impossible to sneak up on them plus they must be androids cause they have astounding aim from even 400m+ away always nailing you in the head. If you jump in any-kind of vehicle like a tank, chopper, boat some enemy unit always has an RPG to blow you up after just 1min of beeing spotted from a distance which makes vehicles pointless to use and half the time you cant even see them, you just blow up. Another time I put a couple guys in a chopper and another couple in a different one and sent them to assualt a coast while the unmanaged allied AI went in with a boat and they were all picked off with RPGs  withing 2min of being air/sea-born without having fired a single shot. This may still be fun as a PvP multiplayer with no AI but the company pulled the multiplayer servers, buy you can still use something like Logmein Himatchi. I think just stick with Arma 2 or 3, I'll never play it again except in multiplayer.			"

												OFDR is an attempt by Codemaster to reviveits Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, originally developed by Bohemia Interactive (who created their own ""Arma"" franchise). Using their own ""EGO"" engine, OFDR is an attempt to bring back the ""sandbox military shooter"" genre, in trying to get away from the tightly scripted experience of MOH or COD franchise. The result is a bit hit and miss, due to unforgiving difficulty, a tightly scripted experience on an open map, and clunky interface that was not even optimized for gamepad. Set on a fictional island just off Russia, which has the potential of large oil reserves, China, with some historical claims, chose to invade it for the oil to fulfill its own energy needs. Russia, busy with its problems, requested US for help, and US marines landed, and soo ncame into direct conflict with the People's Liberation Army. You will get to play two characters... a Marine Sgt with his own fireteam, and a special forces lieutenant leading his own fireteam. They have different missions on different part of the island, but together they will find a way to kick the PLA off the island. The game is realistic in that you can be wounded by a single bullet, and a head shot will likely kill you. You will need to use the medpack on yourself to staunch the bleeding (else you'll fade out and die), and/or summon the fireteam medic (or anyone else) to bandage you. However, the interface to do so is clumsy and impossible to use during combat. Same with grenades. You have them, but throwing them is a real PITA. The game does retail a lot of the open feel. If you can get at a vehicle, you can probably drive it. A jeep, sure. Tank or APC? No problem. Helicopter? Why not, if you catch one on the ground. Killing armor, on the other hand, is a different problem, as clearly they are invulnerable to your bullets, and you have to find anti-armor weapons (Queen Bee AT rocket, Javelin AT missile, etc.) . And you will occasionally get to shoot Stinger or Strela SAM at helicopters. The actual shooting, however, leaves much to be desired. You will barely spot the enemy at all, even through the various target scopes, unless you happen across a sniper rifle (usually by killing an enemy sniper, or special ammo crates). There's also plenty of foliage and terrain features. Add it to a very... bland color pallete (it's almost all autumn yellow) and you'll NEVER spot the enemies without a little help from the threat indicator (which is only active at the ""easy"" difficulty level).  And no, there's no ""radar"" showing you where the enemies are. This is a sim, not a ""game"". The missions are long and the progress saved at checkpoints. However, the checkpoints are not always placed at logical spots, and you often don't know what exactly you did wrong last playthrough. So you end up repeating the checkpoint over and over until you throw your controller through the monitor. The missions also fail to allow the open-sandbox style map to work its magic, as most of the missions are tightly scripted and often with a TIME LIMIT, such as ""you must eliminate the SAM teams before our own gunships arrive in X minutes"". Obviously there's going to be a ton of enemies between you and the SAM teams, all wanting to shoot you dead. All in all, OFDR is extremely disappointing. It has plenty of potential, as its sequel, OF:Red River showed. However, the execution is marred by timed mission triggers, impossibility of acquiring targets in the scopes, and very clunky interface, even on a gamepad.			"

I loved the intro to the story but just couldn't bring myself to do anything more than the first mission because the game is simply not enjoyable.  It takes 10 minutes of walking or driving to get next interesting area with limited action only to die after combat because you can't make a helicopter gain altitude and the check point was where the previous combat was 20 minutes ago.  No thank you; I don't mind a punishing difficulty but this isn't hard it is just broken try and fire a javalin at an APC and you'll see what I mean.			"

Thanks to the Map Editor, you can create your own game within the game. The commands are slow, until you are able to map the keys to your needs-then this game is brand new. Use of the Macro enables orders to be called at the press of a button-i highly recommend any mouse with Macro or Joypad and Xpadder (of which is an awesome app for those coming from Console to PC). Loved it, and loving more i have 200 ish scenarios to play on. Shame the server is dead, but there are ways and means.			"

												This game was a pleasant surprize. I went into it thinking it was more of a role player or strategy game but after many hours in realize it has all of those and more. For some reason codemasters the devs stopped this one after the Red River series...still scratching my noggin over that one...but found a link on their site that took me to a euro site that is alive and well and even has 152 missions that can be used over and above the ones that initially came with the game with more to follow. Now you just can't beat that. You can play co-op or multi-player and the single-player has a good 12 to 18 hrs worth and for the modest prices you can pick this one up for and if you like the genre you owe it to yourself to give it a whirl. It was released in 2009 so the graphics are very decent and it doesn't tax your graphics card to boot. It's a stand alone so you don't need Steam or Origin to play it. I would give it five stars but there are a few minor glitches like loosing your cursor motion at times but alt tab out or reboot and it comes right back and off ya go again. Again for what their asking prices these days are and you have friends that like the same stuff this is a fun game to play on line in LAN mode. Keep in mind also that there all sorts of ways to skin the cat in this game which makes for challenging ways to defeat the AI's, maps are fairly large with all sorts of ways to go about winning each mission which there are ten with seven extra missions inside the game once you complete the first ten. If you get hung up do as I and go to IGN walkthrough and it'll help tremendously.There are a number of folks that have added quite a few maps there are two patches 1.01 and 1.02 that add two DLC's and there is another fellow found on the codemasters site that has added 152 more maps that are really challenging. There are no dedicated servers so round up your buds to play on LAN and off ya go.			"

												I played this a long time ago when I borred it from a friend (in disk form!) and only recently, about 5 years later got it for steam. Everything is exactly as I remember it, smooth, challenging and fast paced. You constantly have to adept to the enviroment and you die REALLY fast if you dont take care. Your team is equally squishy, and while some say the AI is a bit stupid, to me I feel as though the AI is just replicating what a real soldier would do in a combat scenario (in the context of following orders, you have to tell the guy to take cover, otherwise he'll stay in formation). Honestly once you got the handle on the controls the game is a treat. I wish I had someone to LAN with, or that the campaign was a bit longer, but it defs is worth it if u can get it on a sale or something			"

												Very realistic war simulationIts a shame that Codemasters stopped working on their Operation Flashpoint titles.  I realy enjoyed playing them.  I guess I was in a minority in this case?You play as one of a squad of 4 poeple with a mission to take out a group of insurgents.  Mostly you are on foot.  Your team is semi-autonomous, they follow your orders but are not controlled by you in any other way.  If you put them in danger, they will get killed, and so will you!  In fact you can be killed by a single well aimed enemy shot.  Thats why I call it realistic. Having played some other 1ps recently and emptied a whole clip into an enemy without even slowing them down this is refreshingly realistic.			"

												I only would say ""Yes, I recommend this game."" now because of it's low price, and only to those who've poured goodly ammount of hours into Arma products, or people who are looking for a slight in-between of arcade-meets-try-hard-simulator. This IS the continuation of Operation Flashpoint, to a degree. So when Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crises was released early in 2001, the developers of it Bohemia Interactive had a bit of a falling out with the publisher, Codemasters.The title remained operation flashpoint, and the engine that was operation flashpoint 1 was redeveloped, Bohemia Ineteractive then went in the direction they did with ARMA 1 2 & 3, Take on Helicopters, Take on Mars I also believe. The Arma franchise went foreward and Codemasters put money into other products as after a few more OFP titles they didn't make the haul in cash they were looking for- probably for the best actually, the later titles were no better then this if that.This is almost a Battlefield meets Arma 1.5/2 engine, it still is very much like Arma or Operation Flashpoint in terms of controls, 'jankiness', try-hard realism, but some aspects of the game were made a lot arcadey, forgiving, and catering to the players action packed experiance instead of getting sniped from hard to see soldiers in fields at dusk (though thats still likely to happen in this engine). If you do enjoy campaigns in the Arma engine, or you enjoy playing with the mission editors- Mission Editor is pretty much the same it was to Operation Flashpoint if memory serves me right-, and you have a few bucks to blow, this game can give you some more arcade like hours of fun then arma can, though for content it really is no replacement!

Story takes you to some small island which Russia, Japan and China claim and China actually invades it. And because you are an American, you intervene. The gameplay is quite easy to understand, though mostly you are better off doing half the things yourselves as the AI likes to have a mental breakdown.

												TL;DRIf you are looking for aim-and-shoot experience with sluggish movement and controls, this is for you. If you are looking for arcade fps experice, go play battlefield. If you are looking for singleplayer with realism experience, play something else.If you have bought this because of the reputation of realism of this game, bad luck.I heard this game is quite good, at least in the perspective of realism.However, what it really delivers is a really sluggish movement and control without any tutorials for which key to press and an arcade-ish combat experience. Movement and control:- Extremely weird and dumb key bindings- Really weird camera locking- Extremely small field of view. (Probably even smaller than horror games)- No options or what so ever for toggling. - Tutorials never tell you what key bindings for each action. Have fun searching in the option or googling it yourself.- Since spacebar is binded to standup and there is no option for jumping. You will frequently find yourself stuck between rocks.- The list goes on and on.Combat:- The enemy AI can spend all day long missing their shot even they are right next to you.- Hit-marker. Not great for a realism game in my opinion.- AIs can shoot at you even there are sh!t tons of trees and grass in front of you.- No option for adjusting the scope.- No way to tell how much is your bullet drop if everyone is firing. Good Luck- Your teammate is always dumb as hell+ Alright experience in long range combat. + There is bullet drop.+ Pretty nice voice actingTo be honest, if this is a indie game, it is pretty nice and alright. But if you say this is from a big studio, it is not that believable. Maybe because it is from 2009? The graphics is pretty nice considering the specs it needs.  "

												While I am a bit disappointed that Codemasters continued a series like OFP after the dismissial of its developers I can say that this title is a bit faithful still to what OFP was about. the Multiplayer was solid (I know Bluedrake is building a way to make it work now and I whole heartedly support that endevor) the fact it was not as easily modable as OFPCW (aka Arma Cold War Crisis) it does have some mods out there so that is a point in the games favor.The game does also stream line the squad commands which is another great point (no navigating number key radio buttons here) Another point in its favor is the graphics and sound (which are on par with Arma 3 (Sorry Arma and Arma 2 but your Graphics and Audio left a bit to be desired out of the gate (and yes the Arma series is a favorite of mine and I can be objective about it )Luckily the last point in favor for this is that the game still gives a hell of a lot of leway in terms of planning and executing missions the way I want to no on rails crap here thank god.overall on my scale of 5 out of 5 this game is decent as long as one is objective enough to overlook the politics and who developed what.

												I never got around to play the first Operation Flashpoint, so I can't really compare this to its predecessor. And I can say that I've tried ARMA2 and ARMA3 and think they are a little TOO hardcore for my taste. With that said, Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising are a good mixture between ""regular"" military FPS games and hardcore military simulators just like the ARMA series.The game takes place on the fictional island of Skira, based on the island Kiska which is located in Alaska. The Global Economic Crisis makes China seize control of the island from Russia, just to be able to grab the oil on the island. Of course, the russians are not very fond of this and they put their army on taking back the army from the PLA (People's Liberation Army). As they already encounter the PLA on the chinese main land, they call to the USA to retake Skira for them. And so... you're playing as two different squad leaders in the struggle of reclaiming Skira. Nothing too fancy.I thought it was a really good game and the player must be careful when playing, can't play it like a Call of Duty game where you just run in to the fire fight and kill everyone ""Rambo style"". No, that'll result in death very quickly. Instead, the player need to take it slow, think about what route to take and if he/she really need to kill that one soldier, why not go around the enemy? That might make the mission a little easier further on.Anyway... I really recommend this.			"

												Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a open world realistic tactical shooter with a world somewhat larger than the world of The Witcher 3. It is very good, has a very fun gameplay and insanely incredible soundtrack, i can pass the soundtrack off as one of the most beautiful of all time. But as a game, it isn't all that good in my opinion. It is very fun and all, but not much is actually in the game. Still a game totally worth playing.7.5/10 ~Larger than The Witcher 3.			"

												- INTRO -(IF YOU WANT TO PLAY MULTIPLAYER HIT ME UP, I HOST) I originally played this game extensively on Xbox360 since its release in 2009 and have comfortably logged over 1300+ hours on that, 120+ hours PC on another Steam account, and recently purchased it for this account.  Alongside this series I have played ArmA since the ArmA II release for a similar amount of time of various accounts.  I will start with the bad since that is most important.  Keep in mind this game is dear to me but I know where it lacks.- THE BAD (and meh) -For starters I used to play when Codemasters had the servers up for multiplayer but unfortunately they have pulled the plug many years ago.  I must use Hamachi, a VPN LAN service, to play with friends in multiplayer.  Codemasters promised far more than was delivered and bailed on the project for the racing series.  There is little mod support and most of them only function with V 1.00 not V 1.02 which is purchased through steam.Akin to ArmA II and earlier the AI vehicle pathfinding is awful.  They try to move in a direct line to the waypoint you have set.  If they encounter an obstruction, even a tiny one, they ram it and continue trying to drive forward.  For a game of this complexity and for its time I guess I understand.  No mods were ever developed to fix this.This game feels almost identical on PC as it does to the Xbox360 release.  I think this game even on PC works ideally with an Xbox 360 controller.  Here is the where the problem arises...This games only supports keyboard and mouse or an Xbox 360 controller.  You are unable to use any other sort of controller or flightsicks.  I believe most of these issues are because the game was optimized for console release.Due to limited support from Codemasters there are not too many missions.  To their credit, the missions they did release are well crafted and fully functional.  The only notable issues I have seen is in the campaign mission Hip Shot (night raid on the fuel depot) in multiplayer where the diversion side objective does not function properly.- THE GOOD - Stunning visuals and cinematic audio make this game quite intense.  I wish there were some sound mods to improve the realism of incoming rounds but it is a trivial issue.  The dirt splatters, JDAM strikes, smoke plooms, and fire were quite impressive for its time.  Even to this day I am awed by the visuals and audio!  The crushed black edges and use of filters give the illusion of cleaner graphics and are easy on the eyes.Gameplay is fairly pleasant.  When people ask what OFP:DR is like I tell them it is the bridge between Battlefield and ArmA.  It has some aspects of realism that do add a challenge but not too much to the point there is a steep learning curve.  I absolutely LOVE the command radial!  Character movement is fluid considering the nature of the game, I do wish they had a lean option.  Helicopter controls are decent although the physics are a not exactly simulation.When you use Hamachi or some other virtual LAN multiplayer is a blast.  You have a fair amount of control over respawns and difficulty.  REMEMBER, THE OFP:DR INTERNET SERVERS NO LONGER EXIST, YOU MUST USE A VIRTUAL LAN SERVICE.- CONCLUSION - I believe this game receives unnecessary flak from the community.  I feel this is because it did not live up to its original expectations and have a rough launch but none the less now is an awesome game.  Especially in 2016 $10 is hard to go wrong and this game is worth every penny.  If you wish to play multiplayer download Hamachi VPN and invite your friends.  I love ArmA and other simulation type games and have to say this is a worthy addition to that category of gaming.  I have picked up and dropped many titles but OFP:DR has a place in my heart and has not sign of dying for me anytime soon. "

												Operation Flashpoint is a great game for people who hate the fast paced unrealistic feel of CoD or BF, but are overwhelmed by the mega realistic games like arma.  Its a good mix of tactics and fun shooting gameplay never bombaring you with situations that require copmplicated orders menus.  You will die fast enough that you will never run into a firefight face first but wont have to figure out how to send your support gunner 400 m left while calling airstrikes simotaniously or some s***.  the AI can be painful at times when you order them to take cover and your man hides on the receiving fire side of the wall you looked at.  Also i found they could simply decide not to follow you on occasion which can make the game irritating.  The graphics are nice looking all considering.  The voicing is very robotic and inhuman sounding but thats no different than Arma.  The story for this game is lacking any depth and easily gets forgotten about making the game purely about killing the enemy and never about saving the day.  You are always stuck using whatever weapon was preassigned to the mission.   Overall, the game is enjoyable, and worth the playthrough if its on sale.6/10			"

												Thought this was a GFWL game so I had it on my list of games to play before GFWL shut down.Apparently if there was any GFWL it's gone now.I also didn't know when I started it that this is basically a Codemasters offshoot of the ARMA series.So if you're a fan of open world military squad shooters, you will probably enjoy it.The single player felt pretty sluggish as I only had a bunch of dumb bots to follow me around which would then usually just die and then I would take all their ammo.The game is apparently much better for MP but I didn't feel like making an account to see if anyone still played this.There's also a website by SaintAxe&Ror (SAR) that has a huge collection of custom missions to download if you so choose.

												First off, my main disappointment with this game was that I expected more. All the pre-release material made this look as an good alternative alternative to the ARMA-sieries, with more focus on a more arcade-style aporashed but still hard for them how wants to play it in Hardcore-mode. But with a lot of missing anonsed featchers and a careless AI, how dosen't care if someone is shooting from a far distant, I can't say I was happy after my first playthru.As an ARMA-player, I like to engage enemy-AI from a distent, so this was a problem that I encountered several times and which even made the hardcore-mode ridiculous easy. However, I will give it that I had a blast with the Co-op. But I can't say that this is an excuse to buy this game, because it mostly relay on how you play with and the player how I played with can make any game fun. Which make Co-op-games biased.			"

												I tried playing this long time ago and I didn't really like it. But hell, recently I got it in a bundle so naturally I tried it again. And boy this game is boring!- Shooting mechanics sucks. At one point it feels like CoD clone, at other it has slight feel of Flashpoint in it. But mostly it feels like some cheap CoD clone. No identity whatsoever.- Campaign? Don't know. First mission, take your American buddies, go to point A, kill bad guys, destroy things at point B, kill some more bad guys at point C, go to extraction and finish your mision with some mucho punchlines. Awesome... NOT!- AI? Decent, actually. But enemies are way too accurate considering ranges the fights are going.- Graphics? Good, and the game is optimized very, very nicely. That's actually the best thing.And here we come to conclusion: it's boring, it's relatively nice, it's boring again, and then some more boredom.And yeah, this is NOT Flashpoint. This is bad version of CoD that wants to be Flashpoint. Avoid.			"

												There are a few reasons why I've only played this game for 10 minutes and the completely uninstall it, despite its awesome name. I have to say that for a 2009 FPS game it looks pretty good but there's no way that I would enjoy this game with so many other superior games out there. To be straight to the subjet I must mention that the graphics are absolutely terrible compared to other 2014 games and the gameplay is also horrific. The menu is really not that well designed and from a optimization point of view it's one of industry's worst, I kid you not. I had something like 40 fps on game's dafault graphics (which are also locked) and it felt really sloppy when shooting. Anyway, I don't recommend this game.			"

Brief ReviewThe original Operation Flashpoint often gets paired with the phrase ""military simulator,"" so that you're completely aware it's the kind of game where a single bullet can kill you, bullet trajectory actually drops over long distances, and switching between carrying an assault rifle to an anti-tank rocket takes considerable time. Operation Flashpoint simply prided itself on being a hardcore simulation of infantry combat. So any follow-up, such as the new Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, has quite a legacy. Which it clearly didnt stand a chance :) Thanks to Arma well pre-Arma 3 Arma.Pros and ConsProsBuggyStupid AIVehicle control is too arcade-likeRealism effects such as projectile paths and damage effectsAttention to detail (In almost every aspect)Firefights at rangeOutstanding visuals (For 2009 that is)Exciting voiceover workConsBuggyStupid AIVehicle control is too arcade-likeRealism effects such as projectile paths and damage effectsAttention to detail (In almost every aspect)Firefights at rangeOutstanding visuals (For 2009 that is)Exciting voiceover workAn EndingNo Pros and Cons arent in the wrong place and I was ment to copy and paste them in both sections because the bugs make this game fun but also frustrating at times.

												Just get Arma 3, or even Arma 2 if you'd like to save money. Codemaster pulled an Activision (or rather, Activision pulled a Codemasters) when they removed Bohemia Interactive as the developer behind the Operation Flashpoint series. Although it bears the Operation Flashpoint name, the true Operation Flashpoint series lives on in the Arma games. This and Red River were just cash grab attempts by CM (who have since shut down their FPS studio and are probably going to be shutting down their racing one too soon).*my lack of time can be explained by the fact that I owned this game on Xbox 360 and only bought it on steam to see if the PC version was any different from the console version (it's not, although console has more players last I checked).You don't believe that this game was a cash grab?

												Took a little over 8 hours to finish the campaign, which I thought was pretty good fun. It reminded me a lot of the original Ghost Recon - the missions are more limited in scope than you might be expecting from the original Operation Flashpoint. Overall, it's worth a few quid for the singleplayer campaign, there's some fun missions in there. Don't expect Arma though, it's far more restricted.			"

												Operation Flashpoint 2 is the sequel to Operation Flashpoint we've been waiting for... Only beaten and ♥♥♥♥♥. Everything was made to be more ""accessible"" to casual players, but in the end it is neither for casuals nor for fans of the original game.  The graphics are average, so is the audio, the AI is dumb, the physics are terrible (tanks banging off small rocks etc), the UI is annoying, the missions are bad, and the gameplay itself is boring. There's also a health regen (like in ArmA3), which says enough. Best to stay with ArmA2 or good old Operation Flashpoint.			"

												I had great fun for a few minutes.The first impression was actually cool. What I mean is the game has it's potential and it could be great... but it isn'twhy, you ask?here's why. It is buggy af. i once lost about 20mins from last checkpoint, just cause i jumped 15meters into the air and died from fall damage for no reasonWhat about the AI? it.. it doesn't exist. teammates can't find their path, even if they should just follow you. they walk straight out of cover into enemy fire. they have a habit of shooting you into your back and refuse to help BECAUSE THEY CAN'T FIND PATH TO YOU. i needed to restore a checkpoint because of that.. 5 TIMESI am a patient man. I really am. I always give games a chance. I most often finish them, even if they have a few problems.But this game..  this game made me angry. also that AI is a disgrace. I won't start it again any time soon. i recommend you do the same.			"

												This was one of my very first games I've ever played on PC. What a great start, playing a tactical combat shooter without having any previous FPS knowledge on PC. I had hard times shooting, getting in a very close combat, dying and suffering heavy casualties, but there was something that simply attracted me to this game. Graphics looked beautiful, I liked physics even tho sometimes I hated how slow I walk and FOV bothered me sometimes but I could just sit and play this game for hours, having fun in mission editor and exploring the island. Such a shame this game didn't get that much of a deserved attention because of its rivals. In my opinion it definitely deserves more attention. Game looks very great, even for today's standard. I highly recommend this game.			"

												It can have its merits but the AI seems woefully imbalanced and all their weapons are essentially sniper rifles.  By mission three you don't stand a chance and supporting allied troops are about as useless as their enemy counterparts are deadly accurate.  The game just doesn't hook you in.  Codemasters are renown for killing series, look at DIRT and apparently these bear little or no similarity to the original Flashpoint series.  Frustrating, tedious and an awkward control system ruins the awesome potential this has on paper.  I think someone once described this as an armed hiking simulator and that's a pretty good analogy.  If you have a lot of patience you might enjoy this otherwise not worth the time and effort.			"

												A nice war sim-arcade (more arcade-ish than it looks, really, but not as arcade as Operation Flashpoint: Red River). If you're looking for a good story, go somewhere else. If you're into tactical shooting and stuff like that, also forget about it, just get Arma 2 on a sale or even Arma 3 if you got the moneys. I'd only buy this on a sale and if I feel very nostalgic, although I must admit I enjoyed it very much when it was released.			"

												A decent game but definetely not suitable for single players. The tactical aspect of the game gives it a nice realism but the AI team members are not that intelligent. On quite a few occations I've had the AI's running from cover chasing after enemy AI to their dead. As this is one game where you  can't hope to complete the mission with team members down it can be quite frustating.			"

												I absolutely love this game. I am a person who generally enjoys the story of the game rather than the multiplayer. This is because my internet sucks and most of the time I have to play offline or do the story. Anyway this game is extremely realistic and alot of fun. Now the part that they added into it so you can get killed in one shot gets annoying but it is alot of fun. So if you are stuck trying to go somewhere and keep dieing just go around. It is quite literally that simple. But there is no multiplayer so people who play mulitplayer would not like it. So I give this a 8/10. It is not like CoD where you are a one man army but it is not like insurgency so if you get shot in the pinky toe you die.			"

This game is different from the first Operation Flashpoint, and it's not actualy what i excpected it to be, but still i would recommend it for anyone who are into Arma-type of games.Story campaign is kinda short, and unlike the first Operation Flashpoint you don't drive tanks, planes, helicopters... on few mission you can get an enemy jeep or sometimes helicopter but that's just sometimes in barely few missions.Pros: - Good gameplay - Nice Graphics - You can play on COOP - If you play on multiplayer you can get a higher ranksCons: - Short campaign - Multiplayer is totaly broken these days, and there are no official servers to play onConclusion: if it's on sale buy it, 13€ is a bit too much for what you get.

Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a war-themed FPS game developed by Codemasters Software with Singleplayer campaign and multiplayer mode. This review contains no spoilers at all. Seriously.GameplayI've spent 2 hours in this game (but Steam shut down and it said less) and I'm not going to run this game ever again. Not because it's bad, but it didn't fit my expections. It's impossible to change mouse sensivity during mission so that made my weapon not acurrate. Also, controls are difirent comparing to other FPS games, which may be frustating for some players. If you take a closer look at UI and HUD, you may notice that its just not-functional, ugly, messy and un-dynamic. Even when the game isn't lagging, the HUD appears to move slow and to have like 15fps. The group commanding system is not user-friendly. Changing weapons is taking time... I basicly couldn't spot any good things in the gameplay. By the way, I was unable to change resolutin of the game, because it couldn't fit by itself with my monitor.GraphicsUnlike the gameplay, the graphics in this game are very nice. 3D detailed grass, shaders and texturing made this game look awesome, I must say. Altough the animations of player and weapons models weren't breath taking. The game itself had too poor color correction shaders and was making me feel dizzy.So...I basicly didn't say much about this game, because I couldn't realy stand its gameplay. Sorry, Codemasters... I didn't realy like this game.4/10			"

												Let's pretend for a moment, that it is not named Operation Flashpoint and that we don't know the original OFP.It is first person shooter, that tries to be more realistic than classic arcades like CoD/Battlefield/... It is quite solid, but there is a lot of stuff I don't like and as result I don't recommend this game.Handling a weapon and movements are just bad and around this area there is sooo many bugs... If you accidentally switch to rocket launcher, then you need to wait for like minute long animation to finish to switch back to weapon. Sometimes it doesn't switch to to grenade launcher and otherwise, or it starts reloading for no reason.System of healing (stopping bleeding) or using binoculars is also quite ridiculous...Then there is AI, that is stupid as hell.Handling a vehicle definitely won't be my favorite part of this game either.It acts like it's open world, but missions are lined to go trough checkpoints (that are even needed to save game).It feels like your head is only meter above ground + the fact that grass is quite high = you don't even see a body 3m from you on the ground. That is really frustrating when I try to find ammo at dead enemies.And there is more... It is not that bad, especially when I got this game for like 20 cents, but I can definitely imagine better spent time. So for me I can just finish campaign, uninstall and I don't need to play this game ever again.			"

												Yes I review a game here everyone else had played years ago and I won't state anything new here, too. I left the series after the very first OF, my computer back than was struggling with the graphics but the game left a lasting impression on me- especially the mission editor was great. I am not a multiplayer guy, online MP is to tough for me, LANs just don't happen anymore. So I am just testing and reviewing the solo player mission here.What can I say:It is hard. Maybe I just suck, but I rarely have played a game that is so frustrating. The realism is good, although I think the ability of your team mates and your enemy differs a lot. My team rarely hits anything while the enemy snipes you from 500+ meters, whether you lie down or you run zigzag. I like the AI (they flank you when you camp or throw grenades) but all tactics on my side seem to be completely bugged or useless. Telling your team to flank or to suppress simply makes them act stupid (they advance but don't fire OR they start firing wildly but stand still). The team is great at spotting enemies, often long before I see them, but they completely fail at shooting/hitting them. Even a soldier standing still facing his rear side or non moving targets at 25m distance! Then it seems to be impossible to sneak up at someone. I tried at night, crawling through high grass towards an enemy outpost overwatching the other direction. At 25m he turned around and started firing at me. And this triggered the alarm for ALL troops in the mission area. How did he radio/set the alarm while turning around and shooting?It is good that you cannot sneak/knife through entire missions, but the missions rely on stealth/avoiding contact or firefights. The game spils this everytime you try. It gets pretty annoying restarting missions simply because the game balancing is crap. Everytime you make a tiny mistake (although you did what was expected) combat helicopters show up and blast you to kingdom come. Or entire companies of enemies appear out of thin air and encirlce your position.I play this game on a medium laptop with just ok settings. This does not work well. Zoom and vision are pretty realistic, enemies at 200m are a handful of pixels only. This game only works well on full resolution and large monitors. You should also be able to have good to max video settings at hand, otherwise the surroundings are rendered so roughly that it is almost impossible to tell enemies from objects.This is not an action game. In large parts it asks you to crawl/sneak through forest or brush land, avoiding being seen. You advance a few dozen meters, then check area with your binoculars. Changing weapon to binocular and back takes awfully long, though.You can not choose weapons/equipment freely for your missions. You will often wish you could bring a sniper rifle along, but you are not allowed to. You will run out of ammo fast, especially if you don't switch to single fire always. Calling for ammo resupply does not work. Your team mates won't share a single mag with you. Looting dead enemies only works if you get to them fast. They disappear after a few moments. Usually they only carry a minimum equipment set (often their rifle has a single mag left, no spare magazines). I wonder how they can shoot at you endlessly while alive, but when they die their ammunition magically vanishes...Teammates in vehicles don't fight. They do mount the MG on a jeep while you drive, but don't expect them to use it. Regardless of commands you have given them. They are also not able to drive a vehicle while you mount the weapons... pretty much sucks.It feels like this game was made for multiplayer and got a handful of bugged and annoying solo missions attached to it later.It was ok for 10€ but I was pretty disappointed by it. I have to check out the editor options yet, but so far I could not find anything that compares to the easy to use and flexible editor from the original game. "

This game is a bad knock-off of Arma 2.  Avoid it, there are better options out there.Between a ludicrous story, boring cutscenes, no 1080p support, and thoughtless combat this game is a loser. "

												This game started out as a decent feeling tactical simulation of combat. If anything it has similarity with actual combat in that it is stressful and not exactly the best choice for a recreational activity. Enemies will see you through tall grass, through cover, through smoke. AI teammates will ♥♥♥♥ their pants routinely and stand still under heavy enemy fire without returning fire or seeking cover. Objectives will outright fail to function property. The entire game has been consolized so hopefuly you enjoy either playing with a controller or having little customization on your control scheme. All this and other poor development decisions mar what could have been an interesting take on a realistic combat sim. The pieces are there, it's just too bad that the end result isn't really worth playing.If you have a tactical murder boner there are defintely better games out there.			"

												I do not know how this game has 61% positive other than old reviews. At 12/6/2015 there is NO mulitiplayer. Single player only, kind of like ARMA. It's not worth it to play this game when the NPCs talk like ""Body found. --- One of....theirs"" typing can't really say it, but they sound like a buncha choppy sound clips mashed together.

												I didn't like it, there have been countless other squad based shooters some have done it better some far worse so about middle of the pack. The friendly ai is dumber than a brick and is worse than the ai of army of 2 (for anyone who has ever played that) If it's like 3$ or less go ahead waste your money, good for (if nothing else) laughing at your moronic allies as they fail to listen to your dirrections and go on the wrong side of cover only to be hosed down by enemy units.

												For a 2009 game, you will experience this feeling as if the game has potential to be good upon entering the main menu for the first time as the soundtrack and stuff forms this feeling like Metal Gear Solid 4's opening intro done by Solid Snake about how war has changed in their era. The first mission of the story itself isn't bad and it gives you the idea of exploring the first map for the first time to 'force recon' your way to discover secondary objectives which are simple to achieve in example 'Destroy this' and 'Destroy that'. In every way, it does sound like the ancestor of the ARMA series but that's only as far as it will be able to achieve.Passing over to the second mission, you will almost immediately face ultimate frustration as you will have realized that your AI teammates are so useless and somewhat of a burden on you that they make ARMA's AI teammates bearable because they at least know how to follow proper orders with swift and precise action. You got shot up badly into a heavily wounded state and require urgent medical aid before you bleed out? It would be a bloody miracle if one of your teammates manage to arrive to your easily approachable position that is well sheltered from gunfire because they will ALWAYS approach your position from exposed areas so they could get shot up too. Even if they arrive to you with plenty of time left before you bleed out, they will just stand there and do nothing. Really, nothing. They won't return fire against enemy units or provide medical aid to you until you either bleed out or they get wounded too. Concerning enemy AI, it's of a mixed bag. They're either very incompetent or ridiculously overpowered in different situations. Examples are when you're behind cover against some large numbers of regular infantry, despite your cover being nothing but a thin tree barely large enough to shield incoming fire, they'll constantly miss like the iconic stormtroopers in the Star Wars franchise but when you're out in the open against at most 3 'support gunners' with LMGs, they'll mow you down with lazer aimbot accuracy at ranges of 400m. Enemy AFVs are also highly overpowered as they have the same accuracy as those aimbot support gunners and the HE splashes from them will always 1-hit kill you. At certain times, you'll feel cool like some tactical operator as his team is winning in a landslide until you experience such encounters that will leave you deciding to quit the game.Weapony - Decent at best. U.S. weaponry is better to use in every way except for the problem of limited ammunition. Compared to the enemy weapons, you have the benefits of a faster rate of fire, accuracy, recoil, scopes and reload time. The only benefit of using the enemy's weapons is: Ammunition. TL;DR - HORRIBLE AI allies, Biased 'Murica Weapons, OVERPOWERED enemy AI, frustrating missions. Game is only worth at a HEAVILY DISCOUNTED price like those super 80% sales. You're better off getting ARMA, I now know the reason why the games had split into Operation Flashpoint and ARMA, because Flashpoint was nothing but a sinking fishing trawler.			"

												OK let me start by saying , at the start i really enjoyed this game. If you like ARMA or games that require strategy and actual planning instead of the now so common ""run and gun"" FPS games then this game is for you. BUT heres what i felt have ruined this game for me - HORRIBLE AI , you would be better off having a squad of braindead ducks at your disposal as oppose to the AI squad you command in this game as they cannot follow a simple order of ""suppressing fire"" or even to move to another location. - LAG SPIKES , this could just be my computer but the framerate goes from a sexy 60fps to under 20 quite often making the already difficult gameplay even harder. -SLOW MOVEMENT, ok i get that they have tried to make a game that makes you really feel that you are a fireteam leader in a heavy warzone but for the love of god , swapping guns takes AT LEAST 5 seconds which doesnt seem like alot but in this game how 1 bullet can take you out for good it makes quite the difference.USER INTERFACE- it does take time to come to grips wiith and get a feel for the in-game ""give order"" feature without having to look at your keyboard for a few seconds to make sure that you are going to give them the right order wether it be fall back , suppress or even move to another location. This can ruin a mission trust me , how many times i have wanted my team to move to a safe fire location only to have them walk straight towards the enemy having their happy little AI heads blown off straight away and seeing as how you only have 4 members at your disposal including only 1 medic if you loose them all ......yea your ♥♥♥♥ed.all in all i feel that if this game got a few little changes it would be an amazing game but these things i have just listed really do make me feel the need to give this a negative review. but hey who knows with a simple update all this could change/			"

												The official system requirements says that my pc should run this game but I can only get a playable framerate on lowest settings. 640x480 is unplayable in a game that demands the player to locate enemies in far positions (otherwise, you'll die). Just don't buy it if you dont meet the RECOMMENDED requirements. On minimum settings I can run with 40~50 FPS. But minimum means ugly textures, no shadow and 640x480. Buy ArmA instead. Asking for refund already.PS: I could run ArmA 3 with better framerate than this game.Os requisitos de sistema oficiais dizem que eu deveria rodar o jogo numa boa mas eu só consigo uma taxa de quadros jogável nas configurações mais baixas. 640x480 é uma resolução injogável pra um jogo que exige que você enxergue os inimigos à distância (ou você morre). Simplesmente não compre se você não alcança os requisitos RECOMENDADOS. Nas configurações mínimas eu rodava a 40~50 frames, mas mínimo significa textura ridícula, sem sombra e 640x480. Compre ArmA ao invés disso. Já pedi reembolso.PS: Eu rodei ArmA 3 melhor que isso.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  After many, many extended sessions with it's cousin; Bohemia Interactive's Armed Assault, better known as ArmA, I was hoping that this would take the Military Simulator game in a new and fresh direction by starting with a clean slate.  Something that BI struggled to do with ArmA 2, and arguably seem to be repeating with ArmA 3.  In the end, they've learned from none of the OFP lessons of the past, and have produced a weak, mainstream, unmoddable parody of a milsim that resembles what ArmA would have looked like if Infinity Ward and EA had bought the rights.

Got it on here and I must of flavored my memory, because this game is not that great. not bad, but not great. Engagements are at long distances, so you can't even see the people your shooting at. Just pray to hit them with a stray bullet. This is of course a HARDCORE Tactical Shooter. But..... servers are down for the mulitplayer from what I heard. So instead get........INSURGENCY, a game is mulitplayer only, but so much fun for a person looking for a tatical shooter game.			"

												Normally i dont review games that i havent completed but now im stuck in last campaign mission so i write this.If you look realistic war game this is and its not game for you,hows so? First of all it has realistic bullet drops,second bullets are deadly,in most games its impossible to die first shot anywhere else than head,but in this game when youre hit,you most probably are dead if the range is less than 100 meters,if not you will start bleeding and need wound treatment. Also i would say shooting is pretty realistic,its really hard to hit targets over 200 meters. but where this game fails,first of all AI is terrible,im stuck in mission over and over again cause i need to destroy some tanks or something else and the problem is i dont have any weapon to destroy them,but no worries you got your team,you click engage tank and thats it...NOT.. your team,if they even manage to get your command will start shooting the TANK with assault rifles,even tho you have team member that has C4 or god damn RPG. Game also fails with dificulty settings,you want realistic game well thats not gonna happen,if you choose normal dificulty,your team members will respawn after dead..so you have to choose hard,then your team doesnt respawn but guess what theres also some other changes to normal so you really have to be good with this kind of games if you want to complete game without losing your nerves. also you cannot choose your weapons,youre put to combat what ever developers wanted. Also some mission have ""time limits"",when you have fought youre way through all enemies they decide to send you chopper and you have to rush half way map just to kill some damn tank or it will shoot your chopper down. How ever i enjoyed this game lot,even with bad AI and other ♥♥♥♥. If you want war game that has huge area and realistic shooting,this is game for you. if you want real missions this is probably game for you.

												Operation Flashpoint is a more realistic game in the fps section. The games graphics are decent but gameplay is somewhat lacking as when you start enemies see you from miles away opening fire at you and suddenly your on the ground with no idea of what is happening bleeding to death. Your comrades have no self decision ability so when your under attack against a swarm of enemies you have to manually command them to take cover. Worst of all the controls are horrible and difficult for normal fps gamers to get used to making a clunky and annoying gameplay experience.4.5/10			"

												This game is not a ""10/10 SO PERFECT"" game, it has it's flaws and whatnot.Graphics are pretty good, controls can be confusing at first if you often play games with simple controls, but it adds to the realism. Maps are huge. Vehicle gameplay is pretty good I guess, I like how you can actually turn on and off the lights and engine. You can call of artillery and shout orders to your team like a maniac through radial menus. That's nice.You can carry two primary weapons, one secondary, lots of other equipment, and also loot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you kill. Buildings are destructible. Missions are your typical war game missions, what would you expect? Eliminate ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, blow up radars and things that pose a threat to friendly vehicles, secure a place and hold it, etc. Occasional stealth, too.There's not much weapon variety, but most of them have several variants with different attachements. I guess that's something that makes up for it.Story is pretty average, but I'm OK with that.AI is stupid, as with any game. Sometimes radio lines are not heard (but show in the subtitles). Sprint speed is pretty pointless as there's barely any difference from the normal speed. Sometimes enemies take about 15 rounds (half a mag for most weapons) to take out, even at point blank. This seems to be random, as sometimes I kill enemies with a single shot on the foot. That, or I'm missing something here.In short, not the best there is, but not that bad. It's interesting. If you like war games that are a bit more realistic than usual, you should give it a shot.Take into account that this is not a war simulator.			"

												This game is very fun and very realistic when playing. plus when you get bored of the campaign dont hesitate to play around with the editor for it on steam. If you get bored with the editor then theres multiplayer. The first time i played multiplayer in this game i had a guy next to me that had his head blown off by a rocket laucher and his blood went all over my view. Good times. of course the whole team died, but was still something to laugh at and learn from in the end.			"

If you played Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis and want to keep experience the great military simulation, then you should follow any ARMA game from Bohemia. This one just carries the first game's name, and not worthy to spend couple hours or cents.Also if you want to get Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis; it's on the Steam platform named ""ARMA: Cold War Assault"".

												Sadly, I did not find this game appealing at all. First of all, the graphics are notoriously bad for its time. The movements feel clunky, which contributed to me dying several time right off the bat. To be fair, I did like how easily you die in this game. It provides a more realistic feeling to combat, but again, the movements and poor bullet pathing took away any feeling of awesomeness in the game. The AI isn't very impressive either, running around like fools at times and not knowing what to do. Weapons? I have never played a game where weapons feel so.... unsatisfactory. I felt i was shooting pellet guns instead. Overall, I do not recommend this game to any FPS gamers. You will be disappointed.Score: 4/10 "

												Oparations Flashpoint: Dragon RisingI have this game since today, and i like the game. I started the mision, witch start's with a movie about the history, and it tells you why you're fighting. Its a good storyline. The game has many options, you can drive cars, fly planes, there are many weapens. I think this is a way cheaper Arma 3, it has a bit recoil at the guns and you see the fire from shooting in the aim. The enemy's are weak but there are much like in Call of duty. It's an open world. In my opinion it's a mix of Call of Duty and Arma.I realy recommend this game to everyone. I buyed it in a sale for les then 5 euro and i'm realy supriced about the game i get for that price. "

												Osobno volim taj žanr igara, pa sam igru skinuo s interneta (torrent-a) 2011 (i završio u nekoliko dana s osmijehom), jer igra nije bila kritički dobro primljena od strane gejmera, a ja nisam htjeo baciti svoj ​​novac ... i bio sam oduševljen s ovom igrom. To je odlična igra za mene i uz Dragon Rising sam se dobro zabavio, unatoč činjenici da je igra pokazala neke svoje nedostatke. Taktički aspekt igre daje lijep realizam, ali članovi AI tima nisu toliko baš previše inteligentni. Gameplay je realan i zabavan za bilo kojeg ljubitelja taktičkih pucačina ili vojne simulacije, ako vam je draže to ime. Igra normalno radi na Windows Vista-i!Personally I love this genre of games, so I downloaded a game from the Internet (torrent) 2011 (and finished in a few days with a smile) because game was not well received by critics of  fellow players and I did not want to throw my money... and I was thrilled with this game. It's an awesome game for Me and I had fun with Dragon Rising despite the fact that it showed a lack of polish. The tactical aspect of the game gives it a nice realism but the AI team members are not always that intelligent. Gameplay is realistic and fun for any fan of tactical shooters or military sim if you prefer that name.Works on Windows Vista!			"

Terrible gameplay, short and boring campaign, full of environmental bugs like walls that launch you in the air and break every bone in your body, knee high fences you can't climb over, buildings so dark you can't see even with night vision etc. The enemy AI likes to absorb dozens of your bullets  before going down and half the rounds don't seem to have any impact on you. The field of view is headsplittingly low and not modifiable and the character models are laughably 2003-tier. The only fun you'll get from this game is the hilarious voice acting.			"

												Oh ho, boy, this is one of the best atempts to create a sh***est game I've ever seen. Codemaster you did it. Congratz.Btw every one who says its ""ok"" or even ""realistic"", you should go to see a doctor. Games in general doesn't need to be realistic or accurate 100% of the time. But this one is failing on the most important part making a fun enviroment for a player. Its a complete garbage and pain to play. Doesn't deserve any positive comment at all. Recomment? Hell, NO!!! Not even for free. Its free on xbox if you want to try it. (XBox live subscribsion month 12/15).			"

												There's little i can really say abou this game from codemasters. It Feels like a very cheap, all be it, graphics better verson of Arma 2. The Controls are badly desinged, and you get promts as to which contol to press, without actualy telling you the controls, which means for the first 30-40mins of supposed gameplay, most of that time is spent in the settings menu. The Gun Mechanicns are really slow and poor, and the hole thing feels sluggish and dull.			"

												Do you like the colour brown? I mean REALLY like the colour brown? Love it so much you want everything in the game, trees, grass, water, sky, sun, allies, enemies, to all be shades of brown? You do!? Do you also enjoy games with worthless tutorials? I mean games that tell you to press the appropriate key without telling you what that key is? Then you find you actually need a series of keys in a menu, mid-combat, with no idea what they are?Then this is the game for you! Everything is brown! The tutorial is worthless! The enemies are indistinct brown shapes against the murky brown backgrounds of the environment. The ally AI is dumb. The enemies rarely miss despite you being prone in shrubbery. Perfect game for building frustration.			"

												It must be old as fk because the max res is 1280x1024, so I didn't even bother. Well I wasn't going to bother anyway because the other Operation Flashpoint game, Red River, is one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. I cannot imagine how much sickeningly worse this is since it came before that one. If Battlefield 3 is a masterpiece painting, these games are stick figures drawn on used toilet paper from a taco bell bathroom on 50 cent taco Tuesdays.Codemasters started a new studio on the side called ""Codemasters Guildford"" to handle making these Flashpoint games. They sucked so bad that Codemasters shut down that side studio and went back to focusing on their racing games. EPIC FAIL.Anyone who likes this game is a hopeless idiot.			"

												This game has all of Arma's bad qualities while ruining almost all of its good qualities. Squad control isn't even a fifth of what Arma has. The animations are cool, but the rocket launcher animations, for instance, force you to stand in the same spot for a gratuitous amount of time. The inventory system is clunky and extremely simplistic. Vehicle combat is pretty much the worst. If you want to gun (which you will because the AI gunners suck), you can only order the move forward my picking a specific spot (so no more ""go forward"" as you would see in Arma). This is made worse by the fact that there is no independent head movement. The difficultly system has an all or nothing approach. Want to have more checkpoints but no hitmarkers? Hahahaha....no. The mission editor, unlike in Arma, is a separate program, making it annoying and restrictive to use.There are a few good things. The many of the campaign missions were interesting, and I sometimes actually enjoyed the game. Some of the later missions get very stupid, but there are a few gems. Even the best missions are sometimes handicapped by terribly placed checkpoints. It is very rewarding when your AI team actually does something well. They are more responsive than in arma, making them a bit more useful in a firefight. Of course, you aren't allowed to control a full squad, and the controls are often extremely restrictive.I was also annoyed by the lousy vehicle choice. The only US transport helicopter is rhe Seahawk. No Huey or Osprey? You can call in airstrikes, but fixed wing aircraft are not modeled and it simply acts as a special artillery strike.Overall, Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is just a crappy, simplistic version of arma. If you can get this for ~$2 on a sale, go for it. However, you might as well just get Arma 2.			"

												Nice graphics with nice guns. That's about it.Contains bunch of unskipable cutscenes, usually at the beginning of a mission. Some of the missions don't have checkpoints at all and forces you to sit through few minute cutscenes. AI is terrible. Your own squad stands stupidly and gets killed really fast. Enemy AI has an aimbot which allows about 150ms reaction time after coming around a corner. Enemy AI surprised from close range can and will kill two players in less than a second.Another annoyance is the ""MOVE HERE TO PROGRESS"" indicators. Game does not allow you to come up with your own tactics.Recommended for co-op? Maybe. (Co-op is possible, does not require LAN even though server is started from same LAN menu.)Recommended for single player? No.			"

												A very gritty, realistic tactical army simulation game. The landscapes you'll travel are absolutely massive! The firefights are difficult, the AI is... in some ways reliable. It's a great game but wait till it's at least $10. The multiplayer is horrible because there's only ONE server that's occupied and you'll be stuck sitting in a lobby for 3 hours just to start playing, get shot, and wait 4 hours for the round to end. The story is long but has a lot of bugs and can be frustrating. Give the game a chance if you really like pretending your a marine.			"

												Very difficult game, for your patience that is.  Poorly placed checkpoints, with sometimes 2 or 3 difficult parts between them requiring you to play the same thing over and over and over and over because a lot of things come down to luck in this game and it's hard to get lucky 3 times in a row.  Did it save right before something really crappy happened towards the end of the mission?  Sorry, either load your last checkpoint or start the mission over.  FOV is awful too, feels like I'm looking at everything through a toilet paper roll.  Otherwise game is fun, but without manual saves, or quick saves, the checkpoint system is just too irritating to be fun and perpetual tunnel vision really doesn't help.But... if you get it for cheap it's probably worth it.

												This game is a lot of fun.  It does a great job at being a game.And it is a lot better than the AMRA only OFP:DR haters out there.PROSReally builds a great sense of being on a modern battlefield against a modern enemy.Sounds visuals great.Graphics of terrain great.Interface great.Music and sound effects great.Okay campaign.CONSCheckpoints and endless restarts.  VERY 80'S.WHY WHY WHYNo situational awarness.Unrealistic missions.Stupid plot.NOT a sandbox!!!!No planning.  Just run and gun and you will make it through.No editor. No addons.ConclusionIf these guys and the guys who make ARMA would come together they just might make an epic game.  What sucks about this game, ARMA does great.  And what sucks about ARMA, OFP:DR does great.If you are not looking for an authentic experience, this game is for you.Otherwise we are stuck the the pitifully poor ARMA series.......			"

												Horrible. At first i thought it might be fun, but then i was killed instantly almost every time from weapons far more innacurate than mine from a massive range. Then i experianced the horrid checkpoint system, few and far between. The waypoints dont help either, as they can ruin your side objectives. Stealth is bad, with the enamies being hawks, and sniper rifles being more inacurate than ever. The AT weapons take forever to set up with no way to stop it, and terain and off-road driving is poor. The helicopter controls are what puched me over the edge. I had decided to try and maybe finish it and then never again, but on the mission to take the navel base, it instantly kills you if you get too close to the base on the ground, so i had to take a helicopter. First i found no way to make it move easily, then it flipped over. The auto-pilot isnt auto at all, it just messes up the gyros. And the tactical view.... The team members are useless and so is commanding them. The only time i commanded them is when they just stop following me, or when they frustrate me so much I send them to commit suicide, which they do no damage while doing. Spawning is delayed, so the enamies sometimes just appear on you, even with a good PC like mine. I tend to never hate a game this much unless it's this bad. I instantly delated my campaign, and uninstalled the game and its sequel. Only FPS i've played worse then some of the CODs.			"

												Despite its lack of cut scenes or conventional cinematic elements, this game is one of the most intense single player FPS games I've played. You feel as vulnerable as a soldier at war, but the controls are tight and you're at least as lethal as any adversaries. This game also looks and sounds great. The multiplayer is actually a total blast as well, you can command your own squad of AI against other players, and the maps are huge. Don't forget about the comprehensive mission editor either... this game is a little old now, but it is a great game, war simulator, and has more than enough content.			"

Graphic is fine and yu won't have any lags here cause old engine. And gameplay is brillant not stupid pew pew pew move enemy spawn pew pew but in realistic approach. Often u can't see enemy so positioning matters. We got big arsenal at our disposal or we can gather more equipment from the field of course kit's C4, grenades ammo to replenish. AI is maybe not perfect but not boring and not scripted so if u die expect other behaviour often. And it's of course co-op mode which is essence of that game - 4 man cooperative fight.			"

												Alright everybody just relax. We do still have a solution to be able to play mp matches and best of all, it's built right into the game. I've made a post on moddb regarding the issue and included instructions on how to start a multiplayer match without the dependency on any third party servers. The post can be found at http://www.moddb.com/games/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/news/codemasters-pulls-the-plugMany of us have been able to enjoy online matches simply by sharing the host ip address with all of the match participants. The process is really simple and has existed the entire time, but most players remain entirely unaware of the solution.To make this work, the player that hosts the session can simply obtain their ip address from one of many websites that give you your ip. Here are a couple:http://www.Whatsmyip.orghttp://www.Whatismyip.comOnce you have your ip address, share it with all of the players you are going to have in the match.Start up your game and select multiplayer from the menu.Select LANFor the host, you must simply create a server for the match. Once you have done that, the other players can join your server and will appear in the lobby after doing so.For the clients, go to the ip address menu selection and enter the ip address that the host gave you. Press enter and if the server is set up as described above, you should connect and enter the game lobby awaiting the start of the game.It's as simple as that!This is something we've known was coming so we shouldn't be quite this bent out of shape about it. We lost much more when they pulled the plug on the forums. In comparison, this is a much lighter blow to the community than that was. Look over the instructions above if you're not familiar with the process. The biggest challenge will be to find other gamers to strike up a game with, but I'm confident we'll be able to find a solution for that too.If anyone is having a problem getting this to work, post it in the Tech Support area of the forums and the answers to your questions will start to roll in.For goodness sake, cheer up!! :D We've survived much worse than this ;) Cheers :D			"

												Talk about realistic and time sinking game.  My game glitched a lot using Steam, but outside of Steam it worked find.I however did not feel I had the attention to actually play this game properly.  It is super realistic, requires being slow, methodical, thinking, and stealth.No run & gun, you'll die or fail the mission.  A good game, but not for anyone who is just looking for a good time unless you want to sink the 6+ hours just to figure out exactually what you really need to do to play properly.I assume you could beat it playing like a safe rambo, but that would not be the way it was meant to be played.

It is hard, the team AI is horrible sometimes and you will likely get frustrated, but it is worth it. The game is pretty legit and the bullet tracking is better than any COD game.			"

												Though its a very polished shooter that is underappreciated I just wasn't comfortable with the controls due to the fact this is a port to PC.Also the AI is good but don't expect them to do anything amazing since its usually you that has to do all the work despite the squad action. One notable occasion my squad had a jeep and I ordered them to attack the enemies 10 feet in front of me while they were in a field directly in front of the jeep and they just drove the jeep in circles not even firing a shot.

												This game is a waste of money. As a commander, you have little power. All you can do is say: Hold, Move, and Attack. It's also really annoying when you move teammates, as your character says the exact corodinates on a military grid. For exampel, instead of saying move to the water tower, you'll say ""Move to Yankee 13, Bravo 4, Whiskey 23"".The combat sucks. For once, your the weak one in a video game. Two bullets, three on occasion, will kill you, while a terrorist can take almost ten bullets to the chest. Your allys do more than you though. They all have assault rifles, yet they can snipe an enemy over 80 yards away in the head. I think i've said enough, so i'll end with this warning. DO NOT BUY.Hope this was helpful.			"

												Overlooked game by many i think also by me, i just find her in last few days and i'm suprised how good she stil is even in 2014. Graphic is fine and yu won't have any lags here cause old engine. And gameplay is brillant not stupid pew pew pew move enemy spawn pew pew but in realistic approach. Often u can't see enemy so positioning matters. We got big arsenal at our disposal or we can gather more equipment from the field of course kit's C4, grenades ammo to replenish. AI is maybe not perfect but not boring and not scripted so if u die expect other behaviour often. And it's of course co-op mode which is essence of that game - 4 man cooperative fight.			"

												Fun game if your into military simulators, but it suffers from truly terrible AI. You can command a fireteam but most of the time they will not follow your orders and will instead do their own thing, usually resulting in their death and disrupting the mission. The enemy AI is decent at best. If they are over 100 meters away and in open ground they ALWAYS drop to the ground and crawl to make it easy for you to kill them, and the ones that have cover use it sometimes but always pop back up in the same spot where you shot them last. The only reason I like this game is because of the open feel about it, where you get to plan your attacks, though most of the time you are being rushed. I'm sure its alot more fun to play with friends, but that would require friends. 6/10			"

												The AI can be annoying as hell if you're down.  Dumb Medics.  It's an okay game and definitely unique compared to other games.  It brings it's own unique playing style like Breach and other military games.  The story is decent but don't expect a lot of music.  This game aims for realism so you die in a few shots if you're not careful.  It's cool to coordinate your team and there's a lot of commands to get used to but once you start having them down then controlling your team into a deadly force is pretty satisfying.			"

												Absolutely Not. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Codemasters released shoddy multiplayer that was entirely broken, back in the days when it was cool to do a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port. No dedicated servers. So all the great mod support was pointless, because you can't play online. It could have been a great game, and they butchered it on the details to save some money. The worst part? Once the game was out the door, Codemasters just abandoned the community and the broken multiplayer.  This was the last codemasters game that I bought, and that was six years ago now.			"

												I can recommend it now that it's dirt cheap - the only way to have fun here is to finish the game for the developers. If Codemasters spent their time and money fixing Dragon Rising instead of making Red River, they would have fared a lot better. It really depends on what you are looking for - if this game did not bear the ""operation flashpoint"" name, it wouldn't have gotten so much flak. The main downfall of this game is that a) they marketed it wrong - taking a name no mainstream player heard of and sticking it on a game that will clearly offend the fans of the original, and b) they didn't care about the community post-release. The fact is, the game has a lot of potential - AI responds fast and feels smooth (kinda like in the original OFP and unlike ArmA2), although friendlies are useless; weapons feel nice and weighty; simplistic graphics don't cause too much strain on your hardware; and the missions have the capacity to be as massive and diverse as the original OFP (now ArmA: Cold War assault - actually, go get that instead). However, once the engine and models were finished, nobody bothered creating a decent long campaign, and the paid DLCs were similar in quality to what I could make in the editor in a day. Vehicles, commanding a platoon, variability of weapons - all could have been used for an awesome DLC, or even in the original campaign, but someone, in his infinite retardation, decided to just make a bland generic 10-mission campaign. But if you're willing to learn some LUA scripting, you can have a lot of fun with a reasonably realistic military sandbox with quite a variety of gameplay. Maybe it lacks the capacity of ArmA3, but I still feel weirdly charmed by its atmosphere.			"

												Despite its lack of cut scenes or conventional cinematic elements, this game is one of the most intense single player FPS games I've played. You feel as vulnerable as a soldier at war, but the controls are tight and you're at least as lethal as any adversaries. This game also looks and sounds great. The multiplayer is actually a total blast as well, you can command your own squad of AI against other players, and the maps are huge. Don't forget about the comprehensive mission editor either... this game is a little old now, but it is a great game, war simulator, and has more than enough content.			"

												The game is almost worthless in single player. Your squad AI is laughable, and the enemy can kill you from a distance where your crosshair is larger than the pixel that represents your target. Its also quite disappointing when you finally approach an objective and your computer controlled heavy weapons guy decides to shoot you from point blank range in the back with an anti-tank rocket.However, multiplayer, this game comes into its own. Having human beings control your squadmates make for some interesting tactics and situations. The game is still hard as hell, and caution is all-to-important, but at least with other people you can actually accomplish something.Its also nice that mission objectives update based on things you discover in the game world, and its easy to miss an entire secondary path just because you never saw that SCUD launcher hidden in a valley.

												The AI can be annoying as hell if you're down.  Dumb Medics.  It's an okay game and definitely unique compared to other games.  It brings it's own unique playing style like Breach and other military games.  The story is decent but don't expect a lot of music.  This game aims for realism so you die in a few shots if you're not careful.  It's cool to coordinate your team and there's a lot of commands to get used to but once you start having them down then controlling your team into a deadly force is pretty satisfying.			"

												If you are in the market for a tactical, semi-realistic shooter with a sandbox element, look no further than Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. This isn't, however, a substitute for ARMA 2 or games of its ilk. Yes the game strives for realism, with bullet drop-off, realistic(for the most part) weapon specs, pretty realistic weapon damage and all that jazz, but it's no ARMA 2. And that's what makes this game one of my favorite FPSs. It gives you enough reality to make things interesting, but remembers that it's a game and games are supposed to be fun. It doesn't sacrifice fun for realism or realism for fun. The AI is as dumb as a post though. Also the game is a blast to play with friends. You will get some great war stories out of it. I highly reccomend this game to fans of tactical FPSs.			"

												This game and it's sequel title seem to impress some people but not others. i for one love it. I personally have tried ARMA but i find it to be an unfinished game and it relies on you making missions to have fun. where as this game is similar to ARMA except that you can jump straight in (by yourself or with a friend) and get straight into the action. I found co-op experience is very enjoyable. me and my brother play it for hours, coordinating with each other and getting in mass firefight which i believe to be rather realistic. very good, would definately recommend.

												The game is a bit old, but if you want the closest thing to a combat simulator you can find this is what you are looking for. It is hard, the team AI is horrible sometimes and you will likely get frustrated, but it is worth it. The game is pretty legit and the bullet tracking is better than any COD game.			"

												This game has campaign coop with a small amount of extra content (once you've downloaded it). The game plays pretty smooth and the controls are fairly easy (although controlling AI allies is a bit horrible). In a 4 player coop game though, there are no allies to control.I'm not sure how much I'd enjoy this game Single-Player, on account of the AI being so horrible to control, but it's fun to play through the Campaign in Co-op.The AI is not particularly great, there seems to be a few bugs, like AI reacting to you, or knowing where you are, when they shouldn't. So this aspect is not very polished.The campaign itself though, apart from being a little buggy (or perhaps it's merely limitations of the game itself) is enjoyable enough.The extra downloadable content however really needs some serious testing. We found so much stuff that just didn't work well that we tired of looking through the rest of it for more.Overall rating would be that the game is DECENT. Worth buying, if you can get it cheap and have some friends to play through the campaign with... But I wouldn't be too happy about paying a Premium Price for this game.			"

												Really fun game. A shame Codemaster won't continue the series.Bought it on a sale a while ago. All though the game is a couple of years old, it didn't bother me when it came to graphjics or gameplay. I like the ""sim-feel"" when playing.I experienced some bugs along the way, like being inside a building fighting enemy infantry, an attack helo and several APC's who where advancing outside the building. Suddenly though, I was thrown out of the building, ending up being stuck on the wall uncontrollaby jumping along side the wall with all of the enemys focusing in on me and eventually killing me.Another problem I experienced was that the teammates didn't care if I lived or died. I constantly tried to keep them healthy (healing them), but when I got injured - not once did they come to my aid through the entire game.However, despite these annoyances I really enjoyed the game and I had some awsome memorable gaming moments playing through the campaign.So, overall it's a very good game and I recommend it to anyone who likes military shooters. I also wish that Codemaster would reconsider and produce more games like it.			"

												This game is one of my favorite squad tactical shooters. It definetly has its issues, but it is one of the games I completed all the way through (on xbox 360). The multiplayer servers have shut down, so there are only the single player missions. In the guide section of Steam, there are the codes to unlock the bonus levels. Additionally, there are over 300 player made levels you can get from mods at: http://www.moddb.com/games/operation-flashpoint-dragon-rising/modsIf you would like to see the game play style, check out the following video of me completing the first level.

												The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of OF: Cold War Crisis (which was later re-released as ArmA: Cold War Assault), Dragon Rising lays stuck between the late 2000's shooter design philosophy and earlier strategic games. The only way I can quickly describe it is Bad Company 2 with large scale combined arms gameplay elements. It is functional, and at times fun, but it lacks a central focus. The art style looks similar to Bad Company 2's, but even more depressing. The consoles-imposed limitations don't help either, as much of predecessor's customisability has been removed. The multiplayer has been officially discontinued but there are some simple ways around it. I had some great fun in these custom lobbies.Don't expect much content or narrative, but it is worth it's low price on sale.			"

												Without a doubt the best FPS military-simulator ever made, and it's all thanks to the editor. There is literally no limit to the scenarios that can be constructed and played out in this game. The AI is good and can be made more complex by additional scripting in the editor. Only complaint i have is that the mechanics for reloading and chaning weapons are way to slow and the fact that you cannot jump makes moving over obsticles hard and non-dynamic/fluid. The real balistics for the weapons is amazing and makes shooting at extended ranges much more realistic than it is in most other games. The environments are good-looking and there are numerous places to construct realistic and dynamic combat scenarios. The day-night shift is wellmade and happens at a sudle rate so that it feels real. The world is huge and there are a satifying aray of weapons to your disposal.			"

												At first I had compatibility issues with the game. When I finally managed to get the game running I was quite disappointed - it certainly is not a war simulator as one would expect.The main issues I have with it - my squad got resurrected and certain waypoints, enemies ignore fire (shooting a guard did not even make the other seek out cover if I was far enough), you could simply repair almost destroyed vehicles by yourself in the middle of a warzone, using an MG means your face gets slapped to a huge ugly black sight blocking thing and you can turn only very slowly and so on... Also, the game feels incredibly scripted. If you use the open world and prioritize a different target than what the game aimed for, you completely derail their narrative and briefings etc.I still liked the fast squad command style, athough it took a while to get used to. In general I had a better military feeling from Star Wars Commandos and OF:Dragon rising just manages to remind me of that feeling.I guess the Rambo-like theme playing in the trailer is actually a good choice for the style of the game.

												+10/10By far the best and most realistic war game I have ever played. Engine fisics are completely realistic, is a full on war simulator with great graphics and most importantly great plot and manueverability. OFDR has been by my standards (playing and testing games for over 20 years now) the most realistic war simulator, I really want to thank the Codemaster and Eidos Montreal team for such a gem. Even compare with Arma(7/10), -slows down on older computers-, that is the only point of reference I could find to compare to, considering the unrealistic style of play and fisics of games like Battlefield(6/10) or CoD(5/10) I think is by far the best bet for a player who's looking for the full on experience of a simulated enviroment when playing war games. Also a great bonus is the game low requirements since even though the game looks great (v8/10), is posible to play it in older computers and computer that only have embeded cards, not need for a dedicated graphic card to play it. And it runs great, plus it's the best war experience (on foot marines) I have ever experience in video gaming, and I have played many war games, since the old times of the old Delta Force games, until the actuality . This game can even be used for realistic combat simulating, checking out how many deaths, kills, bullets shot, time spent on mission, etc, in a completely realistic pace.I really want to congratulate the Codemaster team for achieving the purpose of showing, how hard can it be to survive in a battlefield and the reasons why still we are sending men out there to protect the peace. This can be use to show the world the hard work and the risk that our army guys take every day, and how far from glorifying games like CoD, the real war is, I totally recommend this game for advanced players, and even for people who just want to try modern time weaponry without the need of shoting a real one. Sounds are very accurate (10/10) and a bonus is the use of equipment and support.All left to say is, you have to try it Marine!!! Hurray!!!!***SALt***2016			"

												operation flashpoint is a 1st person sim-cade of a fictional war over the island of skira. You play as the us marines spear heading the assault onto the island. which is new and not cliched at all, might i add. for a 6 year old game the graphics have timed well. However the game play mechanics seem slow and clunky at times  and the AI are even more stupid ""special forces"" literally. at times it feels like you're being funnled through a corridoor only to be ambushed by the PLA. As your me act asif nothing has happend. on the other hand, the weapons sound like they have alot of effort put into them. And the immersion is second to non.despite its floors I think this game is great for £6.99 even if the game servers have down.			"
