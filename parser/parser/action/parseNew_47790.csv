												Unlike Call of Duty - Black Ops II, this actually gets Afghanistan right. The setting looks like the mountains I flew over and the valley I rucked in. It looks like Afghanistan, it sounds like Afghanistan, and despite the game-isms, does a good job of telling the story.  Little things stand out to me - the visible selector switch from semi to full, the relatively realistic weapons models, the radio chatter and dialogue - as authentic. There are some reality breakers, like a general in a suit during cutscenes or the wrong time period highspeed gofast gear on dudes in a game set in 2001, but I can put them aside and enjoy the atmosphere.The campaign isn't going to appeal to everyone. It's shorter than some, and it's not full of Michael Bay explosions like the Call of Duty series (which I also own). What makes the single player shine is that it's based on real events. The set pieces (vehicle sections, stand-and-fights) are well presented, and logically flow with the game. There's a sense of being part of a larger picture with the radio chatter between AFOs Neptune and Wolfpack and their boss ('Jimmy,' or COL Drucker in the cutscenes). Your actions make sense, and several times throughout the game you'll see the other AFO doing their part of the missions.It's worth picking up, on sale or full price, and getting a solid play through. If you want to see a more realistic shooter than the Call of Duty series with a story grounded in actual events, this is the one. This is probably the most under-appreciated military shooter in recent memory for me, purely as an on-the-rails gut wrench adrenaline ride (the downhill scramble to the chopper and the stand-your-ground sequences in particular). Yeah, there's hand-holding, but it the game it makes sense. No one plays rambo in real life, because that's how you die.			"

												Overall this is a great single player experience - the missions themselves are immersive and the environments - mountainous terrain interspersed with villages makes for a fresh and good air battle with helicopters.Be prepared for a short single player experience, so feel free to drag it out and not sprint the whole way through the game. My only criticism is of the General (Flag I think) 's character. The meddling top brass who doesn't know that he's sacrificing his men while not listening to those with their boots on the ground has been done, and adds no real depth to the game other than having an excuse to play as an army ranger.Advantages of the game:Action packed, fast paced and exciting singleplayer campaign.Great shooting, some moments of stealth interwined as well.Good controls for PC, which is not always the case for a lot of games released these days.Decent graphics.Story is acceptable, but the end is a little sad.Multiplayer is good and has more action than singleplayer.

												As a veteran, I've played through the campaign three times now with a year in between each. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster movie, so don't have an expectation of that.  It's gritty and dirty, and leaves you with mixed emotions that are hard to recognize at the end.  You may feel sad, angry,♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, sad again...and ultimately thankful.  All rolled into one.The story is good, and for me, emotional.  It brings back the memories of camaraderie, of knowing deep down that for your buddies, you'll run through a fusillade of fire in order to drag them out if need be.  For me, it's powerfully moving, and at the end, I just sit and let time take me backwards until it's time to return to the present again.Functionally, the visuals are somewhat dated, but they work.  The gunplay is as expected for a game and breaks from reality sometimes (no one reloads with the exact same speed, accuracy and deft paws that are chronicled here everytime you do so, it just doesn't happen due to Murphy's Law). The sounds are good, and the voice acting is very convincing.  Most of the major players sound just like you would expect elite operators to sound like.If you like first-person shooters and a good, albeit short, storyline, pick it up.  Especially if it's on sale for $5 or so.  Worth it.			"

This is my opinion of Medal Of Honor   Aspect Rating   Story 6.5   Graphics 7.5   Sound 9.0   Gameplay 6.5   Overall 7.4 Scores are out of 10. Overall score is an average This was the first Medal Of Hornor game that I have played. Though it may be tempting to look at its flaws and dismiss Medal of Honor as inferior to its competitors, there is a lot to enjoy here. The campaign has its shortcomings, but its unique sense of scope and well-orchestrated pacing make it an enjoyably cohesive adventure. Medal of Honor doesn't set any new standards for the genre, but it delivers a lot of entertainment and excitement if you're looking to add a splash of realism to your first-person shooting.I wouldnt recommend this game at full price, but when on sale, be sure to pick up your copy of Medal of Honor.

												Disclaimer: I have only played the SP. I assume the MP is either dead or sucks.I recommend the game if you get it on sale for less than $5. Otherwise, stay away.The SP is engaging enough to keep you in for the 3-4 hours it takes to bear the game. There is nothing spectacular about it though, just a mindless, on-rails scripted shooter with a few too many interruptions for my liking. Clearly made with the limitations of the last-gen consoles in mind, and the enviroments and level design show that the whole way.AI is somewhere between brain dead and acceptable. Enemies will take cover and shoot back, but that's about it. Gunplay is mildly immersive, though your teammates are more of an annoyance than help.Good for a lazy afternoon and for less than $5. Also, ♥♥♥♥ EA.			"

Note: the following review covers only the single player campaign.There was a point in time when Medal of Honor was a series that mattered. A franchise born in a time where WWII shooters were still hot and Allied Assault was blowing players and its competition away. But between then and now bolt action rifles and beach stormings have fallen out of fashion, most of the people who made Medal of Honor a respected name among shooters have long since left for other studios, and 2010’s reboot (for lack of a more appropriate term) is left doing the same thing so many other games were a decade or so ago when the series was first kicking off: attempting to ape its peers in the hope of grabbing a slice of the pie.Today’s analogical pastry is the impossibly large Call of Duty, which along with its innovations in campaign structures and online play brought itself out of the early 20th century and into modern day. Naturally every other military shooter has followed suit, but Medal of Honor is perhaps the first to really attempt to ground itself in the ongoing conflicts happening in the middle east, a decision that could have given its campaign meaning outside of itself and showcased to its players the very real horrors raging on in Afghanistan which somehow still feel so distant.Instead we end up with exactly what you’d expect from a modern military shooter, except coming along with the added baggage of playing off actual current events, which for all of developer Danger Close’s intentions has only managed to turn the game into a giant mess. It’s not that I expected Medal of Honor to provide any meaningful commentary on the scenarios its portraying, but by marrying its summer action movie mentality to a war that’s still raging and killing thousands it trivializes the losses of American soldiers and innocent Afghans for mindless entertainment.Medal of Honor is happy to proclaim itself as being “real” only so far as it can manage to fit in a blockbuster sequence of set pieces and explosions, showing you how horrible the things its replicating are one second while reveling in gory headshots and idiotic “bro-speak” the next. It feels emotionally manipulative and tasteless, unwilling to commit to being anything but a dumb action game with as little nuance in presenting its subject matter as that usually entails.And what an unbelievably dumb game Medal of Honor is. Below its terribly handled premise, incoherent plot, and attempts at “gritty realism”, there’s a game that’s terrified of letting you play it. It funnels you through levels with gratuitous levels of restriction, placing invisible walls everywhere so as to always be entirely in control of where you are and where you can go even if it intends to let you there later. You move when it tells you to, shoot where it points you, watch the often malfunctioning scripted sequences sometimes when it makes you, and participate in its series of strict directions because that’s all you can do.Medal of Honor is so obsessed with being in control that I began to ask why I was even there at all. The game clearly didn’t want me there, as I became one more thing needing to be kept on a leash, in case I potentially walk too far ahead and break another scripting trigger or stumble into an area before it’s had time to spawn its enemies, and I didn’t want to be there because the lack of any player agency made it feel like I was watching a very dull movie that I had to keep moving forward.But it’s probably the incompetency with which the game hides any of this that’s the most insulting. There’s never any question that you’re being moved through egregiously linear environments, shooting enemies with zero tactical awareness that pop up like target dummies with guns that never feel right. The game presents itself entirely as it is, as if it hasn’t even enough pride to try and hide its mind numbing tediousness and genericism; to try and pretend it wasn’t plopped out in the hopes of catching hold of Call of Duty’s momentum because it hasn’t a single original idea left for itself. In a way I kind of appreciate this sort of honesty, if only because it’s the only bit of sincerity the game ever shows.You can find more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

												I'm trying to catch up on a significant backlog of games, MoH was up next. Total playtime for the single player campaign was about 6 hours. Definitely an enjoyable game, there were quite a few moments of greatness with a few low points.  There were two points where I had to go back to a previous check point due to a NPC getting stuck on an item or a event not triggering properly, certainly not a big deal. Enemy AI was mixed at time but provided enough of a challenge. The various mission styles definitely kept the game fresh.			"

												This game is exactly what you expect: a linear experience of your typical brown military shooter. No one is going to lie to you about there's something different, or better, or that the MP is crowed (is not). What I can respect of this game is:-Good voice acting-More based on any real conflict than any CoD you will ever play-When they give you an LMG in some missions and they tell you to use supressive fire, you actually have to supressive fire. instead of peashoting like all CoD weapons.-Overall more cohesive.Game is old in most aspects because, let's face it: released on 2010 to supplie the demand of a tired genre.I got this on a bundle and have to admit I enjoyed it, and it took me to finish as much time as you see in hard difficulty. You can try the  hardcore Tier 1 mode if you want, but I wanted to pass trough with a shooter of this kind since it passed some time before I was actually burned out.Get it free, get it in bundle, trade or a deal, if you never tried it and want to play a military shooters with high accesible gameplay.

												First of all, Medal of Honor's single-player and multi-player modes are literally two different games with different graphics and gameplay.The single-player part is kind of generic, but still may be fun. Every level offers something different: breaking through enemies' lines with your squadmates, perfroming a stealthy mission, playing as a helicopter gunner, operating an anti-materiel rifle, etc. Voice acting is very good. Guns feel realistic and are nice to use. The graphics are dated, but still good for a 2010 game. In my book, the biggest flaws in Medal of Honor are its modest length (about 5h) and its difficulty, or rather its absence: even on the hardest difficulty level enemies lack aggression and are not so dangerous; your character can survive more hits than you'd expect. Beating a level without dying once is not a hard task, especially if you're an experienced gamer. Overall, the single-player mode is decent, but feels more like an interactive war movie. I haven't played the multiplayer mode a lot, however I can confirm people are still playing it and there are active servers. Gameplay-wise it's similar to Battlefield: Bad Company 2 or Battlefield 3 (as it was made by DICE, creators of Battlefield), but with smaller maps, faster gameplay, no vehicles and a few CoD-like killstreaks.

												If you have watched any number of genuine helmet cam war videos, you will appreciate the highly realistic portrayal of tactics.This is not a corridor shooter. It is a roleplaying game best enjoyed when you immerse yourself in your role and play it out like the real soldiers. The gameplay settings are pleasantly variable - sniping, sneaking, assault, and vehicle levels with the respective operator groups. This includes the actual equipment each of them uses and their expectable sound and power of effect.This is a chiseled out and fact-checked shooter I would definitely recommend any day.			"

												!Single Player Only Review!It was supposed to be the game that would break Activision's CoD empire, it was supposed to be the game that would reestablish the once great Meda of Honor name. Now, it's a game that will no-one remember and the game that fell short in every aspect it could have.The story of MoH itself is uninteresting, undercooked and short. The game can be finished in a mere 5 hours on normal settings, without any, and I mean ANY replay value. There aren't any collectibles, multiple paths or story elements that would encourage the player to start the game all over again. Once you have finished it semi-frustrated there is no going back to it. Frustration is a concept that will many of us have to face in MoH. The super-linear nature of the discourages any way of alternate pathfinding. To put it simple, if you don't do what the game says you to do, you're dead. Don't try to be a hero, as you always have to follow instructions to survive. If you are told to hold position, don't try to peek above the wall, because you are getting shot. If you are told to run or retreat don't try to stay and hold off the enemy as they will kill you...sometimes even behind cover.Not is all bad about the game however. Two things stand out the most. The graphics are beautiful even on medium settings. Water, rocks, buildings and shadows look astonishing. The other thing where you have to give credit to the creators is trying to maintain authenticity. Places, soldiers, the way they talk to each other, situations all feel real to a person who is inexperienced in war situations. The game itself takes place in Afghanistan and it's plot is loosely based on the Operation Anaconda where US soldiers tried to destroy Taliban forces back in '02.I can honestly say that I haven't seen a game that would want YOU to rush through it's single player mode. This game does. For one thing its ultra short. Experienced player can finish it in 4 to 5 hours easily, and checkpoints are so frequent that even if you happen to die, you won't be set back for more than 2 minutes of your progress. Literally, a level starts with an in-game cinematic and a shepherd is taken down silently by your fellow soldier, and boom checkpoint. Sometimes it feels like the game throws you a CP every time you reload you weapon. The level design is also horrible, excluding the first few stages, on all of the levels there is 1 hard point where you are so overwhelmed that you will die 3-10 times in 5 minutes. Up until that point and even after that there is little to no resistance. To put it gently, it's unbalanced.When you get frustrated (and you'll get) by the SP you can try the Tier1 mode, which is unlocked once you've completed the SP on any difficulty. Basically, Tier1 is the same as the SP just with some gameplay tweaks, e.g. difficulty is set to hard and you have no restarts. Once you die, you have to start over again. There is a time limit in each level that you have to beat, and headshots will freeze the timer for a couple of seconds. To conserve time there aren't any cutscenes either. This mode really is for hardcore MoH players and I doubt that any of the one-timers will enjoy it.Rating: 47/100; Replay Value: 1/5; To Beat: 5 hours; Played on: normal.			"

												Don't play Warfighter.Okay? Okay. Good +Very good weapons, ambient audio and voice acting+'Decent' Campaign+BadassBad -Terrible MP-Bad Scripting-Linear-'Decent' CampaignDLCNothing to speak of, just a preorder bonus that added some fairly overpowered guns and entry into the BF3 beta at the time.Worth?If game rentals were still a thing, I'd do that. Fun, not worth more than $10 or so, unless you really really like Navy SEALS.ReviewMedal of Honor 2010 was a pretty decent campaign blaster. It's extremely set-piece, but the guns have a percussive sound and an authority. Action is frenetic. It's optimized to the level that if you melee but miss, you can hold the button to draw your pistol instead and blast a guy, operator style. There's a lot of attention to detail and realism, as well as an incredible atmosphere riding ATVs through the desert, eliminating AQ with suppressed rifles and takedowns, then calling in dazzling close air support.But it really isn't a big deal for any one reason. It isn't a Call of Duty 4 with tons of innovative gameplay. Just a decent story, realistic and well-paced. Too short, a bit too linear and too much perspective changing. Better than any of the Battlefield games that came after it, and the craptastic Warfighter game. The multiplayer, being essentially Bad Company 2 without any actual depth, isn't really worth comment.			"

												Medal of Honor is a First-Person shooter, and also the thirteenth game in the series, taking place in Afghanistan, instead of the previous titles which took place during The Second World War. Released in 2010, Medal of Honor, has you conducting hostage rescues, and raiding hideouts, while navigating through dangerous territories filled with insurgents. IED's and realistic ambushes put you in the crosshairs and make you feel like you are actually in the firefights. The realism we've come to expect from the Medal of Honor series does not disappoint. You play the game as one of several different characters throughout the missions, from Navy Seals to Army Rangers. The story takes place beginning in 2001 during the beginning of the Afghanistan invasion. The game also has multiplayer mode, which features three different classes; Rifleman, Special Operations, and Snipers. An interesting title, one I would recommend to anyone who doesn't have PTSD, as the realistic quality and content could be psychologically damaging.			"

												Well, this game left me with mixed feelings. Besides the platitudinous plot about the good Americans and the bad middle easterns, the story was somewhat ambient. Sometimes gameplay was linear, though it don't mind it. What really bothered me, it was the scripted actions. Like, you can't progress the story if don't do some things like going to a specific spot or make a specific action.Big minus imo, is the duration of the campaign, which is pretty small, so it's only value for money if you can get it on a sale, like 5-6 euro or something and only if you are medal of honor fan. I liked very much voice actors and music background.If you want to spend an evening, MoH is a nice way to do it, but get as cheaper you can on sale.			"

												If you're looking for a beautiful game with a gripping story that you can't help getting enthralled into this is the game for you. Not only is the game awe inspiring in its detail and realistic weapon mechanics but it gives you an intense gameplay experience you can't not enjoy. Not only does this game come with an amazing storyline but the multiplayer is equally fun to play with friends or even by yourself. Even after completing the story you'll find yourself coming back to play the multiplayer over and over again. Even though its a bit of an older game I find it to feel and look better than most Call of Duty games that have been released in previous years (Especially AW and BO3). I reccomend this to anyone who wants to fall away from your typical shooters and get ingested into a story I found to be one of the best Ive played since the Modern Warfare series, in one game.			"

												If you manage to get this game for very low price, it's worth trying out.Well-optimised, not too hardware-demanding, runs on max settings without any hiccups, with good graphics.The singleplayer is good:I like the Afghanistan and military atmosphere. Audio is very good, graphics are beautiful and sharp. Character animations are somewhat good.The story is short, characters are noticable but rather character-less (bearded guy with a cap).There's no customisation, no ranks and no collectibles, in singleplayer. The cover system is working great.But as said, it's good - I installed this game because I felt like playing a shooter, taking place in Afghanistan (or something with lot of sand) and I got just what I needed.The singleplayer deserves a 7/10 rank, not bad. Good atmosphere and fun combat.The multiplayer is extremly mediocre. Very few players still play, but you find one-two full servers every now-and-then.While singleplayer is running on beautiful and polished Unreal Engine, the multiplayer is powered by a watered-down Frostbite engine. They removed cover mechanics, character animations suck, detection of hits is pretty damn bad, maps are too small and most of killing is ruthless spawntrapping. Movement is extremly sloppy and bulky, there are problems with delay (even if your ping is low).At least, I didn't encounter any blatant cheating, at least something.The unlock system is decent. Also weapon customisation. There are three classes, each one has unique equipment for both faction (Taliban and US).Rarely, you get a good match with the right type of players, in that case the multiplayer is great. But as said - very rarely.Multiplayer deserves the ranking of around 5/10, not sure. It mainly suffers from the engine, removal of features (comparing to singleplayer) and strange map and encounter design.			"

												I dind´t play this game for a long time. And why? Because some stupid videoreview I saw on it on gamestar.de, that told only how bad the game is - and only talked about the negative points of this game. But in fact, he just got it all wrong, didn´t understand the story, or played a completely different game? Maybe the game has been updated since then, but when I played it the first time this week, expecting nothing good - i got really surprised. Hell the game is 6 years old by now, but I loved the realistic style, the persons in it, the immersive story following an Operation in Afghanistan from different point of views but then coming all together... awesome. You will almost never be on your own but always togehter with your squad, and they talk a lot but none of it is crap or hollywood♥♥♥♥♥♥like in Medal of Honor. It just sounds perfect like military radio communication. The sounds are awesome. For example one of your squad members talks, you see his lips move, you hear him over the radio in your ear, but you also hear him talking normally because he´s standing right next to you...   or there´s a sequence when you drop into a Valley, and each shot you do just sounds amazing like if you´d be in a real valley (no idea how to say this in english :-)... Of course the grafics are not top notch, of course there are some small bugs that we´re not even worth to mention, but the game itself is a great and very (or at least it seems so) authentic military experience... Awesome and I can fully recommend it. Just make sure u listen to what your squad members talk over the radio - because there´s a lot of information about what´s going on in it, and I think the reporter from gamestar.de just didn´t listen because he says the story is not existing and strange :-D....Only thing I kinda disliked- the sequence where you go by quad bike through the mountains, the feeling for the driving is just very badly done and I don´t feel it realistic neither because it´s a mission about stealth everywhere you stop - and then you just roam on on those loud bikes?... makes no sense to me. But as I said - ...overall, awesome game. Loved it.PS: Didn´t even try the Multyplayer as it´s 6 years old already today. But from the videoreviews I saw it seemed pretty good.			"

												In all honesty, this is the best single player story I have ever played. For those of you who know some about the military, for the most part, it is very accurate to the real military, and the units displayed. This story is based upon a true story of SEALs. Play this game, you will love it. You won't regret it. This is the best story I have ever played through.			"

												Short campaign, so definitely get it on sale. Got it for $5, beat it in that many hours. People talk about the story being very strong for an FPS. The story didn't feel that strong to me. Rather it was the reality that parts of this coincide with what our troops actually go/went through. One part of a relatively early mission was eerily similar to a book a coworker of mine was reading called Red Platoon. The end definitely had that emotional kick in the gut if you perceive it as something that may've happened. So coming from someone who's trying to get into the FPS genre, this was an enjoyable experience that had some solid reminders. Just don't expect a super long campaign or a story that rivals an RPG.

												I think single player campaign is one of the best I played when it comes to realistic military shooters. There are some bugs and glitches here and there (one prevented me from completing the mission so I had to run it again...), but the story, atmosphere, sounds, music and characters are worth it. The gameplay is similar to corridor shooters like CoD, although you won't see as many spectacular scripts. The pace is a bit slower when you are playing as SF operators and dynamic and ""loud"" while taking role of Rangers. Campaign is rather short (5-6 h is enough to finish it), but quite tense.If you will have an occassion to get MoH on sale, I highly recommend to give it a shot.			"

												For starters:- got the game for $5- finished it on hard. (hardest difficulty)- haven't tried multiplayer (don't want to)But to be honest I really did enjoy this game, the story is taken from the perspective of the SEALs and the Rangers fighting the AQ.PROS:+ Frost engine allowing some destruction of most walls+ Great storyline+ awesome cinematics and characters+ Easy stealth for those who hate stealth games (me)+ Maximum of 13+ 'nades for nade spam+ 1000 ammo on the SAW, too much if you ask me+ Easy game for people new to FPS (please play hard)+ can run well on low end cps (mine)CONS:- Campaign short (3hrs)- Hitmarkers?- Easiest FPS I've ever played- Requesting ammo negating the reason to pick up enemy weapons when low on ammo and no challenge when running empty.- Unlimited pistol ammo- No graphic changer/slider except resolution- Hardly ever any recoil unless using heavy weaponsThe game may not be worth the current price but if on special grab for an easy shooter. Not too good at reviewing but just wanted to share what I enjoyed and what I found disappointing.			"

												It's too easy, it's too short (sub 5 hours for a mediocre player like me) and it's agonisingly linear. There is very little story or any emotional investment in the characters as they chop and change so often. It holds your hand for most of the time and then misses out critical information (like use 4 to target the mortars in the gunfighter mission). There are invisible walls everywhere and the AI on both sides is very stupid glitching on scenery and failing to trigger the next section in some cases. On the upside it looks very nice, the voice acting is excellent as is the sound work. I liked the few bits of variety we did get (helicopters, sniper sections) but these were very limited compared to the corridor shooter of the rest of the game. Multiplayer - is something between MW2 and BC2, but it's not as good as both. So if you like MW2 or BC2 you should go on playing it, reason to try MOH multiplayer is only if you didn't find what you want in one of them. 6\10 for multiplayer.			"

												The singleplayer is worth it alone. It offers a serious character driven narrative with good combat. Sure it's old, sure probably no one plays the multiplayer, but whenever I want a modern combat story game, this is what I turn to. The story is focused, the characters feel real, the shooting is great, the levels are good. It's worth it if you like first person shooter campaigns. Better than the sequel, but if you like this Warfighter might be worth a shot, just keep in mind it isn't as good as this.Try not to cry at the end, I dare you.			"

												WARNING: The FOV is set to 55, and no official FOV slider is present. There is an unofficial mod, but it's still in beta. Here is the link[community.pcgamingwiki.com]Medal of Honor 2010 is not a bad game, but it's not really a game that i would recommend.The game consists of a singleplayer campaign that was made by Danger Close and multiplayer that was made by DICE.SingleplayerCampaign is about the war in Afghanistan. Unlike most shooters now a days, they decided to focus solely on one place. You don't have this ""travel round the world"" that most shooters do these days, everything happens in one location.I also liked how they hand over missions to you. You start out as marines. During that level you get surrounded and call for air support.  Two helicopters come to the rescue and drive the enemy away, then you start playing as one of the pilots. By the end of their level, you almost get shot by an RPG, but a friendly sniper team prevents that from happening. Now you switch to that sniper team.During the sniper level, you provide assistance to a friendly unit. Then you switch to that unit.Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good here. This game has your typical linear designed levels. Altogether the game isn't very long - only 4 hours. Also, a lot of features that were part of MOH Airborne are not present - like choosing your loadout, big open levels, choosing you starting point, upgrading your weapons.MultiplayerIt was made by DICE. It kind of resembles a mix between COD and Battlefield.Unlike the singleplayer, it uses Frostbite 1.5 (while the singleplayer uses Unreal Engine 3). Despite all that, the destruction is very insignificant though.It features 12 maps and 6 modes. Allows a max of 24 players. Also, it has a server browser. 5 maps are used for Team Assault (TDM), Sector Control (smaller Conquest) and Objective Raid (Rush without vehicles). 3 maps are used for Combat Mission (Rush with vehicles). 2 Maps for Hot Zone (King of the Hill).2 Maps for Clean Sweep (Counter Strike).Combat Mission is probably the main mode of the game. It's pretty much Rush, except that you have 5 objectives, and you defend one at a time. Unlike BF's Rush it doesn't have 2 objectives at any one time. For more traditional Rush, play Objective Raid. Unfortunately in that one, the game ends after one of the objectives blows up - no extra objectives.Defenders win if the time limit runs out. Attackers win if they destroy every objective.Taliban are always the defenders and US are always the attackers. US also gets an APC (unfortunately, it's only available on 2 maps).The game features 3 classes: Rifleman, Special Ops, Sniper. Rifleman gets access to assault rifles and machine guns. As well as smoke grenades and grenade launchers. Special Ops gets access to shotguns, carbines and SMGs. They also get rocket launchers. Sniper gets access to sniper rifles and C4.The leveling up is very similar to battlefield, that means, if you play as say Rifleman, you level up only the Rifleman class. Each class has 15 levels. Also, just like in Battlefield, you are stuck with respective weapons to your faction, and to use your enemy's weapons, you must reach the max level.There are a total of 15 weapons in the game, and you have 3 attachment slots for each of them.Now what it copied from COD are the killstreaks. They named them as pointstreaks. You can get them just by playing the objective or by getting kills. Once you die you lose your streak.Now, the other unique thing is that you are given a choice between a defensive or offensive killstreak.I feel that the multiplayer is just too low on content.ConclusionSingle player wise i think that this is a step backwards. Medal of Honor Airborne was a good example on how to make singleplayer games.Multiplayer is alright, but i doubt you will find anyone playing it these days. Considering the amount of content given, i wouldn't blame them.			"

												The singleplayer campaign is not like in any other shooters. I find it realistic and engaging, the atmosphere is perfect and the dialogues between your mates are even better. For the first time I actually felt like a soldier thrown into the middle of a batlefield. You really have to immerse yourself in a role, trust your teammates and rely on them. And they have to do that too. The emphasis is put on tactics. We get to play three individuals which together combined make a whole decent story.One thing that particularly annoyed me were buggy checkpoints. Sometimes I had to restart the mission to continue the game.Overall, 7/10			"

												Medal of Honor Positives:+ Action packed, fast paced and exciting singleplayer campaign.+ Great shooting, some moments of stealth interwined as well.+ Good controls for PC, which is not always the case for a lot of games released these days.+ Decent graphics.+ Story is acceptable, nothing incredible though.Negatives:- Short singleplayer campaign, takes around 7-8 hours to finish on the hardest difficulty setting.- Very linear, you'll progress from one mission to the next with restrictive environments. No exploration or side missions.- Story, while reasonable, could improve greatly and lift the score for this game.- Multiplayer is literally full of young kids. No realism or authenticity here, the guns are awkward to use, the maps unimaginative and it is plagued by the typical problems with multiplayer, like spawn camping. As a whole, it's a boring multiplayer experience.Overall Score: 7/10Medal of Honor is a fun singleplayer game and that's probably all you need to know to buy it. Sure, it doesn't last long, but those 7-8 hours are good. Multiplayer does suck, so if you're purchasing for that reason alone, I'd say avoid.Pick it up on sale for 1-2 dollars like I did, and it will be well worth it.			"

 WARNING SPOILERSMedal of HonorThis Game is old but classic >.>  Another interesting fps but buggy as hell. I literally could surf a lot on top of some things.Most of times npc can lag and just stay afk in place forever, etcetera.One aspect that I really was impressed with is that the game is made kinda hardcore because at 1st all your enemies always will shoot you first in head (auto-aim ofc) at 2nd no tutorials allowed.I was thinking 10 mins on which button is activating hellfire rockets in helicopter untill I decided to watch video where guy said: ""Oh by the way if you didn't know hellfire rockets on 4 button"".The funniest thing that in last mission I had GL 320 on my rifle, which should have been activated by some button but where? Nothing in options, nowhere mentioned this and I didn't figure it out to the end.Story is simple just about army how soliders fight for life of each other and safe each other as well and ending is sad, because your main character ""Rabbit"" dies.Ending is sad but it's truth because we don't get happy ends in war.Medal of Honor: WarfighterOf course this part of the series became better because you know danger close was working a bit with Dice and Dice made Battlefield so some epic things from Battlefield came to Medal of Honor: Warfighter.Good story not only about war, but about families of those warriors, how they feel and how everyone feels besides those old characters remaining.THE NEW ULTIMATE MOVE IN THIS GAME IS SLIDING. Slide from cover to cover and shoot is so cool @_@ Besides in two missions you only ride on cars so yeah….Ride a car in fps so much it's kinda weird.Of course as in every war you get captive and your best friend gets killed there and are you going for revenge. And a little easter egg is that one mission from Medal of Honor: Warfighter continues from previous part. And in the end of this game you are avenging your friend that got killed in captivity and “rabbit”, who guy who died in previous part.I recommend both games even if Medal of Honor in Steam and Medal of Honor: Warfighter in Origin besides that second part has really good multiplayer. But don’t buy first part without discounts because its really short and second maybe too. They are not worth full price I think. Bye<3 "

												An honorable effortI only own this game because it came as part of a bundle, and it's not something I would normally play (as a rule I prefer to battle zombies, mutants, and aliens). I was, however, pleasantly surprised by MEDAL OF HONOR. It's a good solid shooter with nice graphics and a realistic atmosphere. The combat is satisfying and reasonably challenging, and it doesn't hold the players hand as much as some games. The single player campaign is, however, very short, at around 6 hours of play, but as I got it pretty much for free I can't complain about that. I can't comment on the multiplayer mode because I haven't played it but the single player part is fun just as long as you don't expect too many hours gameplay from it. 3.5/5			"

Such kind of games should have a larger single player campaign but sadly its not the case with this game. The story is very good but the fact that you have to buy another game in the series to complete the storys ending is not really much of a good idea, instead it would have been better if the developers provided it as a part of dlc. IF you gonna buy this game then buy it when there's sale cuz now its not worth the amount it's sold for. I recommend this game only to those who love FPS game cuz the  guns recoil are pretty much accurate in this game.			"

												Reskinned Bad Company 2 with Call Of Duty sized maps that we all played on xbox years ago. Still a great game and I use it to benchmark older hardware. Great campaign. Side note: Back in 2010 this game faced a lot of controversy regarding the enemies in this game. People form the east were complaining about it being too real, in fact DICE almost changed enemy models to russian because of lawsuits. But eventually those went away as well. Side note 2: Medal of Honor Warfighter the follow up to this game follows a different story and also faced controversy. The game was produced by DICE but they had insider advice from former military agents about weapons ETC. The game was ""TOO REAL"" and was then degraded to civilian levels. From what I heard MOH WF had too many classified weapons and gadgets and the government didn't want these to be out in the wild yet ""remember we were still dealing with Iraq in 2012"" This game was being produced during the Bin Laden investigation and came out after his death. They made the same weapons about 5 times with no variation between them with different names to fill the void of the game they created. This ended up killing this game early and a unfinished product came out therefore ending the Medal of Honor franchise then. I suggest you go read up on it.			"

												[8.5/10]Honestly...i purchase this because i just want Battlefield 3 Beta Access. that's all. Anyway, overall, It has a great single player, and an interesting multiplayer. The story and gameplay of Call of Duty was too darn stupid. Medal of Honor makes Call of Duty seem fantastical in comparison. That is why the game is certainly worth buying.			"

												You know what...I was ready to finish the campaign. It was boring and unintersting, but I was ready for it. I was having what I was expecting (a♥♥♥♥♥♥time) but I gave it a chance, just to see what these games were all about.And then I just got some ""fatal error"" out of nowhere that kept me from going any further (hooray!) so I'll never know what happens to the guy with the glasses and the beard.Gameplay is your basic Whac'a'Mole with guns.At least I only spent a dollar for it..

												Better than it's reputation. The campaign was not really original, but was disciplined and semi-realistic, especially in comparison with other military shooters. Gameplay and graphics are like meat and potatoes. Dialogue felt professional somehow, as did the soldiers themselves. I cannot really give this thing a medal (pun intended) but I got my moneys worth.			"

												Very enthralling story set in the war in Afghanistan. Instead of taking the Call of Duty-approach of jumping between set-pieces all over the world you jump between a couple of different characters from a few special operations units carrying out small-scale attacks against (mainly) the Taliban. I loved this concept, it had me hooked from the get-go and got me through the entire campaign in one sitting. I played on the highest difficulty level and it lasted about 4,5 hours (well balanced difficulty, punishing you for getting hit instead of relying on bullet-sponge enemies in infinite waves). The story is a bit on the short side but at the same time completely without filler and loaded with well-written characters and thought out missions. It's more ""Hollywood-realism"" than power fantasy, meaning the missions feel credible while you never feel like Rambo. You still mow down hundreds of enemies á la the end of ""Fury"" but the prescense of AI-controlled squad mates make it feel like a team effort. Like previously mentioned, I really liked this take on story-telling and found it somewhat original for the genre.What I didn't like about the game was how limited the graphics options were. The game deactivates options it considers ""out of your league"", meaning I could not play this game at anything higher than 1440p ""Medium"" settings. As in there wasn't any options but ""Low"" and ""Medium"". Ridiculous. Fortunately the game still looks great and is very well optimized.I have not played the multiplayer and have no interest in doing so. The single-player however is one of the better ones I've played from the last decade. I loved it and would highly recommend this game  based on that experience.			"

												Medal of Honor™ is the best 1st person shooter (modern warfare combat) you can get your hands on. DICE has done a great job with this title back in 2010. Both single-player and multi-player components are intense and this is one of the few titles that can be proud of being a realistic and tough combat simulator. Take sides and fight as a Tier 1 US operator or a taliban force in Afganistan. Bring your skills with you because Medal of Honor™ will be an unforgettable experience. 10/10			"

The graphics were just so clean when I went back and played it it brought back memories of 2010 and this game launch my passion for the military even FURTHER. I will always remember this game. 10/10 would recommend(Haven't tried myself yet though I've heard there is like only 100 people left on multiplayer though I've also heard there isn't  a problem playing with those small amount of people)			"

												Medal of Honor should be an patriotic shooter like Modern Warfare, instead it looks more like an anti-war shooter, because the violence in this game seems so senseless and you wonder why you ever kill masses of terrorists. The game is not bad, but it's definitely questionable. Even the multiplayer mode offers nothing new or outstanding. It feels more like an mix between Bad Company  and Modern Warfare. This Game is just polarizing.			"

												Well,  this game left me with mixed feelings. Besides the platitudinous plot about the good Americans and the bad middle easterns, the story was somewhat ambient. Sometimes gameplay was linear, though it don't mind it. What really bothered me, it was the scripted actions. Like, you can't progress the story if don't do some things like going to a specific spot or make a specific action.Big minus imo, is the duration of the campaign, which is pretty small, so it's only value for money if you can get it on a sale, like 5-6 euro or something and only if you are medal of honor fan. I liked very much voice actors and music background.TL;DRIf you want to spend an evening, MoH is a nice way to do it, but get as cheaper you can on sale.			"

												This will be a review on the single player element of the game ONLY.TL;DRThe game is fun, solid shooting mechanics, it does a fantastic job of paying homage to those who have served in the Military. Also does a good job of recreating real life events. (To know what this game is based off of, search for the ""Battle of Roberts Ridge"")However the game has a frustrating lack of replayability, there's virtiually no choice in the game whatsoever, even so far as down to the pathing. Your compadres also treat you like how a cop would treat a kid on a ride-along.If you want a game that gives you freedom to explore, vast amounts of choice, and you can sacrifice the 'realism of war' and honor to veterans that this game provides, I would recommend you try out Crysis 1 instead.Okay. Longer review time here.I should probably preface this by saying that I played Medal of Honor Warfighter first, so I had very low expectations going in, however I'd looked up trailers for the single player and thought that it looked really really good. I'll also state my biases as someone who really wanted to join the service, but due to medical issues, can't, so games that honor soldiers are automatically a little higher on the scale than a similar game that just follows the normal trends.That being said. I'll start off with the pro's again.The shooting mechanics feel very solid in this game. That's honestly something that will make or break a game for me, I can't go back and play Black Ops 1 because it feels like the gun I'm holding is made of empty cardboard. But this game hit the nail on the head for me, the guns feel like they have weight to them, and it makes it very easy to control.Combine that with the serious nature of this game and how you want to pull everything off very precisely, it sort of wraps that whole combat experience up very nicely and the simple mechanics of it feel like a well oiled machine.Along with the shooting, you also have the option to melee your opponents, and this feels so satisfying to be able to do when you manage to sneak up on an opponent and melee them, especially because these moments are rare, for reasons they shouldn't be, but more on that in the negatives section.The tone of this game is also set up very very well, and I believe this is helped on by the story taking influence from actual events that occurred. I can't speak to all of the game, but there are specific levels (see the TL;DR) that drew influence from real life events. However, this level of historical accuracy does come with the cost of design and creative decisions you're allowed to make, its what separates this game from something like Crysis or Spec Ops The Line, more on that later though.Overal these positives boil down to a very solid single play through, you will have a lot of fun, but really only be able to do that once, so lets get down to why.So the negatives in this game.Lets start off with a half positive half negative. This game gives you individual characters to interact with, people with very different personality styles, so you're not just the singular hero surrounded by incompetent brainless AI, they actually are a team of people around you. But the game does this in a very shoddy way, I swear they all have the same face, with maybe different facial hair across a few of them, and an artist gave a few of them different Uniforms and different skin tones, and thats literally the only way to distinguish them outside of their voice. That and even though this is supposed to be a well oiled special operations unit, you still end up doing most of the leg-work for your team. Though that contrasts quite heavily against how it feels they treat you throughout the game.Little tangent here, but I swear you'll see how it ties in. So the designers of the game wanted you to follow a very specific path of how to complete the game yeah? Call of Duty has more variety in how you can approach scenarios, at least in that game they give you different corridors to shoot through, but rarely in this game will you find that. And tying in with that, the designers made it so that in several sections throughout the game, there are little ledges that you must drop down from, or climb over, but the only way to do that, is to wait for your teammates to give you a lift. How does this tie in now? Because your teammates bloody climb over that thing like its no big deal, you're just the chubby fat kid they ♥♥♥♥ing felt sorry for excluding and now they have to help you over the ledge cause you can't fit your love handles over it! But they can effortlessly do summer saults all over that bloody thing. Literally all they had to do to make you feel less like the incompetent team member that they still tell you to do everything in the game (Ramirez, take out that APC!) Is by tweaking the animations so that you help your teammates over that ledge too! Honestly, it doesn't just stop there, it honestly feels like you're the new guy on the team, and this team operates mostly autonomously of  any higher orders, sooo... probably something like Seal Team 6, since we're told somewhere that they're Navy Seals, plus all the ads for the game said Tier 1. But still, new guy on the team for Team 6 wouldn't be treated like the bumbling idiot it feels that you are! That along with how this whole, buddy hoist mechanic works, it really drains down the player choice. This game has none, and tats why there's little to no replayability for this game. There's one specific area where player choice would have been so easy to do, and would have been absolutely beautiful to see happen. (I'll have to spoil literally 10 minutes of the game to make my point) At one point in the game, you're tasked with taking out this mounted machine gunner who happens to have a position on a hill where he can shoot down on you. All the player is taske with doing, is using your SAW to provide supporting fire to your teammates, making this guy stop shooting. (I had trouble with this part some how and it literally took me an hour to get it to work) However there were several points in time where I was able to sneak around to the side of this guy, and get to a blind spot in his coverage where I could shoot this guy and he couldn't return fire. But whats bloody annoying is that this guy literalyl doesn't take bullet damage. The designers specifically took into account that I would try and do this, and safeguarded against it... Why not make it so that you can just shoot the dude right then and there? Instead of having the military waste a 125K$ rocket to blow up one ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with a mounted machine gun? Its just stuff like that which frustrates me with this game, there's zero choice within the game, and thus almost zero replayability.I think if the designers had taken a page from the book of the likes of Spec Ops The Line, or Specifically in this instance Crysis 1, where (for the latter example) You are allowed to move freely within your environment and tackle any situation how you want to, but it doesn't change the story whatsoever. Which is what I feel they were going for, a narrative based experience. Though personally, I would love to see a realistic shooter like this game, take some inferences from The Line, and have a branching storyline where you see someone go through feeling the effects of the chaos and brutality around them, but in a well oiled and finely tuned game like this. Because lets face it, while there's no way to deviate from the intended experience (its biggest fault) the intended experience is still a very solid one!Screw numbered ratings, this game is fun if you're down for a one time playthrough of a game, and especially so if you enjoy military shooters that have a good story along with them. If you absolutely can't play games that offer no choice in how you play them, don't buy this game, as stated before, there is rarely any opportunity to deviate from the intended experience.			"

												Medal of Honour is... Extremely AverageAs a long time fan of the franchise, the chance of reboot is an exciting prospect, sadly it'll have to wait for another edition of this title to achieve its pontential. As an FPS it should have either had an incredible story, or incredible mechanics, Medal of Honour did a cracking job of not achieving either. Lets not be solely negative, there is a few fantastic moments where the cinematography simply blows you away, but aside from those moments the showreel is lacking. The gameplay is solid, the campaign is short, the characters are not memorably at all but they do all have beards which is nice. Cutting to the chase, unless you've played every Call of Duty and replayed your entire catalogue of games, it might be advisable to skip this title. If your intrigued and plan to purchase it, due to its mediocrity anywhere around £7 or less would be justifiable. NotesNo Achievements, No Trading Cards, Controller Support			"

												It's okay, but I would not spend 20 bucks on it.This is a 5 dollar shooter at best these days.Still holds up nicely with beautiful landscapes and action scenes, the details are really great.  It is a shame they don't really let you explore at all though.  You are very much on a rail, closed off from anything you might wish to see... and often even guys holding guns you wish you could grab.  But the visual experience is nice even compared to recent releases IMO Some obvious aged limitations, but it does look very nice.Sound is pretty good as well, decent enough I wanted to turn it up. Some gun sounds were kind of annoying, but they came out well even on some junk speakers I am forced to use lately, I am sure it would sound even better on an HD sound system.  No real audio experience complaints.The story is totally boring to me, and I have played better rail shooters (Black comes to mind)  All of the limitations make me frustrated.  I was hoping for more of a multi-path shooter, with varied options for how to progress, not so.  The game is really just a quick action flick stuffed into a game.  At least it looks nice though.The variety is nice, and this is way better than the old WW2 MoH games I played even back on what... PSX??  For what it is, it is well made.  You could do worse with your money, but there are much better shooters on steam for less than this at full price.Honestly, it is not a bad game, but you won't be getting much from multiplayer, and the campaign is very short.High budget quality... but only worth about 5 bucks on today's market.

												I honestly thought it was great. In the recent market of moddern warfare shooters, companies never get the balls to make a game about the actual modern wars. We've seen plenty of fake wars in the Battlefield and CoD series, straying from the real conflicts of WW2 that made those games successful. EA took the original concept of Medal of Honor, following valliant soldiers through the real life conflicts that have shaped our world, and brought it to the 21st century. Accompanied by music from Ramin Djawadi who's work I'm sure everyone is familiar with from Game of Thrones, this game truly takes a leap out of the standard Call of Fields that we've all become so used to. How EA managed to let a gem like this slip though the cracks without ruining it on the way out, I'll never know, but it truly is the unsung hero of modern day shooters. I'm not one to recommend FPS games like this, but I absolutely recommend this one if you care at all about the single player in FPS games. It's not just a Call of Duty clone.			"

												Can't say it's really a good game; the level design is basically follow your teammates and wait for them to open doors, and some levels like the ATV one are just terrible. That said, as someone who hasn't played a CoD-style FPS campaign in a very long time I enjoyed it more than the game really deserves. The last such game I played was Call of Duty 2: Big Red One, so even though the game is deeply flawed I still got a bit of a nostalgia kick. I would avoid it unless you, like me, haven't played this style of game in a very long time.			"

												A triumph of game design! A  tour-de-force in everything that makes EA the creativity powerhouse it is today! An immaculate masterpiece that will surely be enjoyed for generations to come.I would bet that someone at EA wouldn't even believe that if they read it. They know what kind of company they are, and they know what kind of game they make. This game had no surpises, and I only played it to remove it from my ""unplayed games"" list. Ok, here's the review.EA's Least Shiatty Game since Medal of Honor: Allied Assault (actually, MOHAA was good. I'll give them that)""Let's relentlessly kill A-rabs for 2 hours!"" Basically, it's pretty graphics and not much else. The gameplay is meh.... You're forced along a very strict path with glass walls if you try to stray even slightly.  There's one great scene where you approach a small village in an Apache (that you don't control, you just hold down m1+m2 and it shoots stuff), and they just say ""Everyone is hostile here. Kill EVERYTHING"" and you destroy every building in a village, undoubtedly killing children and civilians. There are lots of short easy gun battles between scripted events. The SEALs will tell you stuff like ""be really really quiet here, we want to be sealthy"". So you can, if you want, sneak along and kill nobody, or you can fire a few shots into the air, and your team will kill everyone for you. The controls are also screwed up too. For example, there was a mission where you're in a helicopter and all of a sudden you need hellfire missiles to take out a mortar, and the button for hellfire missiles isn't left click, right click, melee, grenade, or any of those keys, even though the last two of those are pointless in a helicopter. Instead, you have to hold down 4 for 2 seconds, even though there's nothing that binds 4 to any action. Really intuitive, right?1.5/5			"

												First, I know I haven't played this that much, but at Origin (EA game launcher), I've completed this game twice, so I kinda know what I'm talking about!Singleplayer: If you want a FPS action shooter with a simple hud and story, this is it.The story have gameplay for like 6-7 hours+ (I think) at easy so it's not long and complicated, but the story is pretty awesome! This game is a game where you bassicly can run around and shoot where you want, I've personally completed multiple missions almost only pistol (unlimited ammo) and knife (says itself), so yeah!Multiplayer: Haven't played that much, but people seems to be crazy good, so end of that!I know this probably was a pretty bad review, but, it's a review!

												Overall this is a great single player experience - the missions themselves are immersive and the environments - mountainous terrain interspersed with villages makes for a fresh and good air battle with helicopters.Be prepared for a short single player experience, so feel free to drag it out and not sprint the whole way through the game. My only criticism is of the General (Flag I think) 's character. The meddling top brass who doesn't know that he's sacrificing his men while not listening to those with their boots on the ground has been done, and adds no real depth to the game other than having an excuse to play as an army ranger.Advantages of the game:Action packed, fast paced and exciting singleplayer campaign.Great shooting, some moments of stealth interwined as well.Good controls for PC, which is not always the case for a lot of games released these days.Decent graphics.Story is acceptable, but the end is a little sad.Multiplayer is good and has more action than singleplayer.

As a soldier myself I really felt like I was back in Iraq(even though this takes place in Afghanistan) On several occasions I had to pause the campign because I had flashbacks.

												So I picked this game during the 75% off. I was like ""well it only costs me a meal so why not"".Not exactly something great to be honest, but decent enough I suppose.You actually play as 3 different characters, 2 Navy SEALs guys from 2 different team, and this Army Ranger. The whole story in Afghanistan actually somewhat connected these charactes. Like, the team Wolfpack helped the other team a few times, and the Rangers were sent to rescue the SEALs. You fought Talibans and stuff, I gotta say, story is a bit typical, but realistic, kinda sorta better than plots of Call of Duty I guess. But still, the story isn't hardhitting like Spec Ops The Line.Gameplay is solid enough, except the part where you and your men were outnumbered, low on ammo, yet you can still get a thousand of extra ammo for you 249. I mean, you folks are supposed to run out of ammo and almost being overrun by the enemies right?(Maybe it's just the normal difficulty?) Runs smoothly so it's acceptable.Well if the MP is still alive this may even be better, but for SP only, you may wanna pick it up during a sale.			"

												The original  Medal of Honor was once a shining example of the FPS genre when it was released on the Playstation back in '99. Shame the series hasn't really moved on much since then.The gameplay is reminiscent of the COD: Modern Warfare series but without the above average scripting, awesome set-pieces and graphical pizazz that makes them enjoyable. The characters are the same cardboard cut-out grunts with plastic personalities that we've seen so many times before and gameplay revolves around clearing endless rooms of stereotypical 'Axis of Evil' bad guys.  Other than an excellent soundtrack, there's not much to recommend about Medal of Honor, whilst they have their own faults, Battlefield 4 or any of the Modern Warfare games will give you a much better experience in terms of graphics, gameplay and overall enjoyment.  I hope that the series makes a decent comeback sometime soon but this game isn't it.			"

												Medal of Honor is a fantastic addition to the string of modern warfare first-person shooters (FPS). The narrative, while brief, is a worthwhile experience that will leave you gaping for more. The graphics, gameplay and sounds will fully immerse you into the battlefields of Afghanistan given the game's detailed atmosphere. However, it should be noted that the singleplayer (SP) and multiplayer (MP) do not utilize the same game engine. While the SP uses a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3, the MP half uses DICE's Frostbite engine from the Battlefield series. Regardless, both the SP and the MP are worth a thorough playthrough. Keep in mind, that there are two DLC packs--""Hot Zone"" and ""Clean Sweep""--that are available exclusively at EA's store and will be unlocked via your in-game persona using redeemable codes.			"

												Medal of Honor throws you straight into the boots of a bad♥♥♥♥♥SEAL team, part of a 4-man group. As the story develops you not only get to play as only one single charachter, but many, in many different situations. This is undoubtedly the game's strong point - giving us as players, the chance to relate to, and understand and feel for other charachters as well, something that lacks greatly in other major AAA-titles. Albeit the game takes on a different approach, contrasting their previous WW2-installments, this one, given its new take on the series, has its own share of pros and cons. As it's been mentioned, charachter development is top-notch, not to mention the awesome graphics (although the game was released back in 2014) which still looks good up to this day. Drawbacks are unfortuneately the multiplayer part, with its numerous glitches, bugs, annoying controls and frankly, the lack of interesting content to give a real gameplay value, hence the bad score. Though, it's mentionworthy to say that they tried. And it's gotten even more polished in the sequel, Warfighter (not available on Steam). Another drawback is the feeling of doing the same mission, over and over, close to becoming annoying, but it never get's there (although pretty close). Last but not least, don't expect any long single-player campaign. It might be a short story, totalling around 4-5 hours. But you're into one hell of a ride, so it's by no means an ""easy"" challenge, to say the least.I'll give this game 3 solid SEALS out of 5!			"

												SINGLE-PLAYER REVIEWFrom the serie that ""started it all"", that led the way for cinematic FPS games, I expected more than this. I played the whole MoH serie since the ps1 games, so I know how it was born and grew.The story is the usual, recycled, already seen soup, which is quite boring and you can skip with no regrets. The problem is that you can only skip movies and not cutsecenes, so if you want to replay the game, you'll have to watch them again and again, and they last for about 50% of the level time.The real problem is the gameplay, though. Being used to games that tells you everything you need to push in order to even move, so much that it gets annoying, I was surprised that this game tells you nothing at all. Well, it tells you what to push to move and jump, the basics that everyone already knows, but not how to use the special equipment you're supposed to use in the ""mini-games"". Ok, there's no mini-games here, but there's special sequences where you need to use a special binocular to mark targets for bombing, a sequence where you use the weaponry of an helicopter, and some sniper sequences. Well, on the first 2 modes you have more than 1 firing mode but the game doesn't tell you that, and you end up wondering why certain targets don't blow up, or why the game keeps telling you to do something that you're already doing.The actual FPS mode is sub-par, too. You can't choose what weapons you start the mission with, and you can only collect enemy weapons (not ammo to refill your one, unless it's the same model) or ask your friends for ammo, if they use the same one as yours.The action has so many little breaks because you either have to climb a 1.5 meters step with the help of a teammate, something exploded near you and you take a whole 15 seconds to get on your feet again, a whole lot of enemies arrived at a near position (so it's better to just look at them instead of firing, right?), the teammates has something to tell you, and so on. It's frustrating. The fact that the game is also an on-rail shooter, with no space for exploration and only one way from point a to point b, makes the SP experience feel so restricting and unsatisfying, that the fact that it only last 3 hours won't bother you so much at the end.Yes, you've read it right, 3 hours. That is about how much it took me to complete this game.It wasn't even so much fun for those 3 hours. The game plays the compassion card for all the soldiers that actually went into those places, risking their life for our freedom. Well I'm sorry, but there's already movies for that and when I buy a game I want a game, not a barely interactive movie. I'm sorry for those people and I really appreciate their work, and I think it's not honest to use their sacrifice to make bad games.The only thing that barely saves this game from being a complete disaster are the graphics. I get a solid 60fps in full-hd and everything at max, with vsync on, but it only looks good during daylight missions (like with most games anyway), and even there there's part of the graphics that is too blocky and/or has bad textures, but it's overall pretty good looking.The audio is a mess, though. The sound can barely be heard and you have to increase the volume at almost maximum in your audio equipment.Oh yeah, there's an additional game mode in SP, where you fight your way in a selected level for leaderboard score. Such fun.If only they added coop, that could have marginally saved this terrible game, but as it is, it's the usual EA game: just bad.			"

												It's shocking to me how hyped this game was, and how terrible it is. This game is generic to the max. It's like they looked at Battlefield and Call of Duty, distilled the basic features out of them, and stripped out any unique or iconic gameplay. It really feels like CoD with less recoil and no soul.I've tried both multiplayer and the campaign, but I'll be mostly reviewing the campaign. One thing I'll say about multiplayer - unless they've changed this, snipers start with no scopes, and you have to spend two hours getting spawn-killed and shooting one enemy per life to earn a crappy scope.Again, the campaign is uber-generic. You are a soldier in a special ops unit. You get briefed on objectives you don't care about, and are thrown into some fighting. Your guns have no recoil. Occasionally you get a slow-motion event.The missions aren't even put together well. There is a sniping mission where you work alongside a veteran sniper, an obvious attempt to copy the flashback mission in Modern Warfare, but executed so badly you'll be failing repeatedly while trying to figure out what he wants you to do. Everything has an extremely linear layout, but there are couple of places where it's still easy to get lost because the level doesn't flow well.Several missions are extremely frustrating or repetitive, or both. One mission has you sniping enemy soldiers on a hill. They're pretty far away, in some trees, and you can't see jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ You sit there and wait for your spotter to call out someone, try in vain to figure out where the target is, and then lose. But in the end you'll get it down because they keep spawning at a handful of locations.The most memorable moment for me was a mission where I was halfway through the level, and a scripted event had us pinned down by enemy MGs. An ally ordered me to provide covering fire with my own light MG so they could move up. But... I dropped my MG at the beginning of the level for a different weapon. So I tried to provide covering fire with my AK. Over and over. Time after time, I wasted entire magazines, but my allies didn't do anything. I tried shooting the enemy gunners, which should have been easy because they weren't very far away, but they were invulnerable. I looked all around the area but there was no LMG available. Finally I realized I could try to pop a grenade in the MG nest. That took a few tries to do without dying, but when I finally got a grenade in there, I was rewarded with... nothing.They seriously made a scripted event halfway through the level where you have to have an LMG to continue, but don't force you to keep the LMG from the beginning of the level and don't give you one when you need it. I had to replay the entire level with the LMG just to be able to pass that part.♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design.			"

												EA's attempt to resurrect the Medal of Honor series by tapping into the modern war such as the fight in Afghanistan is almost universally judged as an also-ran that failed to distinguish itself from its chief rival, the COD: Modern Warfare series. And after playing it I can see why. The SP portion was designed apart from the MP portion (by different teams, even) and never quite tightly integrated. The SP campaign went for authenticity by recording actual soldiers and model missions that they went on, albeit somewhat dramatised, but the result, while authentic, seem to lack the ""punch"" or the dramatic tension that MW seem to deliver. The authenticity also reduced the enemy into ragtag group of poorly armed peasants that relied on numbers that just got lucky by pure amount of lead flying in your direction. You play several different people with bare transition between them which adds a bit to the confusion. All in all, the SP campaign offered all sorts of challenges, from standard cover shooter with flanking to rail-shooter sequence (the gunship sequence), to sniper alley (aka Whack-a-mole) to stealth escape, and turret defense (shoot anything that comes down that mountain). But it is primarily a shooter, albeit a rather... derivative one that broke no grounds.			"

												I was bored one afternoon and decided to give Medal Of Honor a shot as I really enjoyed the Mutiplayer Beta but was in the mood for a single player game. I expected to spend 15 minutes playing and then go on to something else. What I found was something amazing.MoH's single player is gritty and real. It embodies the harshness of the conflict and twines together the story of different squads interacting in the Afghan conflict perfectly. One moment you are waiting for evac and helicopters clear out the landing zone and then break off to hit another target - to which you transition to the next mission as that helicopter gunner.The audio is visceral. I got shot at in a village and flinched when a metal wall next to me was peppered with bullets. I can't remember the last time I've reacted to a game in such a way - and that is a great thing.MoH is a complete experience. I wish it lasted longer as I was able to complete the campaign in around 6 hours but it was worth every minute.			"

The game burned down similarily to that of the Hindenburg, and it was pretty.Now it's still not a bad game, there's usually 2 or 3 games going on at a given time... because of that it feels like a secret society.

												The only Medal of Honor i've really played apart from a really old on on the PS1 when i was a kid. I enjoyes this as well as it's multiplayer. It's multiplayer is similar to Battle Field. Single Player has amazing story line and fun game play. I bought this game on Humble Bundle so it was worth it for me. The Multiplayer is near dead and there are very few servers left. If  you want the game it's mainly for the 4 hour Single player experience which is amazing but not really worth $20 and doesn't really have much replay value. You can end with the smallest bit of cover left because of destructable terain and fight over heaps of taliban. I love FPSGood Storyline and game play 8/10			"

												Awesome game!  Great SP campaign.  Play as a Ranger, Delta Force operator or a Navy SEAL DEVGRU operator.  The SP campaign is also very realistic.  Realistic weapons and tactics.  MP is done by DICE and feels like a mix of BC2 and MW2.			"

												I first played this game and hated it I must say. But then I decided to reinstall it and give it a shot, mainly because I was a huge fan of the old Medal of Honor games and because I felt like I was being mean to the game itself. What can I say? It is definitely not the best FPS I ever played but still, I found it is a good one, decent story, decent setting and overall in my honest opinion, a great soundtrack. The graphics look kinda nice for a game of 2010, specially coming from DICE. But the only thing that I kinda found weird was the shooting, the mouse moved really weird and the guns themselves were okayish, some of them had a nice and decent kick to them when you fired but I got the feeling that firing from the hip worked every single time, specially when spraying. That said, I'd say that you should probably give it a try if you're a fan of the old Medal of Honor games or if you're just bored someday.			"

												EA's attempt to resurrect the Medal of Honor series by tapping into the modern war such as the fight in Afghanistan is almost universally judged as an also-ran that failed to distinguish itself from its chief rival, the COD: Modern Warfare series. And after playing it I can see why. The SP portion was designed apart from the MP portion (by different teams, even) and never quite tightly integrated. The SP campaign went for authenticity by recording actual soldiers and model missions that they went on, albeit somewhat dramatised, but the result, while authentic, seem to lack the ""punch"" or the dramatic tension that MW seem to deliver. The authenticity also reduced the enemy into ragtag group of poorly armed peasants that relied on numbers that just got lucky by pure amount of lead flying in your direction. You play several different people with bare transition between them which adds a bit to the confusion. All in all, the SP campaign offered all sorts of challenges, from standard cover shooter with flanking to rail-shooter sequence (the gunship sequence), to sniper alley (aka Whack-a-mole) to stealth escape, and turret defense (shoot anything that comes down that mountain). But it is primarily a shooter, albeit a rather... derivative one that broke no grounds.			"

												It's shocking to me how hyped this game was, and how terrible it is. This game is generic to the max. It's like they looked at Battlefield and Call of Duty, distilled the basic features out of them, and stripped out any unique or iconic gameplay. It really feels like CoD with less recoil and no soul.I've tried both multiplayer and the campaign, but I'll be mostly reviewing the campaign. One thing I'll say about multiplayer - unless they've changed this, snipers start with no scopes, and you have to spend two hours getting spawn-killed and shooting one enemy per life to earn a crappy scope.Again, the campaign is uber-generic. You are a soldier in a special ops unit. You get briefed on objectives you don't care about, and are thrown into some fighting. Your guns have no recoil. Occasionally you get a slow-motion event.The missions aren't even put together well. There is a sniping mission where you work alongside a veteran sniper, an obvious attempt to copy the flashback mission in Modern Warfare, but executed so badly you'll be failing repeatedly while trying to figure out what he wants you to do. Everything has an extremely linear layout, but there are couple of places where it's still easy to get lost because the level doesn't flow well.Several missions are extremely frustrating or repetitive, or both. One mission has you sniping enemy soldiers on a hill. They're pretty far away, in some trees, and you can't see jack♥♥♥♥♥♥ You sit there and wait for your spotter to call out someone, try in vain to figure out where the target is, and then lose. But in the end you'll get it down because they keep spawning at a handful of locations.The most memorable moment for me was a mission where I was halfway through the level, and a scripted event had us pinned down by enemy MGs. An ally ordered me to provide covering fire with my own light MG so they could move up. But... I dropped my MG at the beginning of the level for a different weapon. So I tried to provide covering fire with my AK. Over and over. Time after time, I wasted entire magazines, but my allies didn't do anything. I tried shooting the enemy gunners, which should have been easy because they weren't very far away, but they were invulnerable. I looked all around the area but there was no LMG available. Finally I realized I could try to pop a grenade in the MG nest. That took a few tries to do without dying, but when I finally got a grenade in there, I was rewarded with... nothing.They seriously made a scripted event halfway through the level where you have to have an LMG to continue, but don't force you to keep the LMG from the beginning of the level and don't give you one when you need it. I had to replay the entire level with the LMG just to be able to pass that part.♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design.			"

												Medal Of Honor has the worst online multiplayer I have ever played. Dozens of spawnrapers, campers and snipers. You can only survive by moving cover to cover with the help of smoke grenades. Otherwise you get a sniper's bullet in your head. Therefore it is a slow paced game so if you like fast gameplay and adrenaline rushes, buy a Call of Duty title instead. However, if you want to entertain yourself with the game's Single Player , then go ahead and buy it. Along with the brilliant storyline, it has beautiful graphics and weapon physics and surprisingly clever AI. The only bad thing i can say about the SP is its length. It took me around 3 hours to complete on the hardest difficulty level. Otherwise it's the best singleplayer i have played in years!!			"

												I got this from a Humble Bundle, and I always liked the games they selected for being included in a bundle. It's the first Medal of Honor I played, and I must say it has lessened my respect for all parties involved, including Humble for giving this more attention than it deserves.This game doesn't have any redeeming qualities I could come up with. Gameplay is bad, execution is bad, pacing is bad, sound design is bad, everything else is bad. It's just junk, and it reminded me why I was reluctant to play war shooters in the first place. You can feel that they tried pretty hard to clone Call of Duty (I mean, just look at the title, duh). Even the description on Steam is involuntarily hilarious. ""...a relatively unknown entity of handpicked warriors""? Who writes stuff like that with a straight face?It's a persiflage of its own subject matter. The realistic enactment of war simply shouldn't be treated in a way like this, it's inadvertently offensive and cheap. Although I feel bad for giving a bad review for a game I paid almost zero $ for, I'm still desperate to warn everyone about giving this game a chance. If you have to, take Call of Duty on for another playthrough, it's still better after the third time than this is during any given 30 minutes of its awful campaign.Please note that I never played any Medal of Honor multiplayer, it may well be its singular redeeming quality, since there must be a reason for it to exist at all. So there. Hope you didn't buy this at anything more than a dollar.			"

												Medal of Honor (2010) actually wasn't as bad as the reviews for it were. I remember the largest criticism being in the choice to be able to play as the Taliban in the multiplayer. I didn't play the multiplayer, so that hasn't hindered my review of this game.In this reboot of the classic WWII series, the game is set in Afghanistan in very late 2001 and March 2002; being loosely based on Operation Anaconda, more specifically, the Battle of Shah-i-Kot and Battle of Takur Ghar. Takur Ghar is a mountain in the Shah-i-Kot Valley in Southeast Afghanistan where, at the time, Taliban and Chechan forces had dug themselves in with well over 500 forces encamped throughout the region. The game's plot revolves around a number of soldiers from the Navy SEALs and various regiments from the US Army, such as the US Rangers and the Aviation Regiment. While a number of the characters don't actually meet, they help each other out at certain points during the game, like at one point, the Rangers are pinned down and the Aviation forces swing in to help them out. Then you take over as the Aviation team to sweep the area. The story is rather simple, sweep the area of enemy forces and, at times, the Navy SEALs are actually gathering intelligence, scouting forces ahead for the Army. Not an amazing story, but the amount of research the team put forward when it came to the accuracy of how many casualties were actually lost on the US side during the battles and the specific locations and tracking the troops movement from real life to fiction was neat. Basically, I applaud the effort with the research even if the story is dry.Technical side, the games graphics are nice, but the AI on your side can get stuck at points and you might have to reload to a prior checkpoint, or worse, restart the whole level, that happened once. Some of the shadows bug out, but it wasn't that noticeable. Sound design is nice. Orchestra score is good, my only complaint that actually annoyed me was the soundtrack with like, Linkin Park. I hate Linkin Park. Seriously.My only other serious complaint is that at some points of the game, apparently every muslim is an enemy and end up being killed by the US Army. Sure enough, in the game, everone you encounter is an enemy except from the first mission where you drive through a town and see some people, like the guy herding his goats across the street. It was a pretty big village and maybe I half expected to see a woman or child out in the streets, but there weren't any, so it became apparent that everyone you'd encountered at that point would become your enemy, which was very much the case. There wasn't any perspective as to who the civilians were or could be. And even the Northern Alliance, the Afghan army that the US had allied with, barely make an appearance. Instead, they're friendly fired upon by an angry guy in Langley. That was just like a WTF moment. I know some of that happened in real life, but it seemed a bit overkill here.Still, a few minor complaints from an overall good FPS.8.0/10			"

												Download Size: Less than 9 gigabytesPlaytime: Less than 6 hours for single playerMedal of Honor (2010) was my intro to modern First Person Shooter games, so I go back and play it once in a while.  Despite the fact that the game plays nearly identically to the Call of Duty Modern Warfare games, Medal of Honor is actually from EA (makers of Battlefield). If you have this game, you probably got it as part of the Humble Origin Bundle from a year or so back (bunch of great games in that one). Like the Call of Duty games, MOH is split into Multiplayer and Single player installations, which means you can download just one or the other if you’re only planning to play through the campaign (like me). There is a separate Steam entry for each.The story of MOH follows a couple of Navy Seal teams in Afghanistan trying to root out Al Qaida / Taliban soldiers, mostly taking place in the mountains. You also switch to playing a member of a squad of Army Rangers for a couple of missions, and see the war from a different perspective. MOH is very story driven, and since you’re almost always in a squad, you can count on the other members of your team to support you when you’re under heavy fire. However if you get shot enough you’ll die and reload the checkpoint. Your team doesn’t “revive” you like in some other squad based games (Payday, Left 4 Dead). Gameplay is very much like Call of Duty Modern Warfare where you’re supposed to do most of the heavy lifting while the rest of your team kind of picks off a few enemies occasionally and provides ammo.MOH has the regenerating health system as expected in most modern first person shooters, with the screen edges turning red as you are taking damage and then clearing up if you don’t get shot for a few seconds. This means that a lot of the time you can risk making a run without cover and take some hits as long as you don’t die. You can also pick up the weapons of fallen enemies, though you should almost always keep your primary assault rifle (with the silencer when available).  An interesting gameplay element as mentioned above is that if you run low on ammo, you can always ask a computer controlled squad mate for more. I don’t remember this being available in many other first person games.Pros:+Pretty good graphics and engrossing story. If you like Call of Duty type shooter games, you should like MOH. I believe the game’s story is based on actual events.+A lot of gameplay variety. You can occasionally control aerial bombardment (as an attack helicopter pilot) or heavy direct fire aircraft (blowing up stuff with big guns!). The sniper/stealth sections are fun as well.Cons:-The game is really short. It can take less than 5 hours to beat the campaign if you’ve played the game before. For a game this short it takes up a lot of hard drive space.-There is at least 1 mission where it can be difficult to tell where you’re supposed to go. Your squad leader gives you an order and it isn’t immediately obvious what you’re supposed to do. Also, more than once I got stuck due to a game bug where an event didn’t trigger the way it was supposed to (marking a spot for air strike).Overall Medal of Honor is a fun game to go through in a weekend, and get a feel for what highly trained combat soldiers have to do for a living. If you’ve seen the recent Mark Wahlberg movie “Lone Survivor” this game has a similar feel (elite soldiers surrounded by enemies).Sequel info:MOH Warfighter is exclusive to EA Origin (no Steam version). I got my copy as a physical DVD so I didn’t have to go through the process of downloading it through Origin.Install size: Less than 20 gigabytesPlaytime: about 6 hours for single playerIn Warfighter, you play a new member of the same group of Navy Seals as in the first game, but with a few new additions to your team. The action takes place in several regions all over the world (Philippines, Middle East, etc.) unlike the first game, where you were in Afghanistan the whole time. There are also a bunch of cutscenes following a few characters in their “off-duty” life in the United States (kind of boring). The general plot of the game though, is chasing down terrorists before they execute their complicated plans of blowing stuff up.The game is very similar to the first MOH (as expected) and  it uses the Frostbite 2 game engine, which was featured in Battlefield 3. The graphics are VERY good and almost photo realistic at times. Unfortunately, this means that some computers may not be able to run the game at a decent frame rate. I found an issue where I would have horribly low frames per second at certain parts of the game, and it turned out that it was due to Origin downloading free map packs in the background (Zero Dark Thirty map pack was about 900 megabytes). When I stopped the downloads the game sped up. If you liked MOH1, you’ll like Warfighter. "

												In honor to the franchise which I thought was decent, I highly recommend MOH.  The gameplay feels authentic and real.  Your in real world locations and fighting alondside actual US military.  The games unique gameplay in authenticity is what I like most.  Yes it is a far cry from COD and multiplayer is not great, but the short single player campaign is worth a run.The graphics are excellent for 2010 and the geography is realistic.  It is a linear game though so not much exploring.  The sound design is impressive, the guns and firefights sound very realistic.  The radio chatter is all authentic military, be it somewhat pervassive language.  You feel like part of the team.  The ending was a nice touch, I salute the men and women who have to encounter these real world scenarios and I think the game gives you a sense of what it is all about.There will be no more MOH (EA pulled the plug on franchise) and maybe players did not get that this was not trying to be COD, thats what BF3 is for or maybe they felt it was very short which it is.  Bottom line is for a game of this quality and if on sale I would recommend picking it up.  Cheers to MOH, always liked this games style even if it was not that popular.✓Recommended			"

												Medal of Honor is a great title, a realistic and epic take on the war in Afghanistan, but it is a little too short, just 5 hours for an incredible experience, that will push you through a breathtaking journey in the most dangerous valleys of Afghanistan. It also has an interesting hard-core single player mode, and a well-made multiplayer. 8/10			"

												An enjoyable gritty and realistic FPS. Only a couple of downers with this game; 1:You play the part of too many characters, so the plot can get a little confusing if you don't play the game in one sitting. 2: It all ended rather abuptly, i didn't even realize i was playing the end level until the credits came rolling up.

												In Medal of Honor, brotherhood is an unspoken bond of trust and companionship through acts of honor where failing to leave a soldier behind isn’t an option and risking one’s life for the fate of another is common. The idea of brotherhood created Medal of Honor’s storyline, and it is the best storyline I have ever played in a tactical FPS thus far. Just like any FPS fan, I too become overly ecstatic about this genre: I can talk hours upon hours about it, give you my critical opinions down to exquisite detail, and discuss creative and strategic ways to deceive opponents online. And so, I wasn’t expecting much out of Medal of Honor considering how popular titles like Modern Warfare 2 have already set a nearly untouchable standard for the FPS genre, and I couldn’t foresee any title that was able to compete with that.However, none have captured a story which is deep enough to really connect the player to the game’s storyline... until now. Although incredibly short, MoH’s campaign is done well and that’s an understatement. You play three different roles: Rabbit and Deuce, who are Tier 1 operatives, and Dante Adams, who is an Army Ranger. Usually, players are not able to become attached to the characters when the protagonist switches too many times and too quickly. But here, it works because it follows the concept of brotherhood mentioned above, covering what other popular shooters are missing in their campaign: a theme and the consistency of building a story around that theme.Furthermore, you’re thrown into a variety of scenarios. Everything that you could possibly imagine that takes place in a war is in MoH’s single-player campaign, such as being ambushed by waves of enemies or being nearly obliterated by a hidden bomb. And what would you do if you jumped out of a helicopter and only had your knife as a weapon? It’s full of intense action through and through—enough that you don’t want to put the controller down.Second, the game’s details are remarkable: Dust from the ground spits up from bullet fire, strobes continuously flash on your teammate’s shoulder when you switch to night-vision indicating who is a friendly, and even the sound of gunfire is different depending on where you are. Inside a wrecked plane, the bullets from a light machine gun has a tin-like sound with a subtle echo. Little details like these make you feel like you’re in a realistic battle.Another feature that emphasizes realism is the communication between you and your AI teammates. Throughout the story, you’re directly spoken to and you’re given orders without any abrupt pop-up hints of where to go next. You’ll hear things like, “Rabbit, take the path at your six…” and “Go loud on Rabbit”, indicating what your next move should be. This is extremely effective since you learn to listen closely as well as learn how to be part of a team, making you much more involved in the combat.Once you finish the campaign, Tier 1 mode is unlocked, where you aim to beat a level within a given time. That’s not all: There aren’t any checkpoints, so if you die, you start over; health regenerates slower; auto-aim assist and weapon’s crosshairs are disabled; and you cannot resupply on ammo from your allies. And need I emphasize the time limit? If you execute “skill kills”, like headshots and melee kills, then the clock temporarily stops. If the level is completed successfully, you earn a spot on the global leaderboards.Despite how amazing the story is, there are several flaws in its gameplay. There are few texture problems where some buildings or environments take time to load while AI characters, who are standing in place, shift abruptly. As for the AI, my teammates at times ran into my line of fire - I promise I was not actually shooting them. And the enemy AI is not much of a concern as they are terribly predictable. In turn, they do become challenging to fight against on certain levels where they attack in groups or waves. My AI teammates despite being drawn to my line of fire are also very effective in killing the enemy without any of my help.Medal of Honor’s minor weakness is its multiplayer. There are five different modes, three of which are objective-based: capturing and defending different points on the map. The other two consists of team deathmatch and hardcore. And let's not even go through the whole Taliban/Opposing Forces thing, or this review will never end. Just like single campaign, teamwork is crucial especially in objective games, like Objective Raid, where your goal is to defend two bases from the opposing team who has a goal to arm it and destroy it. In order to defend both bases, your team must spread out or the match could end in less than a minute. The gameplay itself is entertaining especially considering that several playlists offer up to 24 players, but just like the game modes, the maps lack variety. There are eight in total and they feature valleys, mountains, and marketplaces, which more or less look the same to me, and they all feature a monochromatic scenery, making the maps rather bland. I couldn’t understand how the single campaign has such diverse terrain with colorful scenery while the maps in multiplayer do not.Like I said in the beginning, I wasn’t expecting much out of Medal of Honor, but I was more than satisfied. While the multiplayer has its cons, it definitely has potential to be built into something more. The single-player campaign is enough to hold anyone through a gripping story with non-stop and fast-paced action and a trio of compelling characters. I should also mention that MoH is dedicated to America’s servicemen and I think it’s a job well done, no matter what the military bases say. Medal of Honor is one game you should be playing and one game that is now in competition with the rest.			"

												Good ambientation ruined by some technical issues.I got this game from the Origin Humble Bundle. Even though the bundle was completely worth buying it, installing this game wasn't. I have only played the single player game which runs on a different engine than the multiplayer's but I won't bother with it.Story wise, it is a short campaign (4-5h at max) with no replayability because everything is so lineal that apart from beautiful enviroments it doesn't have enough motivation to even finish it.The single player uses a console-like FOV and there is no way to change it. It feels zoomed (like if you play the whole game looking through a scope) and therefore it's very uncomfortable to play for more than 20min.Another negative point is mouse sensitivity. By default, MOH has mouse acceleration set to true which you can change but there is also some weird thing about sensitivity. Even on the lowest setting your aim moves faster than most people would desire. You can lower your dpi to solve this if you have a margin for that, obviously.Overall you're better off watching a movie like Black Hawk Down or Lone Survivor if you want some action.			"

Edit 4-8-15Okay so I redownloaded the game tried it out again played through 4 or 5 missions yeah ok it's a good shooter but not as good as the other medal of honor titles I have played and so maybe I was expecting a little more out of this one. but you have to admit the gameplay is a little like a point and click 1990 game.  I'm getting a steady 60 fps. in some places yes the graphics still don't impress me any I was hoping it would be better. on the Airport map the graphics looked so awesome but that's it so far. okay so I'm changing my Thumbs down to a thumbs up.

												I don't really know how to describe this game. It's similar to a rail shooter, while at the same time having ""I don't know where to go moments"", as well as artificial difficulty. While being ridiculously simple, and yet still can't say it's not entertaining.So, that play time is (one) play-through. Yes, I beat the game. At some points I didn't even move my reticul, I just shot straight at a spawn point while enemies funneled into my scope. If your lazy, you can just let your teammate shoot everyone, that works pretty well too.Not sure there is much else to say, you load it up, kill the entire population of Afghanistan, the story goes sideways, then it ends, abruptly. Apparently this was EAs first foray into making a COD clone, and they consider the game a ""stepping stone"". For me it is legitimately the first example of a ""so bad it's good"" game. Like, now were in a helicopter! Now were sniping with a 50 cal! Now were getting ambushed! Now were on the slip and slide! It's strange enough to be intriguing.			"

												I have no idea why I'm rating this as positive, since this game has so many flaws it's incredible. It has some nice pros but it is FAR out weighed by its cons.Pros : -Some of the best 2010 graphics. Still competes with todays graphics. -Solid Sound ( No doubt the strong in this game, coming in with an overal 9.5-10/10 IMO )-Decent singleplayer storyline-Vehicles ( Very VERY few )-Fairly well optimized-Doesnt require a high spec rig-Cheap-Doesn't require Origin-Not buggy-Weapon customization ( Barely any, but still )-Killstreaks-Anticheat ( Not the best but it gets the job done )-Not alot hackers ( due to the fact that most servers are dedicated with admins kicking )-The perfect niche between Call of Duty and BattlefieldCons:-Some of the worst map design I've seen in a while. Yes ; The maps are worse then Call of Duty maps.-Lack of killstreaks ( It is a good thing that the game has them; but the few ones it has are EXTREMLY similiar. )-12 Year old community who hackusate everyone on the team for aimbotting or kids who ♥♥♥♥ your mom.-Absoulutely horrendous spawns / spawn system. This NEEDS to be revamped.-Did I mention the maps?-Nade spam-Rocket spam ( 3/4 of my deaths at the end of the game are to rockets and or nades alone. This NEEDS to be fixed. )-Dying playerbase ( There are a couple servers everyday so that is good / nice, however most will be high ping since there's so few.-9/10 servers will be high ping due to the fact that there are so few servers and the chances of ya living close are so slim-The nade spam makes Call of Duty look like a good game-Crappy looking UI-Lack of gun diversity-Crap gun customization-Little to no vehicles.-It's a little grindy.-Few maps-No medic / ammo classes like in Battlefield-Few gamemodes-The worst netcode I've ever seen in my life. If you thought Battlefield 4 has a rough release, youre in for a treat. This netcode is easily twice as bad. Imagine Battlefield 4's netcode on release with 1500 Ping... This is it. On top of that, you will usally get 50-200 MS ping per server.The reason why this game is recommended by me is because it's so cheap it's worth a buy; IF you manage to find a copy under 10$. Personally, I got a copy for 0.98 $ and I would be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥if I got it for 1.98$However, for 0.98$, it is worth every single penny for all the times you die due to♥♥♥♥♥♥netcode, high ping, terrible map design, nade spam, rocket spam, by the same two guns the game offers, and due to ridiculous killstreaks.If you are into Call of Duty and or Battlefield and want to try something different this is a must buy.

												If you’re looking for a new campaign to crunch through, Medal of Honor (2010) will do for an evening. The campaign is serviceable, but very short. Some of the intros to missions are incredibly long and unskippable, which kills the replayability a bit. This also doesn’t leave much of the game left to actually play. The parts you do get to play are along very narrow buildings, valleys, etc. It’s a good campaign to play through once, but there are only one or two missions that are actually replay-worthy on their own.The characters all have cool sounding callsigns, but you’ll not really remember who is who, and they all become interchangeable.I’m hesitant to call any shooter video game “realistic”, but I’d say Medal of Honor comes closer than the other big names in the market right now.I personally enjoyed the soundtrack a lot, and found it added a lot to the game. I even purchased it separately.Lastly, one thing that swung my view of this game far into the positive (for me) was that the developers know bullet math. Most shooters acknowledge that if you have not emptied a magazine, then you don’t need to chamber a fresh round when reloading, YET the number of rounds available will only be those of the magazine. This is just a little pet peeve of mine, so I was super happy when I noticed that in Medal of Honor, the extra round is maintained when reloading.  Good job developers. Now why did that disappear in Warfighter?Anyhow, while I personally enjoyed this game, I have unique tastes, and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to a “general” gamer.			"

												No game can be what it is really like. However this game to me is a great make. Medal of Honor brought their kind of ""Modern Warfare"" to the table. I read all of these negative reviews but at least in this game we are fighting against Americas real enemy, terrorism. Here we dont see our nation being torn apart by Russia like in Call of Duty. This game brings you an experience I seem to feel is similar to the movie ""Act of Valor"". The high speed and precise actions that you as the player need to make, that quick head shot while breaching a room has not been as satisfying in any other game to me but this one. Military experience backing me on this no game is real, not one no matter Arma or anything. Games are meant to be theactical and this game is worth the money, I bought it after reading all the other negative posts about it and I am very glad I did.			"

												Entertaining shooter on rails, but a little short (5 hours on ""hard""). The missions are diverse, as soldier in the field or aboard a helicopter. There are enough weapons to choose from and the handling and sounds are all very satisfying. The AI of enemies and your squad is not that awesome. My allies often walked in front of my gun causing friendly fire, which was a bit annoying. The voice acting, graphics and animations are all very nice, especially the soldier from the cover art (can't recall his name, maybe Voodoo?) is a real badass.7/10			"

												It's hard to offer something new in this kind of games but, although it is one out of a hundred  of similar games, I'm having fun playing it. It might get too lineal at some points and you may observe some lack of movement freedom sometimes. The story it tells could be better and more involving too. As I said, it doesn't offer anything new and it's not the best game I've ever played, but you can still enjoy playing it.			"

												I went into Medal of Honor expecting another gritty, brown, cover-shooting FPS, clicking away until the brown terrorist hiding behind brown rocks stop moving. What you get is, well, that but not nearly as deary and grinding as I had anticipated and even did some things pretty well. Maybe it's because it's been a few years since I've played a single player modern military shooter.First off, the campaign is head scratchingly short. For a series that has always focused on single player it's a little puzzling that so much time and money was put into a 3-5 hour campaign. That being said, short is better than long and grindy. There is a good mix of stealth based and all out war game play, with vehicle and sniper sections scattered through out that keep things fresh. You jump between three view points that tie together nicely whcih prevents the transitions from being jarring. One of the things that I thought they did well was conveying the uncertainty of who is a target and who is a civilian, or even a friendly. I do think they missed an opportunity to put those decisions on the player, as most of those situations occur in either scripted sections or cut scenes, but still, it didn't go unnoticed.There were a few more details that helped lift this game a bit above mediocre. The guns felt varied and solid, although the shotgun is overpowered, and headshots look and sound satisfying. My favorite detail was the sound design. There's this really cool thing when you're standing near a squad member who's speaking and you can hear their voice both through the radio and normally. It doesn't actually effect anything but it's a nice detail that's realistic and helps with immersion and makes me wonder why I haven't heard it in more games.There's no reason to run out and buy this at full price but if modern FPSs are your thing or you get the chance at a good price it's worth a quick play through. A note on the value: I didn't play more than just loading into a couple of games but the multiplayer is still up and running and there were players. You may need to go into the settings file and force the DirectX to version 9. There's also what they call Tier 1 mode which is just leader boards for completing the campaign levels while hitting or beating various statistical goals (time, accuracy, melee kills, etc).			"

												while there was only a few bugs, the new Medal of Honor game was horrible. I found that in several parts of the game you didnt even need to shoot the game would just “choo choo” tug along in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cliche’d story. And at no point did the game make me adapt or did it change in any way i literally just sat behind cover headshotting any dumbass who popped out of cover with my LITERALLY INFINITE AMMO. and when i wasnt doing that is was using or on some incredibly powerful weapon laying waste to anything that had so much as a pulse and wasnt white. It was kind of unsettling it all felt like some creepy power trip some criminally insane person would have before committing a mass murder. AND THERE WAS LITERALLY LIKE 8? WEAPONS IN THE STORY MODE?? AND YOUR STARTING GEAR WAS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE SAME WEAPON? AN AUTOMATIC WITH AN ACOG. oh maybe your offhand is a shotgun or something at time but the ♥♥♥♥in M4 or whatever that tacticool SEAL guy was using were pretty much the same gun. AND THE STORY IS LIKE EXACLTY LIKE MW2 (SPOILER) MAIN CHARACTER DIES AS YOU PLAY AS STATIC MAIN CHARACTER 2. i was shocked as i finished the game, DUMBFOUNDED as the credits began to roll. IT ROMANTICIZED WAR AND THE MILITARY LIFE SO MUCH. SURE ITS NOT A BAD THING BUT WAR IS ♥♥♥♥ING WAR OK THERES NOTHING PRETTY ABOUT IT. i honestly think this game is ♥♥♥♥ing dangerous. not like how the ♥♥♥♥ing media paints GTAIV to teach kids to kill but this game says WAR IS FUN, YOULL MAKE GOOD FRIENDS, AND EVERYONE WILL RESPECT YOU, KILL BROWN PEOPLE. This game felt like a ♥♥♥♥ing social experiment and i paid way too much for it (Humble Bundle $1)			"

												Awful graphics, boring story, terrible controls, the game feels like a cheap Call of Duty clone. Pure garbage at its finest. The single player is terrible, and I don't think I've ever seen a game misuse an engine to such an extent. All the animations are trash and feel out of place to boot. Speaking of boots, kicking open doors feels like you're playing Crysis in the nano suit kicking bunnies. Seriously, the doors just fly open like they've been glued to the hinges. Everything in the game just feels wrong, from the aiming to the strange movement. Leaning seems to consist of you standing on one foot at a 90 degree angle while keeping your chin aligned to the ground. In no way worth the money. It's almost as bad as EA. 0/10. Almost.			"

												I was enjoying the first couple hours of this game. Then the arbitrary, no matter what you do you're screwed plots began, intermixed with the cliche'd slow-motion ""You just got blown up"" scenes. I despise linear games with predestined outcomes, and I really hate getting deep into a game, then no matter how well I play, or even how poorly, my character is destined to be captured/killed/blown-up/eaten by aliens, etc. I played all of the original MOH games years ago. I have to say I'm not impressed with how this one has evolved to become like COD, a bunch of short chapters played by different characters with different names.  That being said, the game doesn't suck. It's just written like many games are these days. ""We want you to see how GREAT we are at plots, so we're going to force your character into mandatory actions"".  Oh and, as for the flamers and fan-boys who can't bear to hear any negative comments, blow me! I paid my money, I'm entitled to my opinion. I've been gaming for 30 years so I think I've seen enough games to differentiate between good, mediocre and bad. I'll still give this a thumbs-up, but the game could definitely be better.  If you like games with areas that are like the old side-scrollers, then you won't mind sitting back for anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes as your character does things that you can't control. As for me, I think it REALLY interrupts the gameplay. I doubt I'll by MOH Airborne on steam. I have it on DVD, and I really don't want to see what they've done to it.			"

												(mini-review)A forgettable, throw-away campaign that does too much to mimic CoD and Battlefield, married to a ghost-town multiplayer landscape.  It's not that the game is bad per-se or that fun can't be had from the positively short singleplayer campaign (4.5 hours!), but it doesn't do anything new and what it does do is mediocre at best.  You can find better examples of this genre in Steam and the multiplayer is officially unplayable with so few people actually frequenting its servers.Save up and get yourself some CoD variant. You'll be happier.6/10.			"

At the end, (not gonna spoil it) I felt so empty and desperate that I let my keyboard and mouse down and just looked at my screen until the end of the cutscene. This is the first time that I'm liking an EA game. If you're thinking to yourself, ""Should I buy this or another game?"", f*ck that other game, buy this immediately and play. It has a rather short playtime but you still can buy the sequel Warfighter after you finish this. I haven't played Warfighter yet but I'm pretty sure they can't destroy this beautiful game with a f*cked up sequel. The game made me feel 4 emotions at the same time, sadness, helplessness, hatred and fury. My favourite characters were Deuce and Rabbit. Conclusion ; BUY THIS GAME WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT AND PLAY IT BEFORE YOU CRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP.			"

Your enemies will hide behind every corner and let their heads away from the cover so you can shot them.The game is so boring cause of the repetitiveness, you just walk into the room and shoot about 4 enemies there, then you wait for your team mates to come and regroup around the door and sometimes they let you kick the door which is the best feature in the game. Team mates are just a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥cause they wont shot anybody yet they talk trash all the time.Also it feels so sterile while you dont have anything to decide about. Everything is straight lined and you just have to follow the rules, there is no other way. You simply go through 3 meters wide corridor, shoot 5 enemies, wait for your team mate to do something and then repeat.If your read this, please stay away from this game. It's ♥♥♥♥in trash.

Also, this game's really challenging, I've played this on easy or normal mode and still die MANY times, the enemies are beasts. The bad thing though, the Campaign is too short. Recommended.			"

MEDAL OF HONOURA po-faced version of Call of Duty without any of the overblown action scenesRating 4/10A competent but incredibly dull trek around Afghanistan. It takes itself far too seriously for what it essentially a heavily scripted action game. You could say it's like the game version of the film Act of Valour. It's not all bad and there a couple of good set pieces which are effectively a last stand scenario reminiscent of the best Call of Duty set pieces however more often than not it's a repetitive slog through dull mountain ranges shooting at brain dead wack a mole enemies. There is nothing particularly new and fresh about Medal of Honour just a feeling of déjà vu, you've played this game 10 times before, it's just had different names.It's also incredibly short, clocking in at around 3 hours for the single player campaign and that's taking your time on the hardest difficulty. Just when you think the game is about to start it ends, it feels rushed much like the disappointing ending to Kane and Lynch Dog Days.			"

												No point in getting MoH now.I recived it as a gift (whom I forgot to thank) when it was $60. Would it be worth buying, not really.You can think of the game as COD skinned with battlefield assests. The game is currently lost as the war(s) in the middle east are done for the most part.While it's designed to make you feel like a special ops team member, it's just... not that tactical. A lot of running and gunning.Multiplayer was a terrible experience, but the single player story had some content in it.The joke is, single player was done in one engine, and then multiplayer in another. This was at the point in time when EA was working on the Frostbite engine.4/10			"

												A solid shooter, and the multiplayer is fun and well made. But the game feels like a teaser for Battlefield 3, the single player is embarrassingly short, and the multiplayer has a laughably small upgrade system (There are 2 team specific guns per class and then an extra one you can unlock). It looks like Battlefield, plays like a cross of BF3 and COD, and then comes up short in content. It's like paying to play a demo. Get it cheap? Worth the couple hours of playtime you will get. Otherwise, avoid.			"

												This is the first time I've actually managed to play all the way through one of these big-budget modern warfare shooters, and now I understand what people mean when they call them big dumb spectacles. This is a game that never let me make my own decisions, held my hand the entire way through, and never gave me any context or reason for killing hundreds of men with overwhelming force - but it was still fun, with plenty of intense action and good variety in gameplay, and obviously well put together. Consider grabbing it if it's on sale, but there's no way I'd pay full price for a game style I just don't like.Full review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/10/medal-of-honor.html "

												I know that CoD gets a lot of flak and most of it is well deserved I admit. But it was never as terrible as this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥at least. No matter how bad Modern Warfare series ♥♥♥♥ed up, they will always be better than this imitation.Lets take a look at the long list of cons:- Weapons have no weight and feel to them. You never get the feeling of pressuring the trigger of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PKM and your hits, they simply don't matter. You won't get the satisfaction you get when you lined up headshots in MW.- Story is non-existant. ""These are the bad guys, we are the good guys. Kill them.""- They added a long♥♥♥♥♥ATV driving+stealth section in the game, but ATV feels like a toy car. It simply stops right away when you press ""S"", it won't be affected by the rocks on the road.- Stealth is much more worse. The enemy will look you right in the eyes and won't see you, because you're supposed to be hidden at that moment.- You cannot avoid game logic. The game wants you to go to some point, you have to. Do you want to go back because there was a nice sniper spot there? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad loser, the door you kicked in and broke off from its hinges is fully repaired and for some reason you can't kick it down again. The only thing that works right in Afghanistan is its door makers it seems.- Enemies spawn constantly if you're ""not supposed to"" kill them. And in some places they respawn right in the same spot, right in front of your eyes. Even if you're unloading a big fat PKM upon the spawn point. Hilarious. - Too damn easy. I am just a decent FPS player, not that good, not that bad, just around the average. I have to say it, hardest difficulty in this game is no better than playing MW1(CoD4) on lowest difficulty.- Glitches. Too damn many glitches. The reason I stopped playing was some glitch that kept me from progressing. If I had a way of finding the chapter name, so I could look for a solution, but there wasn't any indication of it. I thought the game isn't worth the trouble.- I have read that the game ends in 4 hours. EA, DICE and Danger Close (Who the ♥♥♥♥ are these guys?) just went somewhat indie with this game and made two interns and a cow to work on this game I assume.If you want a decent story (although they ♥♥♥♥ed it up with MW3 I'd say) with modern warfare, your first choice should be the Modern Warfare (Pripyat... a better mission than this whole game combined) trilogy, this should be the last.Terrible/10			"

												The game starts as you ""Rabbit"", because you carry around a rabbit's foot around and I kid you not,  a guy is called ""Dusty"".  I am going to gloss over the gameplay and the mechanics as it has already been done by my peers. It is the appaling story of the game I will try to sink my teeth into or lack thereof. I did not understand any of it. The fundamental questions, Why was I there? Who am I shooting at? Why am I shooting at them? Who am I? Shooting at brown people is the new cowboy appeal like it was to red indians back in pre independence times. Maybe later we will cringe at distasteful things like this. I certainly hope so.This is really close to being a propaganda game.			"

												This is a promising game at first. Great looks, great playability, different game mechanics... But it is just another CoD. I actually bought it because I thought i was NOT going to be like that, not another massive, commercial, non-gamer oriented, boring, empty and soulless FPS.The campaign is really boring and repetitive, too lineal, very unoriginal and really, really short and easy even on the hardest setting. I finished it with just 5 hours of playtime (and I repeated the first missions a few times due to some hardware problems). So, if you're looking for a nice singleplayer experience, this is not what you're looking for.If MP is your thing, then... dont buy it either. Its nothing special. If you like AAA military FPS, get any CoD or Battlefield. Basically the same thing but with many more players online, although here you might find less 13-year-olds screaming at their mics or hackers. Benefits of being less massive.			"

												I'm having some fun playing this but other times I just want to get to the end. The characters are boring. Seems like everybody is a hardened white commando from about the same background and with the same attitude and feelings about everything except for one black commander who might as well be white and one white general or CIA guy or something who should be a lot better actor. The sound is bad. There's lots of err... homoerotic commando whispering in your ear as you stealthily follow the one and only path to ""penetrate"" your next objective like Dorothy for instance. I like it but the whispering voice sounds the same way no matter if that commando is in front of you, behind you or fifty feet in front of you. And your name keeps changing as you switch identities for no apparant reason. The cities aren't much bigger than farms. The guy directing you often tells me to do things but I have trouble following his instructions. It helps to press H so that your objective lights up for a little while. Its not really that important because there aren't any different ways to go but it took me some time to figure that out. Quite a few times I've been unable to progress and been forced to restart a mission. I'm often annoyed with the game choosing my weapon. Can't I be allowed to make any decisions? I've played other games that allow me to pick weapons  and choose paths and my name. That's how I prefer it. This game doesn't allow a lot of freedom in allowing you to pick what you'll do next or how you'll do it and its very repetitious. There's one mission where you are taking cover in some crumbling mud shack and the enemy streams in forever down the hills around you. It just gets tiring picking them off. Hard to believe they would waste that many guys on that pathetic tactic but I suppose it could happen. What's going on with that Barret sniper rifle view? Its like they mounted a camera on the back of a camel walking on rocky terrain in high winds.The graphics are good and there's a lot of action. Its not as good as taking a walk but its better than raking leaves. This game is not sleep inducing. It'll tire you out but it will also make you feel restless and and angry. If you need to fall asleep I recomend Eurotruck simulator.			"

Following the modern military trend that has thankfully ended as we go sci-fi. What do I say? It's like battlefield/CoD but not as fun or cool. Good graphics but it looks like trash now. I do like how it is 'based' off a true story(The Lone Survivor One) but it is 'based' in a way like a modern remake of Romeo and Juliet set in New York City is 'based' off the original. The only fun I had with this game is thisYou can knife towel heads even when their dead. Repeatedly too. Like, your guy gets REALLY into it. He goes prone and just SHIVS that allah-worshipper.			"

AI ... not so good ... Constantly during SP i end up riddling my own team with bullets because the run out like a FPS noob in a game with friendly fire enabled...

Multiplayer was OK.   but ... was obviously some shoddy programming and some sketchy players about... sit 400-600 meter away with sniper rifle ...get one shotted by a ak 47 with no optics...   ak 47 with no optics = 10 x better than sniper in this game...       :(			"

												Singleplayer runs poorly, has mouse issues and half of the maps lack alot of detail, some maps are great though... and an ok story.The Multiplayer however runs alot better and gameplay is good enough, I do suggest it for the MP, but since this review seems to be for ""Medal of Honor(TM) Single Player"", I can't recommend the SP.

												This game takes everything that was bad about Call of Duty and manages to make it worse. The campaign is mindless, funneling you from one menial task to the next with no agency or challenge. The multiplayer is worse than most f2p games and less populated to boot, sporting the noisy, cluttered visuals and random one-hit spawn kills from across the map characteristic of the worst in the genre. There are no other features. You have to endure 3.5 minutes of an unskippable cutscene before you're even allowed to play the campaign, and in certain scripted events you don't even need to shoot anybody to stay alive. It's also four hours long. That is not hyperbole.			"

												The game's campaign starts off soon after the 9/11 attacks (meme♥♥♥♥ insert 9/11 joke here). It follows men who are apart of the DEVGRU operators, who all get AWESOME code names, them being Mother(♥♥♥♥er), Doodoo, Preacher, and Rabbit (possibly a furfag?) who also work with a sandnigger towelhead known as Tariq, who has the intelz that they need. Little did they know that Tariq was actually a sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who had lured them into a trap. After the Americans prove that ♥♥♥♥♥ wrong and kill all of his buddies, the Americans interrogate Tariq to find out that there are over 9000 talibanz waiting up in the♥♥♥♥♥♥i-kot valley to shoot them. After this part, every other mission is just securing stuff, blowing stuff up, driving around, blowing more stuff up, shooting people, being shot at, actually suffering a bullet wound, some on rail levels, and dying. Not much of an interesting story beyond this mission. Other memorable code names include Cat (Panther), Vegas, Deuce (more like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amirite not needed), and Dusty.			"

You may notice the time that I spent playing is 25 minutes, well, that's because it was hurting my eyes way too much. The FoV is so terrible that it will most likely make you want to just give up on life because of the pain it causes. I got halfway through the first mission, and well, I stopped. I really tried to keep going but I couldn't endure the pain any longer. This comes from a average 1st person shooter player.			"

												EA's half-baked attempt at being a Call of Duty clone. Take literally anything about the AI behavior, lack of being allowed to go anywhere or do anything without your partner's permission, lack of recoil, 1.5 sec reload time, etc. and re-name it and you have Medal of Honor. One might think that I'm exaggerating. No, it's almost literally a Call of Duty clone. If you've played Call of Duty, you've already played this game. There's literally nothing new or innovative about it.The game isn't bad, but it's not good. Overall, would not recommend.			"

												This game feels like a really low budget game and it's really boring. I encountered multiple game breaking bugs in less than two hours. You don't have any freedom whatsoever, you basically have to just follow a guy constantly. Way too many times your tour guide's events won't trigger and you have to either try to go ahead and trigger the next event so he teleports to you or just restart because you need him to open doors for you. Stealth? There isn't any. Waiting for a guy to tell you when to go isn't stealth. Sniping? They tell you who to shoot sooo. The field of view? Absolutely atrocious. A fixed 55 tunnel vision is nowhere near acceptable. It also can't be changed in the config files. Want to climb a little ledge? Wait for your friend to do it for you.What about the story? Meh, looks boring. Anyways I don't really care it might as well just be something like: ""You're a little girl with cataracts following a tour guide wanting to see what ""war"" is and trying to learn how doors and basic mobility works.""I haven't tried the multiplayer, but with a fov of 55 it's not even worth trying.

												Hi, everybody!OK, So I have just come out of a 30h stint of Dishonoured, so I'm going to make a couple of comparisons to that here.OK So the good/normal stuff.It's a Rail Shooter = There is only one way to progress one possible direction of events can unfold. This is good in that it directs the story in the direction that the writers want it to go. I like rail shooters, Half Life is a rail shooter, by definition.The Shooting controls.YAY SOMEONE GOT IT RIGHT! The way it is set up, by default, is how I, and other pro FPS players, have our controls (mostly).Crouch and sprint whilst the button is depressed, not on toggle. Rifle Zoom on Rcklick, also on toggle. WOOT WOOT! Really this is only a little thing as it can usually be changed in the keyboard settings, but I didn't have to change it, for once. Would have been nice if melee was mapped to F, tho. (usually I would have it on E, but that was needed for peeking, which didn't feel as good as the Dishonoured's version)The Stealth/Knifing - there were about 6 opportunites to employ this, if you wanted to. Which is reasonable for a gun-focussed campaign. The stealth itself was only OK... you had to kill in the prescribed order, if you went off the script, everyone is alerted and it devolves into a gun fight. I also feel that the enemies hit harder during the stealth sections if you stuffed it up and started a gun fight, as an incentive to do it the way the writers wanted you to. You could run behind someone and they would not hear you. But stealth the wrong guy (or the right guy in the wrong order) and he'd alert the whole base.Health bar - was a fast-regenerating red mist that surrounds the vision, similar to CoD, I believe, but better in that it only took a couple of hits (3?) before I was restarting at the checkpoint. Good and bad.The mechanic suited the game andt he fast-paced storyline.Enemies - these would flank and attack, and dive for cover, the AI seemed fine, their accuracy was acceptable. Exept the snipers.Sniping (Barret sections)These were pretty good. You had wind, bullet travel time, and an IR camera to deal with.everything was there except the recoil. Oh there is one bit where you are sniping and your spotter is calling shots. He does a fairly hopeless job of it. and their snipers are useless shots. Then they had Dragonov's VS our Barret.Run-And-Gun (the story proper)Mostly fine, sections of running to find cover, picking your shots, and not getting shot or grenaded in the process. You can always ask your allies for more ammo if you're out, too - which is kinda nice. There are some points (you will realise them when it happens) where eventually you realise the enemies have infinite respawn, and the nex event is actually triggered by you moving up closer to the enemy stronghold.  I didn't really like that mechanic. Nor did I like the absolute reliance on Air support to take out dug-in targets such as AA turrets and mortar fire. What would the Rangers do without the Airfoce, I wonder? Hmmm... drop a grenage instead of a signal flare, I imagine.Story Telling:I didn't like how you were constantly being told parts of the story through different Character's eyes. At least, I didn't like how it was done in this game. Usually when this is done, it creates some extra layer of depth to the game, due to the new character having a different mechanic, such as Raven in MSG2  Where you swithced from gun play to sword play. In this, when you change guys, you swap your M4 for (I dunno, some other full auto assault rifle. I plead ignorance). There wasn't really enough difference in each character to truely make each one feel unique. It really was just more of the same as the other guy buy now they are calling me something different when they talk to me.The story: (no spoilers)Was a nod to the boys on the ground, their trials, and their hardships. This was done in the outworking of the story, quite well. not really a spoiler, but if you don't want any clues about the game story at all... ""Bullets or bones? Bones heal... Jump!"" would be my favourite line in the movie/game. Their desperation felt sincere, That's a rare thing in gaming story lines. I feel like it was a pity the game was only 5h long, but it told the story they wanted it to, without drawing it out - which maight actually leave you feeling cheated if it went on 'forever' and that ending was the one that you got. it was a good length for the story that was told. Just the game itself was well done and felt a bit short, if only because I wanted a bit more of the exellent game play, There are more things I could comment on, I guess, like the part where you play the Apache Gunner, which served well if only to break the gameplay up and provide some variety. but really, everything about this game was good to OK, and worth a play through. I think I got this either for $4 on special, or in a bundle, So i can't complain about the price. But I have never bought a game (OK I might have once at some point) that wasn't at least 66% off, so don't ask me about paying retail for it.Final verdict, If you are an FPS fan, It's worth a run, on at least normal difficulty. I'm sure If I played this  on easy I could go all Rambo on it and mulch the game in a couple or three hours.I miss the freedom of Dishonoured. Guess what I'm off to play? (Yes, I have Ghost/No Kills on every level) "

												This review is for the game ''Medal of Honor'',a first-person military shooter video game,developed by the video game company Danger Close Games(Single-player) and EA Digital Illusions CE(multiplayer).It was published by Electronic Arts and released in October 12,2010 for NA and October 15,2010 for Europe.The game uses the Unreal Engine 3 for the single player campaign and the Frostbit 1.5 for the multiplayer mod.The game is available for Microsoft Windows,Playstation 3 and Xbox 360.Single player-campaign plotThe campaign,of the thirteenth installment of the Medal of Honor series,takes place during the first days of the invasion of Afghanistan,in 2002.The story might be based on on the events that took place during Operation Anaconda that occured in March 2002,approximately six months after 9/11.In the game you will get to experience warfare that happened in reality like the seizing of Bagram Airfield,the Battle of Takur Ghar and the Battle of Shah-i-Kot.Throughout the game you will be exchanging roles between the Navy SEAL DEVGRU ''Rabbit'',a Delta Force sniper code-named ''Deuce'',Ranger Dante Adams and the Apache helicopter gunner Brad Hawkins.Apart they will face great battles and will have to overcome great obstacles in order to protect their country,their freedom and their well-being.MultiplayerMultiplayer is really rich in weapon customization,perk unlockables,achievements,statistics and ribbons giving the sense of fulfillment to the player while playing multiplayer.Sadly the multiplayer is quite dead already.Unfortunately no more that 100-200 gamers play daily.RecapMedal of Honor series used to be Electronic Arts' flagship.Unfortunately interest got lost since EA focused more on the development was focused on creating and expanding the Dragon Age series,the Dead Space series,the Crysis series and especially the Battlefield series,whom today are EA's flagship.Pros+Beautiful graphics+Interesting fast paced storyline,sometimes heartbreaking+Exciting and easy to use shooting mechanismsCons-Deceased multiplayer-Linear mission based storyline(too linear for my taste)Q:Do i recommend this game?A:Depends.If you want to explore the single player campaign and progress through the Medal of Honor universe absolutely yes.If you buy it for the Multiplayer mod do not bother you'll be playing alone or with a bunch of 12 year olds.P.S I didn't refer much on the Plot section because i didn't want to spoil the game to you.Buy it and play it thoroughly.Support the developers.Electronic Arts thank you for this game.

												I felt the single-player campaign was reasonably well-done, and deserved better reviews.  My complaints would be that it was pretty short (I finished it in about 4 hours) and some of the missions suffered from the CoD syndrome of endless waves of enemies.  But overall it felt more realistic than most of its contemporaries, and the nod to real-life battles (Operation Redwings, later made famous by the movie Lone Survivor), was fun imo.			"

												From unbearably low FOV with no FOV options, to broken scripted events, to glitches and crashes, this game is borderline unplayable. On top of that, it has little to no relation to previous Medal of Honor games. It's a very generic ""cinematic"" corridor shooter. Its multiplayer isn't anything special either. With no unique elements, I'd recommend you get another, similar game instead, as this one is a broken mess.			"

												Well, I got the game for quite a few years but never played it. Yesterday I decide to finish those games I had never played  before in my libaray, and I started with it.Maybe it's a little unfair, but you decide to get it NOW, I suggest that you have better choices. This game shows ages not only in graphic, but also gameplay. The shooting doesn't same so real. Storyline - sterotypes..,, AI is kind of dumb as well...It might look good when it came out, but now it loks so... Well a lot of games look still fabulous nowadays, coz they don't rely on technologies, but art styles. like dishonored, deux ex human revolution. This game is the opposite. If you want to play some FPS classics, stick with the foreametioned games or bioshock series. You can get them in the same price when on sale.			"

												Sorry but that game just suck. I explain why. Well look back at the Medal of Honor Series. Of all the old good games. Yeah okay many are pretty old with graphic way behind even Call of Duty 1 but damn they had allot to do in it. But now it is just a boring as normal shooter. Even worse you are slow as ♥♥♥♥ and you ever have to run back to your commander to get your missions. Just because you stand 5 meters away from him means you don't get the next waypoint. I probably should play deeper into the game but the fact that there are better games out there is just killing it at all. And well I am actually comparing it to games from City Interactive. Well not the very bad games of them but the just a bit better ones. Well if that game would be from City interactive I would let it pass and say okay, maybe this shows potential, but it is damn Medal of Honor!			"

												Sorry but that game just suck. I explain why. Well look back at the Medal of Honor Series. Of all the old good games. Yeah okay many are pretty old with graphic way behind even Call of Duty 1 but damn they had allot to do in it. But now it is just a boring as normal shooter. Even worse you are slow as ♥♥♥♥ and you ever have to run back to your commander to get your missions. Just because you stand 5 meters away from him means you don't get the next waypoint. I probably should play deeper into the game but the fact that there are better games out there is just killing it at all. And well I am actually comparing it to games from City Interactive. Well not the very bad games of them but the just a bit better ones. Well if that game would be from City interactive I would let it pass and say okay, maybe this shows potential, but it is damn Medal of Honor!			"

												Recently, I finally got around to finishing MoH.The amount of times I've spent repeatedly stabbing a single person is most likely more than the amount of time it takes to complete the entire storyline.The actual game was fun, and got me interested in it, as it has a lot of depth, and details for what's happening, although a bunch of unrealistic scenarios (believe it or not, a person doesn't wipe out an army of 100 by himself).The ending was depressing, and made me want to kms.10/10			"

												I maintain that this Medal of Honor has, without a doubt, the most engaging and fun campaign of any I've played in the series. Gameplay was fun and challenging (especially on Tier 2;) and even now it still looks good from a graphic standpoint.The mutiplayer had some kinks. You aren't able to go prone, sometimes collision is strange on the props in levels... but overall, it is still fun to play. I've continuously recommended it since launch.			"

												Single-player: The whole game was ok. The modern setting I liked, the graphics were also pretty good. What I didn't like were some of the bugs. It's been a while since I played it, but the only thing I CAN remember (yes, short memory... I already forgot what I just typed) were the NPC's that stopped doing anything mid-game which resulted in replaying the entire level all over again. The story was ok, nothing special. It lacked a lot of suspense and action (which is, of course, realistic, but I'm not playing games for 100% realism). Nothing noteworthy.Multiplayer: Not bad, but the fact that there is (was ?) so much spawnkilling killed this game very quickly for me. Is it that hard to create a solid spawn system (Modern Warfare 2 could do it) ?If you don't like MW this might be for you. Otherwise, stick with MW (more action, faster gameplay, better controls, more polished and EXCELLENT multiplayer).[Rating: 66/100]			"

												SP: The story is pretty powerful, as it's loosely based on the real events of the Battle of Roberts Ridge. It's a gripping story and the cutscenes do it justice. The gameplay however is very monotonuous. The Taliban fighters just seem to come at you like a wave of zombies. When they shoot from cover, it's like your're playing one of those flash games where the enemies pop up at exactly the same place in a periodic manner. This makes the enemies feel very unreal and almost laughable. You also don't have any room to diverge from the beaten track, it's a completely linear shooter like CoD.MP: The unlock system just simply and plainly sucks. The stock weapons are not much fun to use and getting some interesting unlocks takes ages. Aiming feels off compared to other first-person shooters, they probably put some sort of mouse acceleration in the game that you can't turn off. The maps and game modes get old really quickly too. It feels like they didn't put much thought in to the MP portion of this game.Conclusion: only get this game in a sale to get dragged away by the story, but you probably won't play it much afterwards.

												For the price point of 20 dollars- I'd say this game is just about what you pay for. If it was another cent more it would be getting a no instead of a yes recommendation. ... actually- an edit here. After typing through this and realizing just how very much I did not enjoy this game, I cannot give it a recommendation at this price point. If it's on sale for 10 dollars, sure pick it up. Otherwise I'd suggest passing on it.Aside from the several game-breaking bugs I encountered while playing through the campaign, setting me back ~30 minutes or forcing me to make the conscious choice to restart the level completely due to an inability to stop crouching, jump, or run... the gameplay as a whole was rather unenjoyable. It felt almost like an indie game... a B-movie among video games I suppose. There were parts where it was damn near impossible to find what you were supposed to shoot at, there was a section where you had to use ""hellfire missiles"" but it did not tell you how, leaving me stuck at that section until I finally looked through all the control bindings to find them on some crazily arbitrary key when they could have simply used right mouse button... The enemy AI wasn't even lacking. It was nonexistent. All the enemies shared the same ~8 models/textures, and the same type of enemy would always run into the same exact position wave after wave until you got your air support to blow it all to hell for you. This is essentially 90% of the game. The other 10% is the game forcing you to stealth through some areas even though being the super soldier any FPS game innately makes you, you could just plow through easily.The actual sounds of gunfire were pretty good, but the MUSIC... god. You know how all games have their OSTs- and then at that one point of the game where everything gets real or goes wrong, you have the really feelsy ones that make the scene feel epic? And how EVERY game does it? Well it might seem like a broken record, but there's a reason things are like that. Because it's a winning formula- it works. Unfortunately the people making Medal of Honor decided to try to fix what was not broken. EVERY single track felt like it was trying to be that ""epic scene"" to make the game feel 100x more exciting than it actually was. When all the music tries to compete for sounding amazing, nothing feels special.The story. Full of holes, nearly nonexistent... without spoiling anything too much, when big scenes happen I just don't CARE. You don't get any backstories. You don't get any personality building. It's just you're there, you do stuff, and the game ends pretty damn abruptly. There's also a very strange ""ending after the ending"" that made no sense whatsoever. I have no clue if it was hinting towards the next game or what, but it was extremely out of  place and even further undermined the ""big scene"" of the ending.The design was also sub par. As I said all the enemies seemed to share the same few models and textures. The environment all felt the same and the map design was poorly laid out for progression- I constantly also ran into invisible bumps that made me stub my toe and unable to move somewhere I clearly should be able to.Overall if I had to score this- I'd give it a 4/10. At least the credits give you a link to donate to a good cause...? Maybe this game was supposed to be promotional for that? If it was- it shouldn't have been. It'd be much more effective if a GOOD game were to be used for that end.EDIT: One last edit. There might be ONE thing this game ""did right"". If I had to take a guess- this might be what war actually feels like (to some extent). Everything feels confusing. There's nothing pointing you in the right direction. It's chaos all around you. Everything looks and feels the same. Unfortunately that just doesn't make for a fun video game for the masses that have been raised on the modern FPS games we have now. I feel like it's possible to get the same ""realistic"" (again this is an assumption of maybe their goal with the game) experience while still keeping it fun and interesting. I never did mention- the guns feel horridly inaccurate. I've shot guns; they're not pinpoint like in other games, but they're not THIS bad either.			"

												This is a well done FPS that somehow went under the radar during a time when the Call of Duty and Battlefield franchises began  saturating the market. The single player campaign is short, but it takes players through a series of fun and exciting missions, based on real world events during the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan, specifically Operation Anaconda. I was impressed with the authenticity that went into the game. Alot of the terminology is something that military folks might only understand. The weapons were done well, and there is a good assortment of hardware for players to get their hands on. Overall, I think Danger Close did a great job with the SP portion but I wish they would've also done the MP portion. DICE (Battlefield), for some reason, was contracted to develop the MP portion. In my opinion, the MP is just stale and too much like Battlefield. Many of the features that are available in SP are not available in MP. Weapons and damage model in MP are also horrible. Hit detection, is most notably, the worst I've seen in any game. Would not recommend MP.			"

												Single Player:Game starts off really strong with you thrown into the middle of a conflict following your squad through a war ravaged middle eastern town. The more you work with them though the more it's apparent that they will constantly hold back, waiting for you - the only badass who can storm a freaking target and use cover effectively to avoid fire - to clear the way before they move up.Would be awesome if the game relied less on the constant leap-frogging dynamic of ""move up"" .. ""wait"" .. ""move up"" .. ""wait"" .. but if you can get past this, it's a pretty well done linear shooter.The only catch is - it's the same old formula that's done a million times in other games and a million times better.

When they shoot from cover, it's like your're playing one of those flash games where the enemies pop up at exactly the same place in a periodic manner. This makes the enemies feel very unreal and almost laughable. You also don't have any room to diverge from the beaten track, it's a completely linear shooter like CoD.MP: The unlock system just simply and plainly sucks. The stock weapons are not much fun to use and getting some interesting unlocks takes ages. Aiming feels off compared to other first-person shooters, they probably put some sort of mouse acceleration in the game that you can't turn off. The maps and game modes get old really quickly too. It feels like they didn't put much thought in to the MP portion of this game.Conclusion: only get this game in a sale to get dragged away by the story, but you probably won't play it much afterwards.

												Medal of Honor will feature a single-player campaign that takes place in 2002, in which the player will control multiple characters from both the “Tier 1” and “Big Military” perspectives. The storyline will follow several ""Tier One Operators"" working under the National Command Authority in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. Players will also play as a US Army Ranger and an Apache helicopter gunner, fighting on a larger scale than the ""Tier 1 Ops"" campaign, as players will then only be a small part of the ""war machine"". The campaign will be heavily weighted (with regards to playtime) in favor of the Tier 1 operators.			"

												This game has a very solid single player campaign and the storyline is good. However, all weapons feel like peashooters and sometimes the enemies just keep on rising no matter how many bullets you put in to them, unless you execute a perfect headshot. It's the same as in SWAT 3 when you hammer the tangos with bean bag ammo.For an old game it's still very fun to play though and looks pretty good even with todays standards.			"

I'm sure that it was due to content at the time and being cowardly. All news media has to jump on the bandwagon. I mean over half of them probably never even picked up a controller and played just based their views other reviews. I highly recommend you give this game a try for yourself and make your own decision. This game gets my seal of approval well worth the price to play.			"

												For the price point of 20 dollars- I'd say this game is just about what you pay for. If it was another cent more it would be getting a no instead of a yes recommendation. ... actually- an edit here. After typing through this and realizing just how very much I did not enjoy this game, I cannot give it a recommendation at this price point. If it's on sale for 10 dollars, sure pick it up. Otherwise I'd suggest passing on it.Aside from the several game-breaking bugs I encountered while playing through the campaign, setting me back ~30 minutes or forcing me to make the conscious choice to restart the level completely due to an inability to stop crouching, jump, or run... the gameplay as a whole was rather unenjoyable. It felt almost like an indie game... a B-movie among video games I suppose. There were parts where it was damn near impossible to find what you were supposed to shoot at, there was a section where you had to use ""hellfire missiles"" but it did not tell you how, leaving me stuck at that section until I finally looked through all the control bindings to find them on some crazily arbitrary key when they could have simply used right mouse button... The enemy AI wasn't even lacking. It was nonexistent. All the enemies shared the same ~8 models/textures, and the same type of enemy would always run into the same exact position wave after wave until you got your air support to blow it all to hell for you. This is essentially 90% of the game. The other 10% is the game forcing you to stealth through some areas even though being the super soldier any FPS game innately makes you, you could just plow through easily.The actual sounds of gunfire were pretty good, but the MUSIC... god. You know how all games have their OSTs- and then at that one point of the game where everything gets real or goes wrong, you have the really feelsy ones that make the scene feel epic? And how EVERY game does it? Well it might seem like a broken record, but there's a reason things are like that. Because it's a winning formula- it works. Unfortunately the people making Medal of Honor decided to try to fix what was not broken. EVERY single track felt like it was trying to be that ""epic scene"" to make the game feel 100x more exciting than it actually was. When all the music tries to compete for sounding amazing, nothing feels special.The story. Full of holes, nearly nonexistent... without spoiling anything too much, when big scenes happen I just don't CARE. You don't get any backstories. You don't get any personality building. It's just you're there, you do stuff, and the game ends pretty damn abruptly. There's also a very strange ""ending after the ending"" that made no sense whatsoever. I have no clue if it was hinting towards the next game or what, but it was extremely out of  place and even further undermined the ""big scene"" of the ending.The design was also sub par. As I said all the enemies seemed to share the same few models and textures. The environment all felt the same and the map design was poorly laid out for progression- I constantly also ran into invisible bumps that made me stub my toe and unable to move somewhere I clearly should be able to.Overall if I had to score this- I'd give it a 4/10. At least the credits give you a link to donate to a good cause...? Maybe this game was supposed to be promotional for that? If it was- it shouldn't have been. It'd be much more effective if a GOOD game were to be used for that end.EDIT: One last edit. There might be ONE thing this game ""did right"". If I had to take a guess- this might be what war actually feels like (to some extent). Everything feels confusing. There's nothing pointing you in the right direction. It's chaos all around you. Everything looks and feels the same. Unfortunately that just doesn't make for a fun video game for the masses that have been raised on the modern FPS games we have now. I feel like it's possible to get the same ""realistic"" (again this is an assumption of maybe their goal with the game) experience while still keeping it fun and interesting. I never did mention- the guns feel horridly inaccurate. I've shot guns; they're not pinpoint like in other games, but they're not THIS bad either.			"

Unlike the Activision franchise that at least has some interesting shooting galleries, this one is average. The only two words to describe these bland, average game is bland and average. 4/10.			"

If you really want to play a shooter game on steam, just buy arma 3 instead. Its all around better. If not, even cod is better than this game.			"

												In the summer of 2011, I made the horrific mistake of buying this game just for early access to the Battlefield 3 beta (also, BF3 turned out to be a disappointment that drove me back to BC2).The single player campaign is basically a crappier Call of Duty. Call of Duty may be rehashed garbage but at least its campaigns are entertaining enough to keep me engaged to the end. I could not say the same with the first hour or so of this awful game. Also, why the heck does this not use Frostbite for single player? That would have kept me interested a little longer. Btw, I heard that the campaign was even worse in the Warfighter sequel that proved embarrassing for EA.The multiplayer mode uses a limited-destruction version of Frostbite (WTF, DICE?). It's a horrible console port with boring maps, few vehicles, and no mod tools for the community to make their own maps (as is the trend these days, sadly).On the technical side, the graphics are nothing to be impressed about. Optimization is passable, but won't make up for the very unimpressive gameplay.Please do not buy this game. If you want a brainless single player shooter from a greedy publisher, then play Modern Warfare 2 or 3. If you want an atrocious multiplayer experience, go download the blandest, worst-rated user-created maps from Counter-Strike community websites.P.S.

I guess that's normal for this type of game.There is one interesting setpiece; it's a fighter jet graveyard.  You're only there for a few minutes though, and there are fighter jet graveyards in most modern military shooters anyway.There is exactly one part of the game that's fun: Your orders are to kill everyone with a heavy machine gun in a seemingly abandoned village. You get to a hut, break in, and then play Defend The Hut for ten minutes.  It was fun because over the course of the mission, RPGs kept taking out the walls until there was almost no cover and I had only 14 bullets left at the end.Finished the campaign in two nights, probably could have done it in one if I had started an hour earlier.If you're looking for a military shooter, how about Spec Ops: The Line instead?

You can complete the whole game with your pistol.> Pistol has literally no recail. Very high rate of fire, almost instant reload, and unlimmited ammo. Not sure why they even bothered getting machine guns and rifles in the game.> You are basically immortal. A heavy machine gun bullet to your head? You won't even feel it.> Some years ago I cheated on a multiplayer game. Lots of people used hax on it, so I just went along. The hax had aimbot, yet, I didn't turn it up half as much as this game does. You hardly even need to aim.> You cannot skip startup logo sequence(edit, graphics are not THAT bad, the game simply didn't tell it had to be restarted after changing settings)> Not sure what to think about it, but my GT650m runs this at max settings when underclocked...> Meshes are ok. Textures are awfull. I recall COD2 having better textures.Suddenly the gap between Consoles and PCs just seems huge. I didn't actually even imagine it was this big.

-Quick Review-Medal of Honor (2010) not to be confused with Medal of Honor (1999) on the PlayStation. Medal of Honor was released on 2010 by EA (Electronic Arts). Medal of Honor takes place in Afghanistan, and was actually developed under the inspiration of American Special Forces.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: The Medal of Honor storyline will have you bouncing back and forth between four different characters, all the while trying to keep up with the unfolding conflict between the USA and with a group similar to the Taliban.The game starts with you playing as a character from a Navy SEAL named “Rabbit”. You will also play once as an Apache gunner, then you alternate between a Delta Force Sniper and and Army Ranger, and finally ending the game from Rabbits perspective.

Let me say, this story is just a mess. Within the first twenty minutes of the game, you start switching between characters. There are games that can successfully switch playable characters and you comprehend the story being told, but none of the characters are memorable to drive this method. Honestly, the only two teams I remember participating on were the Navy SEAL's and the Delta Force Sniper group. Everyone else is a blur of “and then we did that”.While the story was interesting, and at times upsetting, (as it can be, when an outsider in a comfortable desk is giving orders which make no sense to the boots on the ground...) the story narrative is hard to follow because of all the character switching, making the story completely tangled and forgettable. Which is sad, as it could have been fantastic.

Gameplay: The controls are pretty basic as far as most FPS's go. You can alternate between a Primary weapon, a secondary, and a pistol. You also have a melee attack for close fighting, and grenades.Depending on whom you're playing as, you have different weapons. For example the seals used a M16-modded rifle, and secondary was a sniper. While in contrast the Delta Sniper group all had silencer modifications on pistols and snipers.While fighting you can swap out, or pick up weapons... ...but again, that's a footnote and just an expected feature in FPS's.

Achievements: There are no Steam Achievements within Medal of Honor. However, in multiplayer there are “Awards” and unlockables as you level up and obtain “skill”.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528129615Price: Medal of Honor is priced at $19.99, I came by my copy from a Humble bundle years ago. The story mode (or “Campaign”) will last about 4 hours, probably less depending on the difficulty you play at and how hard you push forward.There is mutliplayer, but I'll add a section to my review to discuss multiplayer features more in depth. Unless you play multiplayer, $19.99 is far too high a price.Multiplayer: I logged on several times to see how the community was doing, and naturally there are a few people still playing the game. But there was only one game going actively, the rest were empty.The Multiplayer is what you would expect: you run around, help capture objectives, fill enemies with bullets, get murdered by the guy who's played nonstop since release... 'ya know, the “norms”.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528129217As you complete multiplayer games, you get experience errr excuse me “skill” points (which acts the same way as experience points in other games), you rank up the classes you've been playing, which unlocks bonuses for that class.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=528129359History: I can't complete this review without saying that I admire the Medal of Honor series. The first game I played was the original Medal of Honor released by DreamWorks Interactive in 1999 for the PlayStation.Looking back, the story from the 1999 version wasn't so great or interesting. However, it's easier to forgive because of the limitations on hardware at that time. It's a bit more difficult to forgive when a game was released in 2010.While I do admire the series, it is always been 100% biased for the United States Agenda. (at times I feel falls close to “propaganda”) At least the Medal of Honor series treats the soldiers respectfully and honorably. In the end I care about the soldiers, not the power hungry politicians and governments fueling the wars and death.Conclusion: Medal of Honor was a disappointment, and I really hate to say that. The story was short, it has emphasis on online content and leaderboards, the story was terribly presented, the gameplay was mediocre at best. From a big name like “Medal of Honor”, there's a fairly long and impressive heritage, making this game's failures all that much more disappointing.Did the game work? Yeah. Is there still some Multiplayer? Yeah. Can you play and shoot up people? Yeah. What sets this game apart? Nothing. You can take it or leave it. For 20 dollars get a game that actually has a story. If you want online competitive play, go grab a game like Call of Duty, Counter Strike, Team Fortress, there are many choices of FPS which still has a community.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=527199532------Edits and updates------Edit/Update October 03, 2015:A very hardy thankyou to Angfucious for spell checking and grammar correcting this piece before I posted it.

												A ridiculously railroaded, bland, unpolished corridor shooter.The AI is non existent. Enemies just run to their designated spot and shoot in your general direction. Your teammates always run into your gunfire and grenades. The gameplay is insipid with plenty of point and click games and turret sections. You constantly have to wait for your teammates to open doors for you, which probably elongates this short game by another 2 hours. The weapons don't feel powerful and shooting them is just unsatisfactory.Story wise... you shoot brown people, while military guys scream at each other. And then you save 2 guys. That's the extent of it that I understood.This game is just depressing, and not in a good way. 4/10			"

												Medal of Honor is a bland, shallow and uninspired first person shooter very clearly developed and marketed to cash in on the success that the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare series was seeing at the time, and in that regard it falls flat on its face. Lets start with the positives. The graphics are pretty good for 2010 and the scene when you're fighting your way up a mountain while an AC-130 gunship fires on targets in the valley below was pretty cool.Now that that's out of the way.MoH is a short, boring corridor shooter occasionally broken up by boring turret sections. Your whole squad are walking ammo boxes that you can request ammo from whenever you get low, so ammo conservation and battlefield scavenging do not exist. The shooting is bland and the guns feel weak. There is hardly any weapon variety and almost no enemy variety.Friendly and enemy AI is generally bad. Enemies stand in the middle of open ground during firefights facing the wrong direction. Almost every time I saw a friendly AI throw a grenade it hit whatever he was using as cover, even during a scripted sequence when one of your squad members uses a grenade to clear a cave entrance. This got me killed more than once. Friendlies will CONSTANTLY run into your fire, blocking enemies and complaining about friendly fire, although as far as I could tell, you can't actually harm them. On multiple occasions scripted sequences would break and require me to load the previous checkpoint. The checkpoints were badly placed and dying would often result in having to replay long portions of the mission and watch unskippable scripted sequences all over again.All of the characters are the same generic, bearded tier 1 operator that contemporary shooters are known for. By the end of the game I didn't know anything about any of the characters or their personalities, which wouldn't be so bad if the game weren't constantly trying to make you feel comradery with your squad and to empathise with their struggle.There are a very limited number of graphics options and the FOV is so low that I had to sit a few metres away from my screen in order to not feel nauseous.

												Uninspired gameplay, brain dead AI and game breaking bugs.Bugs where I was forced to restart from the last checkpoint.- Stuck on terrain- enemy AI is stuck so you'll need to find and kill him before the game ""mission"" moves forward.- After a cutscene, I left clicked and it put me back to the start of the mission.

												The single player section of the game was avarage at best compared to COD games. It is unfortinate that they just copied CODs formula rather then coming up with something new. If you are looking for more over the top Tier 1 action and the game is on sale i might be worth checking out, but overall I would not recommand this game.			"

												I got this game through a Humble Bundle that I primarily bought for Dead Space 3.This game... it's decent, but not worth the cost. There are a few spots that are actually really good thematically, but largely the game is one very heavily scripted event after another. It's like Modern Warfare with half the gameplay and length and none of the story. I'd just skip this one and get one of the Modern Warfares if you want to get your military shooter on.			"

												An extremely linear game with no character or gameplay depth.  Frequent script breaks forcing you to reset checkpoints.  The game is basically this: shoot taliban that spawn out of thin air, move up 40 feet, repeat.  Sprinkle that with a bunch of US miliatary hoo-rah garbage and you've got this game.  4 hour single player campaign, and the majority of that is being pinned down fighing waves of taliban that spawn out of thin air right in plain view.Whoever greenlit releasing a game of this caliber in this state at EA is insane.

												So... Medal of Honor... Infamous for it's ""racism"" and overall mediocre presentation.I'll just tell it how it is. The gunplay feels good only if you score headshots. Otherwise the sound design and the feel of the gun leaves much to desire. The story starts off really weak and continues on the same level for the most part. The last hour of the game though is really great and emotional. And I think that's the reason why a few of these people reviewing here claim that the story is amazing. Some complain that the story is too short (4-6 hours, depending on your skill) and to them I'll say ""What are you talking about?"" This is perfect length. It shows an operation and you get enough. Anything longer would feel just like filler and it'd get boring.The multiplayer is dead. Don't buy it for this. I had the chance to play it when it was still a body that was twitching and in all honesty, you're not missing out on much. The graphics even now look beautiful. The soldiers that are currently deployed still say that the game looks like the world actually does and I have to admit, that's pretty impressive then.The main issue that I have with this game is the FOV. I tried changing it but to no avail. It's a constant 60 FOV or so and it's pretty disgusting because of it.The options menu is mediocre, but it still offers a few options in terms of windowed mode, resolution and some graphics changes. It runs fine as well.Overall5/10A good surprise, considering the reviews.(All games start at a 5/10 and move upwards/downwards based on pros and cons)			"

An enemy is hiding behind a crate so I throw a grenade which blows up and then the enemy glitches in front of the crate and starts shooting me. I almost stopped there but I completed the level so I got to see the rest of the linear, horribly scripted canyon that you walk through. I'm glad I got this in the EA humble bundle.			"

												Dull, on rails, and completely sans story. The gunplay feels weak, enemies don't react to shots or even the player, as they will walk straight past you to get to their scripted spot before taking action. Allies do everything for you. Even on ""Hard"", you needn't fire a shot thanks to the overbearing teammates. The only plus to the gunplay is that the normally distant and hollow sounding weapons change in timbre when you reach the end of a magazine. And to completely describe the story, it starts off with one squad trying to find an informant, who tells them that there are enemies nearby and something about a daughter, and that's it. Subsequently playing as different characters, you are just dropped into a warzone to do fighting towards some people who are pointing their fighting at you until two of the player characters meet up at the end. There's no spoilers, because there's no plot. They have no reason to do any of this apart from being told to do the fighting in one direction until the game decides to stop mid-level, entirely without climax or warning, and roll credits.			"

Not to mention that is it nothing more then a cod with meal of honor stuck on the front, overall, this game is mildly fun to play, might get 5-6 hours out of the single player, and realize you wasted your money, of course that is just my opinion but if your looking at this and thinking man this games gonna be a fun realistic shooter then boy are you wrong.

												Single Player Review: Medal of Honor raises no bars, almost seems to advertise it's need to follow it's competitors into mediocre territory. A few moments of strategic gameplay and cinematic beauty are overshadowed by the sterotypical watered down story and uninspired conclusion. The formula presented here is like a HungryMan meal for Gamers: tasty if you have a dollar.			"

												This game had great potential, it could've been fun but they made event registry happen client sided. This results in people with high latency killing you after you're done killing them, sometimes a few seconds later, when they're dead. As a result it feels very unrewarding to be good or not at FPS games when any brazilian who can't aim to save his life manages to kill you 3 seconds after you've taken cover, because of client-sided event registry. Same thing happens in all Battlefield titles, and it needs to stop. The foreign hordes of are ruining our gameplay with their high pings, make them play on servers on their own bloody continent.That, and the only way they ever get kills is by spamming noob tubes or rockets anyway.Now if you'll excuse me, i'll go back to playing a game without either ♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance or a netcode enforced skill cap.

												No no no no no no. This isn't make any sense. The ""Story"" is awful, there's no beginning, no end, just some action scenes. The friendly, and enemy AI is catastrophic, the missions are ♥♥♥♥ed up, there are no exact clues at certain points where to go or what to do, there are many weapons in this game, you only have to use your main, because you can easily get ammo from friendlies, so you don'§t need any other weapon then your main, the long range sniping looks cool tough. And that's the only positive thing about the game. Ohh and you have a headshot indicator, which is cool at the beginning, but makes no sense, has no use.tl;dr:Pros:-Long range sniping looks coolCons:-Everything else in this gameSorry guys, I'm not exaggerating.

												I personally would not buy this game unless it went on sale for a very cheap price( I got my copy from the humble bundle). The campaign lacks weapon variety which I like alot in shooter games. The storyline and transition of the game is linear which, combined with the simple shooter gameplay and lack of variety of guns to choose from, provides stale gameplay.			"

												MoH is rather poor, even for a modern military fps. It seems to be confused over wether it wants to be a CoD clone or a more realistic portrayal of modern warfare. In one hand it has a minimalistic hud and is set in a real war but on the other it has a little icon that pops up when you shoot an enemy in the head and enemy A.I. that seriously lacks any sense of self-preservation. The characters are bland and unmemorable which results in the final rescue mission of the very short campain lacking any sort of weight.			"

												Average game. You play as a faceless soldier in an elite squad and basically you shoot foreigners. Your teammates are your typical rough and gruff badasses who lack personality. Admittedly there were some military drama that got me interested. Although not much. Graphics are okay, the gameplay is so linear I bumped into a lot of invisible walls, and I encountered some moments I can't proceed because I failed to trigger the next script. It's hand-holding to the max. Multiplayer? I won't really bother. This game is 3 years old and I highly doubt there are people bored enough to still play this game online. Also it requires me to register and log in into EA servers. Screw that.6/10			"

												Cons:- It's a boring, so scripted that if you by accident leave one enemy alive (and that is possible since AI is dumb as s**t) sitting behind some cover, game won't even load next part of the level and you can fall through the floor!- You can't open the door until the game lets you do it. - You can't sit on a buggy until game tells you to do so. - Pistol has an infinite amount of ammo, it's accurate as a sniper rifle and reloads in 1 sec. Reality FTW!- Dialogue is tedious. - Game tries to copy over the top action from CoD but it fails miserably.- You need to manually enter CD due to copy protection. As if someone would want to pirate this PoS!- Looks ugly. Feels ugly. Plays ugly. Your character is ugly. Enemies are ugly.- And once more, is boring. Won't even finish it, it's not worth the time!Pros- Runs nice on pretty much anything. Coz it's ugly.- Hmmmm... thinking, thinking... All in all, avoid like a plague. It's not the worst game out there, for sure, but this was supposed to be AAA title, and as such is a failure. It's not original, it's not funny, it will only take few bucks from you and will give nothing in return!Avoid! "

												That wasn't fun at all. (Single player review, normal difficulty, This review doesn't include multiplayer or Tier 1 mode.)My entire playthrough of this game which was a short 4 hours of my life, I didn't enjoy this game at all. I liked and appreciated small things in this game. But that was it, I expected a generic shooty game, and a generic shooty game it was.With a disgustingly short campaign mode anyways.It was 4... let that sink in. FOUR hours long, probably because this is like a Call of Duty thing where people actually only buy it for the Multiplayer, which I can understand. But dear god. FOUR hours. I was watching the end credits before I knew it and all I could think was ""no. No this can't ALREADY be over."" But yeah. IIIIITTTT was.Anywho, the gameplay. It's a generic shooty game, I don't really know what else to say. You have gun, you use said gun to kill hostile people. You win game. That's pretty much it.There was very little gun variation, the maps were all boring to me, the combat was boring, missions were boring, nothing new, all boring.The things I appreciated in this game was some small gun-attention details, like how if I reload with a bullet still in the chamber, my full bullet count is one over the typical full-magazine reload. And I appreciated how relaxed the voices are in the game. Because in real life, that's how it is. No gravely-speaking men all the time all angry and always eager to show who's south pole's bigger on the mic or on the battle-field for that matter.Butttt... yeah. Really all I have to say nicely about this game, it was a boring disappointment to me from start to end. I was hoping, that even though I expected a generic shooter. That it'd be a little bit more different of a approach to a fps shooter, but i'm sorry I did.The thing that probably annoyed me the most is when they threw me in a helicopter in a first-person camera in the drivers seat. I was so excited. I thought I was going to be flying that thing around for that mission. Nope. It was a rollercoaster ride where I just left-clicked on people and sometimes right-clicked if they were being extra mean than their ak-47 wielding fellows.I really don't want to write a honest review that covers the bases for this game. If you want a shooty game, just go get the next CoD or something, it'll have at least zombies or aliens or something. And endless multiplayer matches. As opposed to an older title like this.Anyways, thanks for reading. I don't really blame you if this didn't help your decision to make a purchase or not. Sorry about that, but have a good day.			"

												Jesus this was probably the shortest game I've ever played. It was also so annoyingly ""corridory"" which I normally don't mind, if it's done properly. But in Medal of Honor, you have invisible walls in front of you and you wonder, why in the world you can't simply walk or jump over this small rock. You are also treated like little retard (where you are supposed to create bond with other soldiers I assume) when your mates can climb over a wall perfecly fine but you need their hand.Graphics are really nice and SMOOTH. That's good achievement.I can't say anything about multiplayer since I never played it.I can't believe they actually ask 30 bucks for this. Don't buy this unless it's 5 bucks! I'm serious. I think I got this from Humble Bundle or something... it's not horrible game but for original price it's an absolute rip off.			"

												A 3 hour game where you are linearly railroaded into mindlessly slaughtering hundreds if not thousands of “taliban” which for all I know could just be some local villagers.If this game is true to life, you know where America’s military budget goes. Advanced weaponry, such as Hellfire missiles are used on small targets like mortar encampments. You use a seemingly endless minigun to mow down the insurgents for 10 straight minutes and in no way feel under threat.So easy was Medal of Honor that I managed to go through most of it without using scopes or ironsights, hitting the local townspeople in the leg for the game to report me getting a headshot. I did a couple of missions, then suddenly it was all over without me breaking a sweat.The game looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ which is hard to do with an engine as good as Frostbyte, plays like♥♥♥♥♥♥and has a story so dull and generic that I couldn’t wait to skip the cutscenes. I am so glad I got this game in a Humble Bundle for pretty much nothing. How this was a full price release I will never know.			"

												remember this game is seven years old before you throw away five bucks on it.try to imagine a multiplayer game where no one is playing ever, anytime, anywhere.now, imagine game maps which are so flawed that even if you did have two full teams; one team is always guaranteed to pin the other team down at the spawn point and spawnrape that team with impunity for the entire match with the only requirement for victory being to get into position before the opposing team does. literally, as though the only object of the game is to mercilessly thrash the other team in their spawn area and the team who spawns first is always the winner.that's this game, bruh.

Posted: September 12, 2016
												I've been playing games for over 25 years now and I can safely state that this new interpretation of MoH is the worst FPS I have ever experienced.- Story and dialogue consist of either a) military gibberish that is probably supposed to sound cool and badass but comes off as nothing but incomprehensible and boring or b) cringeworthy and corny exchanges of either patriotic or SUPERRRRRR TOUGH lines. My favorite? Early on you rescue an Afghan, but your men aren't sure if they can trust him:Grunt A: For all we know he set us up a trap. We can't trust this guy!Grunt B: You're right. Hurr durr.Tariq (the Afghan): I have a daughter, I want her to live in freedom.All grunts together: Oh, ok, now we trust you. You're cool.- Your playing field is EXTREMELY limited despite many areas appearing to be open. So you're just blocked by measly small boulders and the likes. Some you can hop over, some you can't. Have fun finding out which are which.- Despite the pipe-shaped levels it is sometimes way too easy to miss the exact spot you need to step on in order to trigger the next event.- Occasionally these triggers are even bugged, forcing you to reload from a checkpoint. Once, for example, my men told me to secure a hut...in a village full of huts that basically all look the same. So I approach each and every one multiple times to no avail. After I (on purpose) blew myself up with a grenade suddenly my men didn't just stop, but pushed on.- Moments that are supposed to stand out are even worse than the general gameplay. Directing missiles and whatnot from far away for minutes is pure valium; sniping is tedious and the game obviously acknowledges it by pushing you towards your targets if you can't find them within the low resolution, all-lookalike mountainsides; and that part where you and your men take cover inside a hut, fending off dozens of Taliban that reduce your cover to little more than a few bricks would even be too ridiculous for a Bugs Bunny cartoon.- mission objectives just kind of pop up all the time and are marked as completed all out of a sudden. You never feel like you're actually accomplishing anything, instead merely pushing forward and letting the game do the rest. And if you ever do get lost because of the game's bugginess, the mission objectives don't give off any useful information as to what to do exactly.- Press F to get pulled up a small ledge by your buddy? What for? It doesn't add ANYTHING to the gameplay and it feels completely out of place when your men can take the same ledge on their own easily. It's just supposed to show off some sort of comradery. Woo, these guys are so cool...- which leads to another downer: None of the soldiers you meet is charismatic or memorable. They either come off as complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that don't give a damn about the values they are supposed to be fighting for but merely loving the fight itself, or they are so forgettable, you won't even remember their names for a minute.- Combat simply doesn't feel good. Weapons don't pack a punch and often you're left wondering if you hit a guy and whether he's just hurt or dead.- Not a single moment in the game sticks out.- a mere 4 hours long- even the ending sucks. The moment I realized the game was about to end was when, ironically, one of your men says ""This is not how it ends."". The rescue mission right at the end of the campaign is probably meant to be some big highlight. Some huge event the whole tension is building up to. Only, it doesn't work that way at all. It just felt like I was in the middle of the game, not like I was nearing the end. Rarely have I seen such an anticlimactic ending, which is made even worse with a stupidly blunt cutscene wrapping things up. Supposedly, teh mountainside is void of enemys (they even outright tell you so), but still we see them bombed to smithereens. Why? Maybe because the director said he'd need some more explosions. And what about the brief segment showing a busy street in peaceful Afghanistan? I haven't got a clue. Maybe worst of all is the Linkin Park song playing afterwards. I like Linkin park, that's not the problem. My issue is that it seems highly out of place. It feels like the song went right over the guy's head who was responsible for licensing songs.How about some other slapstick moments the campaign despite being so short is loaded with?- Airplanes delivering airstrikes magically fly straight through mountains popping back into sight at the other end.- You are supposed to mark a bunker but it won't work? Oh, silly you, what the game really meant for you to do is to mark some nondescript boulder a few metres away from the bunker. Don't worry, the airplanes are still going to hit the bunker, not the boulder.- Your highly specialized teammate opens up a door to a dark tunnel? I'm sure he'll do it carefully, taking cover and using flashlights or thermovision. Oh, too bad, he just stands in the entrance - upright - and shouts ""oh, it's so dark in there"" only to get shot.Bottom line: Horrible game that is in no way realistic, but tries its best to convey such an image and thus sacrifices gameplay. So in the end it gets neither right.At least the so-called Tier 1 mode is a nice idea. Here, you replay the SP missions, aiming for fast times, earning medals in the process. If only the gameplay mechanics would make for a better foundation.			"

												After plowing a few levels into this shooter, I can't recommend it in any fashion. The shooting feels clunky, with unrealistic sounds and recoil, and the extremely linear trainride of a level design doesn't help it at all.

I was sucked into the story which revolves around a US Ranger team that pwnz and gets pwn3d.  As the story unravels you'll find yourself being emmersed in it and don't wanna stop and you just can't wait to see what happens next.  Not a bad game and very much worth the play.  If you've played CoD's SP campaign this one probably isn't much different.  Oh, and it has MP, but I skipped it and went on to my next game.			"

												Medal of Honor is another game in the growing list of drudgingly boring modern military shooters. The level design is bland and uninspired, the gameplay is boring and monotonous, and frankly, the game is overall rather broken. I played through the first handful of missions on hard mode, running around without regard for my character's well-being, avoiding cover and simply rushing my enemies. Also, I was using the pistol the entire time (Imagine the style one would play older shoot-em-up type games, like Doom; that's how terrible the AI is) This got me through completely fine, and the only time I died was when one of my computer controlled allies threw a grenade at me and ultimately killed me.Addendum, this game is not very good. Unless you are into modern military shooters with very simple objectives and straightforward gameplay, then this game is not for you.			"

												It's an okay game, the AI is not very good and sometimes you'll just die out of nowhere, the knife is far too powerful and you remain in the animation after you've stabbed somebody leading to many deaths. If you carry on stabbing you won't go on to a different person, you will continue stabbing the original person. When a knife is an instakill this seems a bit pointless. It's a fairly visually appealing game with pretty good voice acting, however the storyline is thus far nonexistent.			"

												After a mere 55 minutes into the medal of honor campaign I have to say this:This is the least fun i've had shooting people in the face. MoH has nothing good about it:The story isn't told well so I didn't really know what was going on. The characters aren't likable. The gunplay is boring and buggy (i shot a guy out a turret which continued to fire until I died staring at it). Overall the game's a boring mess, and I'd recommend skipping out of the 55 minutes I spent. 2/10 would not bang			"

												Medal of Honor is, without any exaggeration, the most bland game I have ever seen in my entire life. It is repetitive, there is no story, gameplay is extremely basic and no feeling of progression as you go through the extremely short (5 hours in my case) game.The game is set entirely in Afghan tundra, with the exception of one urban level and another one set in an airbase and although  tundra is not a common environment in videogames, it is extremely overused here. Gameplay consists of simple first-person shooter action broken up by vechile sections. There was nothing in that respect that I haven't seen before. The story was so extremely uninteresting that I forgot it in it's entirety inbetween playing it and writing this review and although that was some time, I can say with certainity that there was no thing going on for the entire duration of the game. I was simply doing stuff without any form of greater context, so my memory of it all is now a miasma of brown deserts with equally brown-uniformed men trodding around while firing the same boring guns at other brown men. The only thing I remembered was one nice moment where you were given the impression that you would be overwhelmed by the enemy in a lengthy standoff, but the opportunity for the game to do something interesting is wasted when you are saved by a helicopter at the last moment. But without doubt the worst moment in the entire story aspect is when I didn't realise the game was over untill the end credits appeared. I seriously was just playing a mission as difficult or interesting as all the other ones untill all of a sudden a cutscene came up where I found some guy dead who I had to rescue since the moment the game had reached 50% of it's runtime. Then the game just stopped. In other words, a story thread that only spanned part of the game was resolved and for some reason the game took the moment to run off in it's entirety. Nothing I did in the first half of the game changed anything meaningful about the rest of the game. Then I tried the multiplayer. Although I have to admit that my brief experience was satisfying, that was mostly because of that I found that I was better at it than most playing. That is not a weird thing, considering that all you do in the multiplayer is run around and shoot eachother in microscopic environments. Therefore noone who plays first person shooters regularly is still playing that, which explains my experience. After 20 minutes I was done, I quit and never returned.If you ask me, this game is just boring. I would not recommend that you pay money for it at all to play it.			"

It's a more realistic kinda game compared to call of duty, but it's pretty short. I'm talking ""shorter than max payne"" short. 5 hours short.In a way it sort of make sense; the mission is screwed up and the latter half of the game is just trying to save soldiers and then pull out. you wouldn't want to spend dozens of hours in a place where 95% of the people wants you dead.Still, if you see it on sale for cheap, grab it. it won't kill you.

												This game is showing its age. Graphic were decent for its day, but today characters look disjointed against the environment. There are much older games that feel more cohesive. Gameplay itself is very linear and stiff. There is a a lean out of cover mechanic which is nice, but it almost never matters. It is usually was a viable strategy to stand in a hail of bullets to pick off my targets. Except in some open environments where the AI gets a crackshot at my skull from a mile away. Story is stale, but has its moments of pure ""'Murica"". Multiplayer is dead as far as I can tell. Probably not worth picking up unless it is dirt cheap or free.			"

												The only great feature was the story; solid story progression with a progressive sense of achievement and a large number of (mostly) fun to watch cut scenes. However, the game play itself was only okay, and there were a few minor terrain glitches/bugs. Some required actions weren't entirely clear, which got annoying at times. Graphics were acceptable, but nothing spectacular (some of the cut scenes had superb graphics, though). Also, the game itself only takes about 4-5 hours to complete, so the campaign is a bit short. The multiplayer hit registers are frustrating. Bottom line: it was worth the $15.00 I paid for it, but I don't think it was worth much more. If you are looking for a better single player FPS experience with similar progression and game play style, I recommend Bad Company 2. A few other great and fairly recent FPS single player campaigns include Crysis 2, Metro 2033, and Call of Duty: Black Ops. If I were to rate Medal of Honor, I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.			"

												I didn't think I was going to like this game after reading some of the reviews. The single player campaign was surprisingly good. The only blemish is the enemy spawning. There are a few sections where the enemies will spawn indefinitely unless you advance your position. It ruins the willing suspension of disbelief for those sections of the game, although it should be noted that the enemy spawning didn't make the game unfair. It's just that enemy respawning indefinitely is an outdated convention. I would have given the single player campaign a 9/10 if not for that single blemish. Still, I had a lot of fun playing the game. The weapons were some of the best I've ever used in a FPS war game and the action was always engaging. The story was typical, but how many of us play FPS's for their story? The campaign was short; six hours tops, but it was never boring. The graphics were excellent and the explosion effects were second to none. I don't know why this game was reviewed so poorly. I didn't play in multiplayer, so consider this review only if you are interested in the single player campaign. 8.5/10			"

												The campaign is fun despite being rather short, but it does feel a bit more like an actual war than in the older Medal of Honor games and some of the Call of Duty games. The campaign does have a fairly good story between each group of characters, but doesn't really clarify any reason for being in the location you're in in the first place, which is a shame. The cutscenes are fairly good, and later on do have good amounts of drama and atmosphere. The biggest downside was the allied AI. At times they were incredibly useful for killing enemies but at other times they could be useless by trying to kill an enemy but continuously firing at an object that was in the way, or by blocking you from getting back into cover when you need it. I'd also remove the infinite ammo on the pistol, since that makes little sense. I'd give the game a 7.0/10.			"

												The single player sucks! Very boring. Nothing special happens in the single player mode, it's just go shoot guys. Guys spawn randomly and there are certain missions where they just keep coming and it's boring. I've played older MoH games where the single player game was some of the BEST missions in any game. This game lacks any compelling features. Guns are boring, meaning they are the guns in EVERY other game. You get a gun that has a grenade launcher but you can't shoot it. Missions are just run here and now here and done. I feel like this game was rushed and no one cared about it. What a shame since every other MoH game was awesome. Nothing immersive about this game at all, the sound is very bland and the environments are ""meh"". What a boring game. And it last about 3 hours.			"

												You're a Tier One operator, you're on active duty in Afghanistan and your name is... Rabbit?This Medal of Honor game reeks of Call of Duty influence, except sadly the gameplay isn't as fluid as Call of Duty's and the campaign isn't as interesting either. Down to the stupid player character names (Rabbit = Soap anyone?), it's clear EA tried to revive a classic series and bring it back to life to compete with the big boys. Unfortunately, they failed and we're left with a generic FPS game set in the brown 'n' bloom desert. With an unengaging plot which tries too hard with it's cutscenes, there's little to push you to press forward in the campaign. Enemy AI is garbage too, leading to mostly dull fights in the streets, rooftops and warehouses of Afghanistan. The guns look nice, and feel good to shoot. They even sound nice. It's just a shame they're stuck in this game. Graphics can be appealing at times but mostly the dull uninspired enviroments leave a lot to be desired, and the lack of graphics options in the main menu was a let down as I had no way to reduce the jaggies which soured my experience a little.In conclusion, EA tried to create a Call of Duty killer yet only managed to spawn a generic, drab, uninspired FPS set in the desert which spells boring enviroments -a-palooza and tries to pull you in with a cliché and boring story. Avoid.			"

												Medal of Honor™ is such a good game, especially if you are searching for an arcade FPS that don't requires too many battle skills or experience in the war genre. May you can get a little of challenge playing on Hard Mode, but the AI isn't so clever, by the way is pretty simple to kill your enemies... all you have to do is to crouch behind a stone and shot on your enemy direction. He will not try to kill you, unless you wait 20 seconds looking to him. Single-player campaign is kind of involving, but is short. Medal of Honor™ is better than the precedents games of the title, and it's available on Steam for a really interesting price. Don't wait for the most incredible FPS that you'll play on your life, he absolutely is not, but he can give you some hours of good fun.			"

												[This review only covers single-player campaign.]This entry in the MoH series is EA's blatant attempt to copy Call of Duty. Unfortunately, the game does a lot of things wrong.Things I disliked:- Lack of information. Where are we fighting? Why do we even fight and shoot everyone in sight? Who are the enemies who are simply labeled as ""bad guys""? One mission even puts you in a helicopter with machine gun and Hellfire rockets and your objective is to kill all ""bad guys"" on the ground who desperately try to fight back with AK-74 rifles. - The player is part of an overpowered squad which takes down literally hundreds of ""bad guys"" while listening to praise from squad mates such as ""Nice!"", ""Good kill!"", etc. The result is almost as off-puting as Spec Ops: The Line - however, in case of MoH it is probably unintentional.- The campaign is a bunch of missions glued together with almost no story.- The game is way too easy, even on the highest difficulty; squad mates are immortal and can deal with anything.- A.I. is simply idiotic. Majority of enemies don't use cover and just stand in the open. Many of those who are smarter and decide to go for cover decide to constantly switch between standing, crouching and lying.- Hitboxes don't make sense. 5 bullets in the neck? No problem! 2 bullets in foot? Impossible to survive.- Player's character is unable to climb or do any action unless told to do so.- ""Press F to receive ammo"" (by asking a squad mate) doesn't work 95 % of the time. However, if it works, the squad mates can provide anything - rifle or machine gun bullets, sniper rounds, rockets ...Things I liked:- The campaign only takes 4-5 hours to beat (on the hardest difficulty).- The gameplay is smooth and feels good; the same with weapons.- Graphics & physics. Mountain ranges provide beautiful vistas and destructible parts of environment make the shootouts interesting.- Contrary to everything mentioned above, 2 missions (out of 10) were well designed and felt pretty great (especially when compared to the rest). Specifically, they were missions 5 (Belly of the Beast) and 9 (Neptune's Net).			"

												The story campaign of MoH takes about 5 hours or less. While it starts off strong and is less over the top and more realistic than Call of Duty, it also feels tone deaf and starts to meander toward the end, eventually just throwing sheer numbers at you until you explode your way to a confusing and unsatisfying outro. There were more than a few glitches in the scripting that would have me loading past checkpoints because I hit an apparent dead end or endlessly respawning enemies with no chance of progress. On the reset eventually a cinematic event would start that never happened the first or second or time around that would unlock the next part of the map or start a cutscene. There's a stealthy sort of mission halfway through that would not let me get the drop on the bad guys quietly from any approach. The game itself would crash every other time I started it up and a couple of times in-game. I didn't touch the ""Tier 1"" mode or multiplayer but I'm guessing that's not as fun as CoD, either. (Plus I didn't feel like setting up yet another exclusive game account so EA can track my stats.)			"

												As a person who has no history with the franchise, I quite enjoyed Medal of Honor. It is nothnig but a highlight reel. Don't expect story or characters. It's just a bunch of cool scenes cut together like in a Michael Bay movie, but better... Hence I can actually recommend this.On Hard difficulty first time it was 4 hours of campaign. That's pretty shallow, so it's definitely not worth more than 10 dollars. But for 10$, it's a pretty good 4 hours.			"

												Feels like playing COD or Battlefield, it has an engaging story though. I can't tell the difference between these FPS shooters, they all look quite the same. Medal of Honor was released when the gaming scene saturated with lots of military FPS shooter, no thanks to annual release of COD. I didn't even bothered to play the multiplayer, let alone the Tier 1 mode in the single player campaign. The fact that I completed the game in 4 hours doesn't do well for this title.			"

												Single Player comments only.This MoH has a good few flaws BUT it isn't an awful game, not by a wide margin. The campaign is a tad predictable but it's far better than the follow-up MoH Warfighter which is truly pathetic on all levels. If the notion of a modern FPS gets you going, if you are vaguely interested in the war in Afghanistan and if you like simple straight-up FPS shooters then there are a LOT worse on offer than this!

												MoH falls short of being a game I'd highly recommend.This FPS is one you should only buy if you really have some cash left over, it is in no way shape or form a must have or must play game, if you never have played it you will not have missed out on anything.The SP is pretty decent and had a nice old-school semi-realistic feel. However it is plagued with simple design flaws, annoying glitches and bugs, terrible AI (both enemy and allied) and through most of the game it feels like your team mates do a bit too much or are always in the places you want to be.The MP feels pretty clunky and is not at all refined. Lacks the polish that even Black Ops has, while DICE might have developed or helped development on the MP it sure does not show much. Bad Company 2's MP is far superior in every way.			"

												I wish I could go into some depth, however, after a rather cinematic start,  I could barely progress in this game due to the fact that mission essential npc's (who you have to follow around to progress the level) tend to get stuck in walls, or go wandering off trying to find paths that don't exist. I watched a guy try walking through a lampost for about 5mins, only for him to appear suddenly stuck in a wall infront of me. Buggy as hell, avoid, wasting your money..etc. It is a disgrace that a game is even released in such a state.			"

												The most under-rated FPS experience of the last 10 years.  This is such a phenomenally brilliant and well balanced shooter that even after two new Call of Duty games and two Battlefield games I still find myself coming back to it.  It's sad that Black Ops came out so soon after it was released or else more content would have been available to help entertain the fickle gamer fanbase.  If you can find it on sale, it is worth the time and money put into it.			"

												Quick, small, and grity 'CoD' like maps make for an interesting game. However, the lack of many weapon choices, or a deeper class system, make you yearn for a better game. So do yourself a favor, skip MoH, and purchase Bad Company 2 instead. MoH is great, and I spent many hours playing the beta, and providing feedback, but it just doesn't feel as polished as Bad Company does. If MoH ever drops in price during a Steam sale, then I would recommend grabbing it. If not, there are better options out there.			"

That kind of thing. The story was basically a movie where I follow around a soldier guy and pointed my gun where he wanted me to point it. I hear that this is kind of realistic but imo it didn't make for a great game. If its cheap there are worse ways to waste a couple bucks.

												MOH puts you into the shoes (well... boots in this case) of a highly trained SEAL team of 4 men mostly throughout the game. As you progress, you get to play different characters in different scenarios in this one warzone. This allowed players to experience the tension of a battlefield... although there's the typical FPS progression in the game, it managed to feel entertaining and engaging despite some bugs. It's good for a nice short bundle of entertainment, if you don't expect that much of it.3 out of 5.			"

												this was obviously a mix between battlefield and COD..sadly to say it kinda wasnt the best of both..disliked at how frequent i was kicked out of a lobby just because i was killing alot of people and the guns felt so clunky, slow and no really any umph to them..wasnt to fond of how each side had thier own type of gun and you couldnt just stick with the same gun every game..

												This game is so rail-roaded that you might as well be playing House of the Dead. There is zero freedom in how you approach situations, and if the game doesn't like how you're doing things, it just throws grossly over-powered enemies at you until you die.24 hours after I post the review, the game stops working completely, even going so far as to crash Steam when I try to start it. Quality work.			"

												Most non involved FPS game I have ever played. Hard difficulty consists of wander about with a shotgun at the hip, point and click at any enemy and they are down, finished first level without getting hit except by the MG nests which still failed to kill me. Alot of hand holding the entire way through, team mates do everything for you. Its just, uninvolved and plain boring to play.			"

I recently just tried to play it.  it was fun at first... until I realized the enemies NEVER shoot at your team members.. always focusing on you.  it might as well be a rail shooter.. something like crash freakin bandicoot where you find yourself being trapped by invisible walls ALL the damn time.  i also got annoyed by the crap choice of weapons for the 'missions' and their scripting and very dull sensitivity for their triggers.  I literally had to get face to face with a team member in a really awkward position before the scripting detected my presence. Just... no. MoH.. I had hopes but you let me down.			"

												Medal of Honor is another game in the growing list of drudgingly boring modern military shooters. The level design is bland and uninspired, the gameplay is boring and monotonous, and frankly, the game is overall rather broken. I played through the first handful of missions on hard mode, running around without regard for my character's well-being, avoiding cover and simply rushing my enemies. Also, I was using the pistol the entire time (Imagine the style one would play older shoot-em-up type games, like Doom; that's how terrible the AI is) This got me through completely fine, and the only time I died was when one of my computer controlled allies threw a grenade at me and ultimately killed me.Addendum, this game is not very good. Unless you are into modern military shooters with very simple objectives and straightforward gameplay, then this game is not for you.			"

												This review is for the single player game.  Great looking game.  Gunplay is good, not great.  Single player game isn't too long, but that's not a big deal.  The story is just ok. It's well modelled and voiced.  The biggest problem with it is that that it often handholds you and puts you on rails when you wish it wouldn't and when they throw in some odd new mechanic where you actually could use a screentip ... it's not there.  Can be frustrating.  Can't recommend it at full price but if you can get it on a decent discount it should give you 4 or 5 hours of entertainment.			"

												Alright; I think you should know what you are in for with this game. Because despite it marketing itself as a hard as nails, top tier, hardcore shooter - it is nothing more than a CoD-ified matinée blockbuster experience. Explosions a plenty, regenerating health all over the place and more guns than you could shake a stick at.That said; I don't think there is anything wrong with that.I am one of those wierd people who genuinly enjoy the Call of Duty and Battlefield campaigns; I love cheesy war movies and I have spent more than my fair share of time just reading about guns on wikipedia, and for what it is, I, for some reason I really like this game. Like, a lot.Now; let me get this straight - there are a lot of flaws apparent here. Flaws that I, in any other game, would find extremely annoying, such as EXTREME liniarity, lack of an FOV slider and a campaign about as long as your average Lord of The Rings movie. There really isn't anything special about this game and I shouldn't like it, because when I look at it, it just seems to blend in as an average CoD clone. But when I play it; it just feels right.I think it is the settings that the game places you in; the characters all fill their sterotypical roles, but does it well and, just like Call of Duty 3, you learn to feel the comraderie between them. That, mixed with some of the most memorable moments in gaming places this game as a favourite of mine.Performance wise I don't think there will be a problem; it runs well on my rig (i7 4979K 4.0GHz, GTX 980, 16GB RAM), maxed out and I think any modern computer should be able to handle it.I think you have to be a military nut to like this game; because it is essentially just softcore porn for the military interested. And, even though I wouldn't mind paying the 19,99€ that it currently is, I would recommending holding of on a sale as there isn't that much content present here. There is a multiplayer mode (that I loved on the Xbox), but I doubt there is much of a crowd left playing it.			"

												Good singleplayer campaign. I enjoyed the actual fighting that seemed balanced and not completely ♥♥♥♥ing stupid like the Call Of Duty single player, where turning up difficulty = just spawn more enemies until your being zerged.Enemies were fun to kill. Maybe thats just because they are stupid hajii's. Regardless, it's a good linear style game. Some nice weapons to choose from. Good graphics, effects, voice acting, weapon sounds, etc. I enjoyed the radio chatter as it was pretty authentic to real life comm's.A lot of the game you were suppose to be stealthy and♥♥♥♥♥♥but I apparently sucked at that because I just wanted to shoot ♥♥♥♥ers dead. It probably made it a bit more difficult, but you can play either way you want.The only thing I disliked was that there really was no resolution to the ""story"" -- it was just a string of missions that followed 2 or 3 different ""groups"" of soldiers (rangers, seals, and iirc one more). Other than that 5/5 for getting to kill terrorists yay			"

												Quality? Or quantity?Medal of Honor, a game about seals, rangers and all the other man and woman who served their country. Regardlessly the game is 5 years old, the graphics didn't sucks. The game run smoothly and the gameplay was fun. Although the gameplay only last 4 hours (Or less), the story was well made, fluent. Meaningful meaning are behind the story. Weapons are good, game mechanic are also good. I've played multi-player long time ago, still the gameplay are COD alike but more or less, it's still better than COD.Anyway, there is some user-friendly issues going on. Like a mission which needs you to press ""4"" to fire the hellfire, they didn't mention it. And the ""Left"" key for M320 is hard to press. Also some stealth mission are tought for some players, for me as a FPS gamer, I just shoot though the mission with ease.Rating: 9/10Recommendation on playing the game: Absolutly!Nevertheless, quality is always better than quantity. Instead of 10hours of bullcrap gameplay? I would rather choose a 4hours really nice gameplay. It just like watching a movie.			"

												Medal of Honor returns with the new Medal of Honor 2010! This game has a good solid story, fantastic graphics ( DICE ftw ) and good aiming system! I believe this is a must buy for any FPS lover! The Multiplayer still has a lot of servers with people playing ( June 2015 ) so I guess you will spent plenty of time in the competitive maps against real players! Overall I believe Medal of Honor 2010 is a very well made video game for a great Series! Definitely reccomended!			"

												Medal of Honor... where do I begin? For starters, it's a typical modern FPS game. You shoot some bad guys, wait for your AI team to open a door and then carry on shooting some bad guys. It's not worth what Steam charge at full price, but if it drops down to around £3 in a sale it is worth picking up. Multiplayer, it's alright...not the best I've seen but it's certainly playable. There isn't much in Storywise, you won't be buying it for that. You'll be buying it to...you guessed it...shoot some bad guys.			"

												Alright; I think you should know what you are in for with this game. Because despite it marketing itself as a hard as nails, top tier, hardcore shooter - it is nothing more than a CoD-ified matinée blockbuster experience. Explosions a plenty, regenerating health all over the place and more guns than you could shake a stick at.That said; I don't think there is anything wrong with that.I am one of those wierd people who genuinly enjoy the Call of Duty and Battlefield campaigns; I love cheesy war movies and I have spent more than my fair share of time just reading about guns on wikipedia, and for what it is, I, for some reason I really like this game. Like, a lot.Now; let me get this straight - there are a lot of flaws apparent here. Flaws that I, in any other game, would find extremely annoying, such as EXTREME liniarity, lack of an FOV slider and a campaign about as long as your average Lord of The Rings movie. There really isn't anything special about this game and I shouldn't like it, because when I look at it, it just seems to blend in as an average CoD clone. But when I play it; it just feels right.I think it is the settings that the game places you in; the characters all fill their sterotypical roles, but does it well and, just like Call of Duty 3, you learn to feel the comraderie between them. That, mixed with some of the most memorable moments in gaming places this game as a favourite of mine.Performance wise I don't think there will be a problem; it runs well on my rig (i7 4979K 4.0GHz, GTX 980, 16GB RAM), maxed out and I think any modern computer should be able to handle it.I think you have to be a military nut to like this game; because it is essentially just softcore porn for the military interested. And, even though I wouldn't mind paying the 19,99€ that it currently is, I would recommending holding of on a sale as there isn't that much content present here. There is a multiplayer mode (that I loved on the Xbox), but I doubt there is much of a crowd left playing it.			"

Buy CoD. EA really failed. Before it was one of the leading gaming companies, now it's making money with epic trailers. Probably only upside of the game are the graphics, assuming that the game is from 2010, or maybe it's just my epic graph card.

												I've played this game in full on Ps3 and i can honestly say that the game itself is not bad. It's worth the play at the very least but the reason i can't recommend this..specifically for pc...is because i have been plagued with the ""General Protection Fault"" error. I can't run the single player and the multiplayer launches but does not allow me to create an account and the one time is somehow did let me it crashed only to have to revisit the problem. My specs exceed the requirements and i've followed every possible troubleshoot i could find to attempt resolving this but to no avail. Be Warned.If you buy this for pc it very well may be a waste of money because it may very well not work. I've read many others who have said the same thing and i'm one of them. Goodluck to you all.

In today's world we pay $12 to go see a movie in 3d and that only lasts 2 hours tops. 6 hours of entertaInment was worth it to me.

												The singleplayer is linear, the gunplay is almost a run-and-gun despite having lean mechanics. There are quite a few breaks where the game gives you a minigame where you mark targets for a gunship to fire upon. Gunplay:Walking bloom is not very high and so the run-and-gun playstyle is a possibility. The game also lets you play safer with leaning if you'd prefer that instead. The ammo is infinite if you use the guns you start with on each mission, as you can just ask your teammate for a full set of ammo and you'll get it quickly. Recoil is almost nonexistent and bloom is mostly negligible for most weapons, especially if you can control your firing. Because of this, spraying-and-praying is also a possible play style. If you pick up an enemy weapon, you'll have to get your own ammo from other enemy guns.Difficulty:This game is pretty easy, even on the hardest difficulty. Because of the difficulty and the easy gunplay, I found myself dying simply because I was running and gunning like I was playing DOOM or Shadow Warrior; in other words, I got bored and found myself running far ahead of my team in more open areas to clear a room quickly. You can move and clear so quickly that you may find youself shooting enemies that haven't even settled down to shoot at you yet, or enemies that are still looking at your teammates while you kill him from behind. In short, it's pretty easy if you don't play like an idiot.Graphics:Very meh. Nothing particularly nasty, nothing noteworthy. There are enemy spawn-points in the game where enemeis come out of when you are fighting in the open. Some of these rooms do not render light by intention and are almost completely dark, which is inconsistent.Conclusion:The gunplay is nothing special and quite boring, and the difficulty is too low. Even though I spent less than a dollar on it (through a Humble Bundle) I would personally not buy this game, even on sale. There are some that would be entertained by it, though.5/10, incredibly average.			"

												I only dealt with the single player campaign, so this review will focus solely on that. Multiplayer seems dead anyway.Gameplay is simplistic, it definitely holds your hand the entire way. Maps and levels are very linear, few options can be taken to approach a situation. You'll never run out of ammo except when the game forces you to, and there's no reason to ever pick up a gun that it also doesn't tell you you should. It follows many of the standard tropes and mechanics you'd find in similar FPS'. The campaign is dreadfully short, four to five hours maximum unless you're absolutely horrid at FPS, in which case you're probably not going to play it anyway. It's also absurdly easy. I was, however, immersed in it. I felt the feels, I felt the tension, the atmosphere for each scene was honestly well put together. But with everything else, I would not play this game for a great shooter experience. It's certainly not worth $20 - $5, maybe. If you have a couple hours to spare, enjoy some mildly touching story about soldiers in war and brotherhood, you can pick it up when it's on sale and have a casual interactive movie, more or less. One that you may or may not see again, so if you can get it even cheaper, that'd be better. $5 max, though.			"

												Finished the campaign in 4 hours, it felt exactly like every other DICE game I've played. In fact, there were moments where I could have sworn I was playing COD:Black Ops. This game has nothing unique, nothing to set it apart from every other shooter. It had a lot of bugs which were game breaking (I had to restart entire missions). The only thing it has going for it is the nice graphics with the desctructable environments, and a fast paced storyline filled with characters that you become relatively attatched to. I would only recomend the purchase if it were on sale...like a really damn good sale, like 90% off.Maybe multiplayer has more to offer...			"

												[This review only covers single-player campaign.]This entry in the MoH series is EA's blatant attempt to copy Call of Duty. Unfortunately, the game does a lot of things wrong.Things I disliked:- Lack of information. Where are we fighting? Why do we even fight and shoot everyone in sight? Who are the enemies who are simply labeled as ""bad guys""? One mission even puts you in a helicopter with machine gun and Hellfire rockets and your objective is to kill all ""bad guys"" on the ground who desperately try to fight back with AK-74 rifles. - The player is part of an overpowered squad which takes down literally hundreds of ""bad guys"" while listening to praise from squad mates such as ""Nice!"", ""Good kill!"", etc. The result is almost as off-puting as Spec Ops: The Line - however, in case of MoH it is probably unintentional.- The campaign is a bunch of missions glued together with almost no story.- The game is way too easy, even on the highest difficulty; squad mates are immortal and can deal with anything.- A.I. is simply idiotic. Majority of enemies don't use cover and just stand in the open. Many of those who are smarter and decide to go for cover decide to constantly switch between standing, crouching and lying.- Hitboxes don't make sense. 5 bullets in the neck? No problem! 2 bullets in foot? Impossible to survive.- Player's character is unable to climb or do any action unless told to do so.- ""Press F to receive ammo"" (by asking a squad mate) doesn't work 95 % of the time. However, if it works, the squad mates can provide anything - rifle or machine gun bullets, sniper rounds, rockets ...Things I liked:- The campaign only takes 4-5 hours to beat (on the hardest difficulty).- The gameplay is smooth and feels good; the same with weapons.- Graphics & physics. Mountain ranges provide beautiful vistas and destructible parts of environment make the shootouts interesting.- Contrary to everything mentioned above, 2 missions (out of 10) were well designed and felt pretty great (especially when compared to the rest). Specifically, they were missions 5 (Belly of the Beast) and 9 (Neptune's Net).			"

												Single Player comments only.This MoH has a good few flaws BUT it isn't an awful game, not by a wide margin. The campaign is a tad predictable but it's far better than the follow-up MoH Warfighter which is truly pathetic on all levels. If the notion of a modern FPS gets you going, if you are vaguely interested in the war in Afghanistan and if you like simple straight-up FPS shooters then there are a LOT worse on offer than this!

So you can imagine my suprise and dissapointment when I hopped into the multiplayer client. It seems to have been made by entirely different people, people who seemingly did not even have any contact with the single player devs. It isn't even really the same game, you cannot even sidestep while running...

												This is hands down one of the best shooters I've ever played on PC, even considering its age. Fun, tactical, and more realistic than most (keeping in mind that it is still a video game), the single-player campaign is something I still come back to and play every once in a while. It's unfortunately short, however.Multiplayer was ok back in the day, but it's been eclipsed by every other similar game that's come out since then.RECCOMMEND?: If you want an amazing military shooter single-player story experience, definately.

												I had almost given up on this game and come to write an incendiary review after the first few missions. So let's get it out of the way: this game is far from perfect.Mouse sensitivity is awkward, it feels fast for small movements and slow for big ones. The AI is pretty weak, as even on hard difficulty, ennemies still seem to think running right in front of you and kneeling before even raising their gun is a good idea (they're not actually surrendering), and they severely suffer from the stormtrooper syndrome (better not shoot the hero). You're the only guy in your squad of elite badass soldiers that really shoots down more than one enemy per encounter. The early missions felt uncompelling and lacking in purpose, with some painfully obvious script checkpoints—that sometimes forget to trigger, forcing you to restart the last sequence. The quad sequences (only one mission) are both eventless and clunky.It gets much better however, and I'm glad I stuck around for it. You get used to the control awkwardness. You live the extraordinary landscape. The ennemies start to feel like they invariably punish you for leaving exposed body parts stick out. Your squad doesn't feel useless anymore. The missions finally get purpose, and I played through the most engaging and memorable FPS sequences I ever played.I can't speak for the multiplayer part that I didn't play.This game is extremely backloaded. It is such a waste that all the bad things about the game appear at the beginning, when it surely drives many players away before they can get to the juicy bits. So if you decide to give this game a chance (and you should), make sure you don't give up on it too easy.Keep in mind, however, that the campaign is very short—I'd wait for a sale if short games make you feel bitter.

												I started playing this game not expecting much.  Then the only reason I continued playing it was just because I could laugh at it.  And then I realized that trying to laugh at it was just making me slowly die inside.  So having finally uninstalled it, here are some of the main things that I find completely ridiculous in this game: Apparently your character's arms are made of wet spaghetti noodles, because while your squadmates have no trouble lifting their arms above their head and hauling themselves onto a ledge, you have to get one of them to boost you up by running over and pressing a button. The game shatters all attempts at being taken seriously when it chooses to call these helping hands ""buddy boosts"". The plot is dull, the voice acting lifeless (and bad in places), and expects you to care about a bunch of guys whose ""names"" go from the semi-reasonable (Voodoo) to the hilariously ridiculous (Mother).  Ex: Mother: Okay, we have to go do the thing and then the thing and the stuff.  Voodoo: Thanks, Mom.  Me: YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO THINK THIS IS ALL GRITTY AND SERIOUS?!?! The game restricts you at every turn.  There was a point where I tried to enter a house with a wide open door.  I could see inside!  And yet the doorway was just an invisible wall.  Note that this is not always the case, but still...If you can't enter somewhere, just close the door!  On another occasion, I was walking along a cliff and decided to try and jump off - you know, for science.  NOPE.  Invisible wall.  No fence or wall that would be a reasonable blockade - nothing that justified me not being able to do this.  Just the developers saying, ""We don't want you to go over there, but we're too lazy to actually show you that."" BUDDY BOOSTS. At one point, your character gets blood splattered on his face, and the camera shows blood splats.  Keep in mind that your character is not wearing goggles, thereby implying he has blood on his eyes.  Then your squadmate comes over and magically wipes the blood away!  Thanks for molesting my eyeballs, buddy. The pistol is hilariously overpowered.  I went through entire sections of the game just going crazy with it.  It has enough range that you can snipe people from decently far away, it shoots quite fast, and it has infinite ammo (unlike your other weapons). FREAKING BUDDY BOOSTS. When the game does give you a bit of freedom, it's ridiculous how quickly it can fall apart.  There was a part where I ran ahead of my squad, shot everyone in the area while my team was monologuing, and then ran to the back of the area while the next scene triggered.  After an air strike came through, I pulled out a grenade and counted it off.  After a couple of seconds, I hurled it into a seemingly empty alcove, where a moment later, about five enemy fighters spawned and were immediately blown up. Your squadmates can and often will play the game for you.  There were times were I ran into an area, fired off some shots to get the enemy's attention, and then crouched behind a wall while my squad took out everyone.  Word of advice, devs: Making the player feel completely irrelevant to a game's outcome does not make them want to keep playing. THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CALL THEM BUDDY BOOSTS WHO THE HELL WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT?!?!?!?!In addition, the plot is dull, the graphics aren't anything special (hooray...gray...), the sound is unremarkable (my friend commented that a hail of gunfire just sounded like hail), and the gameplay is, in many cases, entirely optional.  Just...go play a shooter that actually seems to care about the player.TLDR: THIS GAME SUCKS BECAUSE BUDDY BOOSTS.			"

												This is a great game to buy! I think it's worth <10.-, (I got it for 5 euros on sale).I recommend this game because it plays well and still will give you that desire you request.The game is like 5 years old but plays and looks almost current gen, so its good!It took me around 5 hours to complete the story and I don't rush, so the story isn't long.(I play my games always on hard and on the highest graphic settings when possible.)But the story is nice and the game comes with a separate multiplayer game which is still alive and ♥♥♥♥ing kicking!Again, the graphics look great and the players know they're warfare, damn its some real♥♥♥♥♥♥I really feel like they brought (back?) the Honor in Medal of Honor. The gameplay and story are serious and let you feel how it is to fight in the Middle east. There's allot of militairy jargon and (luckely) no hyper modern weapons. While being in an elite SEAL's team, you'll be pinned down and be sweating ya balls off.The story is actually another linear story where you follow and lead the team on, but its not a bad thing. You can do things your way, and there are enough times where you can choose how to approach enemies. Even when they say you're obliged to NOT shoot anyone and let them pass, you can be that♥♥♥♥♥♥and change the ♥♥♥♥ing story and start a mayhem! Try that in Battlefield or COD.. Also, the NPC's in your team help shooting the bad guys and in most games they shoot like♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they want you too do all the work. In this game they really help you out, communicate well and give you ammo when you ask for it. And everytime you think you are save because of the standard game mechanics in most games... Well think twice before you die and have to retry again. There's allot of (explosive) action and there's a nice amount of stealth which feels awesome and brings the balance in the game. What I really loved about the story is that it felt not over the top in anyway. Then there's the multiplayer, which will give you extra hours of fun if you're into that!			"

												So I purchased this game out of nostalgia for the originals, hoping that at the very least, I would get a good 5-10 hours of a mindless linear shooter campaign in which i could unwind by popping skulls, and half paying attention to an unoriginal story.Unfortunately, it appears that even though my standards were very low, I still set my expectations much too high.  The level design is rather convuluted, and I often found myself trying to figure out where to go.  I guess this shouldn't have been as much of a problem as a lot of the level progression is explained to you by your squad mates.  Unfortunately, for the majority of the game, the entirety of the Dialog was both imperceptable and unitelligable, leaving me feeling lost and confused.  On 3 or 4 occasions, the game got stuck, and failed to load the next mission objective, leaving me confused and frustrated for a few minutes until I figured out what was going on, and re-loaded the game save.Unfortunately, not even the story was able to redeem this game in my eyes.  Unlike most linear first person shooters, Medal of Honor doesn't try to tell some kind of story with a villan and a hero via dialog and cut scenes, but rather it attempts to give the player a ""slice of life experience"".  This is all well and good, however it was not executed well.  As most FPS characters are, the subjects of this game are static characters who neither develop as the game goes on, or are given a chance to really set themselves apart as someone for you to care about.  And since you don't care about the characters, you unfortunately are left not caring about what happens to them, causing the ""slice of life"" arc to fall on deaf ears, and a regretful wallet.			"

												As a US Army veteran, it's easy to see the time which was put into this game to make it as accurate as possible (while still keeping it a game). Although the single-player campaign is short, it plays like a movie with you as the main character(s). Aside from giving us a mere glimpse into the skill of our special operations fighting force, it also shows the level of brotherhood these warriors share and the lengths they would go to in order to protect their own. Although there were a few bugs in the game (respawning into an area where you're killed again in seconds with no way to escape, A.I. trying to walk through walls, shoebox-style gameplay where your movement is limited to a pre-defined area, etc.), these are overshadowed by what I consider to be a great story line. If you're looking for a realistic open-world sandbox style FPS, however, you'd have better luck with the ARMA series. I didn't (and won't) bother with the multiplayer, but I can tell you that if you're looking for a great story-driven FPS, look no further than this game. In the end, it will pull at your emotions and give you a glimpse, even if only briefly, into the mind a our great defenders and silent warriors.			"

Gone are the special effects where buildings collapse and nuclear guns shot homing bullets and aliens invade. In place of it are the grim, hot, sand blinding effects of what war in the middle east looks like. This is tactical, it is effiecent and is as close to a special unit as the average person will get.

												At first the game feels very stiff in how you move and operate, but if you are into realistic shooters, this is the game for you. You >-have<- to use and peek out of cover, check your HUD, melee takedowns aren't just brushing a knife across your enemy's foot, you have to stab them in a vital point. Also, the story is very entertaining, not as stupidly impossible as Black Ops campaigns, but enough to keep you interested. Playing on hard is reccomended for the best feel.			"

												Single player is on UT3 engine and multiplayer is on Frostbie engine.Bothe MP and SP are developed by 2 different teams so MP is graphicaly pretty nice and as for gameplay it is oiously EA's try to make their own CODMW.SIngleplayer is suprisingly ugly and yes I mean in highest settings... game is very consoloited and some times you will just stare shocked form some huge glitches. SP doesnt look even half good as MP, but gameplay isnt that bad. there is lean,prone, fire mods and ironsights, and thats someting what is hard to find in other games.I mean all those 4 features together. At the end I was suprised that overall feeling was nice, Good storyline balanced, dynamic, some cinematic nothing original but nicely done.  But that graphics is big downside. I dont think its worth it's price. So yes play it but wait for sale =)			"

												Having gone into this game with the notion that it would be just like all the other fps campaigns out there , bland ,on the rails and without a good story I must say I was pleasently surprised! I Highly enjoyed the game the characters in the gamae work well and are actualy useful , they will kill enemies give you ammo and point out enemies to you rather than being useless bullet soakers like in other shooters.I also commplement the fact that stealth sections areent forced on you, you can make up for a mistake rather than being condemened to an instant death or loss. The gunplay worked reasonably well and although there is definatly alot to be desired the headshot system is Very satisfying. Finaly I'd like to say that unlike every other fps I have played, (other than halo of course) this ending actualy kind of made me feel sad. I would recommened this although of course it does have it's flaws in the end I found it to be quite the enjoyable campaign, I'd give it a 7/10 as far as its genre is concerned but as a whole a 6/10 is more fitting			"

												This game seems to have alot of negative reviews and im not sure why to be honest..Normally im a Call of Duty guy but Advanced Warfare is terrible so fancied a change and decided to download Medal of Honor Airborne yesterday, reminded me of the CoD:WAW days and i rather enjoyed it so i looked for other types of the Medal of Honour franchise and came across this for like £3 online, so thought it was worth a go for the sake of a few quid and i am pleasently suprised, to me the game has a very CoD4 sort of feel, the missions didnt at all get boring like some FPS games as there is a variety of missions, some are run and gun, some youre a sniper, some your controlling the airsupport and others your in stealth and i think there is a good balance of them all. Graphic wise i think its very good considering the game is 5 years old now (i think) and that may well be down to having a good PC but nevertheless i thought the cinematic scenes and general graphics were a good 8/10, id say on par with the earlier Call of Duty games. For me im not normally a campaign type of person, i just seem to do it when i first get a game just to say its done, then crack on with the online stuff but with this i actually enjoyed it, it didnt seem to short like what Airborne did and didnt seem to long for it to drag on and get tedious, i think all together i completed it in maybe 3-4 hours? so for those asking is it worth it? i would say Yes however would i say the same had i paid full price for the game, hmm maybe. ill see how multiplayer goes first..Update: i dont like multiplayer.

												The games main campaign only took me 3 hours to complete. The game is completely linear. It has a realistic feel to it, although enemies tend to ragdoll when shot down. It had a good variety of missions, vehicle combat, stealth missions, sniper missions, run and gun missions. I haven't tried the multiplayer, or any of the side missions, but the game feels a bit dated compared to Battlefield 3 and even TF2. I got this game during EA's Humble Bundle, so it only cost me $6(with several other games of course). I'd only recommend buying it if you can get it this cheap. 6.5 is my final rating.			"

												This game has an excellent storyling and realistic play.  However, the Singleplayer mission is short and it looks as if they had planned additional content, maybe an expansion or two, but it has not seen the light of day.  That just leave the Multiplayer and Tier 1 missions.  The Tier 1 missions are little bonus missions that could make you a better player by focusing on the core skills needed toparticipate online and in the singleplayer story.  The Multiplayer could use some polishing in many ways, basically just more of the stuff that made Battlefield great.			"

												The only great feature was the story; solid story progression with a progressive sense of achievement and a large number of (mostly) fun to watch cut scenes. However, the game play itself was only okay, and there were a few minor terrain glitches/bugs. Some required actions weren't entirely clear, which got annoying at times. Graphics were acceptable, but nothing spectacular (some of the cut scenes had superb graphics, though). Also, the game itself only takes about 4-5 hours to complete, so the campaign is a bit short. The multiplayer hit registers are frustrating. Bottom line: it was worth the $15.00 I paid for it, but I don't think it was worth much more. If you are looking for a better single player FPS experience with similar progression and game play style, I recommend Bad Company 2. A few other great and fairly recent FPS single player campaigns include Crysis 2, Metro 2033, and Call of Duty: Black Ops. If I were to rate Medal of Honor, I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.			"

From beginning to end it felt like I was in a movie with it's seamless cutscenes, and ability to slide directly into each mission. One of the best games FPS games I've played in years that gets ""it"" right in the campaign and multiplayer. Fun to play and also theraputic if you are an OEF/OIF vet. P.S. The mission where you defend the blown up house stressed me out so much I stopped playing and came back two weeks later to finish it. In my opinion, this is one of the great realistic military FPS up there with Joint Ops, and ARMA.			"

												Campaign - I'll start off with the con's that made what could've been a great game,a good game. Extremely short,took me about 3-4 hours to finish. Very linear gameplay and If you dare try to go off the path,you'll be yelled at or come across invisible walls. Also the AI,both enemy and allie can be extremely♥♥♥♥♥♥at times. The pro's,majority of the game looks really nice. Cut-scene's are good quality! There's not much of a story,but I didn't mind what story there was. Nice cover system,controls are a pleasure to use and headshot's feel rewarding. Some missions where you're surrounded and bunkered down can feel pretty intense. My favourite part,there's plenty of vehicles and weapons to control,from off road vehicles to aircraft and aerial missile strikes which have nice explosions. If you can get this game cheap like I did,you should get your monies worth just from a playthrough. Multiplayer - Despite not having the best overall graphics,even for a game from 2010,this is a really fun MP! Stock standard game mode's,really good map's with heaps of different ground levels and places to go. The guns feel/sound great! The servers aren't as healthy as they could be and might not be active for much longer,but Its good quality fun for when you feel like mowing people down.			"

												9/10 this game farpassed all my expectations. Unlke its competition medal of honor does not fantasize the true grity nature of war. This game makes you fell like the tier 1 operator. With a focus on realism this games delivers you into the action you hear about on cnn. Combat is excelent and on hardest dificulty it challenges you to play it smart and tactical. The story could use a little work. It left you out in the dark about why you and your team were doing this. Spoiler*****But at the end this game makes you feel not only wanting vengance but sad to see your fellow brother seal not make it. It transitions great into the Sequel Medal of Honor Warfighter. only reason i gave it a 9 was cause of a few bugs with ai mapping but was rare and the multiplayer was a little lacking in content.

												Making somebody sign up for an EA account to play online after they already have an account with Steam? I thought we were past this. Anyway, the single player is linear, with checkpoints guiding you down the corridor from point A to point B while shooting ""bad guys"". The plot attempts fails to draw emotions while simultaneously keeping you from caring about anything in the ""story"". Medal of Honor offers nothing that hadn't been seen before; it consists of mindless killing without anything to care about. It's a game that doesn't make you think. Instead of picking up the next Call of Duty, buy this game in addition to a game that will make you think.			"

												This game is showing its age. Graphic were decent for its day, but today characters look disjointed against the environment. There are much older games that feel more cohesive. Gameplay itself is very linear and stiff. There is a a lean out of cover mechanic which is nice, but it almost never matters. It is usually was a viable strategy to stand in a hail of bullets to pick off my targets. Except in some open environments where the AI gets a crackshot at my skull from a mile away. Story is stale, but has its moments of pure ""'Murica"". Multiplayer is dead as far as I can tell. Probably not worth picking up unless it is dirt cheap or free.			"

												Stay away from this game.  This is the spawn killing version of Battlefield with smaller maps. This game is just an attempt at making money on an old title by making it more like Battlefield.  Right down to the guys yelling on the battlefield, This game takes its cues completely from Battlefield.... Did I mention this game is a failed attempt at Battlefield?  Yes its made by EA, yes it uses Dice, This is not an excuse though.   Maybe the Campaign is fun, I havent tried it but the online game play is just nothing but chatoic spawn killing and camping.  Youll join a server and when you join someone will be sitting waiting for spawns and he will shoot you over and over and over and over until you scream and♥♥♥♥♥♥and whine and ♥♥♥♥♥ then quit.  I would personally just buy BF3 or BF4.  Dont be fooled by a sale either. This game isnt worth 2 bucks.			"

												MoH falls short of being a game I'd highly recommend.This FPS is one you should only buy if you really have some cash left over, it is in no way shape or form a must have or must play game, if you never have played it you will not have missed out on anything.The SP is pretty decent and had a nice old-school semi-realistic feel. However it is plagued with simple design flaws, annoying glitches and bugs, terrible AI (both enemy and allied) and through most of the game it feels like your team mates do a bit too much or are always in the places you want to be.The MP feels pretty clunky and is not at all refined. Lacks the polish that even Black Ops has, while DICE might have developed or helped development on the MP it sure does not show much. Bad Company 2's MP is far superior in every way.			"

I watched a guy try walking through a lampost for about 5mins, only for him to appear suddenly stuck in a wall infront of me.

												~This review is only about the SINGLE-PLAYER campaign~Well first things first,I have to admit that I'm not a hardcore fan\gamer when it comes to FPS's, so maybe this review isn't 100% helpful but I'll write down my impressions anyway.I got this game on the humble origin bundle and wanted to give it a shot. Bottom line - I quite enjoyed it. Is this game that good, though? Not too sure about that.To say the truth it isn't bad either, except for some bugs I encountered during the gameplay, but it also isn't anything too good or special in comparison to other FPS games as far as I know, story is not very original at all... The voice acting is great on the other hand. The graphics are beautiful and the music is really amazing in my opinion, it gave the single player campaign a very cinematic feeling which I really like being in games in general. Another nice thing is the short bits in the game where the gameplay is slightly varied (shooting from an aircraft, driving etc..) from the repetitive 'go from point x to point y and shoot 'em down'.But then again, it isn't really anything special that would tear the CoD experience apart, and it's also VERY short-completed it in about 6-7 hours on normal difficulty and I'm NOT that good with FPS, meaning that an experienced player would finish it all in like 4-5 hours, I assume.Obviously the big deal in here is supposed to be the multiplayer part, which I don't intend to try anytime soon...So, I do recommend this game anyway, for it has its good points, but if you're not in for the multiplayer shooting then you wouldn't want to pay a full price for it.

												I've played this game in full on Ps3 and i can honestly say that the game itself is not bad. It's worth the play at the very least but the reason i can't recommend this..specifically for pc...is because i have been plagued with the ""General Protection Fault"" error. I can't run the single player and the multiplayer launches but does not allow me to create an account and the one time is somehow did let me it crashed only to have to revisit the problem. My specs exceed the requirements and i've followed every possible troubleshoot i could find to attempt resolving this but to no avail. Be Warned.If you buy this for pc it very well may be a waste of money because it may very well not work. I've read many others who have said the same thing and i'm one of them. Goodluck to you all.

I was sucked into the story which revolves around a US Ranger team that pwnz and gets pwn3d.  As the story unravels you'll find yourself being emmersed in it and don't wanna stop and you just can't wait to see what happens next.  Not a bad game and very much worth the play.  If you've played CoD's SP campaign this one probably isn't much different.  Oh, and it has MP, but I skipped it and went on to my next game.			"

It's well modelled and voiced.  The biggest problem with it is that that it often handholds you and puts you on rails when you wish it wouldn't and when they throw in some odd new mechanic where you actually could use a screentip ... it's not there.  Can be frustrating.  Can't recommend it at full price but if you can get it on a decent discount it should give you 4 or 5 hours of entertainment.			"

												So, the newest Medal of Honour SP had literally 4 hours of play time, with honestly the ♥♥♥♥♥est story line i have ever seen. It had all the generic things a FPS has these days and is quite honestly worse than chewing on whats left of a homeless man's shoe. Although it still left me with the whole ""war sucks"" mentality than most of them seem to have these days, why does the guy you like the most always die?			"

												I started playing this game not expecting much.  Then the only reason I continued playing it was just because I could laugh at it.  And then I realized that trying to laugh at it was just making me slowly die inside.  So having finally uninstalled it, here are some of the main things that I find completely ridiculous in this game: Apparently your character's arms are made of wet spaghetti noodles, because while your squadmates have no trouble lifting their arms above their head and hauling themselves onto a ledge, you have to get one of them to boost you up by running over and pressing a button. The game shatters all attempts at being taken seriously when it chooses to call these helping hands ""buddy boosts"". The plot is dull, the voice acting lifeless (and bad in places), and expects you to care about a bunch of guys whose ""names"" go from the semi-reasonable (Voodoo) to the hilariously ridiculous (Mother).  Ex: Mother: Okay, we have to go do the thing and then the thing and the stuff.  Voodoo: Thanks, Mom.  Me: YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO THINK THIS IS ALL GRITTY AND SERIOUS?!?! The game restricts you at every turn.  There was a point where I tried to enter a house with a wide open door.  I could see inside!  And yet the doorway was just an invisible wall.  Note that this is not always the case, but still...If you can't enter somewhere, just close the door!  On another occasion, I was walking along a cliff and decided to try and jump off - you know, for science.  NOPE.  Invisible wall.  No fence or wall that would be a reasonable blockade - nothing that justified me not being able to do this.  Just the developers saying, ""We don't want you to go over there, but we're too lazy to actually show you that."" BUDDY BOOSTS. At one point, your character gets blood splattered on his face, and the camera shows blood splats.  Keep in mind that your character is not wearing goggles, thereby implying he has blood on his eyes.  Then your squadmate comes over and magically wipes the blood away!  Thanks for molesting my eyeballs, buddy. The pistol is hilariously overpowered.  I went through entire sections of the game just going crazy with it.  It has enough range that you can snipe people from decently far away, it shoots quite fast, and it has infinite ammo (unlike your other weapons). FREAKING BUDDY BOOSTS. When the game does give you a bit of freedom, it's ridiculous how quickly it can fall apart.  There was a part where I ran ahead of my squad, shot everyone in the area while my team was monologuing, and then ran to the back of the area while the next scene triggered.  After an air strike came through, I pulled out a grenade and counted it off.  After a couple of seconds, I hurled it into a seemingly empty alcove, where a moment later, about five enemy fighters spawned and were immediately blown up. Your squadmates can and often will play the game for you.  There were times were I ran into an area, fired off some shots to get the enemy's attention, and then crouched behind a wall while my squad took out everyone.  Word of advice, devs: Making the player feel completely irrelevant to a game's outcome does not make them want to keep playing. THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CALL THEM BUDDY BOOSTS WHO THE HELL WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT?!?!?!?!In addition, the plot is dull, the graphics aren't anything special (hooray...gray...), the sound is unremarkable (my friend commented that a hail of gunfire just sounded like hail), and the gameplay is, in many cases, entirely optional.  Just...go play a shooter that actually seems to care about the player.TLDR: THIS GAME SUCKS BECAUSE BUDDY BOOSTS.			"

												I would say the game is worth it if the price is $10 or less. The single player campaign was exciting but very linear in what actions you could take. The graphics and sound are superb IMO, and quite realistic. I had a good time playing the campaign, and yeah it only took me 6 hours to win it but I think it was still worth the price. In today's world we pay $12 to go see a movie in 3d and that only lasts 2 hours tops. 6 hours of entertaInment was worth it to me. My only complaint was having at some points to trigger an action sequence by going to a specific point and not being able to go alternate routes. I			"

												Having gone into this game with the notion that it would be just like all the other fps campaigns out there , bland ,on the rails and without a good story I must say I was pleasently surprised! I Highly enjoyed the game the characters in the gamae work well and are actualy useful , they will kill enemies give you ammo and point out enemies to you rather than being useless bullet soakers like in other shooters.I also commplement the fact that stealth sections areent forced on you, you can make up for a mistake rather than being condemened to an instant death or loss. The gunplay worked reasonably well and although there is definatly alot to be desired the headshot system is Very satisfying. Finaly I'd like to say that unlike every other fps I have played, (other than halo of course) this ending actualy kind of made me feel sad. I would recommened this although of course it does have it's flaws in the end I found it to be quite the enjoyable campaign, I'd give it a 7/10 as far as its genre is concerned but as a whole a 6/10 is more fitting			"

												Single player is on UT3 engine and multiplayer is on Frostbie engine.Bothe MP and SP are developed by 2 different teams so MP is graphicaly pretty nice and as for gameplay it is oiously EA's try to make their own CODMW.SIngleplayer is suprisingly ugly and yes I mean in highest settings... game is very consoloited and some times you will just stare shocked form some huge glitches. SP doesnt look even half good as MP, but gameplay isnt that bad. there is lean,prone, fire mods and ironsights, and thats someting what is hard to find in other games.I mean all those 4 features together. At the end I was suprised that overall feeling was nice, Good storyline balanced, dynamic, some cinematic nothing original but nicely done.  But that graphics is big downside. I dont think its worth it's price. So yes play it but wait for sale =)			"

												This game has an excellent storyling and realistic play.  However, the Singleplayer mission is short and it looks as if they had planned additional content, maybe an expansion or two, but it has not seen the light of day.  That just leave the Multiplayer and Tier 1 missions.  The Tier 1 missions are little bonus missions that could make you a better player by focusing on the core skills needed toparticipate online and in the singleplayer story.  The Multiplayer could use some polishing in many ways, basically just more of the stuff that made Battlefield great.			"

												There is very little story or any emotional investment in the characters as they chop and change so often. It holds your hand for most of the time and then misses out critical information (like use 4 to target the mortars in the gunfighter mission). There are invisible walls everywhere and the AI on both sides is very stupid glitching on scenery and failing to trigger the next section in some cases.On the upside it looks very nice, the voice acting is excellent as is the sound work. I liked the few bits of variety we did get (helicopters, sniper sections) but these were very limited compared to the corridor shooter of the rest of the game.If you are looking for a great shooter with a story look elsewhere!

												Very well, Medal of Honor represents a good and graphically gorgeous example of the Afghanistan dusty war, between thecnological power of the americans versus the man will, unique engine to really fight the enemy.In any case, differently from the others review, I've not meet any script defect or particular difficulty to complete the short history. The game is in any case funny to play and beautiful to watch, so the suggestion is to get it on sale.To be clear you should hear what your commander tell you to do in order to advance in some points, but this is an ancient story of the single-player scritped missions.At last multiplayer: in this DICE mode very similar to Battlefield bad company 2, you have your gun, you cannot lean or get prone, and you have to shoot to invisible men. I live about 5 to 30 second in multiplayer mode... it's embarassing how much strange it is. Server are not always available in my country but you can friendly switch to something else for multiplayer.This MoH is about the last EA title of the series that lies here on STEAM, cause of sad incompatibility between the two...In any case, let's try again to remember to EA to put their games on STEAM!

												The games main campaign only took me 3 hours to complete. The game is completely linear. It has a realistic feel to it, although enemies tend to ragdoll when shot down. It had a good variety of missions, vehicle combat, stealth missions, sniper missions, run and gun missions. I haven't tried the multiplayer, or any of the side missions, but the game feels a bit dated compared to Battlefield 3 and even TF2. I got this game during EA's Humble Bundle, so it only cost me $6(with several other games of course). I'd only recommend buying it if you can get it this cheap. 6.5 is my final rating.			"

												Singleplayer: Terrible.This turns from a hand-held corridor shooter to an on rails shooter to turret sections several times and none of them are really fun. There is no real story, just loads of US Armed Forces and gun wanking. You are pushed from one set piece to the next without any clear goal and mow down thousands of troops (seriously, if you don't move on certain bits stuff just keeps spawning in endlessly.)PC options are laughable and I actually had to google for help on one mission - if you find yourself in a helicopter turret section and the annoying voice keeps shouting at you to use missiles, just hold down 4. Yes, 4. Totally intuitive and explained in detail, never.This seems like a minor, petty dig at it but that's going to be the one thing that will come to my mind when someone mentions Medal of Honor - having to alt+tab out of a game to google for help on its controls. Marvellous.I'm actually somewhat disappointed I got this in the Humble Bundle because I can't delete it from my Steam Library.			"

												I was expecting much, much more from a DICE game. The story is so terrible the only thing that entertains me is killing friendlies. The controls are nice and it looks quite pretty but graphics don't sell me on a game.On to multiplayer. COD gets a lot of hate, I can see why that might be. Small maps, OP weapons and campers. Well MOH is even worse. Tiny maps and I don't think I saw an enemy once as the game was just mortar strikes and rocket launchers. I'm a pretty good player but as a newbie to the multiplayer mode I could hardly get a kill.I'm so glad I got this as part of a Humble Bundle deal, I would NEVER spend even £5 on this. Do yourself a favour, don't even think of buying this game.!Updated review will be made when(if) I complete the Single Player!			"

SP doesnt look even half good as MP, but gameplay isnt that bad. there is lean,prone, fire mods and ironsights, and thats someting what is hard to find in other games.I mean all those 4 features together. At the end I was suprised that overall feeling was nice, Good storyline balanced, dynamic, some cinematic nothing original but nicely done.  But that graphics is big downside. I dont think its worth it's price. So yes play it but wait for sale =)			"

												Quality? Or quantity?Medal of Honor, a game about seals, rangers and all the other man and woman who served their country. Regardlessly the game is 5 years old, the graphics didn't sucks. The game run smoothly and the gameplay was fun. Although the gameplay only last 4 hours (Or less), the story was well made, fluent. Meaningful meaning are behind the story. Weapons are good, game mechanic are also good. I've played multi-player long time ago, still the gameplay are COD alike but more or less, it's still better than COD.Anyway, there is some user-friendly issues going on. Like a mission which needs you to press ""4"" to fire the hellfire, they didn't mention it. And the ""Left"" key for M320 is hard to press. Also some stealth mission are tought for some players, for me as a FPS gamer, I just shoot though the mission with ease.Rating: 9/10Recommendation on playing the game: Absolutly!Nevertheless, quality is always better than quantity. Instead of 10hours of bullcrap gameplay? I would rather choose a 4hours really nice gameplay. It just like watching a movie.			"

												I will never understand the kicking that this game got in the reviews on Steam. Yes, it's linear but that's because it's telling a story in the midst of a war - an open world option was never going to work, at least not with the story the devs wanted to tell. I love non-linear gaming (hell look at the time I've spent in GTA's Liberty City, Sleeping Dogs' Hong Kong etc) but it's not always the best solution.The story is actually very good given the quality of others in this genre, and by the time you're down to a sidearm, no cover, and every other Ranger is out of ammo... well, no spoilers but you do end up reacting out loud as if you were really there. Oh and if you're not on the bleeding edge of hardware, the Unreal 3 engine here gives you an easy ride.Don't think of it as a combat sim, think of it as a story you're being allowed to play through.

												Not too happy with this one.  The graphics and overall presentation are quite good, but the gameplay is extremely limited because the player is funelled into certain areas and doesn't have much choice over where to move. It seems like all the FPS games are moving towards the funelling approach.  I finished the single-player campaign in 5 hours, and it felt like I was only playing half the time, with cut scenes taking up the other half. I much preferred MOH Airborne Assault or COD Modern Warfare.			"

(Shameful really because in a game like this its usually just a matter of pointing out which direction to shoot in.)The _feel_ of the game is wrong. Guns are too accurate and aren't rewarding to shoot. Compare this game to Battlefield 3 or hell even Modern Warfare 2 and the guns just feel *fake*. (Yeah I know they _are_ fake). As I was playing the game I had the distinict feeling that it was made without passion. I stopped after a few levels and found better ways to spend my time.I don't recommend, just go buy Battlefield.			"

												It's an okay game, the AI is not very good and sometimes you'll just die out of nowhere, the knife is far too powerful and you remain in the animation after you've stabbed somebody leading to many deaths. If you carry on stabbing you won't go on to a different person, you will continue stabbing the original person. When a knife is an instakill this seems a bit pointless. It's a fairly visually appealing game with pretty good voice acting, however the storyline is thus far nonexistent.			"

												I started playing this game not expecting much.  Then the only reason I continued playing it was just because I could laugh at it.  And then I realized that trying to laugh at it was just making me slowly die inside.  So having finally uninstalled it, here are some of the main things that I find completely ridiculous in this game: Apparently your character's arms are made of wet spaghetti noodles, because while your squadmates have no trouble lifting their arms above their head and hauling themselves onto a ledge, you have to get one of them to boost you up by running over and pressing a button. The game shatters all attempts at being taken seriously when it chooses to call these helping hands ""buddy boosts"". The plot is dull, the voice acting lifeless (and bad in places), and expects you to care about a bunch of guys whose ""names"" go from the semi-reasonable (Voodoo) to the hilariously ridiculous (Mother).  Ex: Mother: Okay, we have to go do the thing and then the thing and the stuff.  Voodoo: Thanks, Mom.  Me: YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO THINK THIS IS ALL GRITTY AND SERIOUS?!?! The game restricts you at every turn.  There was a point where I tried to enter a house with a wide open door.  I could see inside!  And yet the doorway was just an invisible wall.  Note that this is not always the case, but still...If you can't enter somewhere, just close the door!  On another occasion, I was walking along a cliff and decided to try and jump off - you know, for science.  NOPE.  Invisible wall.  No fence or wall that would be a reasonable blockade - nothing that justified me not being able to do this.  Just the developers saying, ""We don't want you to go over there, but we're too lazy to actually show you that."" BUDDY BOOSTS. At one point, your character gets blood splattered on his face, and the camera shows blood splats.  Keep in mind that your character is not wearing goggles, thereby implying he has blood on his eyes.  Then your squadmate comes over and magically wipes the blood away!  Thanks for molesting my eyeballs, buddy. The pistol is hilariously overpowered.  I went through entire sections of the game just going crazy with it.  It has enough range that you can snipe people from decently far away, it shoots quite fast, and it has infinite ammo (unlike your other weapons). FREAKING BUDDY BOOSTS. When the game does give you a bit of freedom, it's ridiculous how quickly it can fall apart.  There was a part where I ran ahead of my squad, shot everyone in the area while my team was monologuing, and then ran to the back of the area while the next scene triggered.  After an air strike came through, I pulled out a grenade and counted it off.  After a couple of seconds, I hurled it into a seemingly empty alcove, where a moment later, about five enemy fighters spawned and were immediately blown up. Your squadmates can and often will play the game for you.  There were times were I ran into an area, fired off some shots to get the enemy's attention, and then crouched behind a wall while my squad took out everyone.  Word of advice, devs: Making the player feel completely irrelevant to a game's outcome does not make them want to keep playing. THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CALL THEM BUDDY BOOSTS WHO THE HELL WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT?!?!?!?!In addition, the plot is dull, the graphics aren't anything special (hooray...gray...), the sound is unremarkable (my friend commented that a hail of gunfire just sounded like hail), and the gameplay is, in many cases, entirely optional.  Just...go play a shooter that actually seems to care about the player.TLDR: THIS GAME SUCKS BECAUSE BUDDY BOOSTS.			"

												Good game. Similar to Call of Duty and Battlefield series. We can choose from many kinds of weapon. Campaign mode is very interesting.Graphic design is good and there is nothing to worry about it.Relatively easy, so good for beginners.In the multiplayer game is not too many people but we can always play with our friends.I recommend.

												So, the newest Medal of Honour SP had literally 4 hours of play time, with honestly the ♥♥♥♥♥est story line i have ever seen. It had all the generic things a FPS has these days and is quite honestly worse than chewing on whats left of a homeless man's shoe. Although it still left me with the whole ""war sucks"" mentality than most of them seem to have these days, why does the guy you like the most always die?			"

Of corse its no ARMA, but it even carries a bit of realism in it, even if only in small details. its now almost 6 years old... and its still is a great game.Buy it on discount if you have never played it... but what am I talking about, its an old game by now.

												This was my favorite game on Xbox 360.  When my 360 died and I couldn't run it on Xbox 1 I put it on the closet shelf.  I found it a week or two ago on Steam and bought it to play again.  It's a short game but fun to play.  I enjoyed it just as much the second time.  The shooting is fun and I like the weapons.  It's not difficult for an experienced FPS player (even on hard difficulty).  I'll keep playing if from time to time because I like it so much.			"

Recommendation level:|-|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|▓▓▓▓▓▓|░░░░░░|░░░░░░|+|Medal of Honor can be compared mostly to the recent episodes of the Call of Duty franchise. You get a military shooter with very linear and short campaign and a multiplayer mode which was designed for the masses. In both parts MoH fails to compete against the successful series. However, there are some parts which are more valuable than in the case of the other. I played through the game twice, so it can be considered as one of my favorite military shooters to date.I would start with the graphics and overall design. Unlike Warfighter, MoH uses the Unreal Engine which is a good choice for any shooters. The utilization however is not the best. The game has the usual ""previous generation console issues"" like blurry textures, worthless anti-aliasing and optimization problems. Also I need to mention that the level design is pretty varied. The night scenes mostly look good with all the lightning, but sometimes I encounter areas which are so poorly detailed. There are almost completely empty rooms, small flames coming from nowhere and a other annoying things. It is maybe not fair to judge a game's graphics four years after release, but I was not amazed at the time when it came out. In 2010 I have seen much better visuals already and the cut-scenes in the game are so disappointing, they are just ruining the atmosphere.One of the better parts of the game is the gameplay. The gunplay is fun, however the behaviour of the weapons sometimes clumsy and weird. Overall it is still acceptable. There are multiple weapons to use from both sides during missions. The short campaign includes the usual sections, like sneaking, sniping, shooting with mg, etc. There are some good ideas either, which seems pretty experimental and brave at times. Some of the areas are nicely done, allowing some freedom and variation, though most of them are pretty linear and strict. At one point on day 2 we crossed under a bridge while troops were marching above us. The game gave me the control, but I was told to let them pass. Once I tried to shoot the separated soldier, all the others started to shoot. Actually, after a few shots they fled, and my partner just desperately wanted to climb the bank of the river bed and chase them. So, sometimes you got more freedom, but in these cases you would never know what happens if you do not stick to the plan, you can even fail the mission because of a bug. And, if I speak about bugs, I encountered a few during my gameplay. Sometimes these breaks the game, like when one of your teammate stuck into a wall, so you need to reload a previous checkpoint. Fortunately, the game saves pretty often, so you do not lose much progress if something bad happens. These linear sequences sometimes nicely choreographed, so I do not complain about it all the time.I have mixed opinions about the writing and storytelling too. You have to control various soldiers during the campaign. These are from different classes, allowing you to explore the full arsenal of the division. However, this may prevent the connection to one certain soldier, making characters less memorable. As I mentioned before, the cutscenes are not managed to give me a good impression, but some of them are exceptions. I really liked the ending. The tense was pretty high in those last minutes, which elevated the game quite a bit. It was really sad and touching. The whole storytelling tries a different approach to the genre and sometimes it is what moves the player forward. I recently watched the Lone Survivor movie and I had similar feeling during the playtime. The game gives back the feel of the war zone in the middle east well.Now comes my favourite part of the game, the audio part. Ramin Djawadi wrote an amazing soundtrack for this title, which earns the game a playthrough on its own. I played the game with lowered effects volume, so that the music can be more enjoyable. The album is also one of my favourite military soundtrack album. The sounds are also pretty much in place. You do not hear anything awkward. The weapon sounds are good, the impacts makes you feel the pressure during combat. The overall feedback is great. Last part in the audio section is the dialogues. This is a shooter, so the most frequent lines you will hear are orders for movement, shoot and others. The lines during cut-scenes and between fights are mostly passable. They do not worsen the experience.Overall, this game feels like an early release. It would needed more polish and work on details. I do not say, that multiplayer could compete against any of the CoD's, but the singleplayer part could be much more enjoyable. That way this could be a must have. However, I still recommend this game, because it is still closer to my heart than many other shooters out there.MY OPINION: 7.5/10 (GOOD)Graphics: 7/10World Design: 7/10Gameplay: 8/10Sound: 9/10Replay Value: 6/10PS: I did not play the multiplayer as it was not populated too much even at the time of my first playthrough.

												Single Player Review: Is this game good? That depends on what you are looking for and how you define it. Its about Afghanistan and thats a touchy subject.I don't think that Danger Close was trying to make light of the war in Afghanistan. I also think a distinction needs to be made between a war game/movie, and an action game/movie. War movies should not be fun, they should be dramatic, even painful, as to respect the gravity of the situation/people invoved. Whereas action movies/games can be fun, because they generally focus around a caricatured protagonist who is the embodiment of some particular virtue. This distinction would be what separates Medal of Honor from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1-3.If this game is a war game then yes. If this game is an action game then no. But that distinction can really only be made in the mind of the player.			"

												You're a Tier One operator, you're on active duty in Afghanistan and your name is... Rabbit?This Medal of Honor game reeks of Call of Duty influence, except sadly the gameplay isn't as fluid as Call of Duty's and the campaign isn't as interesting either. Down to the stupid player character names (Rabbit = Soap anyone?), it's clear EA tried to revive a classic series and bring it back to life to compete with the big boys. Unfortunately, they failed and we're left with a generic FPS game set in the brown 'n' bloom desert. With an unengaging plot which tries too hard with it's cutscenes, there's little to push you to press forward in the campaign. Enemy AI is garbage too, leading to mostly dull fights in the streets, rooftops and warehouses of Afghanistan. The guns look nice, and feel good to shoot. They even sound nice. It's just a shame they're stuck in this game. Graphics can be appealing at times but mostly the dull uninspired enviroments leave a lot to be desired, and the lack of graphics options in the main menu was a let down as I had no way to reduce the jaggies which soured my experience a little.In conclusion, EA tried to create a Call of Duty killer yet only managed to spawn a generic, drab, uninspired FPS set in the desert which spells boring enviroments -a-palooza and tries to pull you in with a cliché and boring story. Avoid.			"

												This game is a decent game. It has pretty grafix and it runs decently. It's worth picking it up on a sale to experience the mediocre but enjoyable story. This is the perfect Call of Duty clone. It wants to be Modern Warfare so bad it's not even funny. Down to the smallest detail. If I have one complaint about the Singleplayer is that it's sensitivity option is PURE♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ It doesn't go low enough. I've lowered the DPI on my mouse and it still goes WAY faster than I would like to. It's such a basic option, yet they didn't fiddle enough with it so it makes the game kinda unplayable for me, I had to pull every trick in the hat, lower Windows sensitivity and so on so forth, to make it playable. Every game's sensitivity option should go from 0 to 100. 0 being DEAD STOP, not moving at all, 100 being crazy fast. Not this game. This game is special.... This is even more curios because the MULTIPLAYER's sensitivity option is very good. It does what it's supposed to do, it goes as low as you want it to, until it stops moving completely. Weird. So this nice segway brings us to multiplayer. If you're buying it for the MP, DON'T. Get the latest COD, it'll be the same. At the time of writing there are only about 100 players playing the MP at any given time! Only a couple of the 4-5 MP modes are played, and those are not the best kind of modes. Not to mention that those 100 players, given their dedication, are MAX level and have every little♥♥♥♥♥♥unlocked, so they're like 5 times more powerful than you, due to the better upgrades they have. If you want a compelling MP experience similar to this go play COD, or try your luck with Medal Of Honor Warfighter, but even with Warfighter I don't think the MP community is what it was at launch, not that this game even EVER had a decent MP community, not even at launch. So bottom line is, buy this game at a sale to experience the decent Singleplayer campaign. That is all.			"

												The single player sucks! Very boring. Nothing special happens in the single player mode, it's just go shoot guys. Guys spawn randomly and there are certain missions where they just keep coming and it's boring. I've played older MoH games where the single player game was some of the BEST missions in any game. This game lacks any compelling features. Guns are boring, meaning they are the guns in EVERY other game. You get a gun that has a grenade launcher but you can't shoot it. Missions are just run here and now here and done. I feel like this game was rushed and no one cared about it. What a shame since every other MoH game was awesome. Nothing immersive about this game at all, the sound is very bland and the environments are ""meh"". What a boring game. And it last about 3 hours.			"

												I got this game in a bundle a while back. The campaign is short, enjoyable and cinematic. The story follows several squads participating in the same mission, and switches between them as necessary. I found that to be a nice touch, and I am glad they didn't try to cram in some lame supervillain plot, instead setting it in the middle east. Gameplay is solid if unspectacular, pretty standard more-or-less-on-rails military shooter stuff. There's never any real doubt (or choice) about where to go or what to do. Graphics, music, sfx - all pretty solid. Decent voice acting.Overall, though I never really found the experience particularly engaging, I did enjoy it while it lasted, so it gets a recommendation from me.			"

Call of Duty bashing aside, the single player portion of this game delivers brilliant atmosphere of differing magnitudes, to the subtleties of nighttime stealth missions to daytime battles - something  the Call of Duty franchise never quite managed to deliver in recent years. This beautiful - albeit short - single player segment is well worth the purchase provided you find DICE's contribution to the multiplayer component to be competent enough to put up with.			"

It's not worth what Steam charge at full price, but if it drops down to around £3 in a sale it is worth picking up. Multiplayer, it's alright...not the best I've seen but it's certainly playable. There isn't much in Storywise, you won't be buying it for that. You'll be buying it to...you guessed it...shoot some bad guys.			"

												A too short AAA title very well made that won't change your life.Very satisfying shooting.Distracted enemies are fun to kill.What I understood from this game:-Beard is the new fashion-Bad guys always die a lot and no one of them survive-Good guys always survive even in the most incredible situations, except a pair of soldier with no name-American Army wastes money and men to save two soldiers because pathos-Politicians are bad, even if soldiers always do what they say			"

												Stay away from this game.  This is the spawn killing version of Battlefield with smaller maps. This game is just an attempt at making money on an old title by making it more like Battlefield.  Right down to the guys yelling on the battlefield, This game takes its cues completely from Battlefield.... Did I mention this game is a failed attempt at Battlefield?  Yes its made by EA, yes it uses Dice, This is not an excuse though.   Maybe the Campaign is fun, I havent tried it but the online game play is just nothing but chatoic spawn killing and camping.  Youll join a server and when you join someone will be sitting waiting for spawns and he will shoot you over and over and over and over until you scream and♥♥♥♥♥♥and whine and ♥♥♥♥♥ then quit.  I would personally just buy BF3 or BF4.  Dont be fooled by a sale either. This game isnt worth 2 bucks.			"

												I got this game in a bundle a while back. The campaign is short, enjoyable and cinematic. The story follows several squads participating in the same mission, and switches between them as necessary. I found that to be a nice touch, and I am glad they didn't try to cram in some lame supervillain plot, instead setting it in the middle east. Gameplay is solid if unspectacular, pretty standard more-or-less-on-rails military shooter stuff. There's never any real doubt (or choice) about where to go or what to do. Graphics, music, sfx - all pretty solid. Decent voice acting.Overall, though I never really found the experience particularly engaging, I did enjoy it while it lasted, so it gets a recommendation from me.			"

												The game seems to be trying to show the realism of war, the bleakness- as the colour palette shows. But the game mechanics prevent it from doing this. Lack of health packs means lack of tension, ammo can be gotten from team mates so the fact that you have limited ammo in your weapons is a bit of an illusion. At many points during the game the music will just stop. One example is during a mission as a character you’ve never played before, you and your three (every level is you and 3 invulnerable team-mates) holding off against waves of insurgents. There’s no music to provide realism and tension! Except there is no tension, the enemies come at you from the same paths again and again, I’ve been playing this character for about 20 minutes, why should I care if he lives or dies. MAKE ME CARE GAME. If the game is relying on the fact that it’s based on real-life events to make me care about the characters then it’s sorely mistaken. The game’s mechanics of what is essentially unlimited ammo, team-mates that absorb whole clips of both enemy and friendly fire, incredibly stupid AI, bullet spongy enemies, extreme linearity and oh much more mean that it cannot in all fairness successfully convey real-life situations and make me feel the horrors of war. Either you go the ARMA route where one bullet can kill you, where the realism of warfare is far more apparent than MoH or you go the CoD route of arcade mayhem while conveying emotions through storytelling. Medal of honour is an absolute mess. The game is disjointed, horribly disjointed. The story is only carried by the cinematics which bookend levels, if your players need the cinematics to follow the story/care about what is going on then you’ve failed at FPS storytelling. Every few levels you change character, moving from special forces to simply infantry. That’s fine in and of itself, but I actually became slightly disorientated, if you skip the cinematic it can take a few minutes to work out who you are playing as based on your location and team members. Not that you can give any orders to your team mates, even medal of honour European assault let you do that. They just follow scripted events and bark orders at you. The game has predictable scripted sequences that even Activision would laugh at. You see all the Call of duty references? That’s because it’s so ♥♥♥♥ing clear that MoH is EA’ response to call of duty. Now in 2013 it’s obvious that they’ve focused on Battlefield as their counter to CoD, even though the games are very different (multiplayer wise) single player wise they’re both a boring as one another.  But of course, it’s the multiplayer component that sells both games.Medal of Honor lacks colour, which is part of this aim at ‘realism’- though in the sense of feeling not in gameplay. Its so boring and depressing, which sums up MoH. Not depressing because of its focus on real-life events or questioning the legality and morality of what the soldiers are actually fighting for (which would actually make an interesting twist to modern military shooters) but because it shows complete and utter disregard for originality and the medal of honour franchise. The lack of a HUD reiterates part of this  ‘realistic approach’, yet in a game where you cans till take a handful of bullets before dying it seems like a bit of useless attempt at getting across whatever message about war Danger close are trying to convey.Forget about the series being set in ww2, even if MoH were set in the second world war, itd still be ♥♥♥♥ing boring. The guns feel boring, and the enemies are not interesting in the slightest. They’re just Nazis in middle-eastern garb. By that I mean they have no character outside of them being EVIL. We don’t see anything that makes us question why we are killing hundreds of these guys, it’s like the game just paints the word TERRORIST in great big letters on their heads. That’s all the motivation we need apparently. Maybe that’s a joke at how soldiers have to remove those thoughts from their heads in order to do their job properly. Or it’s just lazy storytelling, you pick. Graphically this game looks about 3 years older than it should. 2011 was only a year away which would herald the use of the frostbite 2 engine. Even battlefield bad company 2 looked far superior to Medal of honour and that came out the same bloody year. The only decent textures are on people’s faces, everything else oozes muddy brown pixels. I’d argue that this is due to an attempt at making a console beating CoD killer, but EA must have been utterly delusional to think that. If CoD gets complaints for being stale then MoH is a loaf of bread left behind two biscuit tins for 4 years, dusted off and then put in shiny packaging to sell to people who only want call of duty clones. Not that it can even be called a clone; the changes it does make (aside from the MoH ability to lean around cover) make the game into a boring mess. Oh and the bugs, these mainly revolve around the AI and the ragdoll/physics effects, at least they make me laugh I guess, something in this game has to. The studio behind this game have an interesting history, as EA Los Angeles they created the battle for middle earth games, all MoH games from Frontline and created both red alert 3 and the terrible ending to Command & Conquer, tiberian twilight. A history of some great and some terrible games. Rebranded as ‘Danger Close’ the studio made the two modern Medal of Honour games, the last of which has been classed as a franchise killer. Now EA have rebranded the studio yet again as DICE Los Angeles, and set them to work on the extremely anticipated game, Battlefront 3. I really hope danger close rethink their fps game design. Clearly modern military shooters were not a genre the studio was good at, taking tons of tropes and clichés, covering it in cardboard and serving it on a grey plate in a grey room for grey people to sit and eat while they laugh at re-runs of Miranda. That all said, Battlefront 3 is being designed by the DICE team behind Battlefield, so hopefully Danger Close, I mean DICE LA, won’t be able to suck the life out of this one. "

												      I bought this game with one reason, that I loved the old Medal of Honor games, my personal favorite being Rising Sun. For the longest time I wondered what happened to the series and why it fell off the face of the Eart. Well the history of it is old game developers who worked for EA in the Medal of Honor division left to creat their own FPS war game, it was called Call of Duty. At first Call of Duty could never live up to the greatest FPS game Medal of Honor was. But then with the release of Call of Duty Modern Warfare, which was a came that captivated the audience at the time. In a rush EA's Medal of Honor divison started to panic and released a game in hopes to beat Modern Warfare, the end result was a game that was rushed.       Medal of Honor came out with this game, a game that takes place in other people's prespective of the modern war, but the end result of the game was left in the dust and left for old Medal of Honor fans. But that raises the question... How is this game?      In truth the game isn't remarkable and certainly doesn't touch the previous Medal of Honor games. The controls in the game are nice, similar to that of COD, the story is hardly compelling, the writing is decent, the gameplay was excellent and possibly one of the saddest NPC's deaths ever.        For the cons of the game it's graphics are poor, the writing is the not the best, A.I can be derpy at times and you can have the ""who the f*ck is shooting me"" syndrome. But as for a game, it's actually a lot of fun. I'll tell you what it is a lot better than the following; COD Ghosts, COD Advanced Warfare, COD Infinate Warfare, Mass Effect Andromeda and No Man's Sky.       Final word: If you were a fan of the old Medal of Honor series and want to recap some of that old feelings when you played the old ones, you're not finding it here. But it is a fun game to play, but for those of you who don't what Medal of Honor is, go play the older games and then consider buying this one.			"

												This game surprised me. The story was well written for a military shooter and I liked the idea of switching between each team and military faction. As the story progressed the different teams you were playing intertwined together seamlessly. However, a six hour campaign is pretty weak. This is the second shortest campaign I have played next to Mirrors Edge. Overall the game was well polished, but if I paid full price I would be disappointed.			"

												This is for singleplayer.Game lacks polish, poor ai and poor controls at times. Unresponsive and at times I would almost ice skate around. Sliding after I stopped moving. That kind of thing. The story was basically a movie where I follow around a soldier guy and pointed my gun where he wanted me to point it. I hear that this is kind of realistic but imo it didn't make for a great game. If its cheap there are worse ways to waste a couple bucks. But honestly for the last hour I was just hoping the game would end soon.			"

												Several actions, not only FPS shooter. Controls a bit unresponsive and key mapping not very suggestive (come on, '4' for Hellfire?) Relism in interface is translated in poor tips on missions (besides de Hud). Same applies to identify enemies - hard as find needles in haysacks. Besides, your character is likely to be the fatty one in the troop - your allies can always jump and crawl and you always need a hand. 6/10, completed in 6h.			"

												Quality? Or quantity?Medal of Honor, a game about seals, rangers and all the other man and woman who served their country. Regardlessly the game is 5 years old, the graphics didn't sucks. The game run smoothly and the gameplay was fun. Although the gameplay only last 4 hours (Or less), the story was well made, fluent. Meaningful meaning are behind the story. Weapons are good, game mechanic are also good. I've played multi-player long time ago, still the gameplay are COD alike but more or less, it's still better than COD.Anyway, there is some user-friendly issues going on. Like a mission which needs you to press ""4"" to fire the hellfire, they didn't mention it. And the ""Left"" key for M320 is hard to press. Also some stealth mission are tought for some players, for me as a FPS gamer, I just shoot though the mission with ease.Rating: 9/10Recommendation on playing the game: Absolutly!Nevertheless, quality is always better than quantity. Instead of 10hours of bullcrap gameplay? I would rather choose a 4hours really nice gameplay. It just like watching a movie.			"

												Single Player Review: Is this game good? That depends on what you are looking for and how you define it. Its about Afghanistan and thats a touchy subject.I don't think that Danger Close was trying to make light of the war in Afghanistan. I also think a distinction needs to be made between a war game/movie, and an action game/movie. War movies should not be fun, they should be dramatic, even painful, as to respect the gravity of the situation/people invoved. Whereas action movies/games can be fun, because they generally focus around a caricatured protagonist who is the embodiment of some particular virtue. This distinction would be what separates Medal of Honor from Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1-3.If this game is a war game then yes. If this game is an action game then no. But that distinction can really only be made in the mind of the player.			"

I found parts of the game a bit slow but nothing that would keep me from a second playthrough. The single player was really good at putting you in the middle of the story. As you move from level to level you will see what I mean. this game is a steal if on sale.  I certainly recommend you get it. Multiplayer review to come.			"

												this game is all about its single player, people get too caught up in multiplayer and its killing gamming, heres why i loved the campaign.it had a pretty good story that was realistic and relatable, it wasnt about Russian or Chinese Invasions or WWIII or something stupid like that, it is set in the war of our time, the war on terror against al qaeda in the mountains of Afganistan, it follows a few protaganists, which isnt something that i really like, i like playing as one person and following their story and becoming attached to them, but i can look past that because the gameplay is superb, it outshines other franchises big time, the sound effects and graphics are how i imagine a warzone to be, so it seems pretty realistic to that degree. though the campaign is unfortunatly short at just a few hours, it makes for a good shooter to just pick up and play as oposed to a long campaign to become invested in, i guess thats looking at the bright side, but yea, id say its worth a buy, especially at the low price of the summer sale (winter sale for myself)			"

												This installment of Medal of Honor plays a lot like its modern-warfare counterparts Call of Duty and Battlefield, but offers a more sober tone overall.  While the campaign is incredibly short (about 4-5 hours) and the linearity allows minimal replay value, it provides decent (and occasionally exceptional) immersion and atmosphere while it lasts.  Certainly not worth the money at full price, but for the $5 I paid for it on sale, I got my money's worth.			"

With that said, yes, the campaign is very short, but it feels sincere. Feels real, unlike the CoD games. No, it's not worth a second playthrough b/c there's nothing to achieve by doing so. I felt this game had a legitatimate chance of being something great but they dropped the ball in extremely linear maps and baron houses. Those Aphgans must've been bored all the time! Literally nothing was in any house except an ampty bookshelf. With that, I do rec this game when it's on sale for 4.99$ or less for the simple fact that the story felt real and sincere in its presentation. I've spent more on a CoD game and refunded it. /shrug			"

												Short game (5h to finish it), but it's very good.The graphics are still very good, despite it being based on the first version of Frostbite.There are too many enemies: be quick, precise and use covers. Friendlies/Teammates will always give you ammos, though, so it's not a problem if you get out of ammo during a fight.Q/E keys are the best when you're behind a cover and need to kill some `mujh`.Always use negative thermal(?) visors when using the sniper gun.

												I started playing this game not expecting much.  Then the only reason I continued playing it was just because I could laugh at it.  And then I realized that trying to laugh at it was just making me slowly die inside.  So having finally uninstalled it, here are some of the main things that I find completely ridiculous in this game: Apparently your character's arms are made of wet spaghetti noodles, because while your squadmates have no trouble lifting their arms above their head and hauling themselves onto a ledge, you have to get one of them to boost you up by running over and pressing a button. The game shatters all attempts at being taken seriously when it chooses to call these helping hands ""buddy boosts"". The plot is dull, the voice acting lifeless (and bad in places), and expects you to care about a bunch of guys whose ""names"" go from the semi-reasonable (Voodoo) to the hilariously ridiculous (Mother).  Ex: Mother: Okay, we have to go do the thing and then the thing and the stuff.  Voodoo: Thanks, Mom.  Me: YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME TO THINK THIS IS ALL GRITTY AND SERIOUS?!?! The game restricts you at every turn.  There was a point where I tried to enter a house with a wide open door.  I could see inside!  And yet the doorway was just an invisible wall.  Note that this is not always the case, but still...If you can't enter somewhere, just close the door!  On another occasion, I was walking along a cliff and decided to try and jump off - you know, for science.  NOPE.  Invisible wall.  No fence or wall that would be a reasonable blockade - nothing that justified me not being able to do this.  Just the developers saying, ""We don't want you to go over there, but we're too lazy to actually show you that."" BUDDY BOOSTS. At one point, your character gets blood splattered on his face, and the camera shows blood splats.  Keep in mind that your character is not wearing goggles, thereby implying he has blood on his eyes.  Then your squadmate comes over and magically wipes the blood away!  Thanks for molesting my eyeballs, buddy. The pistol is hilariously overpowered.  I went through entire sections of the game just going crazy with it.  It has enough range that you can snipe people from decently far away, it shoots quite fast, and it has infinite ammo (unlike your other weapons). FREAKING BUDDY BOOSTS. When the game does give you a bit of freedom, it's ridiculous how quickly it can fall apart.  There was a part where I ran ahead of my squad, shot everyone in the area while my team was monologuing, and then ran to the back of the area while the next scene triggered.  After an air strike came through, I pulled out a grenade and counted it off.  After a couple of seconds, I hurled it into a seemingly empty alcove, where a moment later, about five enemy fighters spawned and were immediately blown up. Your squadmates can and often will play the game for you.  There were times were I ran into an area, fired off some shots to get the enemy's attention, and then crouched behind a wall while my squad took out everyone.  Word of advice, devs: Making the player feel completely irrelevant to a game's outcome does not make them want to keep playing. THEY ACTUALLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO CALL THEM BUDDY BOOSTS WHO THE HELL WAS IN CHARGE OF THAT?!?!?!?!In addition, the plot is dull, the graphics aren't anything special (hooray...gray...), the sound is unremarkable (my friend commented that a hail of gunfire just sounded like hail), and the gameplay is, in many cases, entirely optional.  Just...go play a shooter that actually seems to care about the player.TLDR: THIS GAME SUCKS BECAUSE BUDDY BOOSTS.			"

												While playing the single player portion of this game I was in awe as to how cool it was and how well done it was. The sounds in single player really sounded amazing like you were really shooting a live person. The pops of the sniper rifles were awesome. The Ai were hard at times, and you could die pretty easy from them. The story is great and you fight Osama Bin Laden's brothers it feels like. You fight in Afghanistan and go into a lot of cave to fight people. The graphics are stunning and great to look at, they put a lot of detail in the way things look. The multiplayer is amazing as well, you can't go all gung ho in the game you have to be careful when moving around and plan attacks. It is a lot of fun to play online, the guns are really powerful and it doesn't take a lot to take someone down. This is a amazing game full of great gameplay, don't pass this one up when looking for a new First Person Shooter to play. I highly recommend this game for so many reasons, I know you'll enjoy it!!

A LOT OF PEOPLE ABUSING THE ARTY STRIKES!,I mean seriously I died 5 times during a match do to arty strikes and I played for 5 mins at mostThe single player on the other hand feels a lot like COD MW2 but more ""realistic"". But it still feels like your limited to a narrow passage way where there's about 2 - 5 guys who you shoot. Some moments your blown away but thats only in cut sceens where you just watch. I do beleive that EA has moved on to better and more large mapped franchises lie Battlefield and others. I do hope though they contiue this franchise but in a more ""Battlefield approach""			"

												What a terrible game!I was expecting good gunplay, great levels and lots of weapons. What I got was terrible level design, overpowered player character (and allies) and completely boring missions.			"

												Alright; I think you should know what you are in for with this game. Because despite it marketing itself as a hard as nails, top tier, hardcore shooter - it is nothing more than a CoD-ified matinée blockbuster experience. Explosions a plenty, regenerating health all over the place and more guns than you could shake a stick at.That said; I don't think there is anything wrong with that.I am one of those wierd people who genuinly enjoy the Call of Duty and Battlefield campaigns; I love cheesy war movies and I have spent more than my fair share of time just reading about guns on wikipedia, and for what it is, I, for some reason I really like this game. Like, a lot.Now; let me get this straight - there are a lot of flaws apparent here. Flaws that I, in any other game, would find extremely annoying, such as EXTREME liniarity, lack of an FOV slider and a campaign about as long as your average Lord of The Rings movie. There really isn't anything special about this game and I shouldn't like it, because when I look at it, it just seems to blend in as an average CoD clone. But when I play it; it just feels right.I think it is the settings that the game places you in; the characters all fill their sterotypical roles, but does it well and, just like Call of Duty 3, you learn to feel the comraderie between them. That, mixed with some of the most memorable moments in gaming places this game as a favourite of mine.Performance wise I don't think there will be a problem; it runs well on my rig (i7 4979K 4.0GHz, GTX 980, 16GB RAM), maxed out and I think any modern computer should be able to handle it.I think you have to be a military nut to like this game; because it is essentially just softcore porn for the military interested. And, even though I wouldn't mind paying the 19,99€ that it currently is, I would recommending holding of on a sale as there isn't that much content present here. There is a multiplayer mode (that I loved on the Xbox), but I doubt there is much of a crowd left playing it.			"

												FIne shooter. Nothing like the good old MoH AA. Funny thing is game has physics locked onto FPS (played @ 96+) so if you shot people they go flying in the air.	😂	😂			"
