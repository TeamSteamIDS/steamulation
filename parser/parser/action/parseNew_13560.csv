												While it pales in comparison to its franchise's third entry, the original Splinter Cell is still a very entertaining experience, with an engrossing plot and oodles of gadgets to match. If you played this after playing later entries like Double Agent or Chaos Theory, or (god help you) Conviction or Blacklist, you might encounter some difficulty getting used to this game's quirks and its overall non-streamlined nature compared to later entries. Give this game a little patience, however, and it will reward you with a rich story and a satisfying stealth experience. However, if you want a more refined and near-perfect stealth experience, you might want to pass this game up in favor of Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory.			"

												For today's standards, this is a good game. The graphics are pretty good for a 2002 release, and the gameplay is solid enough to be fun. Back in the day it was kind of a big deal, but nowadays many elements feel dated: the levels are very linear, the story is forgettable, the music is unremarkable and there's no content besides the main campaign.  I recommend it for fans of the series or the stealth genre for historical reasons, but for everyone else, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory is the one to play. It's a good deal when you buy it with the Elite Echelon Pack which comes with SC, SC:CT, SC:DA and Conviction.Also a quick note: The PC port was made with old Nvidia cards in mind, so on most modern hardware you'll be missing many of the special effects the original Xbox version had, as it falls back to a generic setting. The lack of this generic setting on the sequel (Pandora Tomorrow) is the reason why it's not on sale on Steam.			"

												I like stealth action games and I like Splinter Cell as it does stealth action very well. The stealth mechanics are very good, especially tracking light exposure and noise made. There are many ways to approach problems and I very much enjoyed playing cat and mouse with my victims while being completely undetected. The setups are mostly well-thought out and the variety of mechanics keep it interesting. I dislike being forced into story-driven firefights so often, but at least the gun mechanics are up to it. The music is somewhat generic and the story seems to be sort of lackluster in that it's hard to care about the characters or what's happening to them.			"

												It's been more than a decade since the original release of Splinter Cell. Does the game still hold up as one of the pioneer hardcore stealth games to this day? ...Yes, yes it does.You play as Sam Fisher, a Splinter Cell in the secretive OPs agency known as 3rd Echelon. You are shadow, invisible, a ghost...and an excellent infiltrator. Should you be captured, you would cease to exist to the general public. With the credo realized, you must play this game as if the light will burn you alive. You will slowly creep through various locales finding ways to circumvent guards or silently take them out. You are provided a generous amount of tools and gadgets to help you in this cause. Be it sticky cameras, wall mines, to snake cameras...you will always find a use for the tinkets possessed by Sam.The game is pretty unforgiving in terms of stealth. There are 5 ratings of exposure to light you can be in at once and depending on your current position will determine how fast a guard realizes it is a bionic commando versus a mosquito buzzing around. There is also an invisible noise detection level which varies depending on the surface you creep upon. You can flatten yourself against a wall to be even more hidden and use distractions such as light switches to pull unexpecting guards to their sleepy fate.One aspect that still amazes me is that you can sneak through most levels without ever touching a guard or being detected. Granted, since this game needs to have a little bit of variation from the normal stealth routine...you'll find yourself in a couple of mandatory shootouts. These occurances are few and far between and help break the typical slow creep and crawl you'll be doing through most of the game. Music and sound play a big part with music dynamically ramping up in intensity when guards are becoming alerted to your prescence to heavy rock when a battle is unavoidable. Ambience of halogen lights and crickets chirping as well as cars passing by will be your typical tune when you are a ghost.Techincally speaking, the game looks great if you do a few simple tweaks in the game's .ini files. I personally could not see the CG cutscenes without sacrificing my graphical tweaks but just watch them on YouTube and you'll still get the full effect. A small price to pay for 1080p and anti-alising. The game runs stable at 60fps and looks fairly decent for its time. Volumetric lighting and partial physics exist here.I can fully recommend Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell for anyone looking for an actual stealth game where slow and steady certainly and almost always wins the race.

												Splinter Cell, a Stealth Action game very much like Metal Gear Solid, except not nearly as over-the-top ridiculous awesome (although this game is pretty awesome). You play as Sam Fisher, America's resident badass to prevent major world conflict (particularly war) and save the lives of many many people. Sam is a no-nonsense guy who is VERY good at his job.Story: 9/10The story is pretty good, a little cheesy at times but good nonetheless. You are basically traveling across the world infiltrating places (EVEN THE CIA) in order to find out more information about your enemies. Sam is an NSA agent, part of Third Echelon, which is supposed to be super top-secret, the kind that if you are caught, it will cause an international crisis because you are probably breaking a few treaties.Sound: 10/10Sound is a MAJOR element of the game. The effects are pretty good and whatnot, and ""Name of the Game"" by Crystal Method is a kickass song. I'm giving this a 10 because the game relies on you being STEALTHY, which means sneaking and timing and making minimal errors, prepare to save often!Graphics: 10/10Considering the game was released in 2003, the graphics are way ahead of its time! You use the element of surprise and hide in the shadows in order to achieve your objectives. This combined with the sound factor from above basically make you a modern day ninja with night vision and death at your fingertips. Gameplay: 10/10A little complicated at times, things aren't always so obvious, and that is a really good thing. The game is really easy if you know what to expect, so on your first playthrough be prepared to have a lot of ""WTF"" moments. With everything flowing together so well, you really find yourself immersed and FEELING like Sam Fisher. When you have to run, your heart will race. When you have to be quiet, you will find yourself holding your breath. This game is truly magnificent for its time.Overall: 9/10Naturally, I would give this a 10/10, but I have one major gripe. The xbox version came with FREE DLC, which were 3 additional levels after the end of the game. We don't get those on PC. Apparently there is a way to grab them, I think it was supposed to come with a 1.3 patch if you also have Chaos Theory (Splinter Cell 3) installed, I didn't try though. The game isn't any less good because of it, just a little depressing.I should also like to note, if you are looking at the sequels, Steam doesn't have Splinter Cell 2, Pandora Tomorrow. There is apparently a PC version you can go buy or something, so I'm not sure why it isn't on Steam, it is depressing, so until we get it, enjoy playing Chaos Theory and so on.			"

												So Tom Clancy Splinter cellThis is pretty much the original Stealth-Sneaky game as far as i know.Interestingly because of the initial disinterest in it ,the devs were gonna make it as a James Bond game(lol)The game originally came out in 2003 and gained notriety quite quickly as a result of the games involvement with Tom Clancy.(Tom clancy(rip) is actually a damn good thriller writer,check him out if you can)So the game is not like todays ""stealth"" games,Theres no easy QTE missions or a nice gun that you can shoot your way out with the only punishement being a score penalty.Your gun has just 30 bullets for a entire level,takes 5 seconds for it to be accurate and needs 3 shots to kill a enemy,AND several missions have the requirement that you cannot incur any fatal injuries.The setting is quite great for its time like a nice Central asian city,a oil rig and even a Cia Facility(Langley).The graphics are obviously a bit dated but in my opinion hold quite well for its time.The animations are quite well done and there are a variety of moves that make the gameplay interesting and not blocky/restrictive.The story is actually quite nice,following the path of a typical dictator-gone-wild-revenge-on-usa thing.The stealth aspect of the game is actually done quite well,darkness,light is well represented with the option of shooting out lights to create darkness for you to hide,There is ZERO handholding,there wont be any markers or compasses to show you where to go,what you have to do and the location of the enemies.You have to solve everything yourself.The AI as well is quite good for its time as many stealth games are put down as a result of extremely wonky AI that acts like a 5 year old with no consciousness.The controls MAY take a bit time to get used to as jump is with the shift key(inb4 random sticky keys notification) and there is no ADS and you pull your gun out with E.Anyways now on to what i hatedThe Save/Load system is horrible.The game Autosaves ONCE in 45 minutes that is at the start and the end section of a mission and you have to manually save everytime and you have to type the save game name again to overwrite it.There are no checkpoints(maybe im spoiled from modern games) so yeah sometimes you forget to save and die and then you gotta do 20 mins of work again.Some places where you have to find a pipe to climb etc are poorly representated.I understand it being a part of the difficulty curve of the game but sometimes it just bugs out or doesnt detect that you are holding a pipe and you fall,or you realise that the actual thing you had to climb was in that doorway just behind you.Some extremely dumb bugs like you getting magnetically sucked into a hole that you cant escape which is actually just a normal texture (Eg at the start of the Oil Rig level,wont spoil anything)Barring nostalgia and the fact that im a fan of all things Tom Clancy,This game has actually aged quite well,with the graphics and animations being bearable for the entirety of your experience.The story is quite servicable if you dont know the genre and the Stealth gameplay is crisp,interesting and brutal,just as it should be.

												Just to let other older gamers know, in case you're wondering like I was if there's any way this will look and run even remotely bearable on modern systems (and especially Win 10 64-bit), that it actually seems to work! All that was needed was to apply the widescreen patch (http://thirteenag.github.io/wfp#sc as referenced by ThirteenAG in thread http://steamcommunity.com/app/13560/discussions/0/392184522712015351/) and BAM, there it is in 1080p and looking better than some titles from around 2010.For this price, I'm pretty confident it was a good idea to begin this walk down the memory lane. Looking forward to relive all the enjoyment I once had with this game!			"

The AI is intelligent, the controls are good, the story is engaging, and it's challenging in the best possible way.  The entire splinter cell series is worth playing, and if you haven't touched it yet then you have a treat waiting for you.			"

												IMHO, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is the most innovative and lovable ""first game from a franchise"" game. Even though this game is old, it's still well worth any gamer's time and money. It is also one of the few Ubisoft titles on Steam that does not require an account on Uplay, which is always a ""plus"". Although I played this a lot when it first came out, I just couldn't put it down when I revisited it with the question if the game has aged well.

												So you may have seen my review of Splinter Cell Conviction. If you haven't, I hate the game. I mostly hate the game because this one is BEAUTIFUL! Oh ma gawd this game is fantastic! The AI is clever, especially at this time in gaming. The game looks rather good, not that graphics are the main focus and never should be. The stealth is fantastic, masterfully done. Finding different paths to bypass guards is really cool. Or making a distraction and hiding in shadows as the investigate, then moving along or knocking them out. I feel awesome. I feel like frikin' James bond, but cooler and better with less sex. The story isn't normal Tom Clancy standards, but not as bad as Call of duty (which is just TERRORISTS TERRORISTS SHOOT SHOOT BLAH!). I highly recommend this game to anyone. I'd give it a 10/10!			"

												One of the last real stealth games, remains true through-out and does a great job never to go the route of turning into a sloppy dumbed down shooter with optional stealth, like 95% of stealth games do today!The controls are decent, although few frustrating hiccups can occur, as you get more accustomed to the game these hiccups happen less and less frequently.The graphics haven't aged a day, they look incredible and even more so when you take into consideration that this was released in 2002!The sound is great and the dialogue is awesome, to sit in the shadows and listen to your enemies cheesy chatter is entertaining and very humourous.I'd recommend this to anyone who enjoys stealth games			"

												Comparison to Blacklist: (NOTE: This original review is only here because it was helpful to 27 people)Better than blacklist? Oh, yes story line is exellent! actual concequences for action. if you leave a body in the open alarm goes off mission failed. it is fun and is a challenge. Blacklist on the other hand is a reskin of assasins creed and had no elements of a stealth game. Perfectionist is to easy but on this game easy is hard. Sure its old but it still holds its own and has AMAZING voice acting Unlike blacklist. Micheal Ironside fits sam perfectly. amazing game 9/10 ign amirite.UPDATED REVIEW:   Pros:+ Micheal Ironside+ Actions have consequences + All Artificial Animation not MOCAP+ Level Design + It is A Challange+ Settings+ Brink Of War FellingDebatable/ Graphics/ Tri-Lens Goggles Cons:- Semi Weak Plot- Shadow and Lighting errors- Auttomated Turrets Are A Big Annoyance- Light meter sometimes does not match surroundings.Easily my favorite in the series. Great action and gameplay.FINAL VERDICT 9.7/10 MASTERPIECE(Please Excuse Any Mistakes)			"

												I love the Splinter Cell series because it's not the same kind of game over and over.  There's a very good reason Tom Clancy's name is on it, and that 10 years after it was released, it's still worth money...because it's awesome :)  Different missions require different playing strategies which challenges the gamer to a variety of styles.  It's also filled with secrets that don't always become obvious to the user at first glance, and it requires you to think about your next move.  Plus your character gets to do interesting things like rappell down walls, use night or thermal vision, remain undetected, interrogate or manipulate npc's, shimmy underneath moving trains etc.  Mandatory training in the game, prior to the first mission ensures you are confortable with the controls, before everything counts.  Meaning less time reading the manual and more time playing the game :)  I'd give it 5 stars!			"

												I played(and completed)this game on PS2 before,and I can say that this is an amazing game ^_^I remember how this game just captivated me when I first played it on PS2,because of the amazing music,characters,etc in itThe plot(in a summary): The President of Georgia is assasinated,allowing billionaire Kombayn Nikoladze(main antagonist)to seize power by bloodless coup d'etat. Sam FIsher(the character you play as),former Navy SEAL officer and Persian Gulf War,is recruited by the NSA to work with it's new division,Third Echelon. He is dispatched to Tbilisi to investigate the disappearence of 2 CIA officers. He finds out that a man named Vyacheslav Grinko(another antagonist)removed their subdermal tracking devices and tracks him down to the defense ministry,finding out that Nikoladze is doing an illegal operation in Azerbaijan. Sam goes to an oil rig and finds that NATO forces are sending fighter jets to bomb the rig,he finds Piotr Lejava and gets his suitcase,which has a laptop containing an encryption key to""The Ark"". The information is revealed to have come from a mole in the CIA,so Sam goes to the CIA HQ to investigate,and interrogates Mitchell Dougherty,finding that his OCD caused him to backup data on an insecure laptop,which was exploited by a network owned by Kalinatek. He goes to Kalinatek and finds Ivan,and gets his encryption key. He goes to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar and finds that the Chinese general Feirong is working with Nikoladze,and that American soldiers are going to be executed on live TV. He rescues the soldiers,and kills Grinko in a firefight. He goes back to the Chinese Embassy and forces Feirong to shre information stored on his computer,which reveals that Nikoladze fled back to Georgia. Sam goes back to Georgia and finds Nikoladze in the Presidential Palace,where he narrowly escapes being killed,with Lambert's arranged blackout saving him. He then assassinates Nikoladze after learning that he is disclosing The Ark's location.The music is amazing.The characters are amazing,especially Lambert and Grimsdottir.The stealth mechanics are pretty good too(even if the AI can be wonky at times)Anyways,overall this is an amazing game that I recommend to everyone.10/10 from me ^_^			"

Splinter Cell is the first game to star Sam Fisher, and its success as a stealth series today is without question. Voiced by Michael Ironside (V: The Final Battle, Total Recall), it truly is a must-have game for any fan of the stealth-action genre.As a gamer that has played the title on PS3 as part of the HD collection, I found the game to be a satisfying experience on the PC. It plays well on Windows 10 despite being an older title - the only noteworthy technical adjustments I felt I had to do were in the .init file, tweaking brightness and gamma to get the shadows in-sync with the stealth meter in-game. Links to optional mods and fixes to common problems can be found here - I used the Widescreen fix and the PS3 HD texture pack.Overall the game is short, but can be much longer depending on your control setup and your ability to assess situations and how to tackle them. There are also some tricks that can be used to avoid detection or combat altogether.After some research into getting my Dualshock 3 to work, I ended up resorting to keyboard and mouse. I was concerned over the difference in how speed of movement was handled (up and down on the mouse wheel as opposed to automatic with control stick pressure), but by the end of the training level I realised it wasn't impeding my gameplay, and that I actually enjoyed it. I recommend a mouse wheel with clicking intervals though. Movement speed is critical in terms of silence in this game.As a stealth game, I find the most important aspect of the interface to be the stealth meter. In perfect darkness it becomes less important to stay slow and quiet because no one can see what's going on anyway. A variety of movement is available to Sam Fisher, including jumping, climbing, crouching, horizontal pipe traversing, and even wall jumps. It's possible to sneak up on guards to knock them out or grab and interrogate. Door codes, doors locked with retinal scans and locks that need to be picked all form major obstacles to your ability to progress (perhaps unsurprisingly). A quick menu is available to access such items as lockpicks, diversion cameras, smoke grenades and sticky shocker rounds (think taser/non-lethal KOs).There is only one pistol and one special assault rifle. Using a weapon is as simple as unholstering, aiming, then firing. Thankfully everything is silenced.  For the ultra-cautious, it's even possible to pop a little camera under a door to check if the next area is clear. It's also possible to use the pistol while hanging from a pipe - not many games could boast this sort of freedom way back when.The one detraction I found comes in the form of the move whereby Sam jumps up a corridor wall to stand on the walls with his legs doing the splits over the corridor path. I didn't find any instances where I could do it. Perhaps I just didn't look hard enough. It seemed like such a pointless thing to show off during training though. I didn't much like the forced combat events either - but with practice it's possible to get through these with no kills / no damage too.Gameplay is thoroughly enjoyable most of the time though. The different levels each offer something new, and are unique enough that the overall game doesn't become stagnant. There are instances where discovery by the enemy or just one alarm can mean game over, but for the mostpart you are free to choose combat or stealth. In my mind stealth is more rewarding anyway, and it's clear this is what the game was created for. There are many sections of the game that you will feel badass for getting through undetected, such as evading sniffer dogs, armoured cameras or lights that can't be shot out, or even time-sensitive events where you must be fast, queit and invisible all at once.Splinter Cell has its funny moments too. There's a Chinese guard no one like to patrol with because of his outlandish theories on American hotdog stands being propoganda cells; one Colonel that everyone hates (one guard even spits on his food); one guard saying he's going to the 'little boys room', and he even sounds embarrassed about it. Even Fisher's limited dialogue is good for a laugh.The colour palette is dark. It's a stealth game, yeah? You won't see much anyway if you spend the majority of the game with your night vision goggles on, as the whole game becomes greyscale. But if you enjoy great gameplay then little things like colour shouldn't matter. The important thing to remember is that this is Third Echelon and the government is relying on you. The nation's top brass will be seeing and hearing everything you do. Of course, covert ops is not something you forget. 'It's like riding a bike.''Or wearing high heels.'It may not have achievements (such as its HD counterpart), but they can still be accomplished. A worthy addition to any gamer's library, at any price.			"

												I played this game alot when I was younger. Probably around 6 years old. Most of the time I didn't know what to do, or how to really play the game, but I understood the general concept. Playing the game has made me relive old memories and it's still a good game to this day. Splinter Cell, the first out of 6 games in the series is a good gem. Released in 2003, this game was quite worth the time. I'm quite surprised by the A.I. in this game due to it being an older game. The A.I. is generally smart and gives quite a challenge even on the easiest difficulty being normal. There are about 10 missions or so, but each mission is realtivley long and you will most likley die alot in the beginning as you need to get a good feeling for the game before you actually get into it. Most likley you'll have to watch a couple videos for throughout certain points in the game. Generally every mission has its challenge, but it's still very fun.The sneaking aspect in this game is something that I have really never seen in a stealth game. Splinter Cell only offers this type of stealth in there games, where you have to be quiet at all times, move carefully every second and plan your tactics strategically and quickly as possible. Conviction and Blacklist didn't quite follow this same design for a stealth shooter but still made it very fun with a different design altogether. Meaning, the first splinter cell, pandora tommorw and chaos theory are quite unique to their design and make it worth playing.Lets get into the game itself. The year is 2003. You play as Sam Fisher, a former agent of the CIA is now recruited into americas newest division agency, third echoleon. Along his side is Lambert, a former friend of Sam who helped on previous missions in other agencies like the CIA, and Anna Grmistodder. (I maybe wrong about the CIA part but I have good feeling he's related to that field.) She's a computer hacker that serves the agency and aids Sam in information about various things.The story itself is quite interesting. It isn't anything too fancy, I haven't beaten the game yet but it is quite interesting as it dives into the political world of countries and the struggles that occour when new leaders or dictators rule over a country. Essentially this isn't any different as the basic story is stopping a dictator gone mad after realising the crimes he has committed. The game breaks this up over ten missions and generally the plot gets a bit more interesting each mission. The gameplay ties into this generally well, but it's more fun as the stealth feature gives it a unique feeling as this game masters the genre of stealth very well. You'll even find yourself going back to some missions to see what you could of done differently, or maybe even see if you're up to a harder challenge. This game makes it so it isn't too hard, but nothing like a cake walk. Generally there are times where you may get frustrated, but once you realise your abilities and how you can tie them in any situation, the game becomes generally easier and just fun to play overall. It may seem that this game wants you to think logically. Essentially, yes, it does want you to use your head and think outside the box a bit from time to time, but it makes it fun to the point where you don't have to worry to much on whether you'll be able to reach your objective.Overall, this game is reccomended for people who like a challenge, as well as stealth games in general. This game is quite unique and in my opnion, games like these should be made more often rather then the shooters or stealth games we get nowa days.9/10			"

Sadly though, the newer cards don't have the architecture needed to give off the dynamtic shadows.  But that's oh kay. It's all about the game play. I recommend this game. That is if you are into stealth like i am.			"

												even though the lighting and the stealth system are kinda broken (it's often hard to tell if you are walking into light or not), it's still a great game that you need to finish at least once in your lifebut if you compared this to chaos theory it's basically the worst stealth game of all timebecause *SPOILER ALERT* anyone who says: ""Chaos Theory wasn't the best SC, nor was it the best stealth game ever"" is wrong. but this gets a solid 8 out of 10 lamberts yelling ""my god, fisher""			"

												Coming to this game after 12 years I thought the experience is gonna be bad but it has really decent graphics and good animations. You can technically do all the things you can do in the newest one. It is fairly easy, challenging at times but not so hard, it has nice realistic take on missions, you infiltrate get the orders and choose your path in whether stealthy killing, assault or no killing. All in all it was good experience, the story wasn't bad as well. However the aiming in this game is ridiculously horrible, even after you wait for the reticle to close you might spend a whole magazine trying to shoot a light, I dunno who saw him fit for the field and if you try to snipe, oh man you need to battle with the thing to get a shot, but It's cool there are alternate ways to shooting. Great game. Note aside: Sam can take down organizations and he couldn't swim...			"

												This game is cool! I passed the whole game in 12.2h of playtime.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game's graphics are awesome compared to the other games from '02-The mechanics of the game are a lot different then other Tom Clancy games-This game is one of those rare stealth games, where stealth is your utimate weapon-Lots of gadgets and toys to choose from-The game has 10 Missions and they are pretty good-Enemy models are excellent, except for the thing when they are about 5 meters away from you, their heads turn in squares-No bugs or crashes-Community isn't deadCONS-Official Web Site isn't working anymore-A bit too hard to pass if you are new to this type of game-No MultiplayerI recommend it. 8/10 would be Sam Fisher again!

												The classic game that started the franchise: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a great experience through and through. The controls may throw players off at first, as this was released when developers thought that the Arrow keys were a good movement option. After some minor tweaking, you'll find everything comfortable, and easy to slip into. You are Sam Fisher, a covert ops agent working for Third Echelon as a Splinter Cell field agent. A certain dictator has recently risen to power, and has been making serious threats against the United States. With the threat of war looming over everyone's heads, it is up to Sam to difuse the situation, and piece together what the Dictator's true intentions are. If that doesn't sound like a recipe to kick butt, I don't know what's wrong with you. The stealth is superb, and the challenge high. I definitely recommend checking this game out.			"

												Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a game where you give people phobia of sweaty old men hiding in dark places. You play as Sam Fisher, a formerly retired special operative of NSA's Third Echelon, a covert organization who's operatives can enact the “Fifth freedom” which basically means they can screw with people in other countries and get away with it.The game starts in the DISTANT FUTURE OF 2004! The Georgian president is assassinated and billionaire Kombayn Nikoladze  takes power in a bloodless coup. And yes I did have to look up how to spell that name. But something fishy is going on and Third Echelon sends Michael Ironside's voice to find out what!Splinter Cell is one of those stealth games that came out when stealth games were expected to be stealth games and not action games where you sneak every now and then. You have to keep track on three factors, darkness, sound, and space. If you move too fast or aren't in suitable shadows, then nearby guards will pick up that something is screwey. Back in the day, Splinter Cell was being pushed against Metal Gear Solid for king of the genre, and by pushed I think Game Pro wouldn't shut up about it for months before getting bored and going on to...I don't know, Warcraft III, I guess. It's kind of an unfair comparison, though, since both series go about their core gameplay completely differently. Since Splinter Cell is from 2002, it obviously has some of that old clunky game feel that game journalists seem to not be able to overcome. Like if a game doesn't play itself then it “didn't age well.” This is why you shouldn't listen to game journalists, they are smelly idiots and I am cooler than them. Splinter Cell expects a certain amount of competency from it's players. It shows you how to use everything you need in the tutorial level and then eases you into it with a pretty basic first level. Unlike later games in the series, Splinter Cell is rather straight forward and linear, making each room more like a stealth challenge than a stop on the way to your actual objective. Going back and playing the original game now kind of makes it feel like a prototype to the next two games, all of the features are there but not as fine tuned as it would come to be in Pandora Tomorrow, or Chaos Theory. Everything works, don't get the wrong idea, it's still a solid experience, but it doesn't hold up to it's successors. Still, Splinter Cell is a very charming game, you can tell a lot of love and attention to detail went into it when it was in development. Hey, check out this super neat lighting system on Unreal 2.0! Can you believe we're pulling this off on the PS2 as well? And look at our movable fabrics and objects, isn't that insane! The characters in Splinter Cell were also something not common for the genre or even other Tom Clancy games at the time or in the future. They were all professional characters, but the banter and discussions between Sam and the others was something endearing and really sold you on them as human beings instead of just polygons and coding.Sam, played by Michael Ironside, has this very distinct gravel to his voice, but instead of being a gruff, grr, “Whiskey Tango Foxtrot” kind of military guy, he's instead a wisecracking, charismatic older man with a sense of humor and a moral code. The banter between him and Irving Lambert, played by Don Jordan, are the highlights of the Splinter Cell story, even more so in later games. So looking at the more recent games, it kind of hurts a little that they  Not only killed off Lamberts character.  but also completely cut out the fun and humorous segments between Sam and his crew in favor of being “Darker” and “Grittier”. To be more specific it's lame and whoever thought those changes for later games is also lame. EDIT: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that you can control your movement speed with the mouse wheel. I mean, how cool is that? Why don't more games do that? That's ingenious.  But should you play Splitting Atoms? It's still holds up, it's nowhere near as good as Pandora Tomorrow or the masterpiece that is Chaos Theory, but you can see all of the framing and build up in this game that eventually made those two pillars of the genre they are today. If you like the series but somehow haven't played the original, you should probably give it a shot. Also, there's a glitch in the second level I found that makes it unbeatable unless you restart or cheat. It was nothing that soured me to the experience, I just thought I should let you know. Splinter Cell gets 8 Michael Ironsides reading you a bed time story, out of 10. You can plant a pineapple by slicing off the top and planting it in the soil.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

Story isn't interesting, typical good vs bad guys. Several good jokes here and there that adds to the game. Stealth is where it perfects at, ai is not dumb, killing enemies is not mandatory and tools that you get troughout the game got Splinter Cell ahead of other stealth games of its time.			"

												Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell is the game that defined Stealth Action and proved its worth. This game has a legendary reputation of stealth, action, adventure, gadgets, and funny lines from badass Sam Fisher. The story of this game is about Sam Fisher, a father who really cares about his daughter Sara Fisher and Third Echelon which is a top-secret government agency unknown to the public eye. Sam Fisher and Third Echelon travel to different locations across the globe while hunting down the bad guys/ terrorists.I highly recommend this game if you're into really stealthy games that requires you to mostly be non-lethal at all times (unless you're been given the Fifth-Freedom order) and staying in the shadows while timing your movements! :D			"

												It has not aged well. Controls are so clunky that it's a pain to play and it's hit or miss on whether or not you interact with an environment object correctly. Example: jumping to a ledge to hang on to it, but falling to your death the first two times because the character wouldn't latch on. Another example (which is where I stopped playing after 3 tries): trying to jump onto a cable to slide down an elevator shaft, but the character won't grab the cable and falls 30 feet to his death.Doesn't support modern resolutions/systems and as some sort of weird byproduct it behaves like it's trying to alt-tab itself out and I have to alt-tab it back in.Between this and Ghost Recon I think I've learned my lesson not to buy ancient Tom Clancy games.

												In this game you deliver freedom in sneaky ways, mainly to Georgians (the horrible Asian kind of Georgian, not the TRUE RED-WHITE-AND-BLUEBLOODED 'MURICAN PATRIOT kind). You are freedom-protector first class Sam Fisher, a veteran NSA employee who keeps people safe by reading their private emails on data sticks and shooting foreigners. He loves freedom so much that he has an extra one called the Fifth Freedom, which is the freedom to shoot Georgians in the face in order to protect the other four freedoms.It's a fun stealth game, not as good as Chaos Theory, but better than the vast majority of games in the genre. It's best to play it before CT, so that it doesn't seem like a step backward. A must-have for all freedom-lovers.			"

Open combat is not recommended. Theme is also nice, being the super agent and all, with quite likable leading character.The biggest game's let down is its level designed. It is a very linear game and because of that it never reaches the level of Thief series. Places you visit don't feel explorable enough. Still worth a shot if you like stealth games.			"

												This game is a true classic, and basicly the roots to the Splinter Cell genera. Though the use of stealth is a bit odd, it dosent take away, that goining in guns blazing isnt the best option. While the games leads you to use stealth, the game suffers from a few bugs and glitches that not ruin but mess up the stealth element to the game (these are minor and aren't game breaking). Bug/Glitches/Mechanics:1. In some levels while shadow are your form of disguise and to hidde bodies and yourself there are some areas that, are pitch black yet when standing in it, the Ai will detect you and investigate or spot you all at once.2. The Ai's field of View is, wide; sneaking up to someone from their side, in a dark or lit room will alert them atomaticly, going from behind is your best bet. this also comes to attcking or passing by them from above.3. The Ai have anodd jerky movment to them that, if you were to attacking from behind, the Ai might spin quickly and spot you, this also comes to their patrol pateren as they might stutter in movment.4.Your detection meter is useful to know when enemies can see you or not, but also suffers a glitch or bug, no matter how dark you hidding spot is if your tick mark passes the first bracket from the dark end then eneimes will be courious or spot you. Meaning you'll have to stay in total darkenes to avoid beeing seen.5. Your gun, the five seven silenced pistol, is very inacuarate, you have to wait a total of 5 sec before your shot matches the cross hair, or else you'll shoot every where excepte your target.6. To grab enemeis attention, you have to walk extremly close to you target and get their attention, or throw or shoot something close to their body in order for them to move, but sometimes they might converge to investigate where your hidding.Summary:Overall the game is very fun, the game lacks flexability to play an absolte stealth run (where as you dont kill or knock out anyone). The game instead would rather want you to kill enemies if possible and/ or knock them out if possible. This game is an old title while my review sounds as if I dislike the game I dont, try the game its fun, just dont expect to pass the entier game without alerting any gaurds or having to kill or knockout any non objective based Ai.

												Splinter Cell... The game that launched so many ships, and has attained the status of classic for the stealth game genre...The very first entry of the serie, sadly, aged pretty poorly. Having only played it relatively recently, I don't have the nostalgia googles most people have(mostly because it was on a console I didn't own when it came out, and one I didn't bother to get). So I need to adress the fact this game has a lot of issues. Controls are horribly wonky to the point of being irresponsive at times. A lot of game mechanics are actually pretty broken like the segment where you must avoid being sniped in a minefield, and you will get hit even in complete darkness if the game feels like it wants to do so. The control scheme itself shows it was thought with console in mind, and isn't instinctive nor convenient. As for graphisms, well... You know. But graphisms are probably the the last of your worries.It's not a bad game, mind you, but for today standards, it's certainly not a good one. At best, it's mediocre, and it's there either for nostagics, or for people who want to get it due to its classic status to know what they have missed a few years back.I suggest you get it in a pack, to understand the origins of the franchise, and how it evolved from there, and for a very low price, which shouldn't be too hard. Understand what you're buying though, because no matter what, you will be disapointed(unless you wear the aforementioned nostalgia googles).I only recommend the game out of the proverbial classic status, because it's a game one should at least play once, just for educational purposes. See how it began, why it, and other stealth games, evolved the way they did, and measure how far down the road they went.Remember kids, this is how the light bulbs genocide started.			"

However the controls and stealth itself (gameplay) feel as good as they felt 14 years ago, in 2002. As Sam Fisher you will be sneaking, climbing, and shooting through fun and diverse levels in world class, while dropping some sarcastic one-liners 2000s style. Just promise me you won't take this cliché story too seriously, remember gameplay is king. "

												This game is GREAT! A must buy for stealth fans, (if you don't mind slightly clunky controls). This is a great first game and the series only got better from here! Splinter Cell is one of my favourite stealth series out there. The only problem I had with this game is that during the cutscenes my screen would flicker rapidly, causing them to be practically unwatchable, which meant I didn't understand any of the story besides ""blah blah blah, stop World War 3 blah blah stealthy blah good lord Fisher blah blah"".(The quicksave function is also a great and much-needed addition)			"

												I would recommend this game to gamers who don't care about graphics or if you have a crappy PC (Me :3). It has this awesome vibe and it is something that I remember playing  back on my PS2 (Even though it was Splinter Cell Pandora Tomorrow). So yes, it is worth the money. I would give it a 4.7 out of 5.			"

												Honestly ... beware.  At least if you're on Windows 10.  The worst issue is that video cutscenes flicker, flash and stutter unwatchably.  There is a fix for this, a DirectX8-DirectX9 converter from ENB, which fixes the video issue, but for me it made the game itself not work at all.  It may be playable on older versions of Windows, especially if you don't have a wide-screen monitor ... but these days, really, who doesn't have a wide-screen monitor?  Control assignments are a bit weird, too, and often things break if you try to reassign them to something more rational.I actually tried this out because I was given Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow for PS2, hated it due to control issues, and wanted to find out whether it was any more playable on PC.  So far, the answer is no.(About Pandora Tomorrow, by the way ... the breaking point for me was when I got through the first major mission successfully, started the second in which you are issued a FN F2000 rifle instead of your trusty FN Five-Seven pistol by any other name, and promptly discovered that the game makes it impossible to hold the rifle's sights on a five-foot target at fifteen yards.  Which, frankly, is completely freaking ridiculous, the absolute worst example of game-imposed artificial klutziness I've ever encountered.)			"

												Game holds up well in alot of areas, one issue I do remember is the game isnt clear on its movement system at times, some things you think you can climb but nope you cant.AI has always been a bit dumb in my opinion while there shooting is ok, alot of the times you can find a shadow in the middle of there fire and essentially leave without getting hit or seen walking away.Music is toppers.Graphics hold up because the game is dark as ♥♥♥♥, and its one of the easier old games to get 1080p working well.Little Note however when playing at 1080p cutscenes are not that so the game will flicker back and forth to the smaller res and higher one, and also at 1080p one HUD element rolls off the screen is you keep pausing that being your objective, its a small issue but this game really could use the higher res.

												A big entry on one of the most renowned stealth game series of all time. Splinter Cell offers a short, but really complete experience.Pros:+fair but pretty challenging+voice acting+writing (characters feel alive and are likeable)+core movement mechanics, even though may feel clunky for someone with no experience with such games is really intuitive and allows the player to make Sam do anything he wishes+great level design+gadgets+different environements+sound and light mechanics+great music+great graphics (for 2002)+solid political fictionCons:-coming out of stealth and killing enemies is necessary a lot of the times, making 'ghosting' impossible-it is a short game			"

												Anyone who knows me knows that I am a huge sucker for real stealth gameplay.  There are different types of stealth and the kind that I hunger for is actually rare these days.  Most games have stealth as an option but I never see it as the only way to progress.  Options are nice but I love it when the game punishes you for being spotted.  Forget about shooting your way through.  Guns are literally only used to take out lights.  Anything else is a travesty.  Hardcore stealth like this is very few and fare between.  Which is why Splinter Cell is one of my favorite game series.  So much nostalgia sneaking past guards in very dark places.  Using your wits and the shadows to sneak by.  Hell some missions flat out failed you if your spotted and why the ♥♥♥♥ not when the entire premise is that you weren't supposed to be there.  Taking out a single guard requires timing and strategy as just taking him out isn't enough.  Finding a good place to hide his body is critical.  Hell some missions were so strict that taking out anyone was mission failure.  I cannot stress enough how much I love it!  The earlier SC games were a treasure that I will always love.  Sad that Pandora Tomorrow isn't on steam because without that we have to skip to Chaos Theory and after that things will never be the same for this series.  This game is really showing its age but it still holds up really well.			"

												It takes some getting used to since it is an older stealth action game, but it's fun and is really detailed in its mechanics. You use cool NSA gadgets and use your environment and tools to sneak around and knock down or kill who's in your way.There's a lot of replayability in how to tackle levels and it's still to this day really fun to just ghost through a level and make it through without being seen. It's not the best in the series since Chaos Theory has some better mechanics but it's definitely one of the best stealth action games ever made.			"

												Classic stealth game. Not in the same league as Metal Gear Solid, as far as some of the story elements go. And the cutscenes are no-where near as cinematic. Great plot nonetheless.You are Third Echelon agent Sam Fisher, and you're going to the world with your stealth. No really though, the stealth in the game is unlike any other 3rd person stealth title. Hiding in the shadows, climbing poles and epic splitting above people's heads. It's quite awesome.The plot is Tom Clancy eque. He didn't write the game series, but he did create the character and the universe, so props, and RIP. This series is exactly what I expect from a master of the military spec-ops genre.9.3/10			"

												In Splinter Cell you play as one of the best and agent Third Echelon has to offer, Sam Fisher (Michael Ironside).He travels to several locations under command by Irving Lambert (Don Jordan) in the world to find out about Kombayn Nikoladze and his connection in several assassinations close before his rule.Developed by Ubisoft Montreal, a modified Unreal Engine 2 was used to allow the light and dark stealth mechanic.GraphicsUsing light and dark to your advantage, shadows, the game still holds up to this day.I did looked up on the guide section to edit the graphic settings to enhance it a little bit.Of course in the backgrounds you see the age of the game, but it did not bother me.GameplayYou can use the light and dark to get around. A nice meter in the down right corner tells you if you are a ninja or a Christmas tree.The enemies can interact with the environment in numbers of ways. Like they search for you if they had seen you and might call others for help.Stealth is the key in this game and you do not have enough firepower to shoot through the game (although possible but not recommend).It took me about 6 hours to get to the end on normal difficulty with a few retries because failing some levels which never frustrated me.SoundSound is important in this game and has descent ones. You recognise most of them instinctively to know what is going on in the world.Sometimes you hear a nice background music to set the mood.In combat you do get the same tune everytime which is slightly annoying.The guns Sam carries are most silent and therefore there is nothing interesting for the sounds to note here. You do get some nice fireworks though.The GoodiesStill got the looks.Still plays as a unique game.Story is easy and fast, most of the time told by news reports (cut scenes).Nice unique variety of levels. Makes most use of the game mechanics. Especially the end game.Sam Fisher.Irving Lambert.Sam Fisher finds the news funny.The badguysAI sometimes sees you, even when you're in the dark.A badly done death.Is it bad this list ends here.ClosureTom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a great game and the first of many. I played this game on the PS2 back in the day and still is one of my favorite games of all time and it surprised me the game plays very well for today's standards.As always I prefer gameplay over graphics even though I mentioned the latter first.For anyone who is a fan of this gerne, this game really fits in your collection.Even though the AI can be wonky, it is still fun to play with.That is all I will and can write from the top of my head from my not so first impressions and to the end of the game.To bad Pandora Tomorrow, the sequel got removed from Steam, but from the early days I can tell it is nice game and if you can get it to work (there are some hints in the Community section here somewhere) you will not be disappointed.Anyway thanks for reading. Hope it helped anyone to decide if the game is worth getting. (got the whole package on a summer sale) and stay off the streets, I mean be stealthy and infinite goggles on. Stay Cool.			"

												A great gem, the stealth is great, the game has better points than Blacklist and Conviction like the dark, It is way more realistic in this game than the newest ones, you could simply use stealth without killing anyone and just pass them.The graphics are really good for a 2002 game, the gameplay is great, you can walk slowly, walk, run and run a little faster, It's even more complex than the newest Splinter Cell games.The only con in this game is that there is no variety at all, there's only 2 guns, the pistol (FN Five-seveN) and the rifle (FN F2000 with Grenade Launcher/SC-20K) even if you don't have to kill people, It would still be fun to use a shotgun with a suppressor or to have even more guns to choose from.It's a great game, I would suggest it to anyone who likes stealth, Splinter Cell, Tom Clancy's, anti-terrorist and third person games fans.9/10			"

												Pretty good stealth action game. I remember wanting to play this back when it came out on PS2, but I never got around to it. I gotta say that the game has aged rather well. It looks great and runs flawlessly with no visual bugs. I did find myself using quick-saves and quick-loads a lot. Sometimes the grab option doesnt show up when I sneak behind enemies, so they end up turning around and alerting everyone. There are some neat gadgets you can use to strategically take out enemies in different ways. You can shoot a distraction camera which attracts enemies by making noise and then takes them out with gas when they get close. My only major complaint is that the tutorial never tells you that you can steady your sniper-scope aim by holding down the right mouse button. I didnt realize this until the final level of the game. Anyway, I got a good 12 hours of play out of this, and its usually dirt cheap when its on sale.			"

												Better than Blacklist in every way. It was a bit of a pain to get it running at 1440p and I had to sacrifice the cutscenes not being in fullscreen but the game is beautiful. The use of the mouse wheel to control speed is brilliant and the plot line is so engaging as  your constantly put in the most f***** situations. Play it on hard difficulty of course. Now time to test the fan-made fixes for Pandora Tommorow! The best series ever IMO before Conviction happened. RIP Tom			"

												This is by far the best splinter cell game that ubisoft has ever created. This game unlike the others has aged well, sure the game doesn't have phenomenal graphics but it is definetely a classic that ever splinter cell fan should own. The controls and movement are a little janky like almost all old games but the reason why this is the best game out of all of them is that it requires the most amount of skill and stealth to get through the levels. Unlike the ones that came out later like chaos theory you cannot run at enemies and knife them. If you do that in this game it'll result in your immediate death.  "

General GameplayTom Clancy's Splinter Cell is a third-person stealth game with a Story that can make you fall asleep, it's been overused nowadays, typical threat to United States.You'll need a few hours and lots of trial and error until you get a hang of the gameplay (unless you played this before), thanks to the Manual Saves option where we can save anywhere, it makes the game less frustrating.There are some major bugs that break the gameplay, and rarely make missions impossible to complete without resorting to Developers Console.Gameplay Rating: 2/5EngineUnreal Engine 2Graphics OptionsIt has all the basic options we could ask for a 2002 game, resolution, shadows, textures, effects. Along with lots of costumization in the files.Graphics QualityFor a 2002 game looks pretty solid, as expected from Unreal Engine! The cutscenes don't work properly on Windows 10 thought, forcing us to either use third-party mods (that can break the game further) or play in Window Mode (like I did).PerformancePerformance is solid, a toaster can run this game.Engine Rating: 4/5Overall Rating: 6/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and engine (how the game looks and runs). If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below! "

												Absolute classic. Not as good as the third game in the series (Chaos Theory), but still very good. Very challenging on hard difficulty level (to be fair so is normal difficulty if you've not played the game before). This is a game that to do well, you have to go slow, take your time, be patient and wait for the right moment. Find somewhere to hide where you can watch your enemies, learn their movements, figure out when to sneak past, and when to grab them...Run and gun? Nope. You died...Didn't bother hiding that dead body at the beginning of the level? Body discovered and an alarm sounded just before you reach the end of the level: mission over...			"

But the only splinter cell I've ever played besides this one was conviction and on the xbox 360. (IT WONT WORK ON MY PC). Conviction was fun... Really fun, I completed it 18 times. So I thought this one would be good too. It was   fun... For the first 3 hours... Then it got really boring... Theres no option to say 'Buy game if you want' theres only do you recommend it, 'yes' or 'no' .  Basically buy the game if you like playing games for couple hours then deleting them.			"

												The game is decent its worth trying out if you want to see how the series has evolved and how it started but i do think that the sequels are better and more fun because they do evolve and build upon what this game created. The story i found very boring and uninteresting i was just skipping through the cutscenes after the oil rig mission i couldn't care less the spinter cell games never really had strong stories.I just focused on the gameplay and after beating it now a second time after a few years since i first played it my opinion of the game hasn't changed. I do think that there are much better stealth games out there and i do think this game is dated. The game is not easy and can be very frustrating at times and it required a lot of trail and error and alot of quick saving and quick loading which the sequels have also fixed because you didn't do those things very often. The game is also very crpytic as to telling you where you need to go and does a poor job of directing the player in the right direction and the level design is very average there isn't really any memorable levels or sequences. The game is not bad i just didn't have a lot of fun with it and i wished i was playing the sequels pandora tomorrow and chaos theory instead which i feel are much better games. I recommend it if you want to see how the franchise started and how it evolved but if you are just  looking to play a good stealth game there are far better options. Go play choas theory if you never played a splinter cell game before.5/10 (Average)			"

												If you love stealth games, then you've got to give this one a go. This is the first of 6 splinter cell games and is probably the most memorable one in my opinion though i've only played through the first 3 but i've seen gameplay of all. If you have only played Conviction or Blacklist which are the two latest ones, then you are going to be in for a shock of how difficult and hardcore the earlier games are, you have to actually sneak around the place and stick to the shadows, it is a game where you will constantly have to autosave and re-attempt sections multiple times before you get it right but that's what makes it so great, you can't go all in guns blazing because you will die in 10 seconds completely unlike conviction and blacklist. Yes the graphics are pretty terrible especially the cutscenes given the game was made in 2002 but the shadow system is better in this one than pandora tommorow and it has got a pretty good storyline with memorable level layouts, more so than even chaos theory which many would agree is the best one out of them all.

												May have been a sucess back in 2002, but this is just frustrating. This game is less about stealth than dealing with situations in linear sucession. You arrive in a new room, with a new guard and a new scenario, what do you do? Forget about routes, surveying the area, different playthroughs. If you're looking for a sort of modern day Thief, forget it. Also, it's palpable that the game was designed for a console port. The controls are weird, menus are garbage (and have aged like s**t).I recommend this game for fans of the series or if you're really dry for Stealth games(or stealth themed).I've just given up on the CIA level. Bodies left behind levels ago are being found, and I've reached the alarm limit, so I'd have to replay the level from scratch. Like hell I will. Come to think of it, alarm limit fails the mission? Why? Put more enemies around, tough them up, but don't make me replay your freakin' uninteresting level!Let's try Pandora Tomorrow.			"

												Is it some kind of rule that stealth games never get it right on the first try? Hitman and Splinter Cell are both venerable classics of the genre and their first entries both frustrate me to no end. While I eventually concluded that I just don't like the Assassin's Creed franchise at all, most people will agree it didn't really hit its stride until Ezio showed up. And as much as I want to love Thief: The Dark Project as much as I love The Metal Age, its controls needed some polish and the level design was frankly way below its sequel's quality.In Splinter Cell's case, it was a few mild but persistent irritations that eventually killed any interest I had in playing through it just for completeness' sake. The controls are clunky and simple tasks like disengaging from a ladder are somehow more complicated than Tomb Raider's tank controls. The levels are totally linear and feel less like locations and more like obstacle courses, and it can be almost impossible to differentiate between a scripted incident and a tactical failure at first glance. And Sam Fisher is the worst marksman I have ever seen in a videogame, taking a dozen shots to hit targets most people could make with a sufficiently vigorous loogie.I'm going to hold out hope that Chaos Theory is a substantial improvement, as the common sentiment seems to rank it among the best stealth games of all time, but this first try I'm done with.

												Old school stealth game through and through. Think more along the lines of Thief rather than Hitman or Dishonored. It's got lovely lighting and shadow effects and the models and environments look nice considering it's age. I'm a sucker for stealth game which don't hold your hand.I found this game overly frustrating and medicore. It's frustrating because its shadow system, which reminded me heavily of the early Thief games at first, doesn't work half the time. You think you are sitting in darkness but the bar to the bottom right thinks otherwise, and everyone nearby opens fire on you. You fire back, and then realise too late that any deaths or more than one alert fails the mission. Your handler makes damn sure you know about it too. So insta-fail missions are in there too. Considering this was Ubisoft, why am I not surprised; they still employ it today in Assassins Creed. The game's worst sins are the terrible controls for jumping (a mixture of movement keys and left-shift) and the level design. Trying to grab onto a ledge from above is trial and error gameplay at its worst. Double jumping correctly requires you to face the higher ledge you want to reach so the guy can pull himself up onto it. I found myself quicksaving not just when I was in a tight spot surrounding patrolling guards, but everytime I needed to make a jump or grab a ledge below. Jumping from a pipe to a balcony for instance, is just as bad, if not worse. It really does feel like the game is punishing you for trying to move forwards.Moving forwards is ALL you do in this game. I thought older games had massive levels that you could easily get lost in? Not this one. Every level is a corridor or a courtyard. No grand palaces/agency complexes with multiple covert entrances or opportunities to enter. Nope, always one, every time. And there are plenty of scripted moments too. Really, it feels far more like Call of Duty: Stealth Edition than any other stealth game I know. The story? Bleugh. It's about as bland as they get. The Russians, the Chinese and some nuclear weapons. Nothing interesting comes out of those things unless you add James Bond. And Splinter Cell guy certainly doesn't feel like a James Bond game, especially when you mistakenly double jump to your demise in the last mission because the movement is so damn arbritary. All in all, I'd say it's not worth playing. There are better stealth games out there than Splinter Cell, much less frustrating yet no less challenging or rewarding. Try Styx: Master of Shadows, or Dishonored on V.Hard using no powers and with the HUD off. Linearity is better suited for fast paced action gaming like shooters or puzzle-based platformers, not patient and meticulous stealth gameplay. In the Splinter Cell series alone, there are also better games - Chaos Theory I've heard is everyone's favourite entry and one of its strengths is the variety of ways in approaching missions and carrying out objectives.5/10			"

												The game doesnt render very well on my Nvidia 680, which means on certain levels I can be standing in pitch darkness but the light meter says its bright as day. The worst offender is there are two specific sections towards the end of the game where a moving spotlight has to be avoided and it's impossible to see. It is possible to get around the spotlight by killing the guards, but its just a real hassle to line up the shots properly to do so.As for the rest of the game I think it starts out ok but the Guard AI gets progressively more psychic and psychotic. The final level will test your patience and sanity, esp if you decide to not quicksave.			"

												The controls for this game are incredibly clunky, which makes what would be simply tasks quite frustrating when Sam Fisher refuses to climb a pipe or move along because you aren't facing in exactly the right direction.Dying or failing a mission becomes irritating with the unnecessarily long 'Mission Failed' screen which, along with the instructions in your headset, are the only parts of the game you can't skip, and have to watch/listen to all over again. Dying and then redoing one part of the game very quickly because you now know what to do results in then having to wait for half a minute while the instructions cycle through one after the other until they finally reach the part that you've arrived at.I suppose this was a good game in 2004, but as it is, it's just too annoying for me to enjoy.

												In short, 2/10 Bad tutorial, total lack of directing the player and just plane not fun.If this game used to be as good as people claim it to be, it did not hold it's charm well. One of my biggest issues was the tutorial, it was long and repeditive and done a terrible job. It makes it seem as though you can't make a sound around enemies without them noticing you, but, in reality they are very lax. The tutorial dosn't use your night-vision goggles at all causing me to forget about them all together and just think the game's brightness was terrible creating a horrid experiance.  Many times there is no way to get around enemies/civillians without being noticed or killing them, unless you knew about the other take downs or rolls that the tutorial neglected to even mention their existance (I never did figure out how to use any of these things since most tutorials online are for console versions). Even if I pretend the tutorial didn't screw the game for me, it's still not a good game, it has a terrible sense of direction, where you have to go is hidden in behind bushes in areas you wouldn't even go near, the map they give you in the pause menu only has numbers, no lables and they expect you to know which number you are at and which one you are going to go to even after only telling you the place's names and there are commonly multipe directions you can go (not all go to the same spot) and often the wrong way will have doors with keypads or gaurds making you think it's the right direction. I could spend the rest of my life griping about the first level alone, so I'll finish with saying: Even going past all this, I didn't like it. The game was just walk 10 feet shoot out a light knock out the gaurd hide and hide the body (move it away from other gaurds trails) then rinse and repeate. But if you were lucky, sometimes you wouldn't have to kill the gaurd, just follow his trail and hide when he turns around then move on. No strategy No fun just follow a confusing and knock out the guards you see along the way.			"

												Edit 2: Removed previous introduction (which is now unnecessary) and changed format to match my other reviews. Fixed some spelling/grammar errors.Review:I wonder how people can review this game calling it ""classic"" or ""unforgettable"". They're not wrong, but I think its an ""unforgettable"", ""classic"" blunder of a game. I'll start with the pros, at least.Pros:+ The gadgets at your disposal are nice, although I never used the cameras and rarely use the fiber optic.+ Animations are fairly top-notch for the time it was made in+ The thermal-camera being used to see fingerprints was a fantastic idea+ Interesting ""movement intervals"" mechanic to adjust speed.+ The levels aren't always detailed but they are varied enough to not be uninteresting.Cons:- Terrible stealth detection. There were more than a few times when being in complete darkness did nothing to hide me from enemies. There were a few unavoidable patrols that kept somehow spotting me in complete shadow.- The lighting has no rhyme nor reason on your light bar. Sometimes a dim light nearby would barely register, but sitting in shadow would shoot it up by 2 or 3 light bars. Sneaking through some areas is basically trial-and-error.- Terrible shooting mechanics. I know this game isn't a shooter, but it tries too hard at times to be one. There are some unavoidable ""horde mode"" attacks throughout the game. The ""aim decay"" is so ridiculously high that firing accurately at enemies is impossible. I've been sniped by enemies with AK's across long corridors that I can barely hit with one semi-auto shot. There are also times where peeking out to shoot an enemy is impossible since they shoot you dead before you even see their hitbox.- The climbing system is broken. Getting off of a ladder/pipe/verticle climbable is impossible. If I'm missing something, tell me, because it's infuriating. The walljumping is nice at times but incredibly finnicky. The split jump is hardly useful. The last level is the worst when it comes to this. The beginning area requires absolutely perfect jumps to get up the cliff, and I had to reload more than 20 times to get it done.- Player speed is either too slow or too fast. If an enemy is patrolling, you're either too slow to catch up to them and knock them out, or too fast and they hear you.- The alarm system sometimes screwed me over. Even after taking down every single guard and hiding bodies in places it would be impossible to find them, I'd still get ""body alerts"" every so often. How?!? There's nobody to find the bodies!- The story is completely forgettable. Oh look, another angry guy who is close-enough-to-the-middle-east-or-russia-to-be-evil-but-not-so-much-that-its-another-cliche-middle-eastern-or-russian-guy. Oh look, characters that have no arc, people dying I don't care about... The main character is only barely passable as one. Each level was just trip after trip to different places hunting down cheap russian/chinese bullet fodder and pressing buttons.- I had to use walkthroughs far too much. The few times you do get a map, it's just a useless picture of rectangles connected to each other. No minimap. No directional pointer. Yes, I know, this is supposed to be a hardcore game, but I got lost way too many times. The map design is really terrible.- On the flip side, the game as a whole is ridiculously linear. The only reason one could feasibly do a replay is to do something like a ""ghost"" playthrough or a ""no alerts"" playthrough (although good luck with that...). There are no multiple paths. No several points of entry. Nothing. It's literally just glorified corridors and rooms with one door in and one door out that you have to go through.Basically, if I wanted to play a stealth game, I would play the Thief franchise, or Dishonored. Hell, the new Thief 4 game is better than this. At least Thief 4 didn't make me want to break my keyboard. Thief: Gold and Thief 2 are older than this game yet hold up far better in pretty much every sense (minus graphics, although Thief graphics patches can actually give this game a run for its money, funnily enough). Dishonored might be too action-oriented for your tastes, but its far better and far easier to play a nice, challenging ""ghost"" playthrough rather than a ghost playthrough involving antidepressants and a bottle of hard liquor to soothe the pain Losing a ghost run in the previously mentioned games were because you messed up. In this game, its sometimes the opposite.So no, I can't recommend this game. It's broken in too many ways, and can't hold up through the ages. And no, the ""dont hate because age"" argument doesn't work. Thief: Deadly Shadows came out essentially around the same time, and it is less broken, less linear, and less rage-inducing. The controls are clunky, sure, but at least they don't cause me to die in stupid ways. If you wanted to play a stealthy modern game though, there's always Rainbow 6. The old ones are more hardcore than eating a brick, but at least if you fail them, it's your own fault rather than the game's. The newer Vegas games are a little too action-y and not enough stealth but could be up your alley.tl;dr Please don't. Some old games just don't hold up through the ages. If you do still like it okay. It's your cup of tea and you can handle it. I on the other hand, couldn't. And I don't think some others might either. There's other 10 dollar stealth games out there. Better ones.			"

												I will start by saying I never played these games on the original Xbox as I never owned one, but I love stealth games and will often take the stealthy approach in non-stealth games like Skyrim. With that being said, I HATE this game on PC. It's not the hardcore stealth aspects (I love that and did just fine), but the controls are EXTREMELY unintuitive and clunky. I changed them around a bit, but I can't do anything about some things. For example, you basically have to get close enough to smell a guard's♥♥♥♥♥just to get the option to grab him. By the time the notice pops up, the guard turns around and you're caught. Jumping is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ too.I ran into a few glitches as well that required me to restart the entire mission like the oil refinery level. A door that was previously locked until near the end when the guy you're after goes through and leaves it open for you was still shut when I got there. I got to maybe halfway through the CIA level on my way to get my gun and I could not get past a maintenance worker in an inventory room. I was in complete darkness and he'd see me everytime from several feet away, but there was no other way through. I said Eff it and deleted the game. That being said, I like a lot of things they did with the game. The stealth aspects are quite detail-oriented for its age. Guards react to the sound of your footsteps based on how fast you move, they will turn the lights back on in a room if you turned them off, and they do a decent job investigating any disturbances.I played Blacklist before this one and I loved it. The controls were far more intuitive (except for when you're trying to get away from a grenade) and you can play it however you want. But I don't have time to play a 12 year old game with controls this bad.			"

												Okay.   Pros: One of the first stealth games that relied on hiding in shadows (INSTEAD OF HIDING IN A BOX), the story is written as it should be: A Tom Clancy novel, Micheal Ironside's voice fits Sam 100%, and graphics are still ""up-to-par""    Cons: Some compatibility issues with current gen PCs, the Chinese Embassy level, not replayable missions, and the detection AI can be REALLY unforgiving at times (Oh well, you deal with it.)Overall, this game is great. It was the start of one of Ubisofts (Former) flagship IPs, revolutionary name in the stealth game genre, broke up what I like to call  ""Arnie Syndrome"", as well as one of the first accounts (That I know of) where a major actor from Hollywood came in to voice a video game character.    Buy it, either on sale or full price. That is if you are willing to learn how to play the game, it might take a couple tries of the first level to start playing as intended.			"

												Before I even started playing this I was playing the most recent entry to the franchise: Blacklist. This game offered challenge and strategy at times, also great mechanics that I didn't know were present in the games of last decade. While the SC games nowadays are about action and stealth, this game offered thrill and stealth which I find a lot more appealing. I can't be sure if a game this good and old would appeal to everyone but if you are after a satisfying political thriller game then I would recommend this. I bought this in a 4 game pack which includes Chaos Theory. Can't wait to see what that game offers!			"

												Revisited the original Splinter Cell as I only started playing from SC 2. It was amazing. No question that the graphics and game are a little dated but it had everything that you love about the Splinter Cell series. A great game to revisit and I thoroughly enjoyed my playthrough. Nice to see the elements that were taken and developed by the later games. Splinter Cell 3 Chaos Theory is definately the series highlight for me. Sadly the last 2 (maybe 3) games have been well below parr for the franchise. If you fancy reliving / getting into Splinter Cell for the first time, this is where to start. Sadly, this is a better game than the Splinter Cell Blacklist. Shame.			"

												There's always been a certain charm about the original Splinter Cell that seems to makes it more fun to revisit than the many sequels that would follow. From Lambert's funny reactions to botching objectives to the impeccably moody atmosphere, Splinter Cell is still a very fun and immersive game all these years later. The stealth mechanics are rather simple and have obviously been refined as the series has went on, but they're still effective and satisfying. This is a highly recommended classic in the stealth genre.			"

												The first game in the ""Splinter Cell"" series is an amazing game. Gameplay keeps you on your toes and is always fun. Whilst movement is a little tricky, the game is what I personally consider flawless, for a game of it's time (2002). The only thing I want to warn potential buyers is that the game is not for the light-hearted, it requires constant thinking and outwitting. I myself have needed to look up a walkthrough to be able to get further in the game.			"

												Played this game a lot on the original Xbox, so I bought it on Steam to relive the great memories. Great game, but an issue I have is that the lighting is considerably worse on PC than the console version, and there doesn't seem to be an easy fix for this. Areas supposed to be brightly lit just aren't occasionally, and sometimes, I can still very obviously see Fisher even though he is in a supposed ""dark"" area. This isn't too bad since you're always going to be looking at the light bar at the right to judge if you are visible or not, but when it comes to searchlights, there is almost no way to see where it is shining at, making these sections with searchlights very difficult. Another small issue is that Sam Fisher can't aim to save his life. Even though I am clearly on target, he almost always misses. Other than these points, this game is great, with memorable levels and awesome gameplay.			"

The first three Splinter Cell games (this, Pandora Tomorrow, and Chaos Theory) are, in my opinion, the best in the series (Chaos Theory being #1). Great voice acting (Michael Ironside!!!!!) and excellent stealth gameplay make this title fun. However, I found the story to be ""good enough."" The missions may seem repetitive at times. If you only want one SC title, get Chaos Theory. This game is better played for nostalgia.			"

												It you like stealth games, then you really need to look into getting this game. Tom Clancy Splinter Cell offers a really unique gaming experience, where you can really get immersed into the game.  Unlike most stealth games, where you make use of the environment they give you, to a degree, you can make your own environment. You're given a meter, that tells how well hidden you are. If you're under one you shouldn't be spotted. Normally your meter depends on the lighting. If you're in a building, you can just shoot out the lighs, assuming they're not being pretected. The ai isn't too bad. You can abuse the meter, and make the ai look atrocious, however, jumping, running, or walking in front of them will get they're attention, and unlike other games, ahem (Metal Gear Solid) They stay on the alert once they see you Even though it's pretty funny if you shoot a light out, they say it must be a shadow, which is what they say if they see you, but don't identify you as a person.

												Being Sam Fisher's debut, this is truly a nostalgic game and introduced me to the stealth genre.I know how I reacted when I first saw the game, back when it was released. To me it looked like the most photorealistic game back then. Never again was I so much in awe of a game's graphics like with this title. Of cource now it doesn't hold up with current games. In fact, with my current rig I had some graphical issues. Every lighting source was correctly displayed with the exception of searchlights, which is rather disturbing, considering how important light is in the game.If you want to play Splinter Cell for the nostalgic factor, I still can recommend it.If you are new to the series and want pure stealth at its best, I would recommend Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory though.

												The fact that Splinter Cell is still worth revisting at all is 100% a testament to the gameplay. The graphics look incredibly dated at this point, despite doing a good job at making a little go a long way. But that's bearable - the dialouge and voice acting is awful to the point of camp (MY GOD, FISCHER, HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?) and the storyline and characters are instantly forgettable... something something suitcase bomb?Spinter Cell's stealth mechanics hold up pretty well and it's interesting to go back and take a glimpse into the gameplay formula that would set the stage for Assassin's Creed five years later. And for the $2.50 paid, I definitely got my money's worth.NOTE: This PC port is bare bones, with no options to spiff up the video settings for modern machines. To get a decent resolution, you'll have to go out of your way and manually edit some .ini files. It also seems to have issues with saving custom control settings between game sessions.			"

												A true classic, this along with Chaos Theory are the best of the series, whilst it shows its age, it has matured well enough to be immensely enjoyable. The missions are varied with a surprising range of objectives within a wide range of settings, the toys are fun to use and the CIA mission in particular gets full marks. My only real gripe is the body counter, which randomly sets off alarms throughout the mission if you have not hidden bodies correctly, this forced me to replay a mission from the start as I was not aware of it at the time, but this is more personal preference.Regardless I give the game a solid 9/10 for brilliant gameplay, voice acting and an enjoyable experience throughout.

												The first of the Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell series is, without a doubt, the definition of stealth that we had been looking for in video gaming for a long time. A bit rough around the edges and with a dubious production, this game beat all odds to launch one of gaming's most recognized stealth franchises to date. That being said, this game has not aged as well as Pandora Tomorrow or even arguably the greatest in the series, Chaos Theory.The graphics for this game are still top notch for what was considered to be top of the line at the time of its release. It wasn't pushing the Xbox completely but came close. The areas are well defined, the shadows are masterfully used to set the scene and going without the night vision goggles on constantly guarantees some rather astounding sights, especially the oil rig and china levels. However, the game is quite dark and players learn to rely on their night vision goggles early, cancelling some of the amazement of the scenery as everything is viewed in dark-greenish/gray. Today, the graphics have not aged well. The models look very dated, as does the scenery in general compared to later games in the series.Sound/music wise, this game still holds some edge. The opening song still puts people in the mood for some good stealth action, while the environmental noise/music in most of the stages helps set the tone for stealth. The detection music as well as the combat themes get the blood and adrenaline pumping as you find a way to escape conflict or end it through epic gunfighting. The other sounds from interacting with objects are down perfectly as well, which makes me wonder how Sam Fisher still hasn't been heard by the guards...Which brings me to the actual AI. Admittedly, there are far better guards than these, or far worse guards. Either they have eagle vision if you're even slightly out of the light and will see any form of movement, or they will be so oblivious that even when you're right next to them in the darkness, they won't see you due to the way the game is designed around using shadows to hide rather than just cover. Being in total darkness means that as long as you don't bump into them, aren't directly in front of them, or don't make noise, they will never see you (which is somewhat, but not entirely, realistic). In combat, they are terrifyingly accurate if they can see you. If they can't, they will almost always miss, opening them up to a headshot to take them out. They also have a bad tendency to rush to a body left in the open for them to see, leaving them open to an untimely demise as well.As for the actual physics of the game, they also tend to be quite rusty. The movement feels somewhat stitled, and particularly on the PC version, there are times where collision detection is extrmeely buggy, often making the player stick to the terrain or not be able to make several jumps. Lighting and vision is off as well in the PC version, allowing enemies to either see you or not see you depending on the circumstances. The lighting is also off on the PC version, due to the projection lights not showing, meaning spotlights are impossible to see. This can ruin gaming experiences, unfortunately, as one level in the game is very much impossible without being able to see where the spotlight is. (no spoilers here).Combat in this game is also oddly done and generally, you are encouraged to avoid it. When you have to engage in it, aiming mechanics are simple but Fisher has a hard time hitting anything with just the normal crosshairs when it is too far away, making getting up closer and person with the enemy a necessity for consistent hits. With the SC-2000, however, that vanishes entirely. The alternate fire has endlessly useful tools at your disposal, and it has a scope, meaning that sniping comes into play during combat, which greatly changes the dynamic. Just be sure to to get used to holding your breath with the alt fire in scope mode if you don't want it to be waving all over the place. The controls in this game are also where the PC port falls apart. On the console, they work fine. On the PC, they generally work okay as well, but they get around the issue of changing your walking speed by mapping it to the mouse wheel on the PC's mouse. You can generally map this to something else, though a good chunk of the other buttons are taken for something else. Jumping is not done with space-bar by default, but rather is the shift key, which is a pain to get used to for people who are used to PC platforming. The menu is on the ""Ctrl"" key which is fine, but also hard to get used to for people who might be used to the tab function being the key generally used for inventory mapping. On the console, everything felt streamlined and perfected. In this, the controls are flimsy and hard to get used to for those not adept to keyboard+mouse controls.The last urksome thing that this game chose to do, that has been an on/off staple for the Splinter Cell series, is forced combat scenarios. There are scenes later in the game that you are automatically put into high alert and have to fight off people who are trying to kill you. The game's already clunky combat controls are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to work with already and being required to use them, when the rest of the game encourages pure stealth and remaining invisible and anonymous to bypass obstacles, was a terrible game design choice, one that was fortunately minimalized or foregone in later installments. That being said, this is still a game that should not be missed. The lighting problem that I was talking about earlier can be solved by going through the ini file and changing the coding. It works beautifully. Courtesy to the forums at UbiSoft here: http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/345379-No-Shadows-in-Splinter-Cell-1-ForumsThe keyboard and mouse controls are clunky but with enough time, offer an arguably high amount of playability, particularly with the aiming mechanics using the mouse rather than a control stick. And with enough knowledge of the physics, several bugs can be avoided. And if all else fails, console commands are your friend with the PC version, as is quick saving (a function that was added in the HD version, but not available in the original console version). If you're comfortable handling some more clunkiness in order to play an old classic, then definitely try this game. It may not hold up to the standards of its successors but it was the game that launched this phenomenal series and turned it into the gaming giant it was today. Oh, and the story is worth seeing through as well. Please, give this game a try. Give it some love, as it still definitely deserves it.			"

												Splinter Cell was released in 2002, and 12 years later still holds up! The gameplay is excellent due to the great stealth mechanics and vast replayablity. Also, the sound is superb. From the ambience to the gun fire, the voice acting, sound effects and music are all great, with an impressive perfomance from Michael Ironside. All this makes this game an easy recommendation.			"

												The game that started the entire series. If you enjoy stealth, then this is the right game for you! Starring Sam Fisher voiced by the famous Micheal Ironside.  Warning ahead of time; the controls and movement is a little clunky. In tight situations, the controls will fail to help you at most times...time your movements correctly.  The story is amazing, characters are easily enjoyable, even though some of the script is a little cheesy, but still hilarious at most times.  The equipment that you recieve is easy to use. The further that you go through the missions, the more gadgets you get, which is a plus.  The missions get harder, as you progress. Changing the from lethal to non-lethal, alarms to no alarms.  The security expands and the cameras are harder to avoid.  The game really tests your patience and strategy.There are some glitches that can help you in a few missions, when its really not going your way...which reminds me, save frequently.  You're going to run into difficult situations, and saving is your backup.  A good idea if you don't want to get spotted is to shoot out lights, hide bodies in dark areas, and throw objects for distractions.  Stick to the shadows (obviously), thick darkness is your best bet.  Save your ammunition, don't rely too much on your gadgets. Overall, this game is amazing.  Patience is the key...if you don't have then go watch CenterStrain's videos on youtube for a wonderful stealth-through			"

												The fact that Splinter Cell is still worth revisting at all is 100% a testament to the gameplay. The graphics look incredibly dated at this point, despite doing a good job at making a little go a long way. But that's bearable - the dialouge and voice acting is awful to the point of camp (MY GOD, FISCHER, HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?) and the storyline and characters are instantly forgettable... something something suitcase bomb?Spinter Cell's stealth mechanics hold up pretty well and it's interesting to go back and take a glimpse into the gameplay formula that would set the stage for Assassin's Creed five years later. And for the $2.50 paid, I definitely got my money's worth.NOTE: This PC port is bare bones, with no options to spiff up the video settings for modern machines. To get a decent resolution, you'll have to go out of your way and manually edit some .ini files. It also seems to have issues with saving custom control settings between game sessions.			"

												Okay.   Pros: One of the first stealth games that relied on hiding in shadows (INSTEAD OF HIDING IN A BOX), the story is written as it should be: A Tom Clancy novel, Micheal Ironside's voice fits Sam 100%, and graphics are still ""up-to-par""    Cons: Some compatibility issues with current gen PCs, the Chinese Embassy level, not replayable missions, and the detection AI can be REALLY unforgiving at times (Oh well, you deal with it.)Overall, this game is great. It was the start of one of Ubisofts (Former) flagship IPs, revolutionary name in the stealth game genre, broke up what I like to call  ""Arnie Syndrome"", as well as one of the first accounts (That I know of) where a major actor from Hollywood came in to voice a video game character.    Buy it, either on sale or full price. That is if you are willing to learn how to play the game, it might take a couple tries of the first level to start playing as intended.			"

												Before I even started playing this I was playing the most recent entry to the franchise: Blacklist. This game offered challenge and strategy at times, also great mechanics that I didn't know were present in the games of last decade. While the SC games nowadays are about action and stealth, this game offered thrill and stealth which I find a lot more appealing. I can't be sure if a game this good and old would appeal to everyone but if you are after a satisfying political thriller game then I would recommend this. I bought this in a 4 game pack which includes Chaos Theory. Can't wait to see what that game offers!			"

												It you like stealth games, then you really need to look into getting this game. Tom Clancy Splinter Cell offers a really unique gaming experience, where you can really get immersed into the game.  Unlike most stealth games, where you make use of the environment they give you, to a degree, you can make your own environment. You're given a meter, that tells how well hidden you are. If you're under one you shouldn't be spotted. Normally your meter depends on the lighting. If you're in a building, you can just shoot out the lighs, assuming they're not being pretected. The ai isn't too bad. You can abuse the meter, and make the ai look atrocious, however, jumping, running, or walking in front of them will get they're attention, and unlike other games, ahem (Metal Gear Solid) They stay on the alert once they see you Even though it's pretty funny if you shoot a light out, they say it must be a shadow, which is what they say if they see you, but don't identify you as a person.

As a side note, the writers did put a lot of humor into this game, but it does not make the story any less serious.-This game provides you with many different ways to play. Don't like killing? You don't have to. Want to go guns blazing? You probably shouldn't, but you can. (Keeping an eye on your alarm level, of course)			"

												I am a fan of the entire series and being new to Steam, when this went on sale I absolutely had to pick them all up so I could relive the story and experience.  The only complaint I have about the Steam version versus the PS2 or Xbox versions is that the lighting seems to glitch. I'll be in perfect dark, an enemy will pop around the corner, I don't move and suddenly in level 5 light and blasted. Aside from that, the versatility of the game remains. Hiding bodies, avoiding alarms, difficult pistol headshots, human shields, gadgets on gadgets, and vision changes all make this still a wonderful game, especially for its time.			"

												I really missed out on Splinter Cell. Played it for the first time and finished it without problems and while this is a 15 year old compute game, it ages really well. There is some guides on the Steam forums for editing the configuration files so you could use modern higher resolution monitors, worked really well for my gaming laptop. Still a really relevant game for new players. Recommend it.			"

												The first game in the ""Splinter Cell"" series is an amazing game. Gameplay keeps you on your toes and is always fun. Whilst movement is a little tricky, the game is what I personally consider flawless, for a game of it's time (2002). The only thing I want to warn potential buyers is that the game is not for the light-hearted, it requires constant thinking and outwitting. I myself have needed to look up a walkthrough to be able to get further in the game.			"

												Been playing for a while now and it's very disappointing to see some of the issues I'm seeing.  I know the game is old but I don't think that excuses it from being held to some basic standards.  For example, there are plenty of times when there are no lights in the room but the game's ""light detection system"" shows the area as being well lit.  Without night vision, it's pitch black, but the light indicator shows full visibility and enemies easily see you.  It's either shoddy design or a nasty bug, but it happens way too often to be excusable in a game that relies on stealth through darkness.  I've died too many times while shuffling through a dark alleyway to find out that every enemy sees me clear as day, and it becomes a game of watching the light indicator to ensure that there are no bugged out lights in your path.There's also sound issues.  You can be 20 feet from an enemy and he'll turn when you make a slight mistake.  Normally you are able to move comfortably at a much closer distance, but sometimes enemies have superhuman hearing that ruins your plans.  Another big issue is that when you move diagonally, you have to press 2 keys (W+A/D) and the game registers that as 2 movements, meaning anytime you move diagonally, you move twice as fast and make twice as much noise.  You can work around this by only using W and moving the mouse to turn, but sometimes you need to keep an eye on other enemies and it isn't practical to make the compromise.  Also, it might just be the design of the game, but your stealth walking speed is slower than an enemies normal walking speed, so if your behind an enemy who's walking away, you will not reach him to eliminate him.  You'd think an NSA Splinter Cell would know how to move quickly and quietly but he's slow as a snail.I would love to enjoy this game and I did for the most part.  I just can't bother myself to finish it when the core mechanic of the game (stealth) is so flawed by bugs.  The quicksave and quickload features got me through 9 hours of this game but I hate that I have to use those features because of the game's problems and not my own mistakes.  If they ever remake this game with a new engine, I'd buy it in a heartbeat but I can't play it as it is.  Stealth games should have working stealth mechanics and this game is just bad enough that I don't want to play anymore.			"

The only complaint I have about the Steam version versus the PS2 or Xbox versions is that the lighting seems to glitch. I'll be in perfect dark, an enemy will pop around the corner, I don't move and suddenly in level 5 light and blasted. Aside from that, the versatility of the game remains. Hiding bodies, avoiding alarms, difficult pistol headshots, human shields, gadgets on gadgets, and vision changes all make this still a wonderful game, especially for its time.			"

												Played this game a lot on the original Xbox, so I bought it on Steam to relive the great memories. Great game, but an issue I have is that the lighting is considerably worse on PC than the console version, and there doesn't seem to be an easy fix for this. Areas supposed to be brightly lit just aren't occasionally, and sometimes, I can still very obviously see Fisher even though he is in a supposed ""dark"" area. This isn't too bad since you're always going to be looking at the light bar at the right to judge if you are visible or not, but when it comes to searchlights, there is almost no way to see where it is shining at, making these sections with searchlights very difficult. Another small issue is that Sam Fisher can't aim to save his life. Even though I am clearly on target, he almost always misses. Other than these points, this game is great, with memorable levels and awesome gameplay.			"

												Best of the series if you ask me. This is a classic that will never be forgotten.If you can get past the bad graphics and rediculous movement AI engine, then your in for a treat. The story offers an amazing splinter cell experience, challenging, good fairness, also now and again you can pull away and have some random fun. Some maps require you to be Ultra Stealth because you cannot be seen AT ALL which makes it really fun, where as there are some maps that let you to choose, go all out and blast through it, or take your time and stealth the whole thing.The weapons are good, using sticky cameras and shock bullets to paralyze your enemys. NOTE HERE! Stick on Hard, it so much more fun and makes the game last that little bit longer. For £6,99 you will have LOTS of fun.       10/10!!			"

												I grew up playing the demo of this game on Exhibition for the classic XBOX. I was then given a GameCube copy of the game and spent hours playing it, though never finished it due to the disc getting scratched up by siblings. It makes me happy to see a digital release on Steam, though I find it hard to play with a keyboard and mouse, so I recommend using external programs to map key bindings to a controller, or purchasing a Steam controller for maximum enjoyment of this great game. I think the graphics are great, even to today's standards, and I find enjoyment when messing with debug commands to have NPCs look like they are attacking the police.Like a wise man once said in a cell, ""Who in the hell are you?""
