												""FORGIVE ME FATHER FOR I WILL SIN"" and lets carry on by saying that ""SHANK"" is one of the toughest S.O.B's i have ever seen in gaming,i mean come on to rip a guy clean in half with your shanks is just one hell of a feat of strength (NOT TO MENTION ONE EASY WAY TO GET COVERED IN YOUR ENEMIES INNARDS YUCK)Now i know this games been out for ages but i have never got round to finishing it until now and i must say it is one game that is no walk in the park,some of the ""BOSS"" fights border on the ""AAARRRGGGHHH GOD DO I HAVE TO TRY AND BEAT THIS (CENSORED FOR THE CHILDREN AND PREGNANT MOTHERS OUT THERE) AGAIN,FOR PETES SAKE (NO IDEA WHO PETE IS EITHER)"" but thats the whole point as you get to the ""BOSS"" and you win a little and you loose a little until you learn their attack pattern and how to deal with them.The graphics in game look like they have been animated by a top team and it all plays out like a saturday morning cartoon (YEAH-if you like them full of action and eviscerated enemies) and the sound and spoken dialogue in game are all of the highest quality and the gameplay just flows from one act to the next,with you hacking down enemies and then moving onto the next wave. My only gripe is,is that is all you actually do whilst playing the game-but trust me when i say you will be having to much fun to realise this and it will not enter your mind until you either stop for a break and think about it to much or finish the game and look back over what you have done and then say to yourself ""GOD I KILLED A LOT OF FOES IN THIS GAME,BUT WHAT ELSE"" (thats how it happened to me anyway).Now whilst i was playing the one thing that came to mind the most was a modern grind house classic (well it was a classic to me anyway) ""MACHETTE"",from the action to the sense of humour this game shares a lot in common with this bloody modern day ""B"" movie,now ""SHANK"" was released in 2010 and ""MACHETTE"" was released in 2010 also so which takes influence from which you decide,but i will tell you this watch one and then play the other (or vice versa) and you to will see what i am talking about.Now this game was a commercial success, selling tens of thousands of copies and remaining in the top 20 Xbox Live Arcade games during September 2010. It was followed by a sequel, Shank 2, released in 2012 for the same gaming platforms as the first game and to be honest you can see why they did the sequel (profit yes i know thats what your thinking-and YES that may be the main reason OK) as the orriginal is just such fun and a total blast to play through (i still need to get to the CO-OP though and play through thet yet).Will you play this if you havent allready,well if you like an action game that kicks ♥♥♥ and takes no prisoners at all then yes and if not then why not as its one of the best side scrolling beat,chop,kick,main,muttilate,eviscerate and blow the crap out of games that this reveiwer has ever played.

												Shank is a cheesy 2D platformer & beat'em up game that plays in Mexico. It has it's own graphic style. There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. I even experienced some lags with over 300 FPS.The big plus is the strange atmosphere. The background music supports it much and feels like a neverending Quentin Tarantino soundtrack. The big minus are the controls and fights. Enemies are able to block gunshots and can dogde around you in the background. Mostly the gameplay is like in Double Dragon. (you can also finish a just local co-op campaign). Enemies with ridiculous names appear from both sides and you have fight them down to proceed. You can pickup some powerups (grenades, health) or special weapons (grenade launcher, flamethrower) but it's just rarely.The hard mode is really very hard. Even if you manage to kill properly all enemies on the map. There remain these annoying jump sequences. Once you fall down you have to repeat the whole level (in hard mode there are no savepoints). Or you just get hit by a grenade on the slackline or accidently change sides on a climbing pole. Sometimes windows don't break if you try to jump through ...			"

												Shank on the trailers showing beautiful cartoon graphics combined with a high degree of brutality. The problem is that games which look professionally on the trailers do not always make the same impression when they fall into the hands - fortunately, not something that applies to this title. The best kind of bloodbath.			"

												The real magic of going through your gaming backlog is stumbling across those little gems you didn't know you had.Such was the case with Shank. I'm not sure when I purchased it, but there it was sitting in my library covered in e-dust. I watched the trailer, and it gave me a feint reminder of Mark of the Ninja. I was intrigued.So I sat down to play it, and a short weekend later I was done. I laid witness to great storytelling, a beautiful aesthetic, and gameplay that, while just a beat-em-up, was deep enough to leave me feeling completely satisfied. The one thing that stood above the rest would definitely be the music. It goes to great lengths to set a moody atmosphere that feels ripped right out of a Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez movie. In fact, if you've seen El Mariachi or Pulp Fiction you'll know roughly what you're getting in to.If you're bored and looking for something to do, puchase and play this game. You won't regret it.

												I am genuinely impressed with Shank - a great old school action brawler with a story straight out of the Kill Bill movies. The action is very clean and fluid. It offers some basic combo moves, fitting weapons, and a few other pleasant surprises. On the downside, it only takes about 2-3 hours to complete the game on normal difficulty. Although it is an enjoyable 2-3 hours of non-stop action.

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.When I first saw the trailer, I've already liked this game. I'm a very old school games fan, even with all the good games today, sometimes I still get myself playing the old classics especially beat'em up and platform games. Who doesn't remember jill of the jungle, Halloween harry, xargon, commander keen, and a lot more? This game is like their grandchild! Very fun and got that retro feeling on the arcade games, when you have to go beating everyone in the level without thinking too much.The boss fights are epic! Just like the old school games, boss fights were, with that thing with the tricks you'll discover to beat the boss easily. I think the only game in the 2000 era that reminds me of the old classics were duked Nukem manhattan project and trineOverall: Recommended to all the old school fans over there, This game will be a very funny experience for sure, you won't be disappointed!

												KNIFE to meet you! - AnnoymousTHE GOODShank controls nicely on the gamepad (Which is what the devs want you to play this on) and feel better than the PC controls, although Shank is a spam fest either way. Button-mashing is inevitable and gameplay is repetative as the same enemies will attack you in the same ways. I never said that it wasn't fun though, as Shank pulls it off with such style that I really cannot find the gameplay boring. Sure the enemies will take a long time to kill and you will take some damage in the process but it's fair and will drop you health and extra weapons for your troubles.THE GREATGraphically I cannot find fault with Shank's aesthetic. The character animations are smooth, the character models are functional, the backgrounds (Silhouettes) do thier job and the scenery looks pleasing at the very least. Shank seems to break up the fighting from time to time by adding in puzzle sections which flows nicely and gives players hands a rest from the constant button-mashing. Mechanics of Shank are fairly simple with not too much getting in the way of redecorating the walls with enemies intestines, and on the topic of intestines it feels like the devolpers wanted this to be more violent in parts. I expected some gruesome deaths from enemies once I got a high enough combo which makes you feel that this game is censored. We'll get to that later.THE UGLYIt's later. The story is absolutely terrible and it seems that the main character, appropriately named Shank is just out to kill the Big Bad because he doesn't lke him. I played the Steam version through to the second boss fight and then downloaded the Humble Bundle 4 version (Which I got a while ago) and noticed that the cutscenes had been changed to the point where the story makes no sense. I cannot understand why Steam would censor an M rated game, but I'm not complaining. The only other real issue is the fact that this game was made for the gamepad. It says so on the intro screen and shows it by having the default controls worse than my home country's rating system. These are two seemingly petty gripes but they really ruin the experince.THE VERDICTDo you see how I've recommended this game? I've recommended it on two conditions. These follow:1- You own a gamepad as the default and customizable controls are terrible2- You don't care about the story/you watch the cutscenes through YouTube to grasp the story/you'll played this game on console and know the storyThese are the only conditions I would recommend Shank and that's a real shame because I like Shank, I possibly even love Shank, but if I'm being honest then that's my recommendation to you.SIMILAR GAMES-Rocketbirds: Hardboiled Chicken for it's crazy, fun, spam fest attitude-Mark Of The Ninja for the unique and eye-catching styleFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview "

 “When you're pushed, killing is as easy as breathing.” Shank is an entertaining 2-D brawler game with a robust combat system and visuals that cross a cartoonish look with the grittiness of graphic novels. The variety of weapons will give you several ways to finish off your opponents, and the boss battles are well made and enjoyable. You should also take a look into the cooperative game, because it provides a decent background story for the singleplayer campaign.Overall the game offers solid gameplay, fluid controls and visceral combat.

												I´ll start by saying that I think that the best game ever has been Street Fighter 2 Arcade.I spent at arcades hundreds of dollars. I fought any challeger who took hold of the second stick, and won.Final Fight Arcade was also great, and Golden Axe 2 the Revenge of Death Adder sublime.Now Arcades are gone, died out about year 2000, killed by PSX, the greatest console ever.Maybe you are too young to care about this fact, but that was history.Shank and Shank 2 are for guys like me, who spent their money coin by coin fighting for prevalence.p.s. I finished the campaign in hard difficulty. Very tough "

												A nicely done sidescroller brawler with revenge story.Common problems, complaints with the game and their fixes:  the updated game removed some cutscenes because they retroactively changed their minds about what's beneficial to the game and what looks decent, removing the more bloody/aggressive parts for whatever reason (blood flows with every landed hit anyways...) ---> you can rightclick on the game in library, go to properties, then betas, and activate [shank classic]. You'll get achivements, everything works, and you'll get back the original cutscenes.  Also, if you play a game on a windows account that has non-english characters in it's name, the game won't be able to save. The fix is simple, create a new win login on the pc, it takes only 2-3 minutes.And then about the game: the game goes roughly one (or two) normal levels, then a bossfight, unlocking new weapons as the game goes on. I played with a controller and the controls are absolutely on the point, easy, well-flowing experience. The story is alright, the main charm of the game is the fighting, managing a group of enemies with different attack styles and patterns and the game does a good job at it.   Normal difficulty's campaign is roughly 3 hours long, the game has a local coop story campaign (different one), with the use of joytokey or similar programs you can bind P1 and P2's controls to the same buttons, so it's even playeable alone :)  The game is a nice brawler-like game, with the bosses being focused on dodging and counterattacking a lot - I think normal mode offers a pleasant challenge and nice story for everyone, as checkpoints are forgiving, always spawning again with 3 granades.extra about the hard difficulty: It's a slightly negative aspect how much of an overkill hard difficulty is - having no checkpoints on whole levels while doing considerably less damage, while punishing super-hard for buttonsmashing / not dodging in time. They ocassionally stunlock you, and dropped health is extremely inconsistant (Big Guys drop hp, sometimes after fighting two I got 0, 1 or two health potions) and one of the later levels features a constant rocket barrage that was a pain in the butt even on normal...  so if you'd like to try hard difficulty, it's *really* hard compared to the normal, a real challenge, maybe a little more than it would be necessary.

												I would love to love this game. It has a fantastic presentation with a Mexican desert flavor, great animation, big boss fights, a plethora of different looking enemies and it is a 2D beat em up published EA (but people think its indie). Its just not fun. In an era full of Metroidvanias beat em ups such as Guacamelee, you will find Shank is more of a basic left to right sidescroller with very few ups and downs. There are no secret areas or even breakable walls with meat in them. If the original Castlevania had secrets, why not Shank?The game has great controls, a quick melee button, strong melee button, a gun attack, a pounce button, grapple button, grenade button, block button and even a jump. It has everything that you'd ever want in a 2D beat em up. With all of that being said, it feels so monotonous. Your attacks feel very weak and each enemy takes an exorbitant amount of hits. The enemies are pretty smart, they'll block and roll through you to sandwich you between enemies. If they have enough distance, they'll pull a gun out and shoot. While there are a lot of different looking enemies, they all pretty much fall into a few categories. Standard foot soldiers, big brawlers, weapon users and dogs. The game is very forgiving on normal mode. There are no lives, you just respawn pretty close to where you died. It is a welcome decision to do so. Of course, there is a hard mode too.The problem with the game is that it gets dull really quick especially when you have the same attacks from start to finish. You gain no new abilities to keep things fresh. There are a few extra guns and strong melee weapons that you can use, but nothing feels like an upgrade, just a sidegrade. The bosses boil down to finding a weakness to exploit, pouncing on them and stabbing them.There are light traversals to break up combat for a mere two seconds, such as climbing a brief fall, briefly hanging from a pipe or jumping platform to platform, but it just needed more of a break from the monotony of combat. It is so odd that there can be so much diversity in combat, and yet you can still just button mash your way to victory. Also what does it say about Shank's combat when the next game the creators made after Shank 2 was a stealth game? Another issue with the game is the blah music.There is co-op to improve the experience, but having a friend around can improve any experience. I'm from an era of Nintendo and Super Nintendo beat em ups that have less combat options, but more enemy diversity. I just couldn't get into Shank.Finally, there will be plenty of sales if not game bundles with Shank 1 and 2. Just wait for the combo pack sales with $5 for both.			"

												Shank is one of those games that I've had in my library for months and never got around to playing until now. And now that I have played it, I'm sure glad I did. I haven't beaten the game yet, but I can tell it's going to be a real winner.The first thing I noticed about the game is the incredible art style. It's cartoonish, and some people might think that would detract from a gritty, blood-soaked beat-em-up, but it fits perfectly with this game. Shank's art style reminds me of Skullgirls or Guacamelee, just cartoony enough to make everything seem surreal, without feeling like a Mario game. The colorful landscapes and enemies that you encounter really make this game stand out.The soundtrack is spectacular, and really adds to the depth of the game. Shank really feels great, and a big part of that is the exceptional music. The sound effects are great as well, really reminding me of old beat-em-ups like X-Men or TMNT with all the grunts and yelling and slashing. Gameplay is a little complicated, because Shank is able to use several weapons and several different kinds of attacks. I've been playing this game with an XBox controller, and it feels very intuitive. The only thing I don't like is that at certain points of the game, it will prompt you to hit a particular button, but the prompt just shows a little cartoon of what the button does so it can be hard to remember which button to press. For example, to pick up items, you have to push down and lunge at the same time, and instead of showing ""RT"" for lunge, it's just a silhouette of Shank lunging. This is only mildly annoying though, because you will quickly learn what each button does and how to pick up items so it won't matter what the prompt looks like. So far, the story is very well written and I'm enjoying it quite a bit. One complaint that I have is that there is no option for subtitles, so make sure your volume is turned up. I usually like to listen to music in iTunes while I play games, so this was weird for me, but the game's music is so good that it doesn't really matter anyway, you'll want to listen to the game's music.Overall, Shank is a very enjoyable side scroller with some platforming elements and a great story. If you don't mind a bit of blood (or a lot of blood, flying everywhere!) then I would consider this a must-have for fans of the beat-em-up genre. Shank plays like an old-style fighting arcade game, but with better graphics and infinitely better controls. If you're not sure if it's something you'd like, then why not grab the free demo and check it out? The whole game is only $10 full price, and you can easily find it on sale or trade with someone. --------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												Shank is a straightforward game. You walk, you pounce, you hack and slash. The beauty of it is that it has a comic-like artstyle of you doing all those things, which pretty much looks like you are the protagonist of an animated movie. You also feel quite ""the man"" while performing different sets of combos. The dodge mechanic is not overused like in shank 2, which keeps the game away from being tedious. Its weaknesses would be that it is a tad short, theres a lack of online co-op (even though you have the option of local co-op) and the gameplay is a lot more awkward with the mouse and keyboard, so you'd need a controller for a better experience. All in all, shank is more than a decent action platformer that will give you a good dose of hack and slash fun. Also, cool costumes!			"

The game will redownload and that's it, you have the uncut original Shank.

												IMPORTANT NOTE: BEFORE YOU START PLAYING THE GAME, MAKE SURE TO RIGHT-CLICK ON THE GAME (WHEN INSTALLED), THE GO TO PROPERTIES, THEN BETAS, AND MAKE SURE THAT INSTEAD OF CHOOSING 'NONE', THAT YOU CHOOSE 'classic'. When done, the game should say; Shank [classic]. The classic version includes all the cutscenes, while NONE is missing most of the cutscenes, so make sure to opt into the classic version under Betas.Shank is an amazing, bloody 2D beat em up game that every indie fan should take a look into. Even though the story may seem a little cliche, it's still very enjoyable. The art and soundtrack of this game complement the story very nicely, but the soundtrack isn't something you'd listen to outside of the game. The gameplay is the best part of the game. Even though you only get a few weapons, it's nice to be able to switch them while in combat, so it can help when situations change very quickly. The AI isn't too bad either, they're not dumb, but they aren't hard to the point where it's impossible, at least on Normal difficulty. The boss fights are better than I expected. Some of the fights are really boring and way too easy, while some are challenging and exceptionally fun, especially the last fight. I actually played the last boss fight a few times over and over, so the game does have some replayable value to it. The only issue about the boss fights is that they aren't spread out evenly. What I mean by this is that sometimes you'll fight one boss after the other, and because most of them are pretty easy, it kinda throws you off a bit, and you can get bored sometimes. And then sometimes you'll have to complete another 5 levels to get to the next boss, so it does feel a bit weird to me personally.Otherwise, overall, this is an exceptional indie game. One that will take you a bit of time to complete on Normal, and then a couple of hours to finish on Hard. The gameplay is superb, the art and soundtrack is beautiful, and the story is a tad bit cliche, but it is still enjoyable. A must pick up for any fan of indie games! :)			"

												Did you find yourself watching Danny Trejo in that movie ""Bad ♥♥♥"" and think to yourself, ""This would make a great video game!""  If you did, you should be ashamed of yourself.  That movie was god awful and nobody deserves to play a game about that.  Did you find yourself thinking you'd want to play a game based on Mr. Trejo after you left ""Machete""?  Well, that's a bit more understandable.  Plus, that's a lot what Shank is like!""  When I say Shank is like ""Machete"", I mean it's violent and involves machetes.  The comparison's pretty direct.  In the movie, we get a few attempts at plot and drama sprinkled in a whole lot of action scenes.  Shank's laid out the same way!  You cruise through a Mexican villa occupied by your former crime lord boss and his goons, in search of revenge.   The game itself is pure beat-em-up in the mechanics department, which leads to straight forward game play that may run a little stale by the end of the game.  It's still competent enough to make for some fun in small bursts.  I picked up Shank on a Humble Bundle for a measley $1; this game is well worth that.  I'd even say it's worth paying a good $5 for.  You get an okay story and plenty of action, though you'll get frustrated a bit when they start to spam you with the harder bad guys.  In small groups these goons are tough but managable, but when they through too many at you,  they can break the flow of your combo's you've been pulling off for awhile.  Frustarting, but not game breaking.  Just be prepared to swear at your monitor a bit.			"

												When I started playing Shank I'd been already familiar with Klei Entertainment - their game, Mark of The Ninja, is one of my favourites and it is among those where I have 100% achievement completion. Of course, MoTN only came out 2 years later, therefore, I expected Shank would have its shortcomings.Now, Shank is a fast-paced, action-packed side-scroller that reminds us of the good-old beat 'em up games from the arcade era. We proceed from one screen to the other while getting rid of dozens of enemies and eventually coming to a boss battle. At our disposal we have melee weapons (chainsaw!) and some firearms. While nothing fancy, making combos with all of our available items is pretty cool in the heat of battle especially when enemies are pouring in from every which way!The game has cutscenes between the levels and a great accompanying soundtrack. While short (can be completed in a couple of hours), for hardcore gamers the hard mode is available offering an extra challenge by completely removing the checkpoints.There are 2 things that make Shank stand out. First, we immediately notice that the game has a comic book art style - this was later used to make MoTN happen and Shank also has a sequel with similar graphics style. Now, the 2nd and perhaps most interesting is the excessive gore / violence the game uses. I found it a bit too much at times - I admit this is the game's style but even the cutscenes have some pretty gory scenes for no apparent reason. I understand the game later on underwent an upgrade and as a result of that some of the more violent scenes were removed / edited including some nudity.Don't go looking for a story here as you do not really have one. This is Shank's tale of revenge against his previous employer but it really is just a basis for killing a whole bunch of enemies (they never really elaborate on the story). This is not necessarily a problem as you are here for the chainsaw! :)To summarise: Shank is a decent beat 'em up from Klei Entertainment which offers a couple of hours of entertainment if you do not really have any other game at your disposal. I look forward to completing its sequel! This is an easy pick-up - especially when discounted - just remember to use a controller! "

												Klei is far and away my favorite developer just for the majesty that is Invisible Inc, but they have a plenty impressive catalog outside of that. Shank goes way back to their early days as their second title, and while it carries their distinct style it definitely feels like a sophomore effort. I love a good beat-em-up and Shank is packed to the brim with blood and combos, but it makes a few of the common mistakes that games of the genre often do.Have you seen Desperado? Good, you know the plot to Shank. Dead lady, three henchmen, one big bad. Your headlining character comes armed with knives, pistols, grenades, and a chainsaw to work his way through streets and rooftops full of thugs. There's a bit of climbing and swinging between fights but the bulk of your time is going to be spent comboing mooks to death and chugging 40s to get your health back.Keeping enemies corralled while you hack them to bits is key here, because Shank is a full 2D beat-em-up with no Z-axis movement. Your foes are a diverse bunch, with spry stick fighters, machete-wielding psychos, gun-totting troopers, lumbering brawlers straight out of Fist of the North Star, and more. The further you get in the more the groups are mixed, causing plenty of chaos and headaches when you have to manage melee, ranged, and explosive threats.Early on the slick combo system provides an easy hook for the game. Everything you do combos beautifully, no matter how you mash your light, heavy, and gun attacks. If you can turn that button-mashing into strategy you should be able to hang with the game pretty well, but by the time you get on the third minion's trail the challenge starts to get a little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty. There's more than one sequence with random explosives raining down on you, and a major late-game street brawl has four waves of foes capped with a minigunner who can easily stunlock you to death.You have plenty of tools besides just your three attacks, including two kinds of grapples and some very useful grenades. While mixing things up can help you get out of unfavorable brawls, it won't help you much against the bosses. Each big bad has a gimmick that must be exploited to beat them, unless you want to whittle their health down a sliver at a time. It's not always obvious what you should do but dying once will pop up a tip straight-up explaining the gimmick, which is a heavy-handed but effective way to address the difficulty.There's a lot of combat in this game over the two to three hours it'll take to beat, so minor aggravations can easily weigh Shank down. Even with all the enemy types it gets repetitive after awhile, playing out across sprawling, linear levels with no secrets or items to find. If you're just here to kill people, though, you'll get plenty of that in lavish comic book style. The game's cutscenes are a highlight, rendered like everything else in Klei's signature look, though the voice acting lacks the impact to really sell the scenes. Overall Shank is a bloody good time that drags in a few places but gives you more than enough action to make up for it.			"

												A fun, well-crafted beat-em-up with great visuals and a simple but effective story. If you enjoy Metal Slug or Guns, Gore, and Cannoli, or the like, or if you're just a fan of grindhouse, revenge flicks, or Tarantino, I'd say absolutely pick this up.  There is one thing to note, however;The Steam version of this game has been heavily edited, causing a number of plot holes and eliminating entire aspects of the story. However, it is fixed easily enough by going into the ""Betas"" Tab and opting for the original, uncut version of the game.			"

												Shank is a game that tries to lure you in with it's looks and makes no excuses about it. The art style in this game is damn near gorgeous and easily makes you forget that the actual graphics are not that great. Everything is clearly defined with sharp edges in this beautiful comic book style visual.The gameplay is another matter entirely though. The first thing the game tells you is that it's best played with a controller, not a keyboard. An instant black mark on any PC game's record, port or not. Despite this it does play fairly easily with a keyboard setup, it might not as smooth as with a controller, but it'll do. The gameplay is a fairly basic side-scrolling brawler and not even a terribly complex one at that, most of the boss fights are almost reminiscent of quicktime events and fights against regular goons quickly turn into simple endurance tests with you hacking away waiting for the henchman supply to run out.A very pretty game but not a very fun one. Thankfully it's short.			"

												Think about a game based on the movie ""Machete"". With Ennio Morricone music. Directed by Quentin Tarantino. Adds a lot of blood and violence. Bring the combo system of Devil May Cry/God of War. That's what playing Shank feels like. And I like it!There are 20 levels, ranging from 4 minutes (boss stages) to 15 minutes long. You can choose between 4 melee weapons (plus your main weapon) and 3 range weapons, although you'll soon discover some weapons are useless compared to others (I never used the Chains a single time). 3 different attacks: one fast but weak, one ranged attack and one strong but slow attack. You can also throw a limited ammount of grenades.The monochrome backgrounds match nicely with the atmosphere of the game, it's good to distinguish between different areas and it helps not to lose your focus from the enemies, but they make the stages feel empty sometimes. There are 11 cosmetic costumes to unlock. The game also has its own coop campaign (local only), which adds some extra hours of fun.			"

												4-5 hours of gameplay. When deciding to buy it, let that factor in your decision.What kind of 5 hours? Well...The story is somewhat Cliche'd even if that doesn't have to be a bad thing. But you can somewhat predict the outcome. Which is okay. Shank shines in it's combat.Buttonmashing skills will serve you well, but they won't see you to the end.Reaction speeds will need to be somewhat tight, and good mind will go a long way too.Most weapons are suitable for most situations, but most of the time, you'll know what setup you're most comfortable with. And this combination will, most of the time, serve you very very well.But don't shy away from changing on-the-fly when the situation calls for it. It might save you from getting ""Shanked"".			"

												8/10+ Very enjoyable game, and this is coming from someone who isn't normally into fighting games+ Great selection of weapons, moves and combos. Enough to make the game not feel repetitive, but not too many to make it difficult to master. In general fighting is very satisfying in this game.+ Required level of skill ramps up gradually throughout the game, keeping things interesting.+ Control are mostly tight, with the pounce move being the one exception.+ Great cartoon-like art style. The levels are varied enough to show off the game's rather unique style.+ Cheesy but very fitting voice acting. I wish the game had more cut scenes. Oh wait, it does. Read cons below.+ Great music.- Story isn't very engaging, and much of it is told at the very end. It also turns out some cut scenes which help explain the story are missing in the regular version of the game. I only found out later that I should have selected Beta from the game Properties to get an uncensored version[forums.kleientertainment.com] that includes all cut scenes. That's unfortunate, because I'm not going to play the game again just for the cut scenes.- Checkpoints instead of save-anywhere. Not a huge issue, but in some cases the checkpoints are too far between and the ones that are saved are cleared if you close the game without completing a level. Normally this isn't an issue because levels are not too long, but in the level before last it's pretty annoying, because it wasn’t easy for me to pass the end of the level and closing the game to take a break meant losing all progress in that level (including one boss fight). As always, leaving the game minimized was the best option, but it messes up the ""hrs on record"" count- I had to search the web to find how to beat some bosses. The game gives some hints, but they're not very helpful. To beat the final boss, for example, you need to apply a very specific combo - when you lock blades with him, you need to quickly press LT  to back out, then RT to grapple.. No idea how someone is expected to find this out without searching the web.- If you find an alternative way that *should* kill a boss but the game was not designed with it in mind, you end up in a situation where the boss has zero health and is completely incapacitated yet can take and endless amount of hits without dying - until you do it the way the game ""wants"". - Game froze once, but is otherwise quite stable.Shank is a really fun game to play. I recommended it without significant reservations, just make sure to enable Beta mode before starting to play, to get all cut scenes.			"

ShankOverall Score: 7/10Short Summary:A fun action 2D beat 'em up (literally) game you will to play. Travel through the beautiful locations this game has to offer to beat up (more like,brutally kill) tons of enemies by using different weapons and combos.Estimated Playthrough Time: 3-5 hours for a single playthrough.+ Graphics: 1)Beautiful locations to play on each ""mission"".2)Well designed art style for each character and overall it's a good looking 2D game. I enjoyed kicking my foes butts with those backrounds (you can see my screenshots for that).+ Gameplay: Fun and Engaging1) Weapons: You start with 3 (Dual Pistols, Knife & Chainsaw) and unlock more as you progress through the game.2) Combos: You can either mash buttons like a maniac or maneuver between each enemy to kill him the way you want and while doing so, killing other enemies as well.3) Enemies: Challenging enemies (and annoying as like you want to beat the crap out of them) which gives the game a good beat up vibe.4) Boss fights: 8 Overall. Each boss is unique but it was too easy to deal with them (Played on normal difficulty so far).5) Controls: At start I struggled to understand how to make certain combos with my weapons (becaues their guide didn't help) but I figoured it out also by choosing my own set of keys to make it easy.**Recommended key set see below**+ Sound:Well suited soundtrack throughout the game.- Storyline:Didn't understand the story behind Shank so much and it's not the strongest part in this game.Conclusion & Other:So after we covered it all up I do strongly recommend this game because it is fun to play if you like to beat up (again, brutally kill) your enemies in different styles.**Re-Playability:Normal & Hard Difficulty.Up to 2 Co-op player (so far didn't find someone to play with)You can also unlock Shank skins by reaching certain amount of kills for each weapon.**Recommended Key Set:Arrow Keys - Movement , Shift - Block.Q - Normal Attack , E - Heavy Attack , R - Gun AttackF - Pounce , G - Grapple , Space - Jump**Screenshots Section: You're more than welcome to also check my screenshots for this game [link below] to see what this game has to offer.http://steamcommunity.com/id/xDMikeW2k14/screenshots/?appid=6120&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=imagewall* Skip it.** Not Recommended.*** Give It A Try.**** Recommended On Sale****** Recommended On Full Price.

It has great graphic novel visual style and music, brutal and dynamic gameplay and cheesy B-movie plot that will make you grin and cringe at the same time.

												Rating 6.5/10OVerview: 2d ActionThe Good:+ Great graphics and animation. + A good combat system, you have light and heavy attacks, ranged attacks, grapple and leap attacks. You mix this all together to create fun and fast combat mechanics. + A variety of weapons to fit your playstyle The Average:The boss battles are mostly the same. Each boss has similar attack patterns making each encounter feel more like a chore rather than a challengeThe Bad:- Its main failing is that the game is very very repetitive. There is very little variety in the level design, thus every level has you beating up enemies, moving on to the next screen and doing it all over again.  The game is short clocking in at roughly 2-3 hours on normal and by the time you reach the end you pretty much had enough anyways. ConclusionIt is a good first effort from Klei Entertainment, they have a unique artsytle and animation to their games which make them stand out but this game is a bit on the shallow side.  "

												Shank is a very violent hand drawn 2D sideways scrolling beat/shoot 'em up. The presentation is excellent - badass gory comic book style cutscenes, great sound effects, and a really fitting gritty soundtrack. The story itself is a very shallow revenge plot, but I couldn't care less - it sets the mood perfectly.Good combat mechanics - 4 weapon categories: The mandatory melee weapon (Two knives), heavy melee weapon (machete, chain saw etc), ranged weapon (guns etc), and grenades (frag, mines, molotovs).  I did find the gravity a bit too weak though - it all felt a wee bit too floaty for my taste.There's a good variation in enemy types and a boss in the end of each level, so even though you could argue the combat is fairly simple, I still found it varied, challenging and rewarding enough to keep me entertained for the 3 hours of gameplay the campaign provides. There's also a co-op campaign.The gameplay using an xbox360 controller didn't feel quite as tight as I had hoped for. While the analouge stick is good for aiming the ranged weapon, it felt a bit too indirect/unresponsive for character control.Generally it's pretty evident that it's a console port, as e.g. the devs didn't even bother hiding the mouse cursor during gameplay.I bought Shank1+2 at 75% off, and at that price it's just ridiculously high value for money, but even at full price it's a recommended purchase for fans of the genre.75%			"

												Fighting games are usually for a certain majority of players that like to improve their skills instead of having mindless fun, which isn’t a bad thing. It’s just that a lot of people are not going to enjoy it as much as DOOM or F.E.A.R in the long run. This happened to me as well. However, Shank manages to be a part fighting game with platforming elements to give it enough variation for replayability to make the game memorable and last longer. There’s even enough charm in the game that makes the game gritty and laws of nature defyingly funny in looks which took me by surprise the first time I played it. The gameplay and art style is what the developers put thought into and not the story, so If your (dumbfoundingly) thinking this game is for the deep and meaningful, then look somewhere else. gameplay The mechanics of the game is more of a simplified, yet well-made fighting mechanic that manages to be easy to learn but hard to master. You have your only light weapon the shives, your heavy weapons, your ranged weapons and your limited throwable. You can combine these attacks to deck out massive damage on your enemies with time. The first time you play this you will die, A lot. But with time you will get better and that just brings up the next mechanic. grabbing, you will love the grab move in the game because of the many things you can do to the thugs when you get your hands on them. Each weapon and move has a different variation on what you can do to the them and the others around you, especially throwing them against other enemies. The light attack with grab must be my favorite and my god is it brutal, anyone unfortunate enough to be in this situation will turn into a human ragdoll. Then we've got platforming, what do I have to say, meh. It’s not bad it’s just easier than it looks. They're so contextual and smooth to go through that it makes a super meat boy stage as hard as a boss fight for the protagonist. But their short and a nice change in the game that somehow fits the setting well with all the impossible leaps of faith and the ability to ♥♥♥♥ing climb walls with a pair of shives, how awesome is that. Artificial intelligence Basic enemies in the game are varied little in their shape, but what they make up for is in specialty. Any weapon that their holding will be used at the best of their abilities that fits the character’s movements. The light guys will usually use one handed weapons and numbers, the massive guys will mostly use two handed weapons and cover a large area, and the nimble girls will use light weapons and their movement. Even what weapon their using can dictate their health depending if they are ranged or melee. The variation is so large that even the enemies without weapons act differently, depending on their shape, which is quite impressive. There are only two kinds of boss fights in the game, one that acts like more of a puzzle to defeat, and the ones that require you to remember everything you did when you encountered specific enemies. The latter is the hardest because the only way to deck damage is to attack normally, because the puzzle enemies take as much damage in their weak points, as a light, ranged guy. This is more of a mixed thing because some of them I liked and some of them I just didn’t like. Atmosphere The art style in the game looks like a cartoon network version of “machete”. It’s well animated and entirely hand drawn. It doesn’t have hand drawn frames like “Skullgirls” but it looks good enough to be eye candy. The story fits the art style well with visceral violence mixed with bright colours to fit the theme. The story isn’t a timeless classic of our age, but is still good enough for the theme. The game story is about a guy “ironically” called shank and the story is unfolded to us about why he is taking vengeance against a group of organised criminals. It may sound serious but when you get to the point that you fight guys bigger than a house, why bother. The cut scenes look good, but the dialogue is purposely asinine at best. The story is mostly told through the cut scenes with the character interactions being forgettable, but the way it’s given to us is its strength making character building and storytelling good. I would be lying if I said that I didn’t like the protagonist and some of the characters. It’s dark, it’s scary, and that’s what it just wants to tell us. Negatives Now when you begin the game, one of the first things it shows to you is “recommended with controller”. Now you can play the game with the keyboard, it’s just that its layout is awful. The key binding scheme could have been laid out better, it just that the first time I played I assumed it was made without testing. It’s not a bad thing because you can bind the keys in ways to fit your style and you can play the game. An even bigger complaint is balancing. There’s so many weapons and enemies given to you that balancing can be a hard thing. Some weapons are overpowered, whereas there are weapons that do sod all damage, a good example is the ranged weapons. The shotgun can pierce through enemies and the charge attack with it can literally mostly clear out a room of hostiles, where the submachine gun does less damage than the pistols and it's only good trait is it’s grab attack variant that does the more damage than the shotgun. Certain enemies can be a pain, especially the dogs that tackle you and bite you to death. This wouldn’t be so bad if there wasn’t one attack you could do when you grab them and is just throw them, which does ♥♥♥♥ poor damage. Conclusion “Shank” has been recently overshadowed by its more smart and agile sister “mark of the ninja” which is probably a shame because it’s quite a good game. It manages to be a good 2D platforming fighting game for anyone who likes “F.E.A.R” or “DOOM” or generally feeling like a badass. If you want something to last and for something to show to your kids when you get older, buy this. You’ll like it, your kids will like it and you’ll probably bore your husband/wife to death when you talk about it.			"

												In this genre of games, I think the masterpiece still stands as Final Fight. So I will mostly compare this with Final Fight.- The art greatly surpasses Final Fight, but it's not a direct result of 20 odd years that passed between these two games. Shank tries to establish its own style that has been a good mix of Metal Slug, Western and Tarantino movies and executes it near flawlessly. The game's greatest merit is its art to be honest.- Lack of ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ to do or secret locations. There aren't any of them unlike Final Fight where you beat a car for no good reason but still a good amount of fun and something to achieve and try to set a record on. Compared to Guacamalee, lack of secret locations also can be more noteworthy.- Comparing stories, Shank and Final Fight both follow a cliche story about a woman but Shank does it a lot better and the story has a good amount of Robert Rodriguez vibe, which I found incredibly done. Also the characters are fleshed out a lot more, unlike Final Fight's bosses.- When it comes to gameplay, Final Fight was much more superior. All of your combos made sense and were devoid of button mashing. Also Final Fight tried to keep combos and attack moves a lot simpler but timing of them and the strategy used to defeat a number of enemies in an area mattered much more than button mashing.- Final Fight allowed you to trap your enemies to a corner of the screen and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them, which made the game a lot easier than it could have been if you couldn't exploit this. Shank carries this trope to some extent, you will mostly be able to corner your enemies and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them except for bosses and some enemy types.- Some fights consists of throwing multiple waves of heavy enemies at you without having a chance to rest or save and it's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Yes, the game scenario makes sense for you to fight them, but having a 8-10 minutes of constant fighting and starting all over when beaten just feels unfair to me.- Responsiveness of the controls are sometimes ♥♥♥♥ed, which was purely perfect for Final Fight. I often wondered why my fighter insisted on shooting at the opposite direction or failed to grab one item in multiple tries. When it comes to dodging, controls ♥♥♥♥ up more and you find yourself standing in the middle of 5 large enemies.- I won't be able to compare this with Final Fight due to era's technical limitations but compared to Guacamalee the amount of gore in the game is just lovely and it is very satisfying to violently strangle someone with chains or how you behead bosses.All in all, if you're interested in the genre or want something interesting, Shank can be a good choice when on sale and fortunately it goes on sale very frequently.

												Shank is a great side scrolling beat em' up game, much like the olden days of Double Dragon, Final Fight or Streets of Rage except no 3rd dimension.The game is over the top violent, which makes it oh so wonderful.  I found myself mashing buttons together just to see what crazy combo he would pull off next.  Some but not all of the environments are interactive, for example while on a train you can throw bad guys off of it.  I found that incredibly entertaining.The game is a side scroller which means at some point you're going to have to jump through obstacle courses.  The developers did this step right though, for instance if you're sliding down a slope and you need to make a life or death decision in the next few seconds, the game will go into slow motion until you make that decision.  It's an excellent system, but this feature goes away in the final levels, which is a bummer because then you have to memorize the next few steps, or die and restart from the last checkpoint.Boss battles are actually fun, as each one has a tick, similiar to Punchout, and no two boss battles are the same.Overall a very good game that deserves a play through if you enjoy side scrolling beat em' ups.

												Very good brawler. Tight controls, interesting moves, decent weapon variety, and a nice artstyle. I personally found it enjoyably challenging, and a bit frustrating at times even on Normal difficulty, but I'm not really much of a fighter/brawler player so your experience may vary. The story was somewhat interesting but truth be told it was nothing revolutionary imo.It's not without flaws, of course. Enemy variety is frankly not the most impressive. Also be warned the singleplayer story mode is very short. First playthrough only took me about 2 to 3 hours. There's some replayability if you want to try hard mode or unlock all the costumes, but frankly after you settle into a pattern of attack that you like, beating up very similar goons already becomes somewhat repetitive in the first playthrough so I'm not sure how many more I'd be interested in doing. There's a multiplayer campaign I haven't done yet, so maybe there's some meat to be had there.Also the save system is automatic and stage based, and it's not always completely clear what the stage start and end points are. So if like me you decide you want a break after reaching a checkpoint and exit the game, you might find yourself having to repeat some content. Around 2 hours of my play time were actually alt-tabbed because I was getting a bit salty and wanted a break, but didn't want to redo the whole stage thanks to the limited autosave system.It was an enjoyable experience and I would recommend it, just be aware that this can indeed be a game you beat in one (short) sitting.

												Best beat-em-up I've played in long time, but I recommend you get a gamepad before you buy. There's a TON of inputs, and I couldn't make it work with my keyboard.But if you DO have a gamepad, this game is awesome. It looks and feels GREAT. There's plenty of depth, so if you get good, you can do all kinds of sweet tech that'll make you feel like a badass. There's also a satisfying difficulty curve.It's Kiei, so you KNOW it looks great all the way through, with plenty of cool moments like sillohetted fights that don't get in the way of the gameplay.And what's more, this game does bosses much better than the genre usually does. They're satisfying, difficult, cool-looking, and have uniqueness without breaking all the rest of the game's rules. "

												Shank is basically an old-school, side-scrolling 2D beat´em-up like the old arcade machines.Story is a muted version of ""Kill Bill"", which is rather vague, but nobody expects the story to be key factor here.A game with pros and cons, it is definitely not a brilliant game but also not a bad one.It will definitely appeal to the old-school players who have ""invested"" a lot of coins in arcade machines. Pros + Nice art and design, background music and animations+ variety of weapons, attack styles and combos+ interesting bosses and corresponding fights+ co-op mode (did not play it)Cons- very short duration (about 5h)- limited replayability (except for the co-op mode)- rather repated level design- could include more on the background story for the single-player campaignReccommended at a badget price.

												Shank is a 2D side scrolling action game from Klei Studios. This is the first in a series of two games and while the second game is a far more refined experience, the original is still fun in it's own way, even if it is a pretty simple game. I have to confess I played Shank 2 before the original so I am slightly more negatively biased towards the game as the first is missing a lot of improvements added in the sequel. This doesn't mean the game isn't fun, it just means it's relatively simple and superficial when it comes to mechanics. In Shank 2 you were almost required to have the proper load out to complete certain levels. In the first game, you have the option to switch weapons on the fly, but you probably won't need to as the two starting weapons (chainsaw and double pistols) can get you through the entire game pretty easily (hard mode included). Additionally there are only three enemy types (medium, large, dog) with a few variants. Once you know how to take down one variant, you can take down all of them with relative ease.I don't mean to say that Shank is a bad game, just one that needed to be fleshed out a little more. In terms of content it's a very short game and I was able to get all the achievements under 10 hours. There is a co-op campaign but it's local only which is very unfortunate because I found it to be pretty fun to double up with a friend and run through some missions. I actually prefer Shank's co-op to Shank 2's co-op (which is a really difficult survival mode). Shank's co-op (although local only) actually fleshes out the story a little more. There is an achievement for completing local co-op so make sure you've got a buddy and an extra controller if you plan on getting all the achievements.Overall Shank is a great looking 2D beat 'em up/shoot 'em up with a great soundtrack and fun bosses. The game may be relatively easy and simple and could use a little more content but it's still a blast to play.6.5/10			"

												By the time of this late review, you've probably have already made your mind about this nearly 3 year old game. I'm simply reviewing to state my interpretation. Shank is a revenge tale played in a 2D platforming brawler. Gameplay is somewhat comparble to the Devil May Cry series, with a standard attack, a secondary weapon attack and guns that can be switched on the fly, grapple and pounce moves, and a grenade to cause heavy damage. The combat is pretty simplistic, and often spammy, as mashing the standard attacks is sometimes the best way to deal with single enemies and small groups. That isn't to say there isn't some complexity with the fact that some enemies can shoot from afar, block or dodge your attacks, or perform unblockable power attacks. The majority of the combat boils down to managing gun shooters and grenade throwers while a handful of standard grunts and a ""big guy"" or two that require you to dodge or block their attacks. Platform segments are simple and are nearly automatic, but   can become a little annoying when you miss a grab point or are hit by a projectile mid-jump.The game's simplicity is both it's main pro and con - it's a simple, very short story with easy to grasp controls and enjoyable ""mindless bloodshed"". It also means the game becomes fairly predictable and leaves most the game easily beat by ""spamming main attack"" or ""spamming pistols"" until you win (this will not always work though, and it pays to mix it up on tougher enemies and large groups). I beat it in less than 3 hours, which is crazy short, but I'm also perfectly fine with that because any longer probably would have outstayed it's welcome for me. (another backlogged title defeated!).You won't find the new revolution in brawlers here, but you have a solid action title that's enjoyably mindless.			"

												As much as I want to give this game a thumbs up, the fact that KIEI is not willing to patch a fix for the Auto-Save Problem (they somehow messed up cloudsaving on Steam) makes this game unplayable. Either you play it through in one session or you have to start all over again (which is on the long run just no fun...). Otherwise it's a very decent side scrolling beat 'em up. The story is cheesy, the artwork is top notch, movement seems a little bit sluggish sometimes though. there aren't really any deep combos, but you have to keep multiple opponents busy most of the time, so crowd control is the word. With its cartoonish graphics and easy to learn controls this game is a must have for most side scroll players. Just be prepared for the mentioned save-bug...			"

												Take everything I say about Shank with a big ol’ spoonful of salt; I don’t like platformers, I generally don’t like 2D side scrolling, and I hate brawlers and fighting games. So what is Shank? It is a 2D side scrolling brawler with comic book aesthetics and short elements of reactionary platforming.Needless to say I started off the first level with a sour taste in my mouth and my judgments pre-rendered. After all of that, I’m not going to make a 180 and say Shank is great, but I got WAY more enjoyment out of it than I ever expected. The fighting felt to me like a run-and-gun adaptation of the combat found in Mark of the Ninja (a game I actually am quite fond of). While the platforming certainly picked at my nerves, the sections were short enough that I was able to push through them and keep playing. Helping matters was that Shank is an absolutely gorgeous game from an aesthetic standpoint. The animations are clear and well fleshed out, the cut-scenes are very rich and capture that comic book vibe, and the colors - while a bit muted for my tastes - are varied from level to level.In the end, Shank is still a brawler. I don’t like memorizing combos and I don’t like how any fighting games handle. But I think in the end, that just says a lot for the quality that this game brings to the table. I’m not about to hand out my game of the year award, but Shank is pretty alright.			"

												You said you wanted a hack and slash side scroller with huge combos and a variety of weapons? Well thats what I thought you said, so I recommended Shank.  In shank you use light attacks, heavy attacks, and fast attacks to build combo chains. Each attack uses a different weapon and there are multiple weapons to find, so far I have found myself using a variety of shank, chainsaw, pistol, and shotgun attacks. However I also have been using grenades and super heavy weapons e.g. the minigun whenever the situation calls for it. Now as you might have figured out there is quite a bit of variety in the ways you can kill enemys, thank goodness too, because otherwise the game would get boring pretty fast. Really there is not much else to shank besides playing through the story and moving on to Shank 2 if you liked what you just played. I would recommend this game to fans of sidescrollers and maybe even fans of hack and slash.			"

												This game reallhy isn't good gameplay-wise. The graphic style is nice. The vague story is a bad ripoff of Tarantino type revenge films. A mixed blessing is that it only takes 3 hours to beat. If it wasn't one of the cheapest games i've played since I had a NES, it probably only would have taken an hour and a half. The shortness of the game meant that I dealt with the frustration because I knew the end was in sight. If it was a 5-6 hour game, I probably would have quit after the first hour.The combat system is just plain boring and too random. It feels like luck is almost as important as skill; sometimes regular hitting combos turn into grapples when you don't want them to, which gives other enemies an open shot at you. Different weapon combinations don't really have much effect other than a couple just being generally worse than others. Pretty much all difficulty comes from the game just throwing tons of enemies at you that throw grenades and shoot assault rifles rather than actually making the enemies smarter or requiring more skill.Honestly, it feels like they prioritized the look and style and added the actual combat as an afterthought with no actual idea behind it other than it should look cool. Kung-fu on the NES has much better combat IMHO because it's 100% skill-based. There aren't any unavoidable deaths, your character reacts predictably and it's never cheap.Certain levels have missles come at you from offscreen and pieces of ceiling fall on you, much too fast to be able to react to, which adds nothing but frustration and random deaths.Pretty much all of the boss fights are glorified quicktime events. They all involve dodging and getting in the occasional hit that does next to no damage until the flashing ""grapple now!"" QTE graphic pops up, at which point your character does a specific attack animation. Each boss requires going through 4 of these QTE's to win. The devs got lazy, because even if you don't have a chainsaw or pistols equipped, your character wil still always use them for the QTE attacks.To top it all off, the developers made the huge mistake of adding a bunch of terrible platforming, with a few notable areas where trial-and-error is the only option. The missles from offscreen appear in one stretch that is super frustrating, and at one point you actually have to shoot your guns at an offscreen enemy to prevent him from killing you mid-jump.Anyways, I LOVED Mark of the Ninja, with a similar visual style by the same devs, because at it's core it's a great stealth game, but at Shank's core is a random button-masher of a fighter mixed with a horrible platformer.

												It took me thirty minutes to figure out that Jumping Light -> Standing Heavy -> Repeat carried an infinite number of non-boss enemies to the corner and kept them there until they died or an enemy spawned behind you. After making sure it still worked for the next hour, I figured I had already beaten the game and had no desire to mash A-X-Y for another hour.It was a fine thirty minutes, to be sure, and the bosses can't be stunlocked, but are instead Standard QTE Bosses mostly there to make sure you know where the block and grapple buttons are.Personally, I'm a bigger fan of Guacamelee.

												Classic side scrolling beat 'em up with very good visuals and animations, good combat mechanics and shallow storyline. What's not to like? Made by my very favourite Klei Entertainment, the game is very stylish and straightforward - exactly what I would expect from a beat 'em up.The ~5 hours of gameplay are just enough for you to finish the game without getting bored with repetitive battles. Although I never get tired of chainsaw butcheries. On the negative side of things - there were some unpleasant bugs in the Mac version that made the game unplayable from time to time.			"

												Your girl has been slain by those you once called comrades, and now, one by one, you will have your revenge. Sweet, bloody revenge. All of this, of course, is just an excellent excuse for some clever, enjoyable platforming and delightful strategic combat.There's something fascinating about charging at a thug with your chainsaw drawn, and flicking him into the air with a satisfying growl of its engine, then juggling his body with a blast from your shotgun. And because you are driven by REVENGE, then leaping into the air and manifesting your titular shanks into his prone body, before hurling him into the crowd. As Shank continues on his vengeful quest, he adds machetes, katanas, machine guns, and much more to his arsenal. For, if nothing else, Shank is multi-talented.And then there's co-op mode, where Shank's good friend joins him on his quest for revenge. I don't recall what his name is -- I just always call him Danny Trejo.  So there you go.  You can play as Danny Trejo.			"

												Another beautifully presented game about stabbing people from Klei Entertainment.Unfortunately, the game heavily falls victim to default optimal strategy, or the ""Hadouken Effect,"" or whatever you want to call it. There are some beautiful and fantastic combos you can pull off if you're willing to experiment and become actually good at the game, but there is one move that will carry you through the entire game with almost zero effort that is quite easy to discover within the first ten minutes of play. Fast-forward through two hours of spamming this move over and over and you have the casual experience of Shank. If you have a friend willing to join you in your jump-slashing spam spree, you can get another two hours out of the local co-op campaign, which was actually quite surprisingly long (about as long as single-player) and to put that much effort into a co-op campaign and make it local-only is somewhat baffling to me.Also baffling is how the hard mode was handled. There are no checkpoints. Even the people who are really into this game admit that the hard mode is quite tedious and unfun. I'm all for arcade difficulty, and I would have expected a limited-lives system to come into play on hard mode, but you have literally one health bar to complete an entire stage. Ten minutes of gameplay in, and an enemy with a minigun can blow you to pieces with a stunlock-instadeath combo before you even know what happened. Hope you're good with the combat, otherwise you're going to repeat ten minutes of spamming again. This isn't even a pure beat-em-up, either. There are platforming sections, and the non-intuitive ""hold right or left to advance, no matter what direction you're actually going"" controls can easily send you plummetting to your inevitable instant death.This is a hard game to recommend, but after watching a walkthrough done by someone familiar with the game's combat engine, I think it has a lot of potential for the diehard beat-em-up fans. If you liked other Klei games, particularly Shank 2, try out the demo and see what you think. Unless you're willing to keep replaying it, however, I'd wait for a sale if I were you.			"

What's it about?Shank is a side-scrolling brawler by Klei Entertainment, who also brought you such titles as Don't Starve and Mark of the Ninja. Playing as the titular protagonist, you make your way through several levels, slaughtering dozens of thugs and hired goons along the way on a one-man quest for revenge.How does it play?The undeniable strength of Shank is its combat. Within the first few minutes of the game, you'll be stringing together devastating combos utilising the weapons at your disposal. You have a light attack, a heavy attack and a firearm attack, and your heavy weapon and firearm can be swapped on the fly with weapons you pick up throughout the game. The fighting has a wonderful feeling of weight and impact to it, and hacking down the beautifully animated enemies is an absolute delight. The bosses are unusual and enjoyable to fight, though most can be beaten in more or less the same way. There is some rudimentary platforming involved in traversing the levels, which doesn't get in the way of the action too much.Because the game was designed for console, it is highly recommended that you use a controller to play it. Trying to play with the keyboard will turn out to be an altogether fiddly and unenjoyable experience, since the buttons you need will be all over the place. Shank uses almost every button and directional input on the controller, and that amounts to 16 keys on the keyboard. Another bugbear is that levels often involve hazards and enemy placements that can lead to unfair deaths and frustration; the church level in particular, with its falling missiles, can be a nightmare to get through. There is also an odd glitch with the chainsaw's jumping attack in which you and your target can become stuck if you try to jump before the attack animation is finished, forcing you to reload the last checkpoint. It is also not a very long game; I finished it in less than three hours, so take that into consideration before purchasing.How does it look?In a word, gorgeous. Keli have a knack for nailing their art styles, and Shank is no exception. The character sprites are beautifully designed and animated, and serve to make the already great combat look and feel even better. The environments are equally gorgeous, though there are points at which elements in the foreground appear onscreen and obscure parts of the stage. This often happens in areas with enemies, which can prove annoying when you are fighting or being attacked in a place you can't see. Despite this little problem, the graphics are delightful to look at, and the resolution options mean you shouldn't have a problem getting it to run on your system.How does it sound?Perhaps less impressive out of all of this is the sound design. The music mostly consists of loops of Mexican standoff-style tunes that fit the game very well, but can get a little repetitive after a while. The enemy shouts and grunts also get very samey (and for some reason, Shank's death rattle sounds almost identical to the Heavy from TF2). The various slashing and shooting sounds are well done, and the chainsaw in particular sounds like the industrial death machine it should. The voice acting in the cutscenes could have been better, but then again, the story is not what's important here.Long story shortShank is a brutal, bloody and highly entertaining beat-'em-up from a highly talented indie studio. The combat is some of the best I've experienced in a 2D game, and the art style is both beautiful to look at and serves to add to the combat experience. A few problems here and there, but Shank is a game that is definitely worth your time and money.Good PointsOutstanding combat systemGorgeous visualsInteresting environments and bossesBad PointsThe occasional game-breaking glitchSound design could have been betterSome questionable decisions in level and art designMay be too short for someRedWolf Rating: 6/10 - Good			"

												While I recommend this game it does have some glaring flaws that really bothered me.The good: the gameplay is pretty sweet.  It's just well designed and I liked the mechanics a lot.  It's reminiscent of old 2d beat em ups, or to a lesser extent Devil May Cry.  Story is, well, it's alright.  You're not really here for story time, though.  I very much enjoyed the animation style.The most glaring flaw is that regular enemies just have way too many hit points.  Killing normal enemies is an absolute grind, and it takes so damned long.  It isn't fun to beat up on the same 3 or 4 dudes for a couple of minutes at a time.  The gameplay really feels like you should be plowing through these guys, and while that's what I wanted, it most certainly isn't what happens.  However, if you go into the game knowing this, it probably won't bother you as much as it did me.  I just hated sitting in fights wondering how much longer it would take.Although the bosses are colorful they can also be sort of frustrating.  For the most part the game demands that you figure out a special trick/tell to each boss and doing that isn't really easy.   Personally I don't think that the tells to what you need to do are obvious enough.  Example: I don't know what the hell I was supposed to do against the final boss, I ended up just brute forcing him because I couldn't figure it out.  It's possible to brute force the guys down, sure, but it takes much, much longer, which isn't viable in a game like this because of your limited healthbar.I didn't have a bad time with Shank.  It's an alright game, not great, not bad.  Could have been a lot better, but that really isn't saying anything.			"

												Slick, varied and downright fun combat is really all this game is about. Sure, it has an attractive art style and an enjoyable (if somewhat cliché) soundtrack but its core is the 2D beat-em-up gameplay. Be sure you have a controller you can play with as I can't imagine playing this with the keyboard (I used a PS2 controller).For me, the highlight of Shank is its boss fights. Each one has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of. However, if you want more of a challenge or can't figure out the weakness, you have the option to whittle them down with normal attacks. While there isn't a huge variety in the grunts that you'll fight, I never grew tired of them because you steadily unlock new weapons that reinvigorate things and quite simply, the game isn't long enough to start getting bored. It also helps that you have 6 different attacks, a dodge/block button and jumping at your disposal as you combo your way to victory. There are some platforming bits that got tiring but fortunately the developers were smart enough to keep those sections short.The story is a very simple tale of revenge that is entirely forgettable but serves its purpose to drive the action forward. The voice acting is equally adequate without being distractingly bad nor anything noteworthy.Given Shank's short length it's hard to recommend at full price. But on sale or packaged in something like a Humble Bundle it will surely entertain you for an afternoon or two.			"

												Jedna mi je od omiljenih 2D arkada. Odusevila me je u svkaom pogledu. Brza, zabavna, ali nazalost i kratka. To bi bila i najveca mana ove igre. Suvise je kratka moze da se zavrsi za nekih par sati igranja. Druga mana igre bi bila sto su komande ocajne totalno su nepristupacne za PC igrace. Igra sama predlaze upotrebu gamepada da bi se bas u igri uzivalo.Ja sam igru presao na tastaturi, ali je malo teze jer ima dosta komandi, a ponekad mora brzo da se koristi dosta tastera.Ako izuzmemo te 2 stvari igra je vrhunska. Gameplay je odlican brz, veoma zabavan. Neprijatelji se deru, vriste dok ih ubijate i bacate oko sebe.Shank ima nekoliko kombo udaraca a pritom moze koristiti nekoliko oruzja. Moj omiljeni je kad dok drzim neprijatelja i bodem ga nozem u stomak probodem ga motornom testerom i bacim u vazduh... Ma dozivljaj je odlican. Sto se oruzja tice na raspolaganju su za pocetak noz, motorka i pistolj, a kasnije kroz igru otkljucavate bolja oruzja macete, uzi, ♥♥♥♥♥ itd.Igra je odlicna preporucujem je svakom.Ja sam je uzeo prosle godine na GMG oba dela sam platio 5$ sto mislim da je dobar deal. To je bilo ono vreme dok su bili skromni.Ko hoce ima na mom profilu video gejmpleja iz shanka pa moze da pgoleda. :)			"

												Ah, beat 'em ups. The genre of the late 80's-early 90's. Loved Final Fight, The Punisher, Cadillacs & Dinosaurs and Captain Commando back then. Great games. This one... not so fun. Well, not so much. The graphics are clean, and action is pretty good. Bosses are a bit on the easy side though. And it's short. It can be finished in a few hours. Where are the times when beat 'em ups were insanely hard ? Please, don't get me wrong. It IS a good game, I just missed the over-the-top action from the old days, action that made me feel like a badass. Maybe I just got older ? I don't know. I wish they would remake the 4 games I mentioned earlier, in HD... Those games were already perfect.[Rating: 70/100]			"

												Caveat emptor: I've only attempted the co-op campaign.The difficulty curve of this game is practically sinusoidal. It goes from very easy, to demanding, to easy, to impossible. It's pretty obvious that little to no effort was put into balancing the progression of the co-op campaign. The game looks pretty and it's a solid concept, but it's not fun to play.Also, the controls overlap. “Use item” is the same button combo as “revive other player”, and one of the inputs in the combo is that for “grapple enemy”. In the frenzy of battle, you will very frequently end up consuming health or just grappling an enemy instead of reviving the other player, leading to many frustrating team fatalities.			"

												Shank is a game i had in my library for a while and since i like brawlers a bit and after i really enjoyed Klei entertainments newer games Mark of the Ninja and Don't Starve i thought i should give this a look. Take this really Early Impression, after roughly half an hour gameplay, with a HUGE grain of salt, since it comes from somone that wasn't really pinin for this game.Shank, not a bad idea, looks really intersting.But Shanks has a big problem.There seems to be a ever so tiiiiny gap between you making the input and the action following it on screen.Partly that resultet for me in attcks going into the wrong direction, other times it seems as if the game at times locks you into moves and that you can't cancel out of them ie. evade attacks, opening you up for enemy hits.The controls are not really tight enough, and for a brawler that is a huuuge minus.Especially with so many other games nowadays beeing really good at this.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS?Nope, sorry.But i would recommend you look at Mark of the Ninja and Don't Starve since those one is much better gams than Shank albeit in a differen't genre..

												I did enjoy Shank, but i can't in all honesty, recommend it.I liked the art style and the tongue-in-cheek melodrama of the grindhouse plot, but the game is busted. I repeatedly got glitched out during fights and platforming sections had jumps that were only possible half the time. The game is a few years old now so those issues are probably never getting fixed. On top of that the game is over quickly, even on the hardest difficulty, which is not bad on its own, but the core mechanics aren't interesting enough for me to ever want to come back. I played it, there was some fun to be had, and I don't feel like playing it ever again.If you can get it at a discount, it's an alright brawler, but you can probably get more foryour money elsewhere.

												This is a hard game to review because it has so many issues and yet isn't horrible and I'd recommend it if you're a very big fan of this genre (only from a sale though). This game is horrendously designed. It was clearly made by amateur indie developers and the only thing remotely polished about it is the artstyle, which is fairly polarizing as it is. The game is essentially a tasteless grindhouse that involves as much gore and blood as possible, but I suppose that's apart of the genre that it's trying to be in so I can't fault it for that. However, what I can fault it for is it's terribly unresponsive controls, repetitive gameplay that's only real progress is gained from achieving arbitrary weapons at times that most of the time are worse than the first few weapons you unlock anyway. The enemies are created to essentially annoy you and juggle you, which in a beat em' up is essentially to be expected but this goes in this game where you've got guys shooting you while guys from off screen tackle you while dogs jump on you and guys hit you with machetes from a much longer range than makes any sense. This would be alright if enemies weren't damage sponges and couldn't attack you when they're barely on screen but it seems to just devolve into button mashing and luck, especially if you're playing on hard mode which means you only have one life. To add to this, the game is artifically created exponentially harder than it needs to be in hard mode because of the horrible platforming in the game that only serves to irritate you further. The developers seem to think irritation is good game design.On top of all of this they censored the game and removed a ton of cutscenes which thus made the story make even less sense than it already did and gives you little motivation to be invested in the game unless you really just like mass murder. There is a steam guide that explains how to put the censorship back in but I just find it amazing that one implied ♥♥♥♥ scene was considered innapropriate in a game where the player commits brutal mass murder to countless people. Doesn't sound like the developers have their priorities right.With that being said, there is some charm to the game that kept me playing and is the reason I am recommending it if you don't have better games to play. Also because I don't like beat em' ups to begin with or grindhouse I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt.			"

Shank.If you like platformers, this is definitely one to pick up - but be forewarned: there are some serously game-breaking issues that make this a lot more frustrating than it should be.Did I have fun? Sure, but the story is boring and the fact that you'll have to reboot a level several times because you're frozen in mid-air with a chainsaw make it difficult to reccomend this.If there weren't so many problems I'd give Shank a thumbs up, however, there are a lot of them and I unfortunately can't/won't.

												A short but delightful beat-em-up / shoot-em-up with a cool graphic novel artstyle.  If you like Metal Slug and similar games, this might just hit the spot.  Gameplay is pretty intuitive - you have your shanks, a heavier melee weapon of choice, and a gun of choice.  There's a bit of simple platforming but mostly cutting down groups of enemies.  The story is pretty basic - badass guy who lost a loved one seeks revenge on those who betrayed him - but the artstyle and animation make up for it.Complaints? It's way too short!!  Nearly all the bosses behave similarly so that can be a tad repetitive.  Multiplayer is local only.  But that's it - you should try out this game when you can, especially if it's on sale.			"

												it could have been a good game - it's a simple but fun beat-em-up with a graphics like something from a comic book and a story straight out of a Rodriguez film. unfortunately, I keep running into a bug which completely breaks the game: sometimes when doing a heavt attack while in the air, my character will freeze mid-jump. occasionally, I can somehow make him finish an attack but usually he's just stuck in the air and the enemies go idle, forcing me to restart. it's especially annoying in the hard mode (because let's not kid ourselves, normal feels more like easy in this game) as there are no checkpoints there so I need to start from the beginning of a level.

												As the game loads each time, you are instantly presented with a warning that you should be using a controller to play the game. This is unacceptable, as I've purchased it for PC, and I expect it to be played as such. Despite this misplaced excuse of a warning, Shank can be played and enjoyed with the keyboard. The controls and combinations aren't too pitiful, and you will be able to execute most of them as soon as you get used to how the mechanics work. The artwork is well done, in a comic book style setting. The voice acting is okay for what it is, but you should not expect them to be excellent. Even though the game is violent, the overall atmosphere is quite mild and cartoony. The story isn't very original nor is it interesting, but it does fit fine with the overall presentation and game play style. Even though Shank attempts to go back to the glory days of early to mid 90s Beat 'em ups, it comes off as unpolished and sometimes inadequate in some forced platforming elements. There is very little variety between the levels and enemies, and once you get acquainted with the moves, Shank gets increasingly repetitive in all aspects, and you will be hoping for a quick finish to the game. After a very short while, it all looks the same, feels the same, and plays the same. The unlocks don't add much at all, and there is very little to be gained with the weapons the game makes available to the player on a permanent basis as you progress through the story. The boss battles can often drag and do not offer any true challenge or difference in game play in comparison to the rest of the enemies. There is very little charm in Shank, in comparison to games of the same genre from earlier generations. It's button mashing without any skill or strategy whatsoever. The music and setting are akin to stereotypical Southwestern United States, and this provides the player with slight immersion to the theme, albeit a basic one. The general concept would have been better suited for a short animated film instead of a shallow and slightly subpar game. Tedious fight mechanics coupled with poorly designed boss battles makes for a forgettable and passable gaming experience.Shank is okay.			"

												Oh Jesus. Right, well I ♥♥♥♥in' love the art style. I really do, it's great to look at. That's about where the good things I have to say about this game ends though. The story is okay, it's exactly as good as you'd expect after glancing at the screenshots. Dudes wife gets ♥♥♥♥♥ (if you go into properties and in the beta bit change it to classic mode, otherwise you get the bizarrely censored version) and killed and he goes after them. It's like a cross between Kill Bill and Law Abiding Citizen. It sounds like it should be amazing by that comparison but it just isn't. Gameplay is mostly where it's a let down. It's as if when they made this game they decided instead of making things to make the game more fun they'd add only things that serve to annoy the player. The fact that your own grenades hurt you despite the game being focused on smaller areas and yet when a bad ♥♥♥♥ empties an Uzi clip at you through a horde of his own peeps none of them get hit. The fact that the game gives you symbol prompts instead of the actual buttons you should be pressing which was doubly annoying because I'm pretty sure switching to the uncensored version changed the controls. The fact that the attack button is the pickup button, the amount of times I accidentally picked up health when it was nearly full is ridiculous. I'm pretty sure the first time I played this, before swapping to the classic version, the button to pick stuff up was holding down and the grab button. Unless of course I dreamt this. Just overall the game is very nice to look at yet very annoying to play. I briefly played Shank 2 first and I don't remember that being so frustrating, hopefully this means they've tidied up the controls a bit. I don't wanna give this a negative review but Mark Of The Ninja is so much better, get that instead. Oh and the soundtrack is very nice. There, there's another positive.			"

												After having completed the game I was highly dissapointed. The controls even with a game controller, were often unresponsive. Allot of the games enviroments were designed to cheaply kill you just adding further frustration. The boss fights are pathetically easy (especially the last one). The game tries to make you replay itself again with novalty items like costumes but I see little to no reason to ever play this game again :( The game had an absolutely awful story, the protaganist had no character development. The game is incredibly short. honestly not worth the full price. If you wanna pick this game up, get it on sale :(			"

												Neither Shank or Shank 2 work on modern Laptops with refresh rates higher than 75hrzThese games should state this clearly on their store pages. The games will work fine if you connect your laptop into a TV or external screen which isn't locked to 75hrz, but this is just plain ridiculous. I'm not taking my HD TV around with me when I travel with laptop...Real shame as it's a good game when it used to work.

												Shank is a pretty nice 2D side-scrolling brawler video game which could have been made for 80s or 90s coin-operated arcade machines. It was developed in comic book art graphic convention mixed with Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez style as well as great sound effects and appropriately feisty soundtrack. This game features plenty of enemies to be brutally exterminated with heavy melee weapons like chainsaw, some firearms and grenades. I really like cool and simple combat system in this production (attacking, dodging and combos). It is good that several challenges are quite difficult and you are also able to increase the difficulty level by selecting hard-core mode. A nice addition is simple a little bit stupid plot with a grain of salt and some dark sense of humor with plenty occasions to shed blood.			"

												Shank is a really fun beat em up game with a story thats just there to spice things up. There are two storys and two modes. The Co op mode tells the backstory to the singelplayer while the singelplayer is what hapens after the co op missions. The story follows on shank after his girlfriend gets killed he wants revenge and hes gonna get it . The combat is really fluid and works pretty well even more so if you have a controller . Whats great theres a diffuclty spike which is great but the co op  campaing requires really good precision and you will have to try to beat the bosses multiple times. The graphics are beutiffly hand drawn and are pretty to look at. Overall its a great game and you have to check it out and its on sale so go and do that i give it a 7/10			"

												Embarrassingly short and with an already cliche story that suffers as a result of underdevelopment, Shank is at least somewhat redeemed by its artistic identity and for the most part tight gameplay that, despite its basically nonexistent variety, still succeeds at delivering a passable experience overall when everything is tallied and accounted for. Would I recommend Shank? Not necessarily unless you're into repeatable elements like beating your own score and unlocking a few goodies along the way.			"

												This isnt a terrible game, and to a certain degree it is fun but the controls are somewhat stiff and it always feels like you are being held back by the controls, that with better controls you could have more fun because you could do amazing combos and such. However my biggest problem with the game is the story, i dont like how linear the story is, i dont like how it has no real originality and the ""plot twist"" if you could call it that at the end, was not surpising, at all, I guessed the plot twist as it happened. while the gameplay to me is okay, thoughout most of the game I'm not sure why Shank is doing what he is doing, i dont know who that lady is in relation to Shank. I just really hate this story because it feels like no effort was put in the story. That being said i can agree with some people's reviews that the art and animation is pretty good and the setting isnt bad.			"

												Shank may be short and seems repetitive at first sight, but the intense action, the violent universe, the outstanding cartoon graphics, the never ending fluid combos only makes you want to continue and have more and more fights. The game can be difficult at some times, but there is always a winning strategy to make things easier. The story is highly inspired by the movie 'Kill Bill', it seems simple but it still keeps the player entertained. I'd give this game a 8/10			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. This game fails on so many levels it's unbelievable... First let's start with the gameplay. You start with shanks, a chainsaw and handguns. Shanks are your basic unchangeable weapons, chainsaw is you basic changeable heavy weapon and handguns are your basic changeable ranged weapons. (They are also the only ranged weapons you'll be using because they have infinite range and massive damage.) You won't be using heavy weapons until you get chains, which is an OP weapon that can kill anything if you combo them with shanks. So basically, even though this game looks like it has weapon variety, it doesn't.Next is the soundtrack. I really don't know what to say about it. It's really average. Like, REALLY average.Next is the story. It's bad. From the cringy voice acting to the fact that it only takes two ♥♥♥♥ing hours to complete and has no replay value. (Unless you count in the hard mode, that gets rid of all checkpoints and makes enemies a little bit harder.)I really do not know what more to say about this game... My final rating is 4/10...			"

												Shank is a 2D brawler. Shank tells the tale of a very angry man who was left for dead while his girlfriend was kidnapped.Shank has been wronged , and you set out on a quest to fix these injustices by slaying every person who dares to stand in your path. You job is to kill everyone involved until come to the man behind it all. Boss of bosses. This reminds me of movie Kill Bill.And so you fight, and fight, and do a bit of jumping, and fight some more.You're not chasing loot, or levelling up your character; you're merely slashing, shooting and chainsawing everything that gets between you and the right-hand side of the screen. Every few levels you're presented with a new weapon, and it's fun to see how a machete handles differently than a katana or see how things change when you switch from a pistol to a shotgun. The high point of the single-player adventure is the boss fights. These fights are all pattern based, and though they are fairly easy, they are still quite entertaining. Each boss has a specific weakness you must exploit, ranging from knocking one thug into a roaring fire to tricking a butcher into lassoing a hanging pig. Shank singleplayer mode is 3 hours long. Aside from the single-player campaign, there is a separate story mode to play through cooperatively. This is a prequel tale to the main event, and you are restricted to teaming up with your buddy locally as there's no online option here. Despite that combat is simplistic and repetitive I still did find this game entertaining.

												Shank is an unapologetically brutal game, and that's a point in its favor.  It is both an homage to classic grindhouse exploitation films and a throwback to old-school arcade beat-em-ups while succeeding on delivering a quality game without being a pile of style and references.  The ""easy"" mode is great for a first run through the game, as it leaves you with enough slack to experiment with the mechanics and develop a preferred play style while still requiring you to be good at the game, and the ""hard"" mode amps up the difficulty and removes mid-mission checkpoints, which in turn emphasizes efficiency and thinking ahead, with the same mechanics feeling natural when used in both modes.  The co-op campaign is fun as well, with thought put into the levels and bosses for two players.			"

												This game's been out for a while now, a sequel is even coming out soon. That said, it's not worth forgetting. The heavily styled art and fluid animation is a blast to look at, even when you know that you're just refighting the same enemies with more health later in the game. Thankfully, they also get smarter and better placed, although this isn't nearly as apparently until later in the game. Another interesting thing about this game are the bosses, the first few bosses require you to grapple at significant moments in their patterns. After the Butcher, all of the other bosses (minus two larger ones) will require you to have mastered the combat system. Considering that the game is difficult even on its easier of two difficulties, it's a good challenge.There are a few annoying moments involving some utterly cheap programming, but it's a good game all the same. If you're looking for a plot, look elsewhere, if you're looking to be a mexican badass...			"

												For all those, who have watched any single Tarantino, Rodriguez or other revenge-, italo-western- or b-movie and liked it: This game is so awesome; you have to play it...!Shank wants ""bloody"" revenge for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of his beloved girlfriend. You will guide him through a pulp, dirty, mexican-like nightmare. Everything is based in a ""italo western graphic art style"" that just KICKS ♥♥♥...The gameplay mingled Jump&Run-elements with a 2-D Side-View, a vast variety of guns and cool Combo- & finishing-moves: Bring destruction upon your enemies in the fast paced solo-mode or cooperative with a friend.The only sad thing about Shank is the short time for the first playthrough!Apart from that: Masterpiece!!!I will close this quick introduction with a quote from the game, which shows that the dialogues are equally good as the ones from Tarantino:Priest: ""I shall call you Lazarus"" - Shank answers: ""And I shall call you: ♥♥♥♥ed""			"

												Total play time: 3.3 Hours for single player.The game is basically Kill Bill. No really, that's it.Not bad for what it is, but it is fairly obvious that this is an XBLA port. As such, the game will give you a warning that it can not be fully enjoyed without a controller. It plays fine either with controller or with keyboard.Apparently there is more back story in Co-Op mode, but it only plays on Split-Screen, I had to give that a pass. Story lacks closure, and there are a couple parts that the game plays ""Gotcha!"" with, and basically forces you to die so you can reload the last checkpoint and avoid the hazard. Obviously not an option with Hard Mode, which gets rid of all checkpoints. Achivement unlocks don't add much, and weapon unlocks during game tend to be less than stellar. You'll settle on what weapon set you like fairly quickly. Would not buy as is, if steeply discounted (Say, around the 3-5 dollar level), might be worth a purchase  to kill a couple hours.			"

												This game is buggy, which is bad this far from release. When jumping and attacking at the same time, you will be frozen in the air at times. Sometimes this will fix, sometimes it won't. Besides that, it's... very base. The most basic of a beat-em-up game. It's easy to stunlock enemies by mashing light and heavy together. Get too many enemies, however, and it just turns into a ""How long can you keep everyone on the ground so you don't get ruthlessly murdered"". When going to fight Angelo, he fires many a rocket at you. You can avoid these, but only if you deciphered the controls and found out how to guard. You shouldn't have to go into the control menu to figure out how to play. And your how to play should tell you HOW TO PLAY. If you go straight into the game, icons will pop up that show an action such as the shank, or the main character taking a pose. The shank is easy enough, but how are you supposed to know what that second one means? Going back to the Angelo level, there are many times where the aiming of the rockets and when they fire are just absolute garbage. Swinging from a skull? Rocket to the face. Cannot avoid. Straight into the bottomless pit with you! The only other gripe I have with the game is its story. It is the same revenge story as ever, ripped straight from Kill Bill. Except, this time, it has uninteresting characters and cliche dialogue!Do not buy this game. Go home and be a family man.			"

												Shank reminds me a lot of the old Metal Slug games for NeoGeo. It has great visuals, an easy control scheme, cool weapons, and plenty of action. The vendetta storyline is overdone, but it works. While it's easy to slash away at enemies, some of the combos are tough to pull off and will have you working overtime to try and master what buttons to mash and when. Getting through the entire single player storyline takes a few hours, but I would like to give the co-op a try sometime. Definitely worth the price.			"

												Unapologetic, satisfying, side scrolling violent bloodbath.Everything is good about this title. From music and comic book aesthetic, through story, to the gameplay itself.Along with your trusty shanks you get a choice of a bigger melee weapon and a gun (you can switch them around), everything to further your goal of making bloody combos on them gang members.I don't believe myself how much fun I had with this game. Bit of a pity that coop backstory is local only. Also, hard mode has no checkpoints so yeah, no place for errors!			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Shank is the first game in the Shank franchise by Klei Entertainment, the wonderful people behind Mark of the Ninja. Shank and its sister sequel Shank 2 were developed before Mark of the Ninja and does not focus on straight stealth like Mark of the Ninja did, but full on action with the same art style and same bloody actionThe story basically shows us a guy named Shank who was tasked in killing his wife but was followed by some other gang members of Cesar where they kill his wife and leave him left for dead, this storyline made me say that it is something roughly around Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill volumes (which I highly recommend watching!)The game is exteremly short, homing in at around 3 hours. But it does have its good and bad sides. Bad, because it is extremly short but good because it does get repetitive after a while. Shank 2 apparently suffers with the same length problems homing in at around 4 hours long (checked via howlongtobeat.com), thankfully Shank does offer a New Game+ mode as well as a multiplayer campaign... but sadly, I don't have any friends to try it out :(The graphics are beautiful and made me remember playing Mark of the Ninja (I played Mark of the Ninja before Shank) as well as Disney cartoons, only Disney's cartoons are less bloody than Shank is. The animations are also really good, from the sword play to the gun fightingThe controls are very annoying on PC and it shows that Shank was originally developed for Xbox and then horribly ported onto the PC, it is impossible to play it on a keyboard, so much so that I had to plug in my controller to play it properly, and if you do happen to have a controller, I highly recommend playing with it as soon as you start. No wonder the game highly recommends playing with a controller when you boot up the game, it wasn't joking...The music and sound effects, are okay but nothing memorableYou will die, a lot, thankfully there is a fair checkpoint system in the game. The voice acting was okay but nothing special, it does suffer like Mark of the Ninja's voice acting, some good, some bad...I had fun playing Shank, even though it did have its fair share of problems here and there, but on the whole, it was a really good action game. Hopefully, its sequel would have ironed out most of the problems Shank had... hopefully... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												This game is terrible. There's no way around it. The controls are awkward, the story is so stupid a four year old could've written it, and the gameplay goes from dead baby easy to completely impossible with nothing in between every single level. And there's nothing rewarding about the challenging bits either. You don't feel like the game is hard and you managed to get through it, you feel like the game is just badly made and you're happy it's over.			"

												I played this one on the PS3 a while back, but I can definitely see myself playing it through again, even in hard mode. Why? Well, just because the cartoonish graphics are aesthetically appealing, as is the violence and variety of weapons Shank wields. The story keeps things moving along at a nice pace while the environments are varied enough to sustain interest until the final battle. A solid action platformer with good replay value!			"

												When his boss leaves him for dead, Shank must kill everyone who stands in his way to get revenge.  With his trusty chainsaw, pistols, and shank, he sets out on a bloody journey.This sidescrolling beat-em-up is exactly what fans of the genre expect.  Tight controls with numerous and varied weapons that have their own strengths and weaknesses, dozens of enemy types, beautiful comic-style graphics, and a storyline even Quentin Tarantino could appreciate make this a game to pay attention to.Shank’s bloodthirsty rampage will take him across about a half-dozen vaguely Latin-inspired stages, each with their own visual flair and memorable boss battles.  New weapons are gifted frequently, and you’ll enjoy learning how to string them together into absurdly long combo attacks against the seemingly never-ending waves of enemies.  Given the quality of the art and design, it isn’t too much of a negative to say this game is quite short: I beat the whole thing in under three hours.There is a co-op campaign that details the backstory of Shank’s initial betrayal and how he ended up in this mess in the first place.  Yes, a co-op campaign that is actually separate from the main story, but still impacts it!  More games should take that approach.  It is only available in local mode, so you’ll need a real life in-person friend to play it.The graphics are absolutely gorgeous.  Crisp, clean and excellently drawn characters make every boss fight memorable.  The waves and waves of enemies in between them also look good, and every single enemy is animated in their own unique way.  The music is likewise extremely well done, adding another welcome layer of drama to the mix.Klei Entertainment nailed it with this one.  I have a few minor quibbles with it, like the fact that some enemies attacks are telegraphed way too late for you to be able to react to them, but overall it is excellently made.  This is a great way to spend an afternoon or two, getting revenge for lost love by way of chainsaw and shotgun.			"

												Shank is a game where u just kill everyone but with a good gameplay and beutiful art. At some points it is hard and u can raise the difficulty from Normal to Hard (which provides u with a really good challenge). More or less it will take u 3 hours to finish the main story and it does have a multiplayer co-op.Lastly, it has not many but fun to gain achievments. I recomend it but if u want something to last long that game is not tha case but at sales u should nontheless buy it.			"

												If you are into Hack and slash games where you are a bloody tornado of comboing doom, then this is 100% you game!Combat is fast paced and making 1 wrong move at the wrong time can lead to a painfull blood death. Some people complain that Shank's combat is repetitive and gets old fast. I agree with that it is repetitive but that is the point.The game wants you to aim for the highest combo you can muster, what better way to do that than repetitive combat? To get that 300 hit combo you need to practice practice practice! That’s the only way you are going to get some satisfying and brutal moves. Combat is this game’s best asset followed immediately by its art style. Its animated comic book style is something to behold.  The animation quality is top notch and it will hook you in with the frequent cut scenes. Unfortunately, this is where the good points end.Bosses are uninteresting and follow an easy to see pattern. One you figure out how to dodge everything, bosses simply become bags of HP that take forever to die.The story serves only to push the character forward. A tale of revenge for Shank to use as an excuse to cut through hordes of Mexicans without a second thought. I will say though, without the story, the game wouldn’t be as enjoyable. The story allows for some graphic cut scenes that just make you even more blood thirsty! Which is a good thing.			"

												I'm going to be honest: I didn't expect to enjoy Shank.However, Shank is now one of my favorite games, and is a a game I recommend to any friend with a few spare bucks.Shank is a 2D sidescroller with wonderful comic-book style graphics, an amazingly satisfying combat system, and unique parkour mechanics.The combat system is stunning.You have three weapons at any given time: your heavy weapon, your gun, and your shanks. You can switch out each of these on the fly (there are 4 heavy weapons and 3 guns), though they have to be unlocked progressively. The game gives you new weapons seemingly the MOMENT you get used to the previous ones. Combat is ridiculously fast paced: the game constantly throws enemies at you, and you have to block, pounce, shoot, stab, and slice through your opponents at light-speed.Movement is equally well done: you can run up (nearly) any wall by climbing with your shanks, you can swing off of lamp posts and other hanging objects, you can slide down inclines, and other parkour game staples. Seeing this in a 2D space may seem like a horrible idea, but trust me, it's great.The story is kind of cliche, but it's seriously unpredictable. You really don't understand what's going on until halfway through the game, as the backstory is slowly revealed through flashbacks, and the final flashback isn't until the final stage of the final boss of the final level.In short: it's a Mexican drug cartel action-romance-tragedy-mystery.Shank also includes a separate local co-op campaign and controller support (in fact, the game works better on a controller.)If you have 10 dollars to spare, or want to play a 2D game, or just want a hell of a good time, pick up Shank.

												This game's been out for a while now, a sequel is even coming out soon. That said, it's not worth forgetting. The heavily styled art and fluid animation is a blast to look at, even when you know that you're just refighting the same enemies with more health later in the game. Thankfully, they also get smarter and better placed, although this isn't nearly as apparently until later in the game. Another interesting thing about this game are the bosses, the first few bosses require you to grapple at significant moments in their patterns. After the Butcher, all of the other bosses (minus two larger ones) will require you to have mastered the combat system. Considering that the game is difficult even on its easier of two difficulties, it's a good challenge.There are a few annoying moments involving some utterly cheap programming, but it's a good game all the same. If you're looking for a plot, look elsewhere, if you're looking to be a mexican badass...			"

I loved platform shoot em ups (Flashback, empire strikes back, judge dredd and Alien 3 being some of the classics)and this chucks into the genre loads of gore, quality weapons and gnarley hand to hand combat.  The bosses are hardcore and the character movement and jumping is tasty.  I am a big fan of the flash graphics.  It might be a little short lived for some.			"

												There are two bad things about Steam version of Shank:1. Controls are not perfect. This is not a big problem. Controls work good with Xbox controller, but it could be better.2. Lot of cutscenes material is missing for no apparent reason.If you go past that, Shank is really fun action game. Nice graphics, lots of blood and guts, 2D brawler made for modern age. You go right, jump, hack, shout and punch hordes of enemies. There is 20 single player levels for about 4-6 hours of gameplay and 2 player local co-op (2 controllers) for another 3-5 hours. It is a bit short but it is long enough not to become repetitive in a bad way. So I recommend it for a nice and violent weekend.			"

												For all those, who have watched any single Tarantino, Rodriguez or other revenge-, italo-western- or b-movie and liked it: This game is so awesome; you have to play it...!Shank wants ""bloody"" revenge for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of his beloved girlfriend. You will guide him through a pulp, dirty, mexican-like nightmare. Everything is based in a ""italo western graphic art style"" that just KICKS ♥♥♥...The gameplay mingled Jump&Run-elements with a 2-D Side-View, a vast variety of guns and cool Combo- & finishing-moves: Bring destruction upon your enemies in the fast paced solo-mode or cooperative with a friend.The only sad thing about Shank is the short time for the first playthrough!Apart from that: Masterpiece!!!I will close this quick introduction with a quote from the game, which shows that the dialogues are equally good as the ones from Tarantino:Priest: ""I shall call you Lazarus"" - Shank answers: ""And I shall call you: ♥♥♥♥ed""			"

As such, the game will give you a warning that it can not be fully enjoyed without a controller. It plays fine either with controller or with keyboard.Apparently there is more back story in Co-Op mode, but it only plays on Split-Screen, I had to give that a pass. Story lacks closure, and there are a couple parts that the game plays ""Gotcha!"" with, and basically forces you to die so you can reload the last checkpoint and avoid the hazard. Obviously not an option with Hard Mode, which gets rid of all checkpoints. Achivement unlocks don't add much, and weapon unlocks during game tend to be less than stellar. You'll settle on what weapon set you like fairly quickly. Would not buy as is, if steeply discounted (Say, around the 3-5 dollar level), might be worth a purchase  to kill a couple hours.			"

												Shank was such a welcome addition to my game collection that I almost forgot how fun it was to play platformers, 2D-side scrollers, those Sega days.. Shank deals with the gritty and revenge-packed story of betrayal between a bodyguard called Shank and Crime Lord, Cesar. What bond was forged in the duty of trust of safety and duty to each other, it had to be broken one day in typical underworld fashion. Yet, that is when it hit close to Shank... Shank doesn't necessarily start off on a journey to find answers as much as finding every goon and thug related to the Cesar and stab, slice, decaptitate, and most notably what he does best, ... shank each one of them. In a 2D side-scrolling style, you have one of the most action-packed Indie games over here. The story is interesting enough and the stages are superbly animated, and the gameplay ... oh, those combos! Go wild and test yourself at Hard mode and see if you still think you got that platformer mastery.This isn't your average Sonic, Mega Man, or Mario platform game.. no, this is Shank!			"

												Shank.  Fairly standard beat-em-up.  I used an Xbox-style controller for this game.  Played it on hard.Pros:+ Controls are tight and responsive. There's a nice synergy with the light, heavy and ranged attacks and it makes performing combos fun and not a memorization game.+ Decently challenging.  I died a lot, mostly on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platforming parts but still.+ Graphics in-game look pretty damn slick.  Very smooth in motion, and the animation work is very well done.Cons:- The cutscenes look like babby's first flash animation.  How do the cutscenes look so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the game itself looks so nice?- Game is incredibly short.  After beating the game on hard, it told me that I spent 4:16 on the campaign.  This takes dying and replaying the levels from the beginning into consideration.- Bosses are a joke, mostly because they each have some kind of gimmick you have to exploit.  The only boss I had trouble with, oddly, was Cassandra.- The platforming sections, holy ♥♥♥♥.  They're basically a reflex test and usually show up in the later half of a level.  If you miss a jump or preemptively jump too soon, you die.  On hard mode, that means you go to the beginning of the level.- Nothing to do after you beat the game.  I understand the sequel adds some ♥♥♥♥ like a survival mode, but there's nothing for #1.Honestly, I give it a 6/10.  It felt like it would have gotten repetitive very quickly if not for the incredibly short campaign length.    Still, it was pretty fun for what it's worth.If you like brawlers and beat-em-ups, I'd say pick it up if it goes on sale for $5 or less.  Personally, I don't think it's worth the full $10 price tag.			"

												Shank offers a stylized beat 'em up that has a strong delivery. Shank is the name of the protagonist who vies for revenge who uses his trusty shank along with heavy melee and firearms.The gameplay is a typical beat 'em up with depth in controls, ranging from various grabs and a slew of move and combo possibilities. Shank has well made animation. Set in a Western theme, the backgrounds reflect typical senarios with grit. Characters are wonderfully animated and have varying designs. The boses at the end of a section are huge and massive or proportional to Shank depending on the strategy used. Cutscenes use the animation style and in some parts, small panels show scenes while in fighting. The music ranges from Western background music to a fuller movie-like score. The game is a bit short, I clocked in at almost 3 hours and the fighting could get repetitive. One warning though, the game is a bit bloody and gory. The game is best used with a gamepad, and I used my Xbox 360 controller.			"

I had fun with it despite the brutal (but nothing compared to its sequel) level of challenge on Hard.

												First of all - make sure that in the game tab, you select ""Beta -> ""Classic version"" to get the over-the-top Shank Violence. Now, this is a very short game - its something like back in the old days you would slot the game into the console and replay it without saving from begining to end in a burst. The amount of attacks and different ways to kill enemies is fantastic to say the least, but the replayability of this title is kinda... well, low.Still, the game is fantastic. If you ever see this on a sale - this is a must-have for Brawler Game fans. The amount of violence Shank deals out to take revenge on the bad guys is insane and Klei Entertainment was pulling no punches here - its very cool.Oh yeah - DEFINITELLY NOT FOR CHILDREN. If you are a parent and considering this game for your child - DON'T. Its insanely violent. But its such a blast to play....			"

												I just couldn't stop when I started playing, this game is so much fun. The music is kickass, the story was good but the coop ending (Yes, coop and single player are two different stories) could have been better, everything is so well drawn, but there's also some glitches (what game doesn't have it), that may screw you up one or two times and some small unfair moments that unfortunaly will frustate you a little (alot in hard mode), but overall the gameplay is very exciting and the music combine very well with the stages making the game a huge experience. If you think the game was boring, easy and repetitive you can try the hard mode that not just make it harder but unfair, you'll take a ton of damage for little hits and the damage you cause will be halved and there will be no checkpoints, but the great winning sensation after finishing the whole game sure make you feel better after all that time spend in your computer. For me shank gets a 8/10. [Yes, my English is terrible] "

												Side-scrolling hack and slash action.  It's a faster paced Double Dragon/Final Fight, but a tad easier.  It's quite a bit like the love-child of old-age side scrolling beat'em ups like the two previously mentioned games married with the hack n' slash carnage of modern action games like God of War with the pacing of a slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic the Hedgehog.  The art style is nice to look at, and is refreshing if you spend most of your time in realistic/ultra-realistic games.  The game's pacing leaves little time to enjoy much of it.  A down-side is that the game is very combo/timing intensive, and it doesn't really care much for you using your mouse.  Mouse + Keyboard gamers might find a hard time playing this game.  I had to dust off my Razer Naga(the one with the 12 buttons on the side) to feel comfortable playing the game.  If you own a controller outside of your keyboard and mouse, definitely use it here.  The game is also short, and can be finished in an afternoon of gaming.			"

												This game should've been a shoo-in for a recommendation. A classic side-scrolling beat 'em up with a graphic novel feel set in the Mexican underworld featuring machetes, chainsaws and epic wrestlers? What could go wrong?Firstly, the good. The game is pretty gorgeous, nicely stylised backdrops and beautiful graphics generally. Over-the-top gory action is par for the course, with you cutting through legions of troops with guns, blades and grenades. Whilst the game warns that it plays better with a gamepad, it's still perfectly playable on a keyboard, with enough move combinations and enemies to keep the game interesting. There's even a passable storyline!Yet something went awry with the game testing. There are only two difficulty modes. The easier one is so straightforward that the game only lasts just over an hour. Although the learning curve is pretty well planned, there aren't many tricky sections, the boss fights feel like choreographed cutscenes, and you're more likely to die from learning where the pitfalls are or being hit by a random projectile. You'd think the hard mode would fix these issues, making the game more challenging, but whilst the bad guys have indeed been beefed up and the fights become much more tense as a result, more importantly each level has to be completed without checkpoints! Since some of the levels are over 10 minutes long (one even includes a mini-boss fight halfway through), there's just oodles of frustration waiting to be had here attempting the missions over and over, only to fall down a hole you didn't even know was there after 10 minutes of playing and have to restart.Overall a decent little game for the price, especially if you can pick it up on offer. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay entertaining, and there's even a little local co-op which I haven't yet tried. But the fact that this game only comes with game modes for children and masochists and nothing in between makes it difficult to give more than a borderline recommendation.			"

												This game's been out for a while now, a sequel is even coming out soon. That said, it's not worth forgetting. The heavily styled art and fluid animation is a blast to look at, even when you know that you're just refighting the same enemies with more health later in the game. Thankfully, they also get smarter and better placed, although this isn't nearly as apparently until later in the game. Another interesting thing about this game are the bosses, the first few bosses require you to grapple at significant moments in their patterns. After the Butcher, all of the other bosses (minus two larger ones) will require you to have mastered the combat system. Considering that the game is difficult even on its easier of two difficulties, it's a good challenge.There are a few annoying moments involving some utterly cheap programming, but it's a good game all the same. If you're looking for a plot, look elsewhere, if you're looking to be a mexican badass...			"

I loved platform shoot em ups (Flashback, empire strikes back, judge dredd and Alien 3 being some of the classics)and this chucks into the genre loads of gore, quality weapons and gnarley hand to hand combat.

												shank is an intresting game great cartoon themed sideways scolling shooter/hack n slasher story and while you have no option in the settings to change the keyboard layout it does inform the gamer at the start that this game that this is best played on game controller. Personally i found the keyboard layout just about ok to work with. graphically it is fine and the range of moves quite amusing in part and with platform elements thrown in with many jumps and running aspects mixes things up. boss fights are varied in difficulty and how well you adapt to the keyboard layout will determine your outcome. I bought this in a sale for £1.99 and if you do not own it this is a great price to pay for it. made it so far on normal difficulty to what i see as close to the end hope to complete soon.			"

												The concept is cool, but this Final Fight style platformer needed some serious work.  The fighting is ok, but the basic mechanics keep you from ever getting to a point of real fluency because they're so clumsy.  There are constantly situations that arise (especially on hard mode) where you really can't do anything but get steamrolled by seven guys from all directions.  I appreciate a challenge, but this game is stupidly hard for all the wrong reasons.  That said, the combos and weapons were cool.  I hope the sequel is better.

However, this game is worth every penny of its full asking price and more.The music, visuals, and gameplay combined in this, result in nothing less than a work of art. The story is simple yet effective, the combat is smooth and super fun to play with and the local coop mode is a blast. Burn through Shank's main story in single player on one of two difficulties, or grab a bro and play through the full length prequel in coop. Either way, if you like beatemups you'll love this.			"

												Shank is an unapologetically brutal game, and that's a point in its favor.  It is both an homage to classic grindhouse exploitation films and a throwback to old-school arcade beat-em-ups while succeeding on delivering a quality game without being a pile of style and references.  The ""easy"" mode is great for a first run through the game, as it leaves you with enough slack to experiment with the mechanics and develop a preferred play style while still requiring you to be good at the game, and the ""hard"" mode amps up the difficulty and removes mid-mission checkpoints, which in turn emphasizes efficiency and thinking ahead, with the same mechanics feeling natural when used in both modes.  The co-op campaign is fun as well, with thought put into the levels and bosses for two players.			"

												Shank reminds me a lot of the old Metal Slug games for NeoGeo. It has great visuals, an easy control scheme, cool weapons, and plenty of action. The vendetta storyline is overdone, but it works. While it's easy to slash away at enemies, some of the combos are tough to pull off and will have you working overtime to try and master what buttons to mash and when. Getting through the entire single player storyline takes a few hours, but I would like to give the co-op a try sometime. Definitely worth the price.			"

												Solid 2D side-scrolling beat 'em up game. Solid visuals for the style of game, but the best part of the game is definitely the combat. It's mainly a hack n slash with melee, ranged and acrobatic type attacks. You basically have a fast attack, slower heavier attack and a ranged attack and you can weave them all together for better combos. The combat is mainly very fluid and responsive majority of the time, but occasionally I've noticed it not respond properly to my attacks or dodges, but it doesn't happen all that frequently.There's a few cutscenes as well to explain the story, but it's not super in depth as you'd expect, but obviously this game is more about the combat than anything else. I've seen other people claim the game is too short, and while I agree, I believe it has a solid length for the genre and especially the price.Overall a very solid title if you're into beat 'em ups!

												A very cool modern take on the sidescrolling beat-em-up genre.  Flawless controls and a cool art style make for a really enjoyable experience.  My only major gripe with it is that they seem to have cheaped out a little on the blood/gore.  It plays itself off as a pretty Rambo-esque kind of theme, then in actual gameplay there are a few spurts, but nothing past that.  A small complaint though for an otherwise great game.

												SHANK! Shank shank shank!  Whenever I see this game I think of Borderlands and Moxxi's second husband and leader of the prison gang.  I suppose it's not a terribly bad thing that a game makes you think of a better one.  This game is not bad by any means.  I really enjoyed this game and once I snag my wireless controller from work, I'm gonna play co-op with my wife.  The game pays homage to the Double Dragon/Streets of Rage style of gameplay, but ramps it up a notch to awesome.  This a solid beat-em-up with a variety of weapons at your disposal.  The fighting, after you beat the game, almost takes on a zen-like quality as you mash 'n slash your way through to the the final showdown with Cesar.  Graphics are hand-drawn style animations that are sharp, crisp, and fluid.  The game is fun to watch and even gives picture-in-picture style display to peek in on the action somewhere else.  The music is appropriate for the mood and will push along the story in a poignant but not overbearing way.  My only real complaints come in the controls department.  I find the handling to be a bit sticky, not as accurate as I would expect from the genre, especially with the wide range of moves at your disposal.  For example I would pounce on a person and start beating the hell out of them and while I'm on top of them I will either aim left or right and shoot to take out others nearby, but I have to be extra deliberate with the button presses for him not to shoot in the wrong direction.  The same could be said for dodging, juggling, and shooting up or down.  I hear they totally revamped the controls for the second and that fact alone is enough to drive me to play the sequel. I managed to beat the game in under four hours, but with the achievements, modes and unlockables, you could easily spend a whole weekend with the game and get your money's worth.			"

												Shank.  Fairly standard beat-em-up.  I used an Xbox-style controller for this game.  Played it on hard.Pros:+ Controls are tight and responsive. There's a nice synergy with the light, heavy and ranged attacks and it makes performing combos fun and not a memorization game.+ Decently challenging.  I died a lot, mostly on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ platforming parts but still.+ Graphics in-game look pretty damn slick.  Very smooth in motion, and the animation work is very well done.Cons:- The cutscenes look like babby's first flash animation.  How do the cutscenes look so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when the game itself looks so nice?- Game is incredibly short.  After beating the game on hard, it told me that I spent 4:16 on the campaign.  This takes dying and replaying the levels from the beginning into consideration.- Bosses are a joke, mostly because they each have some kind of gimmick you have to exploit.  The only boss I had trouble with, oddly, was Cassandra.- The platforming sections, holy ♥♥♥♥.  They're basically a reflex test and usually show up in the later half of a level.  If you miss a jump or preemptively jump too soon, you die.  On hard mode, that means you go to the beginning of the level.- Nothing to do after you beat the game.  I understand the sequel adds some ♥♥♥♥ like a survival mode, but there's nothing for #1.Honestly, I give it a 6/10.  It felt like it would have gotten repetitive very quickly if not for the incredibly short campaign length.    Still, it was pretty fun for what it's worth.If you like brawlers and beat-em-ups, I'd say pick it up if it goes on sale for $5 or less.  Personally, I don't think it's worth the full $10 price tag.			"

												This game is terrible. There's no way around it. The controls are awkward, the story is so stupid a four year old could've written it, and the gameplay goes from dead baby easy to completely impossible with nothing in between every single level. And there's nothing rewarding about the challenging bits either. You don't feel like the game is hard and you managed to get through it, you feel like the game is just badly made and you're happy it's over.			"

Not impressive at allFrustrating combat with enemies either dodging all of the time or stacking on top of you with timed attacks, while you are still doing your execution just to get hit right after and lose half of your health pool.  There are no combos in this game, either use your pre set knifes for fast attacks, heavy weapon for slightly more powerful ones or a ranged gun. There is a certain variety in weaponry, yet you end up using knife, chainsaw & shotgun that you get early in the game. Why? They are the best. Boss battles, well they are like puzzles. Try a first time, figure out what you should be doing. Keep repeating the frocess to kill the boss. Meh.Story, well... There is nothing to it. Mindless 2D action game. With more than frustrating levels on ""hard"" difficulty that have no checkpoints what so ever. If you die by a stupid controls or in game climbing glitch, you end up replaying the past 10minutes of level just to most likely end up dead once more. Oh and let's not forget random level where the boss is shooting a bazooka half level through. You'll end up dead more than you think. Which will either lead you to uninstalling the game and forgetting it even exists, or finishing it on ""normal"" and doing the same as mentioned before.Voice acting, poor at it's best.I'v heard many complains about keyboard & mouse controls in this game. But it is to be expected, since the game recommends using a controller. But is it really that better with a controller? Slightly yes, but still clunky and annoying.Get this if you have time to waste and nothing better to play. Also be aware of EA being a publisher.Verdict: One of the worst Klei Entertainment games. Review coming from someone who finished one of their most recent games ""Mark of the Ninja"" on a 100% (achievements included) with 20hours playtime. Now that was a gem!			"

												I previously made a review of this game. It was a short one, just saying that it was a pretty good spectacle-fighter side-scroller and that if you liked the genre, you should get it.I'm going back to this review because not only do I recommend it, but I've only just recently went back and realized how much of a masterpiece of a game this is.There were a lot of concepts I didn't really get a hang of during my first playthough, and as such I was less enthusiastic about the game because getting though the game without really using the dodge-cancels (or rather, dodging in general) really takes the experience away.Now that I have gone back and I'm able to do totally crazy ♥♥♥♥ like 100-hit combos (which is the most fun thing I've done in a while), I actually feel like I'm playing a 2D god hand, and that in itself is a huge complement. It flows so well, able to connect combos in a perfect and seemless way. Not only does it look fantastic when you gun-juggle someone, it also feels amazing. And that in itself is a hard thing to fully grasp and achieve in a video game.It's just pure fun!			"

												This game should've been a shoo-in for a recommendation. A classic side-scrolling beat 'em up with a graphic novel feel set in the Mexican underworld featuring machetes, chainsaws and epic wrestlers? What could go wrong?Firstly, the good. The game is pretty gorgeous, nicely stylised backdrops and beautiful graphics generally. Over-the-top gory action is par for the course, with you cutting through legions of troops with guns, blades and grenades. Whilst the game warns that it plays better with a gamepad, it's still perfectly playable on a keyboard, with enough move combinations and enemies to keep the game interesting. There's even a passable storyline!Yet something went awry with the game testing. There are only two difficulty modes. The easier one is so straightforward that the game only lasts just over an hour. Although the learning curve is pretty well planned, there aren't many tricky sections, the boss fights feel like choreographed cutscenes, and you're more likely to die from learning where the pitfalls are or being hit by a random projectile. You'd think the hard mode would fix these issues, making the game more challenging, but whilst the bad guys have indeed been beefed up and the fights become much more tense as a result, more importantly each level has to be completed without checkpoints! Since some of the levels are over 10 minutes long (one even includes a mini-boss fight halfway through), there's just oodles of frustration waiting to be had here attempting the missions over and over, only to fall down a hole you didn't even know was there after 10 minutes of playing and have to restart.Overall a decent little game for the price, especially if you can pick it up on offer. The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay entertaining, and there's even a little local co-op which I haven't yet tried. But the fact that this game only comes with game modes for children and masochists and nothing in between makes it difficult to give more than a borderline recommendation.			"

However, this game is worth every penny of its full asking price and more.The music, visuals, and gameplay combined in this, result in nothing less than a work of art. The story is simple yet effective, the combat is smooth and super fun to play with and the local coop mode is a blast. Burn through Shank's main story in single player on one of two difficulties, or grab a bro and play through the full length prequel in coop. Either way, if you like beatemups you'll love this.			"

												If you are into Hack and slash games where you are a bloody tornado of comboing doom, then this is 100% you game!Combat is fast paced and making 1 wrong move at the wrong time can lead to a painfull blood death. Some people complain that Shank's combat is repetitive and gets old fast. I agree with that it is repetitive but that is the point.The game wants you to aim for the highest combo you can muster, what better way to do that than repetitive combat? To get that 300 hit combo you need to practice practice practice! That’s the only way you are going to get some satisfying and brutal moves. Combat is this game’s best asset followed immediately by its art style. Its animated comic book style is something to behold.  The animation quality is top notch and it will hook you in with the frequent cut scenes. Unfortunately, this is where the good points end.Bosses are uninteresting and follow an easy to see pattern. One you figure out how to dodge everything, bosses simply become bags of HP that take forever to die.The story serves only to push the character forward. A tale of revenge for Shank to use as an excuse to cut through hordes of Mexicans without a second thought. I will say though, without the story, the game wouldn’t be as enjoyable. The story allows for some graphic cut scenes that just make you even more blood thirsty! Which is a good thing.			"

												Shank is an unapologetically brutal game, and that's a point in its favor.  It is both an homage to classic grindhouse exploitation films and a throwback to old-school arcade beat-em-ups while succeeding on delivering a quality game without being a pile of style and references.  The ""easy"" mode is great for a first run through the game, as it leaves you with enough slack to experiment with the mechanics and develop a preferred play style while still requiring you to be good at the game, and the ""hard"" mode amps up the difficulty and removes mid-mission checkpoints, which in turn emphasizes efficiency and thinking ahead, with the same mechanics feeling natural when used in both modes.  The co-op campaign is fun as well, with thought put into the levels and bosses for two players.			"

												Side-scrolling hack and slash action.  It's a faster paced Double Dragon/Final Fight, but a tad easier.  It's quite a bit like the love-child of old-age side scrolling beat'em ups like the two previously mentioned games married with the hack n' slash carnage of modern action games like God of War with the pacing of a slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sonic the Hedgehog.  The art style is nice to look at, and is refreshing if you spend most of your time in realistic/ultra-realistic games.  The game's pacing leaves little time to enjoy much of it.  A down-side is that the game is very combo/timing intensive, and it doesn't really care much for you using your mouse.  Mouse + Keyboard gamers might find a hard time playing this game.  I had to dust off my Razer Naga(the one with the 12 buttons on the side) to feel comfortable playing the game.  If you own a controller outside of your keyboard and mouse, definitely use it here.  The game is also short, and can be finished in an afternoon of gaming.			"

												Shank offers a stylized beat 'em up that has a strong delivery. Shank is the name of the protagonist who vies for revenge who uses his trusty shank along with heavy melee and firearms.The gameplay is a typical beat 'em up with depth in controls, ranging from various grabs and a slew of move and combo possibilities. Shank has well made animation. Set in a Western theme, the backgrounds reflect typical senarios with grit. Characters are wonderfully animated and have varying designs. The boses at the end of a section are huge and massive or proportional to Shank depending on the strategy used. Cutscenes use the animation style and in some parts, small panels show scenes while in fighting. The music ranges from Western background music to a fuller movie-like score. The game is a bit short, I clocked in at almost 3 hours and the fighting could get repetitive. One warning though, the game is a bit bloody and gory. The game is best used with a gamepad, and I used my Xbox 360 controller.			"

												When his boss leaves him for dead, Shank must kill everyone who stands in his way to get revenge.  With his trusty chainsaw, pistols, and shank, he sets out on a bloody journey.This sidescrolling beat-em-up is exactly what fans of the genre expect.  Tight controls with numerous and varied weapons that have their own strengths and weaknesses, dozens of enemy types, beautiful comic-style graphics, and a storyline even Quentin Tarantino could appreciate make this a game to pay attention to.Shank’s bloodthirsty rampage will take him across about a half-dozen vaguely Latin-inspired stages, each with their own visual flair and memorable boss battles.  New weapons are gifted frequently, and you’ll enjoy learning how to string them together into absurdly long combo attacks against the seemingly never-ending waves of enemies.  Given the quality of the art and design, it isn’t too much of a negative to say this game is quite short: I beat the whole thing in under three hours.There is a co-op campaign that details the backstory of Shank’s initial betrayal and how he ended up in this mess in the first place.  Yes, a co-op campaign that is actually separate from the main story, but still impacts it!  More games should take that approach.  It is only available in local mode, so you’ll need a real life in-person friend to play it.The graphics are absolutely gorgeous.  Crisp, clean and excellently drawn characters make every boss fight memorable.  The waves and waves of enemies in between them also look good, and every single enemy is animated in their own unique way.  The music is likewise extremely well done, adding another welcome layer of drama to the mix.Klei Entertainment nailed it with this one.  I have a few minor quibbles with it, like the fact that some enemies attacks are telegraphed way too late for you to be able to react to them, but overall it is excellently made.  This is a great way to spend an afternoon or two, getting revenge for lost love by way of chainsaw and shotgun.			"

												Shank is a 2D Sidescrolling beat-em-up. You have a small arsenal on hand that you use to dispatch your enemies in brutal bloody fast paced combat. Its fun and its got a tacky but well done story. A revenge flick style beat em up. Klei even in their earlier days were a force to be reckoned with. Play this game, especially if it goes on sale, because it will be super cheap!			"

												Shank is a game where u just kill everyone but with a good gameplay and beutiful art. At some points it is hard and u can raise the difficulty from Normal to Hard (which provides u with a really good challenge). More or less it will take u 3 hours to finish the main story and it does have a multiplayer co-op.Lastly, it has not many but fun to gain achievments. I recomend it but if u want something to last long that game is not tha case but at sales u should nontheless buy it.			"

												A fun hack and slash and a good play. Highly reccomend using a controller for this one though, playing it well with a keyboard is a nightmare.			"
