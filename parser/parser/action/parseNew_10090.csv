												Once upon a time, Call of Duty was a legit, epic, ww2 shooter.There was a time where snipers camped and didn't run around quick scoping. There was a time where submachine gunners ran around and didn't camp in corners.There was a time where thermal scopes didn't exist and smokes actually did someting.There was a time where tanks roamed the battlefield and dominated over everyone.There was a time where 2-3 bullets actually killed you instead of 10-12.There was a time where shotguns weren't OP.There was a time where 12 year olds didn't sleep with your mom.There was a time where squeakers didn't dominate over people.There was a time where trolls didn't anger over-sensitive people.All in a place called Call of Duty: World at War			"

												When I was 10 years old I remember my dad getting me this game for Christmas. I remember playing the campaign and enjoying it and being scared by the zombie mode that was unlocked upon finishing the game. During this time I didn't have internet so I couldn't play online. Due to this I always played with my dad. I believe that lasted for a couple months and I begged my dad to get the internet set up so I could play with other people. Call of Duty: World at War was my first online game and it was a great experience. Campaign:- I would say the campaign in this game is fairly average, but one of the best Call of Duty campaigns.- You can play all, but two missions cooperatively.Multiplayer:- Personally, I thought this game had the best multiplayer out of all the Call of Duty games. I loved playing Hardcore          Headquarters, Hardcore Search and Destroy, and War.- Unfortunetly, this games feels basically dead these days and I don't really see a reason to play it.- On PC there is a problem where you get kicked from games for no reason by Punk Buster.Zombies:- This game comes with four fun zombie maps upon purchase.- There are loads and loads of custom maps to play- Four player coop.I honestly can't think of any negative things to say about this game. If you're looking for a game to play custom zombie maps this is the game for you!			"

Call of Duty: World at War 
A Screenshot of Call of Duty: World at War
By: รкг๏๏ℓ๏๏รε




Its fun, fast, and arcadie. In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=358229015and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other ""Call of Duty"" game. Multiplayer is still alive and active. The servers are very fun to play in and have a lot of active players on them. WaW's multiplayer is very fun and solid. It may have a couple of cheap moments like any other COD has. But it is still very enjoyable and can keep you entertained for a couple of hours.As always I leave the best for last. Zombies! Call of Duty: World at War's zombie mode is one of the best co-op experiences I have ever had. Its fun, gameplay is solid, theres a story, and it will give you and your friends hours upon hours of entertainment. The game comes with 4 solid maps to play on. Natch Der Untoten, Verruckt, Shi No Numa, and Der Riese. These maps offer great variety and are very fun to play in. Zombies is the biggest and most alive part of this game. With a community that has created thousands upon thousands of custom zombie maps that one can enjoy. Many map makers like ZCT and TMG provide high quality maps that can be compared to Treyarch's best. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=359152137You still reading eh? Go and buy this game NOW! Yeah thats right, NOW! This is a game everyone should have in their libraries as it offers many hours of entertainment.			"

												When Infinity Ward released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare back in 2007, the developer was met with critical acclaim and praise for breaking away from the World War II setting that had started to bog down the once revolutionary series. That made Treyarch's decision to bring the fifth installment back to the historical time period that much more confusing - why mess with success? Well, Call of Duty: World at War returns to the series' roots, and is a good reminder of why World War II games became so popular in the first place - the tone is gritty, the pace is frantic, and the action is visceral.World at War's story is split between two very different fronts - the ferocious jungle campaign of the Pacific theatre, and the retaliatory invasion of the Russians on the Eastern front. That's right - no pesky Normandy invasions this time around! In the Pacific, you take on the role of Private Miller of the United States Marine Corps, and take part in the island hopping campaign towards Okinawa. On the Eastern Front, you play as Private Dimitri Petrenko, and are tasked with pushing the Nazis out of Russia and marching into Berlin. The campaign is paced exceptionally well so that after a few missions of fighting as Miller in the Pacific, you'll switch over to play as Dimitri in Eastern Europe. This stops the campaign from becoming stale, keeping it fresh and exciting.Perhaps the best part of the campaign is the sheer amount of variety found in the missions. The first mission as Private Petrenko, for example, comes straight out of the movie Enemy at the Gates. Narrowly surviving a massacre in Nazi controlled Stalingrad, you and an injured comrade have to make your way through the enemy filled streets armed with only a sniper rifle in order to assassinate the German General. In addition to sniper duels, you'll also have to burn out enemy fortifications during the campaign, as well as command a tank through enemy infested Germany.One of the most memorable missions has you playing as neither Miller nor Petrenko, but Petty Officer Locke, a gunner for a PBY Catalina flying boat. In addition to shooting down Japanese patrol boats, merchant ships, and fighter planes, you'll have to try and rescue American sailors stranded in the sea after their fleet is decimated by a squadron of kamikaze fighters. The mission is really unique, and the intensity ramps up significantly as more Japanese planes show up, and ammo starts becoming scarce. The first person views of the plane's interior as well as the exceptional dialogue make this mission much more than a standard rail shooting experience.Although it is overall an invigorating experience, the campaign does have a few faults - most notably, some annoying glitches. For example, in order to finish one mission, you have to regroup with your squad. The mission won't end, however, until you backtrack half way through the level and unstick one of your AI buddies with a grenade - something that obviously shouldn't make into the finished product. There are a few other minor glitches as well, such as the little grenade symbol by your feet sometimes staying on screen long after its explosion, but these usually don't have an effect on the gameplay, and are thus easily ignorable.As great as the campaign is alone, it's even greater with a few friends. World at War allows you to play through the entire campaign with up to three friends, and you can even turn on competitive scoring, much like in Halo 3, to add a new layer of depth when playing with friends. The other co-operative mode in World at War is the ever-addictive Nazi Zombies. With a few friends, you get to fight off a never-ending horde of Nazi Zombies, starting off with just a pistol. As the game continues, and the waves get progressively harder and harder, new guns are available to purchase. It's hectic and crazy, and although no Left 4 Dead, it is a heck of a lot of fun. If Nazi Zombies isn't your thing, then you might find World at War's multiplayer more enjoyable. Treyarch took the super addictive multiplayer system from Modern Warfare, and it still is great. Classes, perks, prestige classes - it's all here. Of course, some of the technology present in Call of Duty 4 wasn't around back in the 1940's, so Treyarch did have to make a few, slight changes. For example, instead of being able to call in Helicopters after getting a killing streak, you can bring in attack dogs to attack your foes, or call in artillery strikes to bombard enemy positions. The essentials are all the same however. You get experience points for killing enemies and winning matches, which can be used to unlock new, powerful guns, weapon accessories and armor, and better perks. The prestige class returns as well, allowing you to return to level 1 after reaching the maximum level. You can do this up to 10 times, so if you are dedicated in getting to the top, be prepared to put a lot of hours in World at War. The graphics in World at War are stunning, with dazzling explosions lighting up the screen and individual character models looking impressively detailed, especially up close, such as when a Banzai soldier jumps on you with a bayonet in your face. The animations are spectacular as well, with no two soldiers dying the same way. You can even blow off individual body parts off with certain weapons, like the shotgun, which is of course extremely satisfying. The game's audio also stands up extremely well. The game features big name voice talent such as Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman, and the soundtrack is immersive and fitting. The guns sound realistic and appropriately powerful - you can even hear the sounds of sizzling flesh after burning enemies with the flamethrower. If that sound doesn't draw you into the war, I'm not sure if anything will.In the end, Call of Duty: World at War is a bit of an odd duck. It combines the new, successful multiplayer system of Modern Warfare with the old, familiar setting of World War II. Though WWII games are a dime a dozen, Call of Duty is still at the top for a reason. The campaign is varied and exciting, and can be played with up to three friends. The multiplayer is deep and addictive, and the new Nazi Zombie mode is surprisingly entertaining. The only major obstacle to enjoying this game for some is probably the setting. If you're absolutely sick of World War II, then you might end up forcing yourself not to enjoy this game. However, if you're a fan of first person shooters in the least, then World at War will provide an enthralling experience.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is by far one of the best FPS co-op games on steam. Why? Not only does it have an entertaining fast paced still active multiplayer and an extremely involved campaign, but World at War also comes with modding capabilities. Many WaW fans agree, one of the best parts of Call of Duty is its zombies! Within the zombie mode, modders and mappers have introduced custom zombies maps for you to download online. This way you aren't stuck playing the same 4 zombie maps. There are hundreds of custom maps featuring customized weapons, camos, perks, scenery, storylines, objectives, game modes, and much more! Would definitely recommend this game to any FPS zombie lover out there. A+ in my book!Download Custom Zombies Maps Here:

												I have a story to tell, might get nostalgic to some of you so sit down and grab a drink.Back in 2009, i was at my cousins house playing out in the yard, then his bigger brother left his room to go walking with the older cousins, leaving just me, my cousin(we'll call cathal) and my other cousin Aaron. Now we went in his room and found his Xbox 360 and a so we turned it on. The game inside, Call of Duty: World at War. We decided to play and when we got on, we choose multiplayer and played with the split screen mode ond choose one of my favourite maps, Castle. We would camp at the two main buildings snipping with the PTRS-41 and using the other pre-made classes. After we played for a few hours, his brother came back and we left to go back outside. I went home asking my dad if i can get this game call Call of duty. HE said sure. Ever since that day, my life was consumed by first person shooters. I got it for the Wii btw. Each day i would go onto My wii and play WAW. Then i got an Xbox 360 and Xbox live. THats when i met people from around Ireland or the UK (i live in Australia now). I would play Multiplayer for hours, Zombies for hours, replay that mission where istill will never figure out how to shot Amirch Hamsel with a pistol from that range like wtf. Tehn i got the MW series, Black ops which i loved just as much and Halo Games which came with the 360. Now, 7 years later, im 16. I play Counter Strike and other games on my 360. However, every so often, ill boot up WAW, MW, BO, to relive distant memories. Remembering all my friends who i would add to platy COD with, Friends who i miss so much, Friends who ill never talk to again. But in the end, Call of Duty is an old classic you boot up on a Saturday evening to play with friends, have a laugh to escape life drama. Ill miss the old days, Split Screening, The PPSH-41, The sense of the Japense charging with a BANZAI. The fall of that german soilder on top of the reighstag, the sense of sniping 7 soilders and a dog with 5 bullets. Ill miss COD back in the late 2000s and early 2010s. I love this game10/10 :')			"

												Welcome to my review for call of duty world at war.Overview:call of duty world at war is a great call of duty game and extremly fun. While everyone says its a copy and paste of cod 4 its a good one and i'm glad treyarch made a ww2 version of cod 4 because the ww2 cods were great. If your wondering where all the dlc is its included in the game and its a good price for the base game and all 4 map packs.Campaign:The campaign is really cool and it proves the struggle that the russians had during the germans rise to power. Its one of those games that are so gorey that it makes you grateful that you didnt have to go to war and it makes you apreciate the army's work, for example you shoot someone in the arm and it will fly off and blood will splatter everywhere, shoot someone in the head with a shotgun and the enemys head will fly off, shoot someone in the leg and both legs will fly off. The story is great, you play as 2 different characters in the campaign: Dimitri petrenko (russian) & private C miller, On the American side you play as private C miller and you escape torture and raid the japanese camp that you escape from and continue to fight the war. It leads you through a long war that will keep you going for ages. For example on mission 2 theres an easter egg that lets you have a ray gun and mission 3 you get a flamethrower and another badass american mission is when you play as a commander on a ww2 plane and you feel like your raining death (a bit like death from above from cod 4, as i said this is a ww2 version of cod 4).  The russian side where you play as dimitri is probably the best part of the campaign because it has the more badass missions. You start off by being in the middle of a massacre at a town square only to meet sergeant reznov who helps you avange the massacre. You continue the campaign trying to regain control of the reichstag (end 2 missions of the campaign) but through that journey you murder as many germans as you can, you even go to their homeland and murder them there. Theres also a russian mission where you drive a tank as means of transport. The ending of the Russian campaign (end of campaign acctually) is badass and im not going to spoil it, just youtube it or play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.Overall i think the campaign is great and worth the price inculded in the game, i rate is 8/10Multiplayer:I dont really play much of this, probably a quarter of my hours but i stopped playing because of how many hackers are in multiplayer. Just like cod 4 you have 5 create-a-class slots with a primary weapon and 1 attachment, a secondary weapon, an equipment slot, 3 perk slots and a vehicle slot (yes some maps you can drive a tank). There is a great gamemode called war where theres a flag you have to capture and the more kills you get the faster you can capture a flag, im not going into to much detail because thats pretty much all war is. The maps are surprisingly really fun and i really enjoy them.Overall i give the multiplayer 7/10 because of the hackers, if there wasnt hackers i would give 8/10Zombies:This is probably my most played part and it is because of custom zombies. Custom zombies is really fun and the people out there create some amazing maps maybe even better than treyarchs default map. I wouldn't suggest playing co-op zombies unless your playing with a friend because people will steal your window and you get people on the mic but if you play solo or with a friend you save yourself from the migraines. The 4 default zombies maps are included (nacht der toten, verruckt, shi no numa & der reise) and they has some really nice features (shame that only der reise has pack a punch). There are 4 perks in zombies to which is very obvious (quick revive, speedcola, juggernog and double tap). Quick revive is a self revive on solo which means when you down you can get back up but you only have 3 uses, juggernog increases your health from 2 hits to die to 4-5 hits to die, speedcola makes you reload double fast and double tap lets you shoot 2x as fast. The guns are good but not amazing unless you have the ray gun or unless your on der reise and can pack a punch (pack a punch gives you a cool camo and shooting sound and doubles, qtriples or quadruples your gun damage, not sure which).Overall i think zombies is the best part, I wouldn't mind paying £20 for the zombies on its own but I rate the zombies part 9.5/10.One last note: If anyone does buy the game or enjoyed the review please thumbs up as this is the first review I have spent very long on but if you do get the game please send me a friend request, I'm always looking for friends on zombies but anyways buy the game and I promise you will love it.Thanks for reading ;)			"

												I have a deep hatred of Call of Duty (for a wide array of reasons), but this game on the PC kind of passed my firewall.In terms of system requirements and gameplay fluency, I was beyond surprised with how well this game runs. I was running a full 60 FPS flawless, even on the higher-paced Zombies mod, which honestly is the only saving grace in Call of Duty.The singleplayer was pretty interesting, too; it was a cool campaign of WWII taking place on two fronts against two highly different enemies - the Japanese favor unconventional, barbaric and suicidal attacks which provide challenge for the close-quarters-oriented United States Marines, and Hitler's Angels go against the Soviets in a longer-ranged conflict.The weaponry feels so unique and abstract from other installments of this otherwise putrid franchise, though that primarily comes from the gore effects in this game. Watching enemies' limbs go flying off when I blast them off with a pump-action shotgun reminds me of many years ago when I played this game on the Xbox 360.So World at War provides an entertaining singleplayer, which also has the equivalent of Halo's ""skulls"" (difficulty and game modifiers that provide either more challenging or easier effects in the gameplay) and cooperative campaign gameplay (it did on the Xbox, at least; I'm almost positive it does on the PC), and the Zombies mode is at its strongest and purest roots. It's tragic when the series' (Zombies) origins are the best version of it.Oh, and it's World War II, not this futuristic Titanfall wannabe ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (One of my many reasons for loathing CoD.)			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is the fifth game in the COD franchise, releasing in 2008 on PC, PS3, PS2, Wii and Xbox 360. The game was developed by Treyarch and published by Activision. This game is set in the World War II era where you play as various soldiers from United States and The Red Army.  Please note that this review is purely based on the single player aspect of World at War. The gameplay shares several features with the rest of the COD franchise up to this release. You spend the majority of the time with at least one other AI controlled squad member which guide you through levels and keeps you up to date with your current objective. You may only carry two weapons at any one time, whilst also having access to smoke grenades, Molotov’s and hand grenades. We have all of the standard FPS mechanics like crouching and prone positions. You recover health by staying out of line of fire of enemies, since there is no “health” packs throughout the game. You know when you are getting close to death as the edges of your screen glow red and your heartbeat increases. I personally think this is a nice feature rather than relying on a health bar, it adds to the immersion of the gameplay as the UI is very minimal. Since this game was released almost eight years ago, the graphics are certainly starting to show their age, with some really low res textures, but the environments are all still really nicely designed, animations on everything is stellar too. Character models are all high quality too. The game’s sound effects are brilliant too; you really feel like you are under heavy fire from enemies when you have surround sound on with a sub.  The fully voice acted characters are also very well done too. This is one of the few COD games which I had a few moments of difficulty throughout the campaign. Usually with COD games your AI partners are able to carry you through most levels with little interaction from you needed, however this game is different.  The tank missions are the ones I found to be the most difficult as you really need eyes in the back of your head in order to avoid taking damage from the hundreds of enemies that have you in their sights. I am not condemning the game for difficulty; it is really refreshing to see a COD game has the challenge in it. The more recent COD games have become a walk in the park so it was nice to see something different here. Whilst the game is linear, there are a few collectables to find throughout the single player campaign, there are 13 “death cards” to be found on every level which unlock cheat modes when playing in co-op. This again is a really cool feature and gives you some incentive to check every room, nook and cranny to find the collectables rather than a pointless achievement. The only negative point about this game for me is the game’s length. I realise I only played the single player so I am only getting half of the experience, but I would have liked to have seen at least five hour single player campaign mode. I managed to complete the game on a medium difficulty in just over three hours. You could replay the game to go back and find all of the collectables and you could also ramp up the difficulty, but given the linearity of the game I don’t see myself jumping into doing that anytime soon.  Looking at the Steam chart numbers, the multiplayer scene is really active still so if multiplayer is your jam you will find a match quite easily still. Technically I only had one issue, and that is with the graphics on some levels. It almost felt like my graphics card was dying as there was spewing graphics all over my screen at some point. It is hard to explain how they looked, but they were really off putting to the game and only happened every few levels. A simple re-load resolved the issue thankfully. Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best games in the COD franchise and one that still holds its own in the current generation of games. Due to the single player’s length, the price point on this game is quite high at £19,99. I would say that if you plan on getting into the multiplayer side of this game, you should pick it up for that price, however if you are only interested in the single player campaign mode, you would be better off waiting for it to go on sale, unfortunately reduction on COD games are very rare so you need to keep your eyes peeled for the deals! For anyone who has just skipped a head to my rating; I will repeat, this game was reviewed purely on the single player campaign; please bear that in mind with this rating.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

												Let's be real, if you're buying this game today it's only for the zombies (and the very fun campaign!).Sure the multiplayer is still there but it's a giant f&#$fest which is only fun for a little bit before it get's old. The zombies mode, and more importantly, the modded zombies maps are what make this game. If you go on the Steam WaW forums you'll always manage to find people to play with if you don't already have friends to play it with. The custom made maps range from being absolutely horrifying to extremely comedic. There are probably hundreds if not thousands of maps online that you can download and play on (look up a tutorial on how to download them if you aren't sure). This leads to pretty much infinite entertainment. I'd definetly pick this game up, but if you're not sure, just look up modded WaW zombies videos on youtube and see if you like them!Btw I see people complaining that newer CoD games don't have co-op campaign but the reason they don't have it is obvious - the new campaigns are so bad it'd be a waste of time and money to implement co-op campaign since nobody would want to play it.

												Usually I try and avoid cod games like the plague but something about a WWII setting seemed like it could be interesting. After reading some reviews and watching some videos etc. I decided to get it and hell was it worth it. The campaign is short but a blast. You still are a badass but atleast you have to take cover  and I ended up dying a ton of times on regular difficulty. The mulitplayer has a surprisingly decent amount of players playing it and on the right servers you will always be able to find a game and boy is it fun. Zombies is also very fun and I would reccomend getting it with your friends for a real good time, because usually you'll have to wait awhile to find a zombie match. Just all together this game ( atleast the campaign, and dont get me started on how amazing the seige on berlin is ) actually feels like a war and is a really good FPS. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone that doesn't like future themed crummy games, or who is looking for a damn good FPS.			"

												In My books this is The best cod ever made. I LOVE the atmosphere the game has: music,  the way the graphics were made, the ruthless feel this game brings about war. Brings back so many good memories from the years gone by. Pretty sad its dead. Nostalgia at its best.			"

												Hmm... where to begin with this amazing game. This game is the best Call of Duty game there is, in my opinion this game even tops COD4. Let me explain why, the campaign is so much fun, Intresting and replayable because this campaign has so many great missions. Next the Multiplayer... To date the Multiplayer is amazing but nowadays there are a few Hackers who just ruin it, but its very little that I see them in a game and there are some Higher XP lobbies which will get you ranked up quickly if you are new to the game so you can get the good guns such as the MP-40, Thompson and My fav weapon in the game the Springfield plus the MP maps are just amazing and have been remade becuase they where just to great. And then there is zombies a gamemode that was nearly canceled (which would have been a massive mistake) the zombies maps are my favs out of the Treyarch games and are the most fun to play and with people making modded zombie maps the fun can keep going. But zombies is very very fun if you have not played a Cod Treyarch game then I reccomend this one first to see how amazing cod really was. Thanks for reading :)			"

												This is one of the good Call Of Duty games. Based on CoD4's IW3 engine, plus the modding capabilities, the community is developing the game's modding even fruther ahead. But the only things is - I can only see alot of custom zombie maps, speaking of Mods and custom content.Dear modders! If you're reading this review, please, make some cool multiplayer mods + some custom co-op campaign maps ^.^			"

Strongest point WaW has to offer is a flexible mod support which allows essentially changing a healthy amount of engine core mechanics.[✔]> 4 player co-op campaign> dedicated mod support > unlimited amount of custom zombie maps> tactical mp instead of rush clusterf*ck> 64 player server & drivable tanks> free CoD DLCs (wow)[✘]> bugs occur more often than not "

Introduction: Call of Duty World at War developed by Treyarch is now a beloved classic in the eye's of many Call of Duty enthusiasts and still incredibly sought after by PC gamers to this day. Overview: Developed by Treyarch Call of Duty World at War remains amongst the top of many PC Call of Duty fans wishlists and standard playlists years after release for many reasons. True to the series fluid arcade style FPS gameplay elements fueled by adrenaline and a constant gameplay flow. Call of Duty: World at War separates itself from the pack as the last true Call of Duty PC release. With graphics optimization unheard of in this day and age of COD console ports to a modding friendly PC release, whether it be it's first forray in into Treyarchs now trademark Zombie mode or a multitude of community driven content in all aspects of multiplayer. Call of Duty: World at War is seen as the last title in the series to be given the full PC treatment gamers grew used to and has sadly never returned. Fans of the series who have never experienced Call of Duty: World at War will be amazed at the amount of content available as a standard retail release. The PC Steam version of this title comes preloaded with the DLC preinstalled for $19.99 which, is why this title has never seen a price drop aside from activisions penchant for never letting their financial steely grip on price reductions slip through their fingers and benefit the consumer on the backend. I must reiterate this Call of Duty release simply doesn't need one. With all the content available in this iteration anyone considering a purchase will be more than pleased with their decision to opt in to the lesser known older brother of the Black Ops series.Graphics: 8.5Just as any other version of the generation 7 Call of Duty games this is also based on the 2007 Unreal engine which, means considering the amount of graphics optimization available Call of Duty: World at War in comparison to it's younger siblings still holds it's own in many aspects and more in some cases.     Gameplay: 8.0Although not quite as intricate as Infinity Wards fan favorite Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. World at War holds it's own where it matters.....Solid gameplay. This is a tried and true Call of Duty recipe since the originals release which I am happy to say is represented perfectly. Although a bit on the no frills side in comparison to Modern Warfare, some prefer it's tenacious gun battles and old school FPS precision beats killstreak style and should in the least be embraced by all ""New school"" Call of Duty fans. Sound: 8.5 A series staple. Call of Duty doesn't let down even by current generation 8 standards. Every whizzing bullet and explosion will test even the most high end of Dolby Surroud Sound systems subwoofers currently on the market today. When the settings are placed just right, you can close your eyes and imagine what an existance in this chaotic time in history would have been like. This truley helps set the tone in any true battlefield experience and World at War doesn't dissapoint.  Online experience: 9.0After all these years Call of Duty: World at War still has a thriving online vs. multiplayer community supplimented by a vast zombies experience that many consider to be superior to the franchises later releases. Due solely to the dedicated modding community that activision has sadly all but forgotten about in it's later releases. With that being said the multiplayer servers are also maintained by groups of dedicated FPS communities. One specific group that must be mentioned for it's servers integrity and organization is the [PDE] "" PerfectDarkElite"", this groups primary servers are maintained by some of the most friendly and integrity driven individuals that I can proudly say I have played along side for countless hours of intense online battles.    Story: 7.5The story of Call of Duty: World at War is what I would consider it's weakest point. Seeded in the standard World War II scenario, you won't find much originality here. Yet with that being said it still manages to keep your interest as any Call of Duty action fest should with the series standard over exaggerated explosions and barely made it through situations, World at War still has it moments of surprize and awe. Replay Value: 10With all the above mentioned features preinstalled in the retail release and available from the online community this is where Call of Duty: World at War shines above the rest!!! If your looking to make a Call of Duty purchase that will last into future if the past is any example then World at War is it! With a lower price tag than it's younger brothers, every dollar is a dollar well spent. The replay value of this title is endless. Final Review Score: 8.0There are two defining Call of Duty titles from the seventh generation that not only set the standard for all titles to come in the series but, also simply couldn't be matched in terms of gripping single player campaigns to this day Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and World at War. Without a doubt Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is the superior of the two but, regardless there's a reason that Treyarch continued to base multiple entries on the gameplay formula represented here....Simply put because it's good and they knew it. If you are looking for one of the best World War II campaigns in gaming history and an online experience that still bustles today, then look no farther.			"

												I bought this game for one reason only ... CUSTOM ZOMBIES!First off, you'll never get bored of zombies as there are so much maps to pick from (there are websites with hundreds of maps).. literally it's endless.If you can get a few friends to buy it too and get all the same maps, it is just endless hours of fun. However i didn't think much of the multiplayer side of this game as i expected it to be like the console - full of hackers and no one playing. Wow I was wrong! I went in to expect no one online. Pressed refresh and hunders of severs and I had the option to filter it and only show servers that aren't modded. I even saw a few servers full of 40+ people playing! (Yep! 40+ people playing in the one match of TDM and on the tiny maps-- IT'S JUST CHAOS in a good way).Seriously, buy this game for Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies! Worth all of your money and all of your hours! Really fun and addictive. This is the game where Call of Duty was at it's best and if it wants to return to that, just remaster this f***ing game!A MUST BUY! <3			"

PROS:+ 2 different WW2 fronts+ variety of weapons and scenarios+ co-op campaign+ zombie modes+ mod support+ still strong playerbaseCONS:- occasional graphical bugs & glitches- AI issues in certain places- some problems with connecting to other players- meeting hackersComment:This game is fantastic. No need to build up tension when a game this good is reviewed. By no means is it a perfect game but surely a very good WW2 FPS worth taking a look at. People who love WW2 shooters and war stories will get their fair share of epic scenes and combat. The variety is what shines, the fact that the missions don't get repetitive. This is thanks to 2 main campaign paths, one in the Pacific and the other in Europe (east front). Yes, we have seen some scenarios in previous CoD or MoH games. But it matters little because it takes a different take on these which keeps it fresh. It has some flaws, like AI being weird in a couple of places, or the occasional glitch. But overall the campaign is great and what makes it even better is the co-op option. That being said it is not always easy to connect to your friends. Same can be said for multiplayer in general but even though the game is old the playerbase remains quite steady. This might be partially because this is (so far) the last WW2 CoD game and mod support was still a thing here. To top off the posibilities this is the first time we get zombie modes in CoD. And it's glorious, especially custom zombies. Playing these modes with friends is loads of fun! I recommend this game and I advise you to get some mods after you finish with the base experience.P.S.: ignore the play time, I played a ton of this back in the day but I don't own a CD/DVD drive anymore so I bought it again on Steam to try it out			"

So i have a great experience to play zombies. I have played now maybe 50+ custom maps on WaW with nearly 250 hours and i have to say it much more fun as the other cod parts.All mapmakers and inventors of the custom maps did such a great work.The ideas from the inventors are sometimes crazy. Ken a member of the Zombie Experten Clan did in the past also his first map which is called Undead Overkill / Calling |ZEC|[ugx-mods.com]Especially i love doing easter eggs which are difficult and tricky to solve. My favourite maps with incredible easter eggs are: Morgue1.1.1[zommods.com] Clinic Of Evil[customzombiemaps.com] Leviathan 1.2[zommods.com] Ragnarok[customzombiemaps.com] UGX Requim V1.1[ugx-mods.com] Das Herrenhaus 1.0[zommods.com] Snowglobe[zommods.com] Prison Mission - v1.1[zommods.com] Abandoned School[zommods.com] The Abandoned Mine[customzombiemaps.com]▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔The Map for the best look i would call Der Berg[zommods.com] and Buried Nuketown[zommods.com], its also the newest custom map. It is worth alone to look up to the sky and sunshine!If i have to choose a best map. I couldn´t, there are so much different good maps for challenging, fungames, easter eggs, highrounds and more. I personally like to play The Bunker[customzombiemaps.com] and Dead Ship[zommods.com] and actually alot of the christmas maps.But everybody should make his own opinion of those large selection.Even for 19,99€ its a fair price, because you can play 100+ maps.I wish it will continue or less with Black Ops 3 Custom Zombies.Recommend page for Custom Zombies on Steam: Join hereBest regards -  |ZEC|eXo BeRLiN ▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔			"

												The campaign is a lot of fun. But it's also so brutal and so violent that it makes you think.Call of Duty is good. Just not good enough to be bought again and again every year.But World at War is definitely worth a purchase in my book.			"

												If I got this game for $60 I wouldn't even be mad. The campaign is worth it. Very fun and the gore is a huge plus. Treyarch did an awesome job with this game. Unfortunately multiplayer servers are down. But campaign is loads of fun. Love the gritty feeling of this game.			"

												The last CoD to be set during WWII; also, the best one. Good ol' times of Call of Duty. If you've got some spare bucks, spend them on this game, you will not regret it. Pros:- Online multiplayer still heavily populated after all these years;- neat campaign (Pvt. Petrenko rules);- Nazi Zombies :)Cons:- As a Historian, I'm stubborn as to accept weapons not being faction-locked (in online multiplayer, you have every weapon at your disposal, according to your level, but meh, many games are like that).

												Once upon a time, there was a Call of Duty game that, much like the others, recieved hate for being part of the CoD francise. However, it had many great things that people consider groundbreaking in newer CoDs such as gore and interactive map elements (in the form of tanks). Once upon a time, that game wasn't infested by hackers in multplayer. That game was Call of Duty World at War. A fantastic WW2 game that was on par with Brothers in Arms for showing how dark WW2 (or any war for that matter) was/can be. We had access to many weapons of devestation, from M1A1 Bazookas, to M2-2 Flamethrowers, and other feared weapons such as the MG42, or as many soldiers dubbed it, ""Hitler's Buzzsaw."" Explosives and large calibre ammunition showed their true power when they ripped apart characters limb by limb, the flamethrower engulfed and charred the bodies of soldiers in true awe. But the experience doesn't just end with a heroic end to a dark and gritty campaign and 80+levels of multiplayer, oh no, for an extra, small map had made it into the game; Nacht der Untoten, Night of the Living Dead. In a move that caught everyone, even many of the employees at Treyarch, offguard, an extra mode was added into Call of Duty that would be immortalized as a icon of the series. Nazi Zombies. Many players, myself included, spent countless hours having fun with this little surprise. And it didn't end there; more maps were added, and all Treyarch games since have had it included, as if the modding community wasn't putting out enough maps as it was. But its time was cut short when Modern Warfare 2 came out the next year and as the fanbase moved on, the hackers moved in, polluting the public multiplayer lobbies like a cancer, making people less inclined to play the game. And so ends the story of Call of Duty World at War... or does it? No, the game won't die for a long time because of its dedicated custom map making community, creating more and more great Zombies experiences each day.			"

												Not much of a Call of Duty fan, but WaW is too good to pass. One of the first games I ever played. First time I played was on the Wii, then switched to PS3, now PC, and it's so much better and fun on the PC. WaW is the only Cod I'll actually play day in and day out. This was and still is a masterpiece.			"

												One of the few Call of Duty games ACTUALLY WORTH YOUR MONEY AND TIME. World at War is quite possibly the best COD of all time. It takes place in the second Wolrd War and lets you play as not only the American marines fighting in Japan, but the Soviets fighting in Germany. From what I've seen, people still play multiplayer. You also get the 3 zombie map dlcs with this purchase so that is a plus. If you enjoy shooters and are a history lover, this game is perfect.			"

Arguably the best of the franchise and well populated. Brilliantly nostalgic and still an absolute joy to play. PunkBuster can be a problem however.""Call of Duty"" was and remains a franchise at the forefront of the online FPS genre. Dominating both console and PC alike, it's rivaled some would say, only by it's EA counterpart ""Battlefield""; but ""World at War"" was something else.Released in 2008 it adapted and built perfectly on the foundations set the previous year by Activision's installment in the series - ""Modern Warfare"".Trearch's addition gave us features the likes of which we'd never seen in ""Call of Duty 4"". Vehicles. Tanks. Though on face value a simple addtion, their inclusion was well implimented and appropriatley balanced. We were also graced with a slightly new approach to the killstreak system, seeing the introduction of attack dogs; along with a tweaked 'Create-A-Class' system made to feel more period accurate, with bolt action rifles becoming an entierly different weapon type paired with the ability to use their iron-sights, as apposed to being restricted to a telescopic sight.In terms of singleplayer, this installment saw you brave the horrors of WWII from both a Russian and American perspective; battling the Japanesse on Iwo Jima and beating down the 3rd Reich from Stalingrad to Berlin. Featuring the voice talents of Keifer Sutherland for the American Sgt. Roebuck, and Gary Oldman for the premier of the legendary hard-as-nails Russian sniper - Viktor Reznov. The campaign is both compelling and fantasicaly written with mixes of close and ranged combat along a spectrum of locales beautifully designed and planned. The singleplayer is, as far as im concerned, unsurpassable by any other ""Call of Duty"" game. However, my one biggest fault with ""Call of Duty: World at War"" is the unfortunate lack of PunkBuster support. The anti-cheat system which now seems abandoned and disused is still required to play some servers in online matchmaking. Needing some Google searching to find a download of the appropriate files to enable the system to work. Although once this is done, the game plays fine and without further fault.Oh, and not to mention. Zombies.Recommended?: Yes.Score: 9/10			"

												Playing this f#cking game made me notice how much I miss the old WW2 FPS games, instead of the new futuristic crap wars that this franchise keeps making up to keep milking blind fans. The thing is, every time I tried to finish this game something happens and I couldn't finish it. Well, until now, that is. Is this game worth it or not? As usual, I'm gonna explain the bad things it has first, although being honest there's not much wrong with it.First and foremost, the story is split in two different parts of WW2, the Americans trying to get revenge after the Pearl Harbor mess and Russia kicking some nazi♥♥♥♥♥ And personally, the American part of the game needed some work. The characters are just SO DAMN BLAND, EVEN FOR COD STANDARDS. And it even tries to pull the ""suddenly killing an important character infront of you and you can't do anything about it"" multiple times, and it fails to get anything because neither I know ANYTHING about those character, neither I even CARE about them. It just means I'll have a different American dumb#ss yelling at me every 10 seconds.Going further with the American side of the story, while they offer some nice changes from the rest of the series, they repeat itself a bit too much. Seriously, most of the American part of the game is spent crawling in trenches and holes in the ground. One of it's missions has one of the moments I most liked on the game, the whole level on the plane using all of those cool guns and it just makes me wonder WHY AREN'T THERE MORE OF THOSE AND LESS DAMN HOLES IN THE GROUND.Also, the game is kinda short. Now sure, CoD games always have a short story mode but hell, in Modern Warfare titles they make up a dumb story behind all of the pew pew pew democracy MURRICA, here they didn't really need to think of a story as it wrote itself years ago. It lasts around 4 to 5 hours, but will take you more on high difficulties. It ends with a good taste, but it's a bit needlessly short to my refined-afro-fueled taste.Lastly, it has some gameplay issues, similar to what you would expect from the rest of this damn ♥♥♥♥♥d franchise. Corpses freezing in mid-air, enemies doing nothing but spamming grenades on high difficulties, enemies respawining non-stop and even respawning in between your allies in insane places, that sort of stuff. Seriously, don't even bother to use normal grenades in anything that isn't normal or easy difficulty, most times enemies will just pick them up and throw them back at your face. Thank motherf#cking mother Russia the Soviet story has molotovs.All of that being said, what does the game have to offer? Well, if you're played games such as the three original CoD's or Medal of Honor (before it went Modern Warfare Ripoff mode) then you'll know what to expect.The story, while being a bit bland on the American side, is quite engaging and fun to go through. Specially the Russian side of it, which feels like it was done by completely different people, as......Well, the Russian side it's just SO F#CKING GOOD. AMAZING MUSIC, AMAZING LEVELS, AMAZING CHARACTERS AND ACTION, JUST WHY COULDN'T THE GAME BE ALL WITH THEM!? I'M NOT JOKING.Weapons are also great. You know this sh#t feeling you get in pretty much all CoD games that any weapon which isn't a Sniper Rifle or an Assault weapon is trash? Well, while Shotguns still seem to be irrelevant on this game, you'll be surprised to find that pretty much all weapons are useful. I actually do suggest switching and trying them all to find what suits your style more. Also, the American vs Japan and Russia vs Nazis stories have different weapons completely, which is a good effort.Something that also surprised me were the vehicle sections. Both stories have a level in which you're in somewhat control of a vehicle, the Americans being the multiple turrets of a big-#ss plane and the Russians being a damn vodka-fueled tank of atomic destruction. Both of them were actually quite fun, specially the plane one.The game also has Coop, although I couldn't try it out this time. I bet it's fun, but I wanted to try it out by myself anyway. The Coop that I did try is the Nazi Zombies mode a long time ago on the Xbox360 of a friend, and that sh#t is fun as hell.Is the game worth it, then? Well, the problem is mainly the price. For 20€ I don't think it is. For that price, either wait for a sale that drops it to 5€ or lower, or just buy it on console, however I DO recommend playing it. It's fun, and a good throwback to the classic CoD's.TL;DR Edition: Think of Modern Warfare 1 but with Vietnam flashes and the Soviet Union suplexing Nazis. It's fun as hell, specially the Coop with the Nazi Zombies unlockable mode, but 20€ is a bit way too much.			"

												Campaign:This is by far my favorite campaign in Call of Duty. The grim, brutal and graphic nature of the campaign really makes the game feel like World War 2, the deadliest war of all time.You play as the Soviets against Nazi Germany in one campaign. You witness the beginning of the war with a grim scene of death and an enticing sniper battle. You then find yourself breaking into the heart of Germany and the destruction of the Fatherland. You also get to prove yourself as either an emotionless monster or a forgiving soul.You also play as the American's against the Japanese. You will witness the Japanese banzai tactics and guerilla warfare. You will go from hot, dry out in the open fighting to narrow caves and muddy, rainy hills. You will witness the downfall of the Japanese Empire from start to finish. Both campaigns are very enticing and the missions, although action packed, are memorable and the environment/scenes make it seem realistic.Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, although sadly their is no matchmaking for PC like their is on console. You have to search through the list of servers. A lot are crouch servers/tactical servers which can be a +1 or a -1. I'm personally fine with it. Game also comes with all DLC's so you get all the maps.Zombies:Yes, zombies. The masterpiece of World at War. It all started here. You get all the zombie maps, plus there is hundreds of custom zombies maps that make the zombies experience endless. This is a big highlight of the PC version. You can easily play with your friends. You can do cheats as well. I'd say the zombies is the best reason to get the PC version over the console versions.Graphics:Pretty nice for their time. I wouldn't criticize it since the rest of the game makes up for it.Overall 9.5/10I take 0.5 off for the lack of matchmaking. Otherwise I love WAW and have played it on my friends accounts and have spent atleast 100 hrs on the PS3 version.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War. The last game before all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC ports of the Call of Duty series. World at War (WaW) is the fifth iteration in the arcade shooter series that brings WWII elements in the COD universe. WAW is Made by Treyarch a company that has made titles such as ""Call of Duty: 2"" and ""Call of duty: 3"", so if you have played those you're in for a similar experience just much more shiny. The COD series also has another developer (Infinity Ward) that switches off on each of the series's games. WAW brings a whole new part of the series. A 4-Player cooperative game-mode named ""Nazi Zombies"". The new experience compiles intuitive gameplay like finding the best parts of a level to kill the undead or find out what weapons do the most damage.The campaign is 5-8 hours of Shooting mindless enemies on set pieces arranging from the heart of Russia to Nazi trenches. The multiplayer is class based with a perk system and customizable weapons. If you manage to get a certain amount of kills in a row you earn special kill-streaks. 3 kills is a UAV, 5 kills is an Artillery Strike, and 8 kills in a row you call in dogs to rip your enemies apart. Overall Call of Duty: World at War is a great buy if you like shooting up hordes of zombies all night with your friends. Or if you want to have a good time killing your way to the top in the leaderboards on multiplayer. Either way your going to have a good time with this game.			"

												Maybe one of the best Call of Duty games, especially compared to the newer ones out here :(.Let me explain why.PROS--Nice, medium sized and hella fun campaign.-Zombie Mode-Multiplayer Mode-Co-op Campaign Mode-Use of Modding to get custom zombie maps-Even to today, it has a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of players on-Use of fun and easy to use console commands for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tting around in Campaign and Zombies-Variety of weapons to have fun with. And by variety I mean the PPSH-41. Hehehe.-Pay for DLC? Nah fam! Get em for free, and you don't even have to download them. They come for free and automatically. Take that, Microsoft and Sony.-GORE. A LOT OF GORE!! exxxxdeeeee-A fun multiplayer experience. As long as you don't need a modder. (Refer to the Cons part)And there is always the bad parts of games. Here we go.CONS--Since the game is old, there isn't much security on the multiplayer and zombie modes. That goes to modders. Since the mod menus are easy to get out there for this game, it is very common to find matches with modders in it with people with God mode, Noclip, unlimited ammo, shooting fire or nukes or some damn♥♥♥♥♥♥-Can't Alt+tab out of the game without crashing it, as well as make you restart your computer. ;(-Modding requires you to mess with the game files, pay attention boys.-Since the console commands won't explain what you need to do, (refer to a console guide command, preferably by ShockingPj33 or all the other console nerds out there.:)...), some can crash your game......And guess what, as well as make you restart your computer.. Fun!. :/Last Words: So, out of all of this, I give the game a 8.5/10. If Treyarch would make a remastered version, without supply drops or variants or♥♥♥♥♥♥like that, and stick to the game like it NEEDS to be and like it IS then I would be happy, or they need to send a team back over here in our world and fix the security and get rid of those modders! It can be fun sometimes, but when they abuse the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of their powers, not fun.. Not fun at all.Going on to my next review. Peace out.-N7			"

												I think World at War is definitely one of the best Call of Duty games, ever! It has an intense understanding of warfare thus unlike any other FPS it gives the players more than a regular opportunity just to match a crosshair with the enemy in front of you. Rather you feel a whole battlefield with a realistic weaponry. Campaign is especially good considering that it tells the story of fronts that has been mentioned less so far, than the other fronts of WWII. It is not very difficult to play, like most of the CoD games, however Veteran difficulty could be tried for a fun challange. Also, you have the opportunity to play in competitive Co-op mode up to 4 players . Other than that there is of course the zombie mode which is the very beginning of the whole series. Map numbers are limited and so are the possibilities but I think it is a must for every dedicated player. Multiplayer is realistic and although perks, attachments and weapons are of great use and advantage for a player, higher levels of others is not a crucial concern for a beginner. The game depends on the talent and caution of a player mostly as well as gameplay experience but not definitely on their level.In overall, I can say that this game is a must for a CoD player, a nice and slighlty different experience for an FPS player and a good place to start for the inexperienced action gamers.

												After purchasing a gaming computer, this was one of the first games I downloaded. THE best purchase I have made on Steam. When World at War first came out, I only had an Xbox. I'd watch videos on YouTube of custom made zombie maps and I would weep silently as I was restricted to the stock & DLC maps (which are still AMAZING). Call of Duty: World at War for PC gaming is everything I thought it would be and so much more.Pros:- Multiplayer is still popular, I'm normally playing in a server with between 14-40 people.- Nazi Zombies, with hundreds of custom player made maps. - Has 10 Prestiges (unlike CoD: 4) I find love that they added this for WaW. Through Prestiging, you can unlock 5 additional Custom Classes, for a total of 10 Customizable Classes.- Singleplayer is incredibly fun and well done. I'm a sucker for WW2 games, so I admit that I am biased.- Explosions and certain weapons will dismember enemies.Cons:- If you aren't with friends, or you haven't gone onto an online community to play Nazi Zombies/Custom NZ, you will more than likely not be able to find a game with a decent ping, which restricts you to SP Nazi Zombies. You can use cheats to help you out, if need be.- Still has a few bugs here and there. The map Downfall occasionally crashes my game, and I will occasionally get kicked from servers upon loading new maps.- Depending on the server, there will be hackers/try hards/cry babies/trolls. Enable Punkbuster and you should be okay (for hackers). I also tend to frequent the same 2 servers, which are usually monitored with an admin, and has a clan website where players can upload demos of suspected hackers.- I find 20$ to be excessive for an 8 year old game (call me cheap idk), so I waited for it to go on sale and grabbed it for 10$All in all, I have to give this a 9/10. The ability to play on customized zombie maps/mods allows you to spend hours trying out new maps or mods. I've been playing the Zombie Realism mod, which adds in a ranking system, custom classes, Prestige mode, weapon Challenges, and more. There aren't many 8 year old games that I can still have fun playing, but World at War is definitely one of them. "

												""You were killed by a grenade. Watch out for the grenade danger indicator.""This is a message or tip that you will see quite frequently throughout World at War's campaign on the higher difficulties; Hardened and Veteran. This is due to the fact that more grenades are thrown at you in this game than there were manufactured during World War II.			"

												In my opinion, this is a nearly perfect game. It has an ok story, but you will overlook that very quickly as the gameplay and atmosphere captures the horror of World War 2 flawlessly, in both plot lines. In the first plot line, you play as an American soldier battling the Japanese, trying to capture an island that is full of booby traps and relentless enemies. This is a very cool way to play, with close quarters combat and ambushes aplenty, making the gameplay very suspenseful. In the other plotline, you play as a Russian soldier, firstly trying desperately to survive during a massive German invasion of a Russian town, then four years later, in 1945, you enter Germany and Berlin and brutally crush the German empire in what is a very satisfying set of levels. The first mission where you play as the Russian soldier is absolutely groundbreaking, filled with suspense and a dark, powerful atmosphere as you try to escape from the overkill that are the Nazis. Gameplay is your average Call of Duty game, it's fun and addictive, but on harder difficulty modes, it is extremely frustrating. Even on the easiest difficulty, you can bet that enemies will throw 3 grenades all aimed at you with no time to react. The Campaign is very entertaining and while short it has plenty of powerful moments, ESPECIALLY the ending, that was one of the best moments in a game, ever. The game looks absolutely beautiful, for a person that has to run PayDay 2 on lowest settings windowed to get 30 FPS it looks fantastic, even on lowest settings. The music is stunning, even right when you start the game you hear a track that grabs you into the game. Sadly, Campaign Co-op is dead and no-one plays it, so be sure to get friends if you want to play the Campaign with someone. Multiplayer is very good. On the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of the game, it is notorious for everyone to hack and spoil the game. Oddly, on the PC version, where it is far easier to cheat, you barely see any cheaters. In general, Multiplayer is very well alive and still has a lot of players to this very day, which is good, because multiplayer is very entertaining and amusing to playthrough online. Last, but certainly not least, the arcade-style Nazi Zombies mode. This is one of the best modes ever to be added to a video game, and would you believe it was added last minute? While the Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops is flawless and (for some extra money) contains all the WaW maps remastered, it's still incredibly fun, and if you ask a friend to play Zombies with you, they usually accept. Overall, this is an excellent game and one that should definitely be in your Steam library. Just, don't get it full price, for this old of a game paying £20 is just plain stupid.			"

												It may be a re-skin of CoD4 but that just means the Good War is back and it's better than ever.Despite the grumblings of many, World at War shows there is still a lot of fight left in WWII as a setting. And despite some obvious shortcomings, like the broken audio and straightforward story, World at War is every bit as intense, polished and fun as it's predecessor. The presentation is top notch, with cutscenes that mix real wartime footage with sleek, modern graphics. The short single player campaign is helped by a terrific multiplayer and co-op portion as well as the ever fun Nazi mode. The World at War doesn't reinvent the wheel by staying snugly in Modern Warfare's shadow, but it does make for a thrilling and enjoyable ride that fans of WWII and shooters alike are sure to appreciate.

												Before you criticize my review based on my playtime shown above, I have played this game an absolute ♥♥♥♥ ton on console.With that being said...Campaign: It's fun if you're into it.Multiplayer: Haven't touched it though I assume it's dead.Zombies: The reason you should get this game. All the DLC is included free of charge so you don't have to mess with paying more for zombie maps. Also, there are tons of custom zombie maps that people have made so you will pretty much never get bored of zombies. The game is incredibly user friendly when loading up custom zombie maps from online so you don't have to install any bull sh*t mods or program to use them. Also, while there are some mediocre zombie maps, there are also a ton of well designed maps that in some cases due to easter eggs or new features outshine the ones that the game comes with. To add, because zombies on Black Ops 1 and 2 aren't exactly mod friendly, custom map makers have turned to integrating a lot of BO1 and BO2 zombies features in World at War. From guns to perks like Mule Kick and extra pack a punch features like cool looking skins for guns when you pack a punch it, these custom maps become more than just a room with spawn points. Hell, there's even buyable endings where you can literally beat the map after you rack up enough points depending on what it's set at (do not confuse buyable with actually having to buy and ending with real money, it's all using the in game points so don't worry about having to pay for extra sh*t. Though this may seem like a lot, or a little if you're a skeptic, this is just a surface level review of what there is to offer in this game through custom zombie maps. You do not have to pay for any map that you download (that I know of) and there's plenty of ways to get these maps. Personally, I just go to youtube and watch well known zombie players playing custom maps that they think are cool and conveniently they link the download to the map. Pretty trusted resource cause, you know, the internet would never lie to me. Anyways, here's a TL;DRGet this game mainly for zombies. All DLC included and custom maps are easily available and easy to use. IMO the custom maps are better than the original ones. Worth.10/10			"

Call of Duty: World at War is a first person shooter created by Treyarch for PC and consoles. Originally named ""Call of Duty 5"", the game continues, and subsequently finishes, the World War II setting started from the first game, ""Call of Duty"". It is the first game within the ""Call of Duty: Black Ops"" series, although not branded/labeled as a ""Black Ops"" game itself. It is considered the goriest, most emotionally hard hitting, and realistic Call of Duty video game to date.Call of Duty: World at War is a fictional video game depicting the fictional lives of two Privates during the denouement of World War II. The game starts with an American Army soldier named Private C. Miller and his journey throughout the beaches and lands of Japan, marching and fighting his way through Makin, Okanawa, and Peleliu Island with Sergeant Thomas Sullivan (who is murdered by a Japanese soldier early in the campaign), who is later replaced by Sergeant Roebuck. After the American-sided introduction, the game then switches to Soviet Union Red Army soldier Private Dimitri Petrenko, and his journey with Sergeant Reznov, Private Chernov, and the rest of the Red Army as they charge their way throughout Stalingrad in Russia, to the fields of Seelow in Germany, and subsequently to Berlin as they cut down all in their path, fighting and brutally slaughtering their way into the Reichstag, to slice down the facist Reich's flag, and to wave ultimate victory over Germany for Mother Russia.Campaign================================The game starts with the American campaign, with Pvt. Miller, along with Sgt. Roebuck and Sullivan, charging through Makin with their battalions, falling into ambushes, and blowing up an ammo depot. The game, after 3 American based missions, switches to the Russian side of the campaign. The Russian campaign starts with the player, Pvt. Petrenko, lying in the slaughter of his comrades after a massacre at a fountain at the Red Square in Stalingrad. The player then continues with Sgt. Reznov to assassinate a German General named Amsel, to avenge the fallen soldiers who had died at Stalingrad. Afterwards, they escape Stalingrad and begin their own adventure to take back Russia, and later Berlin.The game continues with multiple battles and conflicts, which when paired with Sean Murray's amazing music, make the whole experience very emotionally hard hitting, and unforgettable. To the Russian Battle Theme, and the ""Black Cats"" fighting theme, the game deliveres an amazing experience that reminisces of the golden days of Call of Duty video games.Zombies================================Call of Duty: World at War intruduces a new ""Nazi Zombies"" mode into the franchise. The mode centers around an operative (or a group of operatives) as they are stranded at a certain base, in need of rescue, from a pending Nazi Zombie invasion. The group/player must work together/alone to fight their way through the carnage and to escape the compound they are in, being supplied with multiple weapons, and powerups through the way.This mode is definitely worth a try, and a good move on Treyarch.Multiplayer================================With the singleplayer campaign, the game also presents a co-op mode, which allows you to play the campaign with friends. It enables the new ""DeathCards"" cheats, which reveal special cheats as you collect them throughout the campaign. They're mostly jokes, such as the cheat that replaces all your weapons with stones. I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not.While the true multiplayer is broken, it can be fixed by following the PC Gaming wiki article here[pcgamingwiki.com].Upon fixing the multiplayer, most players will notice that almost all the servers are sadly modded. Most servers have leveling cheats enabled, where-in your first 5 minutes of gameplay the player will most likely already be leveled to level 28. I have suffered this, and many others have/will too.Ignoring that, the multiplayer is mostly fun. There's multiple modes that will deliver a fun arcade experience for the player. Nothing much to say here.Issues/Bugs/Glitches================================Albeit all the great things about the game, it does present multiple issues. For starters, the game has a failsafe where if the player does not advance at all, it will start spamming grenades at the player until they move forward. On most difficulties, this is usually 1 to 3 grenades. While this doesn't sound too bad, it becomes a terrible experience on Veteran difficulties, as the player will most likely have 6-7, even 8 grenades thrown at them at once.The game also suffers from terrible AI issues. An example is in ""Vendetta"", the first Russian campaign mission. During the part where you must protect your comrades as they storm a communications center, sometimes of the AI will become confused, and refuse to navigate. This results in a crash, which you must ALT+TAB out to see (as the game does not close automatically). Sadly, this has happened to me at least 4 times throughout the campaign, with both American and Russian campaigns. The AI can also be oblivious to enemies, where they (sometimes) will stand their and absorb bullets until they die, doing nothing. This is most prominant on Veteran mode, and leads to an annoying experience, since your comrades will not help you AT ALL during these fire-fights. Happily, Sgt. Roebuck nor Reznov will never have these errors; as Reznov stays in the back (never moving unless it's a scripted event), and Roebuck stays behind cover all of the time throwing grenades and using his pistol.  The enemies also feel like they all have aimbot on higher difficulties, and aren't actually aiming for the armies as a whole; just you and you alone.Final Remarks================================I definitely recommend this game to EVERYONE who has a love for first person shooters, war video games, or Call of Duty games, as this game will find a way to take camp in anyones heart and mind.This game is simply amazing, despite the issues it has, and definitely deserves a chance to be played by everyone.================================FINAL RATING: 8/10			"

Some of the free zombie mods are worlds better than what you can get as paid dlc, or even full games from other sources or consoles. They really outdid themselves with this game.

												I played the game for over 2000 hours on ps3 and over 500 hours on xbox 360. This is the best cod man has ever made. Singleplayer is epic from the begining of being captured and tortured, to putting that rusian flag up. Best cod campaign 10/10. Next is Zombies. TBH im not a zombies fan however, this has teh best maps for zombies and is just cool. WIth custom maps aswell that just makes my 7/10 go to a 9/10. wont give 10/10 until i like zombies ;) Last is MP. same engine as cod4 in ww2. What is there to hate, fine there not many good servers as they are all 64 man XD. I want a classic 5v5 / 6v6 game to be perfect. there are extra xp / easy prestige servers if you cba to grind and tbh i dont see why you wouldnt use those servers. People say there are hackers but i have seen1 hacker who tried to aimbot but his aimbot missed everytime XD. i would buy this game for the price it is now!!!			"

												I know I've only played this game for two hours on PC, but I already know what this game is all about from playing both the PS3 and 360 versions of it for years. After experiencing all the annoying♥♥♥♥♥♥that's plagued the console versions of WaW, the PC version was a refreshing change from all the god mode, no clip, infection, infinite ammo, XP hacking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s on consoles. Another major bonus of WaW on PC is custom zombies which, after being able to play as a shotgun wielding Patrick Star shooting up dozens of Bubble Buddy zombies, further solidified my love for WaW on PC. All in all, if you're a console gamer looking to escape the mess that is WaW on consoles, get yourself a decent PC, buy this game (preferably when it's on sale because $9.99 is a hell of a lot better than paying $19.99 for an almost eight year old game), and enjoy WaW before it went to♥♥♥♥♥♥on consoles. Oh, one word of advice for console gamers wanting to play this version of WaW, the mouse and keyboard makes it easier to aim in this game so don't be surprised when you get sniped dozens of times out of nowhere immediately after you spawn. 10/10 would pop hundreds of bubble buddies with a shotgun and get sniped out of nowhere immediately after spawning again.

												*EDIT* This is one of the last good Call of Duty games in my opinion. The Black Ops series was well put together also, and Advanced Warfare turned out to be good so far. But I always come back to this CoD, because of how simple it is, and the amount of people that still play this game after 6 Years of it's release. I love this game, because of the campaign and most of all the zombies. Considering that they have a lot of custom maps, it just makes this game worth playing anytime. I recommend this game to anyone who loves to play Call of Duty and the Zombies mode itself.			"

Posted: June 24, 2014
												To this day, Call of Duty: World at War still holds up as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time. To give a full perspective on the game, I will do this review in three parts:Campaign: Probably the weakest aspect of the game, but still fun to run around play through World War II environments. Its story feels a bit less personal and epic as some of the other titles (Modern Warfare, Black Ops), however it isn't by any means bad and can still be enjoyed. The mechanics of the campaign can be somewhat odd, with things like random grenade spawning which cause a bit of annoyance. But, on the whole it's still a fun time. World at War also has a co-op campaign feature, something that has not been seen since in the series.Multiplayer: This is where World at War really shines. In general, the game is designed around being skill based, and as such you are rewarded for being a good player. Now, that doesn't mean there isn't the occasional iffy mechanic in the game (martyrdom), however most of the time you earn your kills and deserve your deaths. The TTK (time to kill) is higher than other games, making gun accurasy and controlling recoil key. The game has generally very strong maps (Castle, Cliffside, Downfall, Nightfire etc.), and each map generally accomidates to a variety of skill sets and has a variety of sightlines (again, reinforcing good aim and gun control being rewarded). All in all, this game has a near perfect multiplayer and to this day remains a great experience. Bonus - Zombies: Although Zombies has come to be expected out of modern Treyarch Call of Duty titles, in World at War it was a hidden bonus mode that caught on like wildfire. That's right, World at War is where this whole zombies craze started. There are 4 zombies maps in total (although you can download additional countless ones via user created maps), including my personal favorite map Zombies map ever, Der Riese. However, every map is enjoyable. The biggest weakness in World at War's Zombies is the zombie grab, which can often cause frustration and being automatically down with no chance to get away. However, if you're good enough, you can avoid this for the most part. Although future games are more refined (and brought these maps back), World at War Zombies is still an incredibly enjoyable experience, and has an endless amount of mod content. Extra and Closing Thoughts: As I mentioned in the Zombies section, there is a wealth of moddable content for this game. This includes maps, guns, skins, modes etc., essentially creating a game you can spend an infinite amount of time and never be bored. In addition, PC players got ALL of World at War's DLC Content for free! However, it is worth noting that the community [as of mid 2014, 5.5 years after release] is slowly dying out, and you could eventually run into an issue finding a desireable game. That being said, this is an excellent game, one of my personal favorite FPS games of all time, and I highly recommend picking it up!			"

												An old but still effective FPS with a dramatic campaign that actually isn't an easy, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥movie like later CoD games. This game was probably the last reputable CoD that came out, taking place during World War II and utilizing great graphics for its day (stll looks decent now).  You will feel like a Soviet hero under Sgt.Reznov's paternalistic nationalism and hatred for Nazis, and you will sense the vulnerability of being ambushed as well as the intense blood letting throughout the Pacific theatre of the campaign. Unique and badass missions permeate this game, and I would have to argue it has the best ending of ANY Call of Duty game!Also, the nazi zombies mini game they added is a timless classic, and a must-play with friends on coop mode!

												Call of Duty World at War is a classic World War 2 First Person Shooter. Infact it is one of the better ones. In the Singleplayer Campaign you switch between two fronts: The Japanese-American and the Russian-German Front. Both Stories are alright, but the Russian one has way more Character Development than the American One. The Multiplayer is your Basic Call of Duty Multiplayer, but with (of course) WW2 Guns. The Multiplayer has small, but also some Bigger Maps. On some Big Maps you can even use Tanks to destroy your Enemies. After beating the Capmpaign you unlock the Zombie Mode ""Nazi Zombies"", which is the best thing about this game. Fight the undead horde round by round as long as possible. Arms yourself up with guns and perks and slay em all >:3. This game also supports mods. There are many mods for this game which add more zombie-Maps to play on. The modding Community is still active. If you like WW2 and Zombies CoD WaW is the game for you.			"

												This is the only call of duty game that actually doesnt suck.Custom zombies are good, multiplayer is actually great and there is no hackers thanks to this new plugin thats on every server :D and there was a online bug to create a profile that was actually easy to fix so if you have this problem just google it and you will find your fix quickly :D.

When playing on regular multiplayer you will need to watch for aim botters. It is not that wide of a issue so you wont run in to many. Overall one of my favorite games to play.			"

												Everybody buys this game for zombies, which is amazing, but I think that the rest of the game was and is highly underrated. The story mode is rich and exciting. Multiplayer is still very good to play on. I've had little to no trouble finding games and the servers have very few if any cheaters on them. Because it is a call of duty it uses the same gameplay mechanics that the most current one uses so to this day it still feels like a modern shooter. I would highly recommend this game... but wait for it to be on sale because it is not worth $20.			"

												Do you have friends? Of course you do, everyone has friends. Get 3 of your friends to buy this game and play co-op with you. The campaign is identical over co-op as single player, and its fun as hell! Step 2, go rent a teamspeak server because skype sucks. Jump on that mic and run through the campaign with your friends in one caffiene fuled night of pure call of duty bliss. Enjoy the call of duty franchise before it got ruined with 13 year olds on xbox live, a lack of dedicated servers, and constant product endorsements from mountain dew and doritos! -Pr0XIDIAN			"

												This game is absolutely amazing.  Many people consider it the last good cod came, and I wont say their wrong.  The campaign is intense, although quite gory.  The only downside i have founde is that almost every multiplayer server is hacked so you can barely play.  The primary reason I got this game was for zombies.  Well, custom zombies.  If you didn't know, you can download maps as a mod and play them.  You could also make them, but thats extremely difficult.  Overall, this is a great game and worth every penny.			"

I wish the COD team can go back to these kind of games and expecially zombies, I will definetly buy it, if they do.			"

												World at War is a game where it's fun to play for a while like zombies, then you are like, ""Only 4 maps? And I've play them all?"" Well then it's time to download maps. That is probably the only reason I bought this game is because of the custom maps made by the community. The community can make some really good and cool maps. The popular ones are the best and have some good customization. When I used to play this on ps3, I play the coop campaign all the time with my brother and we used to just beat it all the time cause we were both just good at WAW. Honestly, everyone played this on console, and then saw custom zombies and bought it for that only. I only play custom zombies and they never get old either. Recommend if you like custom zombies.

Some maps are straight up hilarious and other, battling to your last breath.4.Npc's-Npc's in this game are not those other npc's who shoot at walls over and over again and don't act like you want them to. 5.Multiplayer-This is never ending fun! I love themaps where you can drive tanks and battle tank vs. tank battles.6. Tis game is never laggy for me and my computer isn't the newest computer out there.7. If I had to rate this game it would be a 10/10, totally get this game!			"

												This is an honest review of Call of Duty: World at War   There's few games that really outshine this one. I've been playing this game for a long time, even though It says I've only got 70 or so hours at the moment. My favorite gamemode is by far the zombies, don't get me wrong, the campaign and multiplayer are fantastic. But the zombies is where this game really shines in my opinion.Pros:-Awesome story-Huge multiplayer maps with vehicles -Extremely realistic hardcore mode-Zombies-Custom, downloadable zombies and multiplaer maps-An actually quality level PC portCons:-Small-ish community-Very hard to get into low-ping public zombies servers-Graphics are outdated (not that it really matters to me, but it's a con for most people)-Crashes happen when you try to switch your online profile-Tanks are OP (as they should be, but its none the less annoying)FINAL VERDICT:  Overall, You could have many hours of fun with your friends in this game. If you have no friends who play this game, it is less of a rewarding experience. If you do buy this game, I would highly recommend playing through the campaign, it is really worth your time.SCORE: 9.5/10			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is a great game. The campaign is engaging and replayable, the multiplayer is fun and enjoyable, and the zombies mode that was introduced from this game that is still in the newer Treyarch titles is a fun game to play with friends.Pros-[Campaign]- Good story and characters, engages you, challenges you, and is only the lead into the stories of BO1 and 2.[MP]- People still play this almost 9 year old game.[MP]- Guns are varying, meaning you aren't going to get killed by one gun and one only (but beware of PPsh users)[ZM]- Simple and easy to learn.[ZM]- Fun for co-op or online.[ZM]- Custom zombies.[Campaign]- This is a personal opinion, but this game is gorey-er than other COD campaigns, and I think it impoves immersionCons-[Campaign]- Although I said its challenging, sometimes it's too much so.[Campaign]- The Pacific Theatre gets boring towards the end, and you almost want it to end there.[MP]- Juggernaut. Enough said.[MP]- Anymore, most servers are not vanilla, meaning it will probably be modded in some way.[ZM]- It gets repetitive after a while, due to simplicity.Final Verdict-Campaign- 8.75/10. It's good, but not amazing.Multiplayer- 9/10. Probably the best multiplayer in a COD game.Zombies- 9.5/10. The second best Zombies mode so far, only behind Black Ops 1.Overall [Average of all scores]- 9.11/10. My favorite COD, and to many others one of the best in the series.			"

												( First impression review )AWESOME game though can't find a single person to play classic zombies :/ but overall good game love it though the multiplayer is something eh i'm not use to lol i've played through black ops and mw3 multiplayer and waw's multiplayer is way better it feels way down to the game for new players i haven't seen stuff like this in along time my vote 10/10 recommend you buy it :D( Edit 1)After playing this game for x ammount of tme and running it through ""most"" of it's paces i've decided to edit my review of this game, the game is great all around but in some aspects/features it lacks so i'ma get down to my review at the bottom of this starting with the story mode.1. Story Mode/single player- I found this game's story quite good though it's very laggy and hard to get into at first I give it a 5/10.2. Story Mode/Co op - when playing the story mode with friends my game as well as theirs would crash for no appearant reason and i have yet to find the cause i give the co op story mode a 2/103. Networking/match making - when joining a co op round with a friend in rare times either person was unable to join the other's match and i have yet to find a cause or a fix to this issue and it is quite rare i give networking/matchmaking a 6/10 for all around.4. Solo mode zombies - I find this one of the best modes of the game i love it the most cause i can sit and play even with out cheats and go Very far in waves or rounds and have music playing with out worrying about my team mates i give solo mode zombies a 10/105. Co op Zombies - I find it hard to find a match for zombies it's sometimes none existant when it is most of the time it's modded maps or people using cheats of some kind but for just private matchs with friends i give the co op zombies a 10/10 for online use i give it a 0/10 because i can't play in a public match because it's mostly private premade teams now.6. Multiplayer - I like the Multiplayer of world at war but most of the servers are either using cheats or mods and it's extremely hard to find a match enless you custom search one for with out mods or cheats that is in the game mode you desire, Also with most servers the health is very low that being said in most servers the bullets that it takes to kill you are around 3 to 5 rather than almost a full clip depending on the right happen i find this a major disappointment because it's hard to find the guy and shoot him before he shoots me and most times it's a one shot from accross the map so i give multiplayer a 6/10.7. Graghics/ effects - I have yet to put these through their paces because i'm still running on low settings because my laptop sucks but when i get my new computer and re run this game at max i'll revise my review and add my rating on these but for now i can't.8. Sound effects - I have to give the sound effects a strong 9/10 they are superb 99 times in each match depending on the weapon.9. mechanics - the game is old that being said i can't even give it a strong review on these because of it being as old as it is so i'ma give the mechanics a 10/10 for them being as old as they are10. playerbase - This game has good playerbase alot of nice peopl and such and it's very easy to get a co op or co op zombie match going this being said i give it a 10/1011. Taking out of all my reviews i give the entire game a 8/10 for it's age and the fact that in some features i can't really put them through their full potential yet i will however do so when i get a better computer.

												7/10 - Campaign = Great | Multiplayer = Near DeathThe campaign is amazing. Still really fun to play. Typical awesome COD.Multiplayer is basically dead. There are some servers, but with heavy rules it's less fun to play than back in the day. Most servers are crouch only. Worth $10 for campaign.

												TL;DR at the bottom My second favorite Call of Duty! Ohhh my god this game! THIS GAME! I can't express to you how much I love Call of Duty: World at War. It's an EXTREMELY close second to Black Ops 2. This game was fun back in 2008 and is still fun to this day! Campaign: This is the last WWII game in the franchise which was sort of a bummer for some people. However, the campaign was really great. It was very long, you were always at the edge of your toes to see what happens next, lots of different gun variety, and you could even play the ENTIRE campaign MULTIPLAYER! This is the only Call of Duty game that let's you do that. Something that I think all the Call of Duty's should let you do. Multiplayer: Multiplayer is amazing  especially  on PC. I have this game for both PS3 and PC. While their may be more people playing it on the console version, the PC version is not hacked and there are community made mods like modern weapons, different gamemodes, and many more. Of course you can play your traditional / old school / classic World at War you know and love, but you do have variety. All matches are hosted on dedicated servers and all of them  can  go up to 64 PLAYERS! Not all servers are like this, but a good ammount of them are. The console version only went up to 18 as the max. So if you like classic World War II Multiplayer type shooters with a lot of gamemode variety, you'll love this! Nazi Zombies: This is where the game really shines (in my opinion) ESPECIALLY on the PC. If you've played WaW on PC, you know exactly what I'm talking about: CUSTOM ZOMBIES. Now before I go into that I'll go over original zombies first. WaW has only 4 zombies maps to choose from. You can play all of these Singleplayer and Multiplayer. This is the game where it all started. Thanks to Treyarch allowing mods for World at War on the PC, you have endless possibilities of different maps you can get. You can Google: ""Custom Zombie Maps"" and you'll get a bunch of results from different websites and map creators. If they could add Steam Workshop to this game, it would be WAY easier to get mods and custom maps for both Zombies and Multiplayer. World at War Zombies on the PC is HANDSDOWN one of the best Zombie experiences you'll ever have in a video game! TL;DR / Summary Overall, Call of Duty: World at War is one of the best Call of Duty games in the world! It is a must buy (in my opinion) if you haven't already tried the game out yet. This is one of the few cases where I recommend you get it on PC over console, because this is one of the fewer Call of Duty games that are SO MUCH BETETR on PC. Call of Dut: World at War is a fun experience for Singleplauer, Multiplayer, and Co-op and is a must have for WWII and Zombie fans!Overall rating 9.5/10!			"

												An amazing story, great characters, and surprisingly supurb graphics make it one of the best games in the Call of Duty franchise. Recently, they've just been focusing on the gameplay/weapons/utilities rather than the story itself. Another cool thing is, this still has a community of players -- +1,000 players strong. 8 years after release, it remains as one of the most well made CoD games.			"

												Recently bought this game on steam (put in alot of hours before on non-steam edition)Its a great game, my favorite part is the 4 player co-op option for the campaign, I don't understand why more games don't have this kind of feature. Along with that the storyline is heck of all fun, its not take one level and then copy-paste it and call it a campaign, the missions are actually unique through the entire game!The multiplayer is fine, its frustrating when people start camping in buildings, but its pretty rewarding to kill them and claim your revenge!By now most likely you're probably getting this game for Zombies, still somewhat active, but I wouldn't recommend playing on pub matches, playing with friends is really the only way to play this game, which is an awesome way to play. 7/10 (Zombies doesn't have a whole lot of maps, not a great many zombies matches, even then you do get kicked out of some of them, and multiplayer is frustrating at times, thats why its not 10/10)			"

												Unlike with my Black Ops 2 review, this game comes as one game under your Steam Library but is a 3 part game, Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies. So i will be doing the one review for the parts individually.WaW - CampaignIts Veteran Campaign is the hardest campaign i have ever completed on any game ever.  Regardless of wether it is a CoD or Battlefield or friggin' The Sims, i don't care it's purely hard.  Unfortunately (Or fortunately in this case) the Steam version of this game does not have achievements so i cannot prove i have completed it on Veteren, and honestly i havent completed it on Veteren on Steam.  I completed the Veteren campaign on the PS3 version of this game a long while back before i started PC gaming. After having gotten every single achievement and my Platinum Trophy i vowed to never ever ever attempt this Veteren Campaign again.  As i said earlier unfortunately this version doesnt have achievements so i dont have enough reason to attempt such a feat again to prove my worth. I can assure you back in the day there was much rage, controller throwing and much swearing loudly. I have since barely ever raged again, im pretty sure it's because no matter how hard something is or how much better a player in a multiplayer game is than me, there is always this Veteren campaign that is harder.Having said all of that i really enjoyed the campaign, despite it being clearly quite old by todays standards it's quite a fun campaign (as long as you are not attempting it on Veteren)WaW - MultiplayerThis game is old and this does reflect in the multiplayer games.  There are quite a lot of One Shot lobbies in the multiplayer mode, it seems to be the more popular due to how much fun the sniper rifles are in this game and how old it is too i guess.  You can find some normal team deathmatch games here too but its not a super busy game on the multiplayer servers from what i have seen, most people will have moved on to the newer CoD multiplayer games i imagine.WaW - ZombiesThis is the game mode that you buy this game for. World at War created Zombies, this was the first ever CoD game to put a zombies mode in.  Having said that you only get one base map which isnt that great.  What is pretty great is that all of the DLC for the Steam version of this game is completely free so you can get 3 other zombies maps too. This is unlike the PS3 version i played many moons ago in which i had to buy all the DLC. The DLC Zombies maps on this game do pale in comparison to the newer CoD games with zombies but that is to be expected since its the first time they have existed in CoD.So that is awesome you have 4 zombies maps just like the console versions. LOL. This is PC ♥♥♥♥♥ES!!!! For the PC version of this game you have a WHOLE COMMUNITY based on ZOMBIES.  There are literally THOUSANDS of Custom Built maps for this game. You can find such maps all completely FREE to download at many numorous websites that host links to maps made by Custom Mappers. You can see hundreds and thousands of videos on Youtube if you pretty much just type 'custom zombies' into youtube search bar to see huge varieties of maps. There are maps that are designed entierly from the map makers imagination or maps made based on real life enviroments wether it be the mappers workplace, house or local supermarket. There are maps based on TV shows such as The Simpsons, Family Guy, Spongebob Squarepants, My Little Pony - Yes i said My Little Pony!!Even i myself have made a few custom maps - the mod tools are free for anyone to use to create your own maps usually available from the many websites that host these maps alongside tutorials on how to use them and many forum posts giving advice on how to use them.So that is why you buy this game pretty much only for the custom zombies maps, you could spend probably over 2000 hours playing every single map for like 30 minutes each easy with probably some maps you could spend a few hours playing.Some of the websites you can find custom maps and tutorials on how to make your own etc:zombiemodding.comugx-mods.comundeadmodding.comtriple-mgames.comand so on, there are tonnes of them :P			"

												Honestly one of my all time favorite cods, no other cod has ever had the same spirit as waw. Waw felt terrifying at times, the match will get quiet until you hear the echo of a rifle crack across the map, taking out your teammates leg in a horrifying fashion. This was the only cod to ever actually feature real gibbing (aside from zombies and that scene in cod 4 where you shoot someones arm off). I always make fun of cod for being mindless and such but this one is considered (to me) to be the best and I would recommend it to ANYONE. Its replayability is almost infinite as long as there are friends and good servers. Also there are custom zombie maps if you get bored or just want a break from the originals.			"

												Remaster World at War Please for 2017 !!!FInal world war II game by call of duty , introducing the battlefront upon the pacific featuring the battle at okinawa and other major battles along the turning tides of pacific. Along the starts of the pacfic the major focus on the eastern front on the advance of the soviet red army into nazi germany , including battles such as the battle of stalingrad ,seige of berlin. However the main focus on private reznov on his story upon the leading events in call of duty black ops . Overall the multiplayer gameplay is very lacking as it faces the road of extinction with its population dying day by day .The best part of the game in focused on zombies as the game introduces the new zombie mode and first maps such as nachet de toten , verruckt , shi no nu ma and der ries , overall interesting game for everyone to consider getting !GAME IS STILL ALIVE !!!

To take away reproaches in secondariness (eventually, on this lawn CoD 1, 2 and 3 were trampled down), add the mad Japanese, the torn-off extremities, a mode of joint passing on four, expanded system the multipleernykh of ""perok"" and the mini-game Nazi Zombies. Ah yes, and the tank with self-repairing armor. Call of Duty: World at War — some step back in comparison with last game of a series, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The plot instead of the present offers again us cloyed World War II, however, with not the most boring campaigns — the USA here battle to Japan, and to punish Germans honor dropped out to the Soviet soldiers. Game process thus doesn't have ingenious statement, that is here, of course, both beautiful rollers, and qualitatively zaskriptovanny events, and various unexpected situations, but everything is made strictly ""on the four"", it is no more. As a result game which we will remember hardly in a year — so turned out, to take place, a little посражаться in a multiplayer and to forget. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).

												La verdad que cansado de tanta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ futurista me vine a pasar el world at war que nunca lo termine. el juego se desarrola en la segunda guerra mundial. y la verdad que en todo el juego se puede sentir una verdadera guerra.manejando a los us,  y a los rusos  sorprendentemente.  me gusto mucho los escenarios. tiene muy buenos graficos para ser un juego del 2008 en fin el juego realmente te logra meter en una guerra, tankes tiros pum pa , helicopteros. muchisimos soldados por momentos, en jugabilidad es bastante completo.ahora en historia bueno se baso en la segunda guerra mundial claramente, pero le falto personajes que uno digamos pueda  tenerle cariño es decir, soap, ghost, el capitan price. el unico esel  sargento reznov <3, tambien el juego no tiene practicamente cinematicas.pero en fin en lo demas el juego es muy bueno ^^ mi nota es un 8			"

Review:Even if you hate or dislike Call of Duty, this is more than just any other CoD. There are an array of free custom mods, maps, zombies, bosses, and more. I'm not going to complain about the $20 price tag either, because this game still has a large online multiplayer and plenty of mods to never leave you bored.Game-play:This game is by far, probably the best Call of Duty ever because it is the most fun, chaotic game-play experience for multi-player and zombies ever. (and there's still mods being released to this day!)Nostalgia:This game is my childhood, and the WWII genre is by far my favorite. I absolutely love this game, along with Black Ops 1* and CoD 4. I doubt anyone who buys this will be disappointed.*Black Ops 1's price tag is way too high, and the DLC is expensive as hell, so RIP my fav CoD game.			"

Posted: March 9, 2015
												CoD: World at War, is EASILY one of the best Call of Duty games ever made. First off, the game goes back to its WW2 roots, after the giant success which is Modern Warfare. The single player campaign is solid, it really helps that WaW focuses on some of the less popular battles from World War II, instead of giving you battles on D-Day at Normandy, which would have been like the millionth recreation within a WW2 game, the game covers an American campaign across multiple islands in the Pacific, as well as the Red Army's comeback at the battle of Stalingrad, which leads up to the Fall of Berlin. All of this provides lots of interesting new battlefields. You will still see some more familiar spots within bombed-out cities, and the farmlands of the Eastern Front missions, but it is all still incredibly well done. War, as you probably know, is an unforgiving and brutal affair, but the Pacific and the Eastern Front were especially so. In the game, Japanese soldiers will swarm you out of bushes, erupting straight out of spider holes and charge straight at you in an attempt to run you through with their bayonets. They'll play dead and wait for you to walk into the middle of a trap. Although the game is primarily set outdoors, most of the game is played in close quarters combat. Meanwhile, on the Russian Front, there are plenty of absoulutely merciless moments to be had. Soldiers on both sides of the war on this front, Russian, and German. Soldiers of both sides gun down wounded or unarmed soldiers, and sometimes you're asked to pull the trigger yourself in situations like this. But, this remains a Call of Duty game, through and through. What I mean by this, is that the action is both fast, and fluid, and the game is rigidly scripted. Enemy soldiers, as well as your computer-controlled teammates respawn endlessy until you advance far enough to hit the triggers to make them stop coming at you. Then, you find yourself at the next firefight, and repeat the process all over again, but, you're usually far too busy ducking, and shooting your way around the level, and occasionaly dying, to really notice this much of the time. The sense of immersion is really outstanding. There are plenty of deafinging, large-scale battles, but there's also a bit of variation to change things up. A perfect example is the PBY mission, where man the guns of a Navy aircraft, while you are in the midst of a raging air AND sea battle, taking fire, and fighting for your life, while trying to save the lives of sailors stranded in the water. All of this sounds great, but it hurts the game in one way. The narrative skips over months at a time, and showcases the major battles in the campaign. The result of this, is that the sense of story may not be as strong as you would expect it to be. In the end, the single-player campaign is relatively short, but it doesn't drag on too long to be unenjoyable either. And, as a bonus, there is a lot of replayability in the story, because the bulk of the campaign is playable in cooperative mode, with up to three other players. Multiplayer (while it has A LOT less players than console, or than when the game originally launched) is an area where WaW shines REALLY bright. Modern Warfare, quite arguably had on of the best multiplayer suites in history, and WaW built upon it. There is a create-a-class system, and a ranking system, that lets you unlock perks, weapons, and other general upgrades, that you can use as the building blocks for tailor your own personal load-out, and play-style. Kill-streaks are in the game, and are simmilar to Modern Warfare's, but with a twist more accurate to the time frame of the game. (UAV=Spotting Plane, Airstrike=Artillery Strike, Attack Helicopter=Attack Dogs)There is also plenty of game mades to choose from. Then, there's my personal favorite aspect to the game. Nazi. Mother♥♥♥♥ing. Zombies. Nazi Zombies is a game mode, where you and up to three others are put together against an endless onslaught of neverending waves of zombies. As you progress the waves get harder, either by adding more total zombies, making them faster, or both. You gain points for killing zombies, and rebuilding baricades, and these points can be used to buy weapons, ammo, and to open doors granting you access to other parts of the map. There's even a mystery box, which costs 950 points for every weapon, that gives you a random weapon. One of those van even be a ray gun, straight out of 1940's era pulp fiction. And, as an added bonus on PC, you get all 3 bonus maps included with the game, which cost 9.99 each on console, and the wonder of custom maps. You can download a free, and safe map launcher, from which you can download maps made buy the community, with the same rules as before, unless changed by the creator. Overall, the game is PACKED with a ridiculously deep amount of gameplay, with appeal to almost every kind of player. All the way from those who want to experience a gritty solo campaign, those who want to play with their friends, and those just want to play the multiplayer. The game is an awesome addition to the franchise, with plenty to offer to the casual gamer, and the hardcore gamer alike.-----9.75/10			"

												The game, for the most part, is quite ""fair"".Some of the guns are kinda better than others but not so much it breaks the game (Like the Recent Cods)You can ride tanks, play with 48 other players, and have friends to play coopSteam is yet to be intergrated into this, and it might never will, so think of an original name.Hackers are nowhere to be seen unlike the console versions.Finally the campaign is good enough to play, as you arent the super mach Mason.Instead you are a pvt, with multiple superioirs at your assistance.

												One word: AwesomeBut for real this game was my first COD and will always have a place in my heart. It has everything. A cool and interesting story line when you switch between 2 different soldiers. One fighting Japan and the other taking back Russia. But the best part comes when you play zombies. When I first played this game on my Xbox all I did was play zombies. It was what made me get into zombies today. A couple years latter I get a good computer and buy this game. My friend tells me to download this map for zombies called Cheese Cube. So I did and I had a blast. This game is amazing and forever will be my favorite COD.-Unscripted			"

												Easily one of if not my favorite CODs, this game is the one that changed it all. The great story, great characters and gameplay it offers a great variety of missions to play. I have always been into COD Zombies and because of the mod options of this one, you can make it almost an entirely different game. It really is hard to find something to complain about here, even though the graphics may not be Order 1866 level it still holds up and the dark grays and blood help set the mood. I got this game when it was on sale. but I think it is fully worth its base price and is a game I still play to this day.			"

												I used to play this game when I was younger, and I'm certain that I can say my younger self would agree with me when I say that this game is pretty bloody stellar. I really enjoyed the campaign in the sense that it explored both the American and Russian parts of the war. However, I think that the most fantastic aspect about this game is the Nazi Zombies mode, where you can choose whether to play the very amazing zombies maps, from the basic yet challenging-to-reach-high-rounds Nacht Der Untoten, to Der Riese, which I found very fun to play with a couple of friends, or you could download custom zombies maps, made by fellow Call of Duty: World at War fans. The maps are usually original or inspired from other games. Overall, worth buying and a very fun game.			"

												Probably the last really good CoD game until Black Ops 2 came around. Get it for the action packed story and retro multiplayer. And stay for the zombies, which the community has taken into a massive extent with custom maps galore for hours upon hours of fresh undead slaying fun. Comes with all previously released DLC I believe. Honestly i'd reccomend it just for the zombies alone			"

												My second favorite Call of Duty of all time. In my unpopular opinion, it achieved the greatness Call of Duty 4 was going for but didn't fully conquer. It's an authentic World War II shooter with plenty of weapons of the era to choose from. The story (which can be played in co-op) and characters are for the most part very good despite being significantly short, and the gameplay is frantic and exciting. The multiplayer is amazing in pretty much every sense, with an unconventional design for Call of Duty's standards. This was the one in the series that started zombies as well, and while Nacht Der Untoten isn't a highlight of the game mode it is raw and hardcore, and Der Riese is outstanding especially with friends. Filled with mysteries. The mode also gave birth to the marvelous soundtrack provided by Kevin Sherwood & Elena Siegman. Treyarch did a fine job with this one. 8.1/10.0 "

And I must say this one is by far the best on PC.Why?CUSTOM NAZI ♥♥♥♥ING ZOMBIES, THAT'S WHY! You can go to certain websites that allow you to download Zombie Maps made by people, and there are maps still being created to this day! It never gets old!You can play them on solo but playing with people is just so much more fun!Five years from now I will still be playing this game.Maybe Treyarch will revamp this game in the future ;)Definitely worth $19.99 for the amount of custom maps you can get for yourself.

Custom Zombies was the main reason I bought this game and I have played about 100+ hours and have a blast playing this game! Their is map being created everyday and you'll never get bored of played the zombies! Call of Duty: World at War has the best Original Zombies experience and the only Custom Zombie experience! If you love Call of Duty Zombies and Call of Duty in general, you should totally buy this game, I recommend it 100%. This is a game you must have. -AaronModzz			"

												Call of Duty WAW is the best cod out there because I didn't like the way that the sucky black ops and modern warfare francise that  wasn't fun because of the the noob tubes and other crap. Also WAW is the spawn of zombies and is the only call of duty that has tanks in Multyplayer!So that's my review of WAW the best call of duty out there.			"

												Experience the gritty realism of World War 2 in Call of Duty: World At War. The brutality of russia's Red Army and terror that US marines faced by the Imperial soldiers, soldiers screaming in agony and reaching for lost limbs gives you a glimpse of the grim reality of ww2. A must-have for the ""real"" ww2 experience.			"

												Welcome to another episode of Agrobal reviews an ""FPS"" :DJust as I was about to expect the same from every Call of Duty game, I get surprised by this campaign. It reminds me a lot of CoD pre-mainstream era. I actually like this campaign a lot. The usual running and gunning here and there. Annoying japanese soldiers that wont stop saying BANZAAAAIIII. Kiefer Sutherland's voice is magical. Maybe it is his voice that acts like a spell I am under. The gameplay is the same. I'd like to bring up the fact that I noticed in every CoD campaign, the player is a grenade magnet. At one point I was late reach an objective, the AI was ready to ambush me with 4 grenades at once--BOOM. Nothing underwhelming here, I am just glad I turned a blind eye after finishing the campaign and reading ""zombies"".			"

												7.5/10Pros: -Nazi Zombies!-A pretty decent campaign that offers replayability value-Great multiplayer, but it's slowly dying :(-WWII shooter-Great selection of WWII shooters-Focuses on the Pacific Theatre of War for a changeCons:-For both charaters (Miller and Dmitri) it starts off in 1942 (Makin Raid for Miller, Stalingrad for Dmitri) then all of the sudden it skips to 1944 for Miller and 1945 for Dmitri. So much happened that wasn't explored. -Sort of branching off from the last con, there was little to no character development. Of course, it's Call of Duty and you play it to shoot down endless waves of bad guys but I think it would have been nice to show changes in characters. -Historically awkward. For example, the only tanks you see for the Russians is the T-34-85, which makes sense because that was the most produced tank the Russians made but they had dozens of other tank models. They had at least 3 other variants of the T-34, the IS tank series and the SU TD's. -Rock music in a WWII shooter. wtf?-Gets repititive very quicklyBuy it on sale, 20.00 is steep especially for its age.

Posted: December 8, 2016
												Call of Duty: World at War is a 2008, historical first-person shooter that takes place in the Pacific Front between the United States and Japan, including the Eastern Front between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Developed by Treyarch and published by Activision, the game takes a different approach than previous Call of Duty titles as the presentation takes a gritty look into the world conflict. The dark overtone, gore, and the true nature of warfare is presented. Does Call of Duty: World at War has your attention?As mentioned earlier, World at War takes a gritty look into World War II than its predecessors. The atmosphere is grim and depressing as you fight your way to Berlin as Private Dimitri Petrenko or as Private Miller hearing the scream of Japanese soldiers charging your positions or the death sirens of burning men. The presentation is outstanding and the game takes inspiration from mature war documentaries (actual combat footage from the Pacific and Eastern Front) or recent war films from the 1990s to the present time. The game does not restrict the nature of warfare. The graphics is pretty solid, even for the game that came out in 2008. Besides the graphics and presentation, the sound effects are actually impressive, ranging from the M1 Garand “ping” sound, the M1919 Browning machine gun, the German FG42, the Japanese Type 99 LMG, and many other weaponries. Kudos to Treyarch for the sound effects. The voice acting from Kiefer Sutherland and Gary Oldman are solid and memorable. Lastly, the campaign was good, even great with intense moments from the Soviet and American campaigns. While World at War has many, outstanding attributes, there are some negative factors that must be taken into consideration. First, the Veteran (hardest) difficulty is a joke. Grenade spamming from enemy AI, unlimited enemy spawn, and lack of a legitimate challenge is a disaster for the Veteran difficulty level. The only way possible to end unlimited enemy spawning is to move forward (and do not stop). The infamous, Heart of the Reich level was a lot of stress when you have to destroy the 4 Flak88 guns while being grenade spammed, dodging enemy AI fire, and healing yourself. Unfortunately, Treyarch was unable to balance out the Veteran difficulty into an actual difficulty challenge without feeling cheated or cop-out. Some of the weapon modeling in the game feels odd and looks weird, particularly the Japanese Arisaka bolt-action rifles, the Thompson, and the pistols from all factions. While this factor might consider as a “neutral” factor, I also noticed a notable amount of over-the-top explosions, cinematic moments in the game when shooting at Japanese boats and ships or buildings. Admittedly, I find the explosions a bit excessive, leaning more into Michael Bay territory but this is based upon personal taste. Lastly, the sale price is a bitter disappointment from Activision. I already mentioned this on my (original) Call of Duty review, but this has to be addressed again. Call of Duty: World at War was released the year after Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. The game fell under MW’s shadow and many gamers were favoring more on present time military setting than World War II or historical shooters. World at War was considered as one of the last World War II titles in the 7th generation of video game consoles (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo Wii generation) and this was before the long drought on no historical first-person shooters until the recent revival and interest of World War II (and historical) games in 2014/2015. I didn’t play much of the Nazi zombies cooperative multiplayer, but the impressions were pretty good in the PC version, especially with the mods. Call of Duty: World at War is, arguably, the last historical shooter for the franchise, and probably the last, great Call of Duty game before the franchise lost its original identity (starting from Ghosts). World at War has my highest recommendation for its gritty, historical presentation, moderate replay value in the single player campaign, and Nazi zombie cooperative multiplayer for the hardcore audience.

												Call of Duty: World at War - The 5th Installment in the Call of Duty SeriesThe vanilla game comes with three different modes: multiplayer, campaign and zombies.If you are buying this game for the campaign or multiplayer, I would recommend going for a different game such as Call of Duty 4. That game on PC has a much better package for those who like these two features. Regardless, the campaign on this game is phenominal and is worth playing through at least once. Likewise, the multiplayer is good but there are not always a lot of people on. The severs are dedicated, so each server is ran by someone in the world. This means that there is a plethora of custom content added to each server, making the multiplayer both fun and diverse. However, despite all of this, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND buying this game if you are a zombies fan. You will absolutely not regret it.After 700+ hours and countless maps, this game has brought nothing but enjoyment. It is safe to say that this game is probably the longest lasting and most exciting Call of Duty for PC. While its community is small, the amount of dedication that is put into this game and its custom content is phenominal. There is still content coming out today and each map is filled with mixed emotions, whether it is the sigh of distress from a new box map to the amazement of Black Ops 3-esque level of detail in maps.Looking at where custom maps started until now, we were able to add new perks (from existing Call of Duty titles and from our imaginations), add buildables, add new guns and create a new format for playing zombies. Buyable endings have become a norm, swiftly replacing that of high rounds in order to increase some maps replayability. Comparatively, these easter eggs generally take a day or two to figure out by some, but are extremely satisfying if found by ones self.For those looking for places to find good custom maps:ugx-mods.com (for the newest and latest custom zombie maps)zombiemodding.com (for the largest bank of custom maps)zommods.com (for the generally more popular custom maps)Any other site not mentioned usually overlaps these sites in content.Regardless of your experience in zombies, this game is definitely for the zombies fanatic. All skill levels are met. If you are a hardcore fan, there are plenty of great/difficult custom maps. If you are just learning, or not that good, there are a ton of box maps to begin learning the game on.In my opinion, if you are looking to get: World at War, Black Ops 1, Black Ops 2, Black Ops 3 ----- Get World at War. It's face value is a surpreme bargain. There are at least 1000 maps so it is well worth it over the other zombie games. This opinion may change in the future as Black Ops 1 is slowly gaining steam toward custom maps (it already has some great custom mods though, and in my opinion custom maps is pretty late for that game) and Black Ops 3 is going to be getting mod tools soon for the public. With what has been shown, Black Ops 3 will more than likely become World at War's successor in terms of custom zombies. So look towards purchasing that game once we get some more information. The possibilities will be endless for that game.Overall, I give this game an 7/10 for the vanilla game for PC specifically, (4 zombies maps/Multiplayer/Campaign) because of how many people are online at the moment and what you will be getting for face value.When you take all of the custom content in consideration I would give the game an easy 10/10. Think about it, you would be paying $20 USD, or 10-15 on sale days, for a game with hundreds of custom maps, equating to 1000's of hours of play time. It is a deal you can not pass up on.10/10-UltzZ "

Unless you prefer Multiplayer, which is still very full and plentiful of players and servers, or the campaign, with one of the better stories CoD has to offer. The zombie community started here, and as grown ever brighter since then. The custom zombie maps and mods are extremely well worth it, and a great play with friends.			"

												Although I reference multiplayer, this review focuses more on Campaign and Zombies.Call of Duty: World at War is mostly good. The Russian campaign is very much close to the older Call of Duty games, and the introduction of Nazi Zombies was a signficant feature for Treyarch. However, World at War has key flaws that prevent it from being amongst the best of the franchise.The game is a step in the right direction for the series however, with features added by United Offensive and the console-only Call of Duty 3 making a return, such as the ability to comandeer vehicles in multiplayer. Mod support is also a strength for this game in multiplayer, with custom zombies being a highlight of the game.The campaign is okay. The Russian half is well done, featuring a mix of large open battles and tight sniping moments. The American campaign has more weak spots than the Russian campaign, such as the QTE's if a Banzai gets to close that can end up becoming a constant annoyance in the campaign, as well as the pacing, its just the worst of the World War 2 campaigns. The game on both ends tries to have you build emotional links with members of your squad, but the characters are not that memorable, outside of Reznov (which is probably due to him being a main character in the Treyarch games).Engine-wise, the textures are clearly quite low-res, even on maximum settings. The added gore is a nice touch, wtih arms, legs and heads being blasted off. This also leads to new animation assets not present in the gameplay of other Call of Duty games. Ultimately, the games visuals are clearly held back by the fact that the game is still using the same engine used in Call of Duty 2.Ultimately, World at War is still a good Call of Duty game.The variety of missions, including tank commanding and airplane gunning makes the campign still stand out, the soundtrack, especially on the final Russian missions stands out, and the modding community continues to still expand the game with custom-made content. This game also includes all the DLC from the console version included in free updates. Although it isn't as solid as what came before, it still plays better than anything that came afterwards.			"

												Certainly not the greatest shooter. Nor is it unique and groundbreaking. But its a damn good WWII shooter that is fun and exciting.The production value of COD is what makes this title stand out from the congested subgenre. It scratched that itch that I have been having for a long time, that Enemy Front couldnt fulfill, although I have to give that title another shot. I applaud the devs for trying to picture WWII in a more horrific, darker and grittier portrayal, especially when playing as the Russians. This is the Call of Duty I remember and enjoyed.  8/10. Would double-tap that again.			"

												Being somebody that has been a fan of Zombies ever since its debut, I strongly recommend this game to any CoD Zombie fan. While the Treyarch maps are good, they eventually grow tiresome and you are left waiting for the next installment. With World @ War, you will never have that problem thanks to the modding community.Custom Zombies are amazing, some of the maps being as good as those made by Treyarch, some even better. Even after owning this game for so long, I find myself going back it when a talented person releases a new map. Trust me, Zombie Fans, this game is worth a purchase. Lock, load and slay up into the high rounds or die trying, this game will never get old.  "

												Infinity Wards WWII Russian campaigns have always been the weakest of the Original Call Of Duty games for me, usually with no central ally unlike the other nations campaigns which included Captain Foley or Captain Price etc. It seems Treyarch learned from Infinity Wards mistake however because the Russian campaign in WaW is fantastic. Led throughout by Resnov through some brilliant missions culminating in a remake of the original Call Of Duty's assualt on the Berlin headquarters the Russian segment oozes quality. The US section however is the weakest this time around which doesn't make it bad just not up to the standard of the Russian campaign.The visuals in this game bring war torn streets and buildings of Europe to life like non of the previous games in the series and the enhanced body damage finally makes grenades and high powered machine guns satisfying as they rip through the bodies of your enemies.I find it difficult to decide which games is better between this and CoD 2 because this is a lot more linear in it's level design and CoD 2 has massive maps with multiple objectives.However WaW is a great single player campaign and also the first in the series to introduce zombie mode for added longevity.Fantastic entry into the WWII series of CoDs and maybe even the best one.

												It's a great game with countless hours of fun (10 hours in 3 days) and Modded Zombie maps? AWESOME! Its graphics arent that great, but that means less lag. I wouldnt reccomend this game to a all-Multiplayer person though. The Multiplay (Not CO-OP) is kinda laggy and filled with hackers. Also, it has a very strong and enjoyable Campaign that you can play co-op. which makes it so much better. Best WWII game i know, and probably best CoD out there.Graphics: 7/10Audio: 7/10Gameplay: 11/10Multiplayer: 3/10Guns: 9/10Zombies/Custom Maps: 10000/10  "

												If you don't like Call of Duty: Zombies then stop reading this post right now and stop considering buying this game. You won't like it. I can't say much for multiplayer or campaign aspects of this game, but the zombies and modded zombies are truly extensive and amazing. I think the greatest thing about a lot of the custom zombies maps is that they have an end other than the death of the player(s). All in all it's a game well worth the buy, but if you don't have much money just wait for a sale (Steam has a lot of those... LOL). If you are a Call of Duty gun nerd then this is certainly a good pick because the maps have guns from every Call of Duty ever. From the good ol' not-so-classics like MW3 to the new games like AW and BO3, you name them, they're there. Also the maps have a number of themes from holiday's to movies, even original ideas. Easter eggs are a large part of the good maps nowadays, you'd be unlucky to find a good map without a zombies gun game mode too! Definitley recommend this game to anyone and everyone above the age of 12.			"

												Call of Duty hasn't sat right with me since 4:Modern Warfare, but World at War grabbed me with it's extreme grittiness.What makes World at War so special, is how it portrays World War II. Where as past Call of Duty games had light violence, World at War is the only Call of Duty game to feature full on gibbing, as well as bullet impaction gibbing. This and the chilling and scary atmosphere that is all throught the game, makes this the last modern Call of Duty game I've enjoyed ever.It's Call of Duty, so you shoot opposing soldiers to get to the other end of the map. It's linear, and completely cinematic, but that never really bothered me in this game. World at War is the last WWII Call of Duty game (at least at the moment), and to me it was the last Call of Duty I could enjoy			"

												The German army began the blitzkrieg on 10 May 1940, the German Army Group B, led by Fedor von Bock, assaulted the BEF on 14 May. As Army Group B pushed the Allied forces back towards the French frontier, the German Army Group A, led by Gerd von Rundstedt, invaded France through the Ardennes. This caught the French unawares. The French High Command was sure that the expensive line of underground forts on the Maginot Line would stop any German attack. The Germans, however, decided not to attack this line. Instead they attacked the weakest part of the French defences, the Ardennes. This was a heavily wooded area that seemed unsuitable for tanks. The French had assumed it was unsuitable for tanks because it was a hilly and wooded area. French resistance crumbled as the German tanks raced to the Channel coast, where the Germans planned to cut off the retreat of the British Expeditionary Force. The German forces simply bypassed the Maginot line which was a situation not anticipated by the defending Allies. The offensive by Army Group A cut communications between French and British commands and after approaching Sedan the German group turned northwards. On 13 May 1940, the Germans launched a Blitzkrieg attack on Belgium and Holland. It was an outstanding success. German attacks rolled swiftly across Holland and Belgium. Dutch attempts to delay the German advance by opening the dykes and flooding the land were ineffective. The Germans used glider planes to land behind the Belgian line of defences and outflank their defenders. Holland surrendered in five days after a huge bombing of Rotterdam. Thirteen days later the Belgians surrendered. The Netherlands and Luxembourg were overrun by 19 May. . By 20 May 1940, huge numbers of British and French soldiers found themselves cut off from the rest of their forces. The push by Army Group A towards the coast combined with the approach of Army Group B from the northeast left the BEF surrounded on three sides by 21 May. The British forces attempted to stop the offensive and launched counter-attacks including at Arras on 21 May. Fortunately for the British, on 20 May, Hitler gave the order to the German commander, Guderian, to stop his tanks in order to allow the Luftwaffe, the German air force, to complete the destruction of the British and French forces. This was a mistake which allowed the British time to regroup. However, the BEF was unable to repel the Germans and it became clear that the Channel ports were threatened. Fresh troops were rushed from England to defend Bolougne and Calais, but after hard fighting, both ports were in German hands by 26 May. General Gort ordered that the BEF should withdraw to Dunkirk, the only port remaining, for evacuation. The British launched ‘Operation Dynamo’. Between 27 May and 4 June, as the Luftwaffe pounded the beaches, the Royal Navy and a host of vessels ranging from yachts to pleasure boats crossed the Channel to rescue the stranded troops.  "

												Call of Duty: World at War was the first COD game to include zombies and I owned this on xbox at one point. it was fun but you had to pay for the extra maps. On PC you don't have to pay for any of the maps and even after they get boring the mods are endless and I mean that literally they are endless. I don't really enjoy multiplayer or the story mode so I can't say much about it but I have played the first 2 missions of story mode and from what I've played it seems pretty cool. Call Of Duty: World at War is 100% worth $40 and if you love COD Zombes you will love this game.			"

												Classic CoD mechanics with a solid campaign. The MP is still somewhat active (around 10 servers) and while it is not perfect it is worth playing for the WW2 themes in it, which would come like a breath of fresh air for fans of the modern warfare franchise. The zombie mode is very fun, very addicting to play with 2+ friends and it is not hard to get people to join your game in this mode.Totally worth it at a low price if you're a fan of the Treyarch games.

												Call of Duty: World at War, also referred to as Call of Duty 5 or simply World at War, and abbreviated as CoD: WaW or WaW, is a first-person shooter game produced by Treyarch, and is the first game in the ""Black Ops"" timeline. It was released on November 11, 2008 in North America and on November 14, 2008 in Europe. It was announced on December 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2008; the 64th anniversary of D-Day, Treyarch announced it would be named as ""World at War"" and it would take place in the Pacific theater of war as well as the Eastern Front.There is one campaign in the game divided into two: the American campaign and the Soviet campaign. The Soviet campaign is returning after having last been present in Call of Duty 2. There is no British campaign in the game, making World at War the only major Call of Duty set in the Second World War not to feature a British Campaign or a British playable character. It features both a solo and co-op campaign, however both are the same except that co-op is played with multiple people and certain missions are absoloutly unplayable.The American campaign is set in the Pacific theater on the islands of Makin, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The Soviet campaign is set in the Eastern Front, mainly in Nazi Germany. In the American campaign, players take the role of Pvt. C. Miller as he fights alongside Sgt. Tom Sullivan, Cpl. Roebuck (later Sergeant), and Pvt. Polonsky. In the Soviet campaign, players take the role of Pvt. Dimitri Petrenko as he fights alongside the merciless Sgt. Viktor Reznov and the merciful Pvt. Chernov. In the American campaign, players, for the first time in a Call of Duty game, fight against the Japanese Imperial Army. Most combat takes place in jungles, where ambushes are likely. Combat also takes place in small mortar pits, ridges, beach heads, Japanese trenches, and small villages. Bunkers are a common sight in the American campaign, usually causing heavy casualties. In the Soviet Campaign, players fight against the German Wehrmacht during the push towards Berlin. Combat takes place, at first, in the ruins of Stalingrad where the player is mainly a sniper. After that, combat occurs in farmland and forests of the German town of Seelow, and finally Berlin is assaulted and close quarter fighting becomes a common feature. The last mission of the Soviet campaign sees the Red Army capture the Reichstag and the player planting the Soviet Flag on top of the building.			"

Had about 300 hours on the PS3 version.Balanced WWII shooter..no submachin guns reaching across the maps. No running at full sprint speed carrying a giant LMG. No snipers jumping up and down acting like an ape with a rifle trying to shoot you in the head.10/10 R.I.P. the best call of duty. You will be missed "

												Call of Duty: World at War was the first COD game to include zombies and I owned this on xbox at one point. it was fun but you had to pay for the extra maps. On PC you don't have to pay for any of the maps and even after they get boring the mods are endless and I mean that literally they are endless. I don't really enjoy multiplayer or the story mode so I can't say much about it but I have played the first 2 missions of story mode and from what I've played it seems pretty cool. Call Of Duty: World at War is 100% worth $40 and if you love COD Zombes you will love this game.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War, also referred to as Call of Duty 5 or simply World at War, and abbreviated as CoD: WaW or WaW, is a first-person shooter game produced by Treyarch, and is the first game in the ""Black Ops"" timeline. It was released on November 11, 2008 in North America and on November 14, 2008 in Europe. It was announced on December 2, 2007, and on June 6, 2008; the 64th anniversary of D-Day, Treyarch announced it would be named as ""World at War"" and it would take place in the Pacific theater of war as well as the Eastern Front.There is one campaign in the game divided into two: the American campaign and the Soviet campaign. The Soviet campaign is returning after having last been present in Call of Duty 2. There is no British campaign in the game, making World at War the only major Call of Duty set in the Second World War not to feature a British Campaign or a British playable character. It features both a solo and co-op campaign, however both are the same except that co-op is played with multiple people and certain missions are absoloutly unplayable.The American campaign is set in the Pacific theater on the islands of Makin, Peleliu, and Okinawa. The Soviet campaign is set in the Eastern Front, mainly in Nazi Germany. In the American campaign, players take the role of Pvt. C. Miller as he fights alongside Sgt. Tom Sullivan, Cpl. Roebuck (later Sergeant), and Pvt. Polonsky. In the Soviet campaign, players take the role of Pvt. Dimitri Petrenko as he fights alongside the merciless Sgt. Viktor Reznov and the merciful Pvt. Chernov. In the American campaign, players, for the first time in a Call of Duty game, fight against the Japanese Imperial Army. Most combat takes place in jungles, where ambushes are likely. Combat also takes place in small mortar pits, ridges, beach heads, Japanese trenches, and small villages. Bunkers are a common sight in the American campaign, usually causing heavy casualties. In the Soviet Campaign, players fight against the German Wehrmacht during the push towards Berlin. Combat takes place, at first, in the ruins of Stalingrad where the player is mainly a sniper. After that, combat occurs in farmland and forests of the German town of Seelow, and finally Berlin is assaulted and close quarter fighting becomes a common feature. The last mission of the Soviet campaign sees the Red Army capture the Reichstag and the player planting the Soviet Flag on top of the building.			"

												Certainly not the greatest shooter. Nor is it unique and groundbreaking. But its a damn good WWII shooter that is fun and exciting.The production value of COD is what makes this title stand out from the congested subgenre. It scratched that itch that I have been having for a long time, that Enemy Front couldnt fulfill, although I have to give that title another shot. I applaud the devs for trying to picture WWII in a more horrific, darker and grittier portrayal, especially when playing as the Russians. This is the Call of Duty I remember and enjoyed.  8/10. Would double-tap that again.			"

												Although I reference multiplayer, this review focuses more on Campaign and Zombies.Call of Duty: World at War is mostly good. The Russian campaign is very much close to the older Call of Duty games, and the introduction of Nazi Zombies was a signficant feature for Treyarch. However, World at War has key flaws that prevent it from being amongst the best of the franchise.The game is a step in the right direction for the series however, with features added by United Offensive and the console-only Call of Duty 3 making a return, such as the ability to comandeer vehicles in multiplayer. Mod support is also a strength for this game in multiplayer, with custom zombies being a highlight of the game.The campaign is okay. The Russian half is well done, featuring a mix of large open battles and tight sniping moments. The American campaign has more weak spots than the Russian campaign, such as the QTE's if a Banzai gets to close that can end up becoming a constant annoyance in the campaign, as well as the pacing, its just the worst of the World War 2 campaigns. The game on both ends tries to have you build emotional links with members of your squad, but the characters are not that memorable, outside of Reznov (which is probably due to him being a main character in the Treyarch games).Engine-wise, the textures are clearly quite low-res, even on maximum settings. The added gore is a nice touch, wtih arms, legs and heads being blasted off. This also leads to new animation assets not present in the gameplay of other Call of Duty games. Ultimately, the games visuals are clearly held back by the fact that the game is still using the same engine used in Call of Duty 2.Ultimately, World at War is still a good Call of Duty game.The variety of missions, including tank commanding and airplane gunning makes the campign still stand out, the soundtrack, especially on the final Russian missions stands out, and the modding community continues to still expand the game with custom-made content. This game also includes all the DLC from the console version included in free updates. Although it isn't as solid as what came before, it still plays better than anything that came afterwards.			"

												Despite having the completely unenviable job of following up CoD4, WaW manages to be pretty decent even if it does not quite match its predecessor's level of quality. Taking the series back to WW2, this game, rather than going to the classic and arguably overused setting of Western Europe (USA/Britain/Canada/etc vs Germany in 1944-45), you instead go to the Ostfront (Germany vs USSR) and the Pacific (USA vs Japan). One thing that is captured really well in this game is the dark and merciless nature of the fighting on these two fronts: you see executions of prisoners and unarmed soldiers trying to surrender (VERY common occurances on these two fronts committed by both sides), and a few times you are even asked to pull the trigger yourself. Ugly, but refreshing too since it ensures that this game isn't just another ""America ♥♥♥♥ Yeah WW2"" game where its good vs evil, but a much more realistic and morally grey experience. The history nut in me liked this little detail enough that this alone would make me recommend this game, if only to get a glimpse of how vicious the war between the Americans and Japanese, and especially the Germans and Soviets, truly was.Honestly though, it's a decent game for shooter fans too and not just crazies like me. Though this is also the game that introduced the Zombie mode to CoD, so that could be a potential turn-off for you. Still, you can have fun with this one.			"

												I would reccomend World at War only for it's coop campaign or modable zombies. However the Multiplayer is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful (no suprise there) but what makes it even worse is that there is 60 players per server making it a huge cluster ♥♥♥♥, there are high XP servers that enable me to prestige every 40 minutes and I still feel it is taking too long. However the zombies on this game does outway the negatives of the multiplayer because of the ability to download modsI rate World at War 7/10			"

												I played over 50+ hours of this game on the PS3 with no DLC, now that the PC version comes with DLC, I might just add another 50 hours on this. I want to say the Pros and Cons with WAWPRO-Great graphics that hold up to today-a toaster can run it-windows 10 compatible -Amazing story line-solid AF gameplay -Community is very active, and there are a lot of filled servers (filled with players... which is a good thing)- Zombies after single player-10/10 zombies maps-custom zombies♥♥♥♥♥♥TON OF CONTENT!!!CON-I beat singleplayer in two hours (it's a little short)-A ton of the multiplayer servers are modded-No EXO SUITS (0/10 DO NOT BUY NO EXO'S)-If you don't like COD, then use your brain and don't buy it-only buy if on sale, cuz why not?Rating: 9/10 -IGN			"

												Call of Duty: World at War PROS AND CONS==============PROS---------------------- Friendly multiplayer community- Fun zombies, especially custom maps- Intriguing campaign- Never gets old, even after 7 years- Still very populated- Inexpensive WWII simulator- No port forwarding required to host a private server for your friends- Most perks I've seen in a [respectably decent] CoD game---------------------CONS---------------------- Graphics aren't the best- Zombies can get boring after round 15 on about every map- Even though custom zombies maps are fun, they can be difficult to install- Modders/hackers on undedicated servers- Often cracked TDM servers with too much XP- Almost all TDM servers are Hardcore Mode- Little to no public zombies servers- Easy to use cheats on any server (Mostly private, though)==============What would I rate this game?---------------------I would give this game a solid3.5 out of 5 stars.---------------------OTHER COMMENTS---------------------Pretty solid game for 2008. Well done, Treyarch.			"

												This game is amazing, i love it.  I wish call of duty would have more world war 2.... But no, they still make call of duty games that take place in like 2058.  The campaign was so fun to play, in one campaign level you get to drive around in a tank and blow up stuff.  Who doesn't love blowing stuff up while driving around in a tank??  The best part about the campaign is that one of the characters, Viktor Reznov is played by Gary Oldman who he's a famous actor in many films such as the Dark Knight or Harry Potter.I tried custom zombies, i see that most custom zombie maps are poorly made (don't ask me to play custom zombies with you.)Overall I like this game, the only call of duty game that is the best, second being the modern warfare trilogy.

												Probably the last near-perfect Call of Duty to be made, Campaign is really cool and challenging on Veteran difficulty, the multiplayer, as hard as it may be to find a lobby with no hackers it's a fun multiplayer, but the main reason I think everyone should purchase this game is because of Zombies, It has the four DLC map packs plus the endless possibilities of custom zombies maps! 9/10 (9 because you can't really enjoy all the games features because of the multiplayer hackers)			"

												Ah Call of Duty, synonymous with 12 years olds and at least 2 years of our own pent up rage, this isn't going to be an entirely hate driven review, more to the point and not a review of the community that plays it.W@W is the last Call of Duty that features built in mod support, and custom zombies is fantastic and its main feature imo.The campaign is mildly racist and does at times make you want to friendly fire at your AI teammates, if you have played previous games or even current games in the COD series then the campaign is what you are familiar with, nothing outstanding.Who are we kidding though, if you are considering buying this game it's not for campaign, it's either for zombies or multiplayer.Now the multiplayer has two features that COD since W@W has lacked greatly, the ability to decimate your enemy and blow bits of them off, you are rewarded for headshots and using a trench gun can blow off someone's legs. As well as the ability to drive Tanks. The main issue I have with multiplayer is the main issue I have with the few COD games I have played, that is the fact it rewards negative actions, for instance rushing headlong in to a hoard of enemies is possible and winable, and it tries to force you to do so. Hit detection is iffy (downright dogshit at times) and can lead to some issues like shooting people around corners due to the size of their hitbox, however one definite perk to W@W is that unlike later COD games maps are less linear in design although not to a great extent to be fair and there are custom maps for both multiplayer and zombies.Before you decide if you should buy it or not, it is to be noted that Punkbuster anti cheat is no longer supported and there are hackers/modders in fair amounts. You must find download a patch file to override the game in order to play multipler.There is also the issue of the server list not populating for a large number of people so to see servers you have to check gametracker or another such list.As an arcade style game it is not great but not terrible, saved for the most part for its excellent zombie hoard mode.All in all its a decent time but is fairly average in presentation and execution, I would rate it 5/10 for the games multiplayer and campaign. However for zombies its a solid 8/10 due to the customization and actual mod support.			"

The Zombies Maps are Logical for he story.6. The History is accurate.7. The Bazai charges are surprising and terrffing at times.8. Some actions you do effect the story.9. The story isn't all way's the same, the is something always different depending on the choice you take.10. You can play the campaign with friends online.11. It explores battles that haven't been explored too much.12. The Tank mission is fun.13. The enlightening is lovely.14. The Zombie maps are time freaky and zombie like.15. At times its really surpising.16. The cutscenes are amazing and dramatic.17. Someone in your squad dies very often, so I get more and more challagging.18. The warfootage in the cutscenes are so outstanding.19. The environments look nearly real.20. The characters voices are awsome.21. The game has wartime sadness and ambition in it.22. You can make your own custom zombie maps.23. Its MY Favourite GAME!Cons:1. It needs more missions in Stalingrad.2. More missions in places like Russia, Poland, Saipan, Wake island, Midway, Philippines and more.3. It had more vehicle missions.4. On the tank mission the tank driver is the guy who is fighting in Stalingrad in the infantry, he is a infantryman, not a Tank guy.5. On the plane mission I wish there was more infomation about your character.6. I wish you could be Axis too.7.  That the bots are really dumb.8. I wish it was longer.9. That you can drop the two bombs on Japan.10. I wish you can choose more country to been in then Russia and U.S.A.11. That you can be real heroes of the War.12. That you can do the Western Front.13. That you can upgrade weapons on singleplayer.14. That there were more weapons.15. There should be a mission were you kill Hitler in his bunker.16. All the enemy soldiers look all basely the same, in the country faces that is.17. There are some historical errors.18. The campgain is too short.19. There are no achievements and badges.20.

												If you want to play spamming simulator play the campaign on VETERAN difficulty! I'm not saying anything bad this is a good game. I used to play this one xbox before any hackers came to it, best COD of the franchise. Even tho the multiplayer might have gone away the campaign is so worth it and zombies is the best one this! 69/10			"

												Probably the best Call of Duty game. The story in the campaign is decent, the graphics are good and the gameplay is challenging and fun. The use of Death cards gives the game some personality and uniqueness in the COD franchise and allows the player to play in more difficult or silly ways. Cheats and mods are fully functional also. This is one of the ONLY CODs where the campaign has a coop function and also contains the original Nazi Zombies maps. Multiplayer is fun and has a ranking system as well as progressive unlocks as you advance.			"

That's a good sign.The whole point of this game however, is zombies. The amount of custom maps is insane! I think that this game is worth solely for the zombies mode alone.

												Call of Duty: World at War is a lot like its predecessor, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. In most respects, this is a good thing. The guns are tightly tuned, the tone is gritty and mature, and the action is exciting and fast-paced. It boasts the same addictive multiplayer system as Modern Warfare, and even expands the multiplayer possibilities by allowing four players to play through the campaign cooperatively. Like every game in the series before Modern Warfare, this Call of Duty takes place during World War II. World at War does an admirable job of spicing things up, but between the well-worn source material and déjà vu game mechanics, there is a pervasive familiarity to the game. Still, though World at War lacks the freshness that made Modern Warfare such a hit, it nevertheless provides a hearty, filling meal--one that shooter fans are sure to savor.The most salient difference between World at War and Modern Warfare is the WWII setting. In the campaign, you split time between two soldiers in two offensive theaters: the Russian push out of their homeland and into the heart of Germany, and the American struggle to wrest Pacific islands from the Japanese. Though you'll alternate between them every few levels, the campaign feels like one solid progression, thanks to the adept pacing.Each soldier's journey begins at a low point. Weaponless and surrounded by the enemy, you get a taste of the despair many soldiers are never rescued from. Though the emotional tone eventually rises toward triumph, you never quite forget the fate you nearly met. The first few levels are a hard scrabble as you and your fellow soldiers try to gain a foothold for your country, while later levels are suffused with a sense of hard-won momentum as you fight bigger battles and push closer to your enemies' capitals. Throughout each level you are accompanied by a superior officer who sets the emotional tone through well-acted dialogue. The vengeful, spitfire Russian pumps up your adrenaline to intoxicating levels, while the grim, determined American provides a sobering influence. This grim sobriety is further enforced by the actual WWII videos, photos, and statistics presented in stylish interchapter cutscenes. The message is, by nature, a conflicted one: Though you may feel like an action hero, you are actually participating in the most horrid of human endeavors. How you ultimately feel about this message will depend on your personal disposition, but suffice to say that the elevated emotional timbre makes for an exciting campaign.Also exciting? Bayonets and flamethrowers, the two standout new weapons in World at War. You wield both in the American campaign, using them to enthusiastically dispatch enemies in trenches and fend off the aggressive banzai raiders. These raiders snipe from the treetops, or pop out of holes and charge you with merciless determination; this aggression makes the American campaign feel uniquely tense. The Russian campaign is slightly more predictable, but it remains vigorous throughout and ends in a spectacularly satisfying way. Explosions and gunfire will cause enemies to lose limbs and copious amounts of blood, making World at War a sight more violent than Modern Warfare. Still, in between the burning, stabbing, and gibbing, there is a lot of crouching behind cover and picking off enemies with your trusty rifle. This kind of action, and most of the other weapons, will feel familiar to anyone who has played a World War II shooter before. It's a well-tuned and exciting familiarity, but it doesn't make any notable leaps.World at War does make a leap for the Call of Duty series by offering two-player split-screen and four-player online cooperative campaign play. It's the same campaign as the single-player experience, though the number of enemies increases for every player that joins you. You can turn competitive scoring on and see who can earn the most points by killing enemies or reviving teammates, and this adds a bit of fun to the campaign and lightens to mood (it's hard to feel grim when there are point values popping up all the time). There are also special items called death cards in each level, and collecting these will allow you to enable a cheat for cooperative play (for instance, enemies die by headshots only or headshots cause enemies to explode). These add a little more spice to the pot, but the only tangible incentives are challenges. Completing these tasks (such as kill 100 enemies with pistols or take first 20 times in competitive co-op) will earn you experience points that go toward your multiplayer rank (co-op is not similarly ranked). Cooperative play is fun in its own right, but linking it to the addictive multiplayer ranking system makes it relevant in a whole different way.In case you missed it last year, the multiplayer system introduced in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is fantastic, and World at War has updated it to fit its WWII setting. The hook is experience points, which you gain by winning matches or completing one of the aforementioned challenges. As you earn these points, you'll rank up and earn access to new weapons, new accessories (like sights and suppressors), and new perks. Perks are special abilities that grant you a wide variety of bonuses, but you can only choose four (one of which is vehicle-specific). This introduces an engaging element of customization: Will you choose to toughen up by increasing your health and bullet damage, or will you go the stealth route and increase your sprint speed while becoming invisible to enemy recon planes? Perks are well balanced, and you have multiple save slots, which enable you to easily switch between your various pretweaked loadouts. This allows you to take full advantage of this deep, engaging system that is just as great this year as it was last year, albeit slightly less novel.There are, of course, new maps, and the bonuses you earn for kill streaks have been updated (notably, the attack helicopter you earned after seven kills in Modern Warfare is now a pack of nasty attack dogs). There are also a few maps that support tanks, powerful additions that mix things up without being too dominant. Most of the modes remain the same, though some have received slight tweaks and Capture the Flag has returned after a hiatus from Modern Warfare. The most striking new mode is actually a cooperative game called Nazi Zombies, playable when you beat the campaign (or play with someone who has). This absurd game puts up to four players in a house that is being assaulted by the undead. Killing the fiends and repairing the barricades earns you points that you then spend to replenish ammunition, buy new guns, and unlock new areas of the house. Each subsequent wave brings tougher, faster, more numerous enemies, and the game inevitably ends in grisly death. Though the random weapon box, assorted power-ups, and skills of your teammates add some variation, each play-through is similar to the last. Still, it makes for some intense, frantic fun and provides a welcome, if slightly bizarre, change of pace.By staying largely true to the formula that made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare so successful, Call of Duty: World at War has ensured a proven level of technical quality, particularly in the multiplayer arena. On the other hand, one of Modern Warfare's strengths was its fresh approach, and by embracing a familiar setting and familiar mechanics, World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence. This is only a bad thing if you are expecting this game to top its benchmark predecessor. If, however, you are hoping for an exciting campaign, fun cooperative play, and engaging multiplayer action, then you'll find a lot to be happy about in World at War.			"

												This is what A Call of Duty needs to be. Classic. Zombie Mode is probably the best and funniest part ever introduced to the CoD series and the fact, that you can just get modded maps and modes for it, makes it amazing.

												Probably the best Call of Duty game. The story in the campaign is decent, the graphics are good and the gameplay is challenging and fun. The use of Death cards gives the game some personality and uniqueness in the COD franchise and allows the player to play in more difficult or silly ways. Cheats and mods are fully functional also. This is one of the ONLY CODs where the campaign has a coop function and also contains the original Nazi Zombies maps. Multiplayer is fun and has a ranking system as well as progressive unlocks as you advance.			"

												This game is the main reason why I bought a gaming pc 4 years ago. It's easily my favorite game, if you couldn't tell by my almost 200 hours played, and i'll tell you why.Reason 1. Custom Zombies: I love Call of Duty Zombies. It's my favorite game mode in any game ever made. However, sometimes the old treyarch maps get old, even on the newer games, and you crave a new map. Here on PC Call of Duty World at War, you can choose from hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of great custom maps- Not to mention that you can make your own!Reason 2. World War 2 games are great.Reason 3. On xbox 360 and ps3, everyone mods call of duty World at War multiplayer, making it completely unplayable in my opinion. On Call of Duty World at War on PC, i'm yet to find someone running around World at War multiplayer with a Rainbow name who flies around in godmode during the game. Thanks punkbuster for perserving the greatest COD multiplayer ever!Reason 4. The campaign is solid. It's put together well, and actually makes sense unlike the newer call of duty campaigns. Reason 5. You could run this game on a potato. You don't need some fancy gtx 980Ti or anything to run this game, a 720 will run it perfect at maximum settings (I would know I used to have one).Reason 6. The value. It's the best $20 game you will ever purchase, and sometimes it goes on sale for $10.I could go on forever. The fact is if I had to choose to keep one game in my library, I would choose Call of Duty World at War.			"

												This review is mainly to counter the huge positive review base for custom made mods: only a thumbs up because CoD:WaW delivered an entertaining WWII shooter that matched the ambience of the theme and war being depicted. First, the biggest problem with custom mods, the lack of centralization of all of them. There is only a handful of them that are actually consolidated in a map downloaded on one of the official sites where you can download mods for zombies. How does that effect you? First of all, if you even get far enough to finding the right mod everyone is playing, or most popular that week, you'll have to wait on end to get people to join or find someone who is playing the same exact mod. The second largest problem is the way mods are loaded in WaW. Say you refreshed the server lists of all the people hosting a game, and you finally see someone hosting a mod you have, you now have to back to the main menu, click mods, then click load mod. After that, WaW will briefly restart itself. All of this can tack about five seconds if you are really fast, and maybe 10 seconds if you're new to the whole thing. Those five or ten seconds will make the difference between the time that lobby is empty, and the time the lobby is full, or you get the message, game is no longer available. It is extremely frustrating as, you'll be waiting another 15-30 minutes just waiting for somone to host a lobby with the same mod loaded, or you may be hosting your own only to be waiting for ever. One of the worst parts about all of this, is MOST mods include MODERN weapons! This is the biggest grip I had with custom zombies, I bought this game to play authentic WWII Guns, but it seems every popular modded server will have a modern weapon in it, and you have to use it for the late game part of the levels if you want to be efficient. Actually, do the previous reason mentioned, I strictly play vanilla maps, and they are hard to come by. Its true, if you are expecting to play vanilla map, the percentage or chances of you finding a lobby of someone playing vanilla map are worst than finding someone with the same mod as you. Its really hard to find someone just hosting the plain ol vanilla maps. To make matters worst, hackers and those users who think their cool loading this ""mod menu"" hack into the game to give ammunition and gun cheats just ruins the whole experience as it causes terrible de-sync issues with the server, so you'll game will freeze up and you'll be dropped from the match. That is the last reason as well, CONNECTION IN THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE. GOOD luck finding a game where you won't be dropped, what is worst than a host who uses mod menu? Constantly, de-dyncing, lagging, and dropping in the middle of the game. Its is terrible and ruins the whole experience. The multiplayer side is quite active, but the elites of the multiplayer mode are the epitome of camping, hand-eye cordination, and literally picking the most unusally spots to snipe you from. Almost any weapon in this game can one-hit kill you, so multiplayer is all about eye-recognization and speed. Be the fastest to see and shoot or you'll never get a kill (Its EXTREMELY hard to see enemies because their uniforms literally blend into the environment) Unless you are really good at spotting or camping really well, the multiplayer mode will be as frustrating as playing on a vanilla or modded zombies game. Good luck maximizing your rank in multiplayer if you are buying this game in 2016 lol.			"

												Best COD ever made, hands down. For those of you noobs who love CoD, but haven't played this need to know the following facts.Pros:- Better than any other Call of Duty game. (yes, that means Black Ops 1)- Most perfectly balanced Call of Duty ever made. Every single weapon class has its perks and drawbacks, nothing is OP or too strong.- Quickscoping is extremely difficult, so no OP snipers.- Absolutely fantastic multiplayer maps.- Equally fantastic DLC multiplayer maps. (as opposed to the normal, disappointing DLC you feel disappointed by)- The original game for Nazi zombies with the quintessential zombie maps.- Great Story.- ONLINE ISN'T DEAD!!! (05/10/2015)Cons:- Lack of servers. This issue could be easily fixed by having more people buying and playing this game though, but the only decent servers up right now are Hardcore TDM (which is fortunately what I generally play, anyway)- Noob ♥♥♥♥ galavanting around with Bazookas.- Martyrdom still exists this far back in the Call Of Duty world, but it doesn't seem like a majority of players use it like they did in MW1.The good far outweighs the bad, and definitely deserves a try from everyone who hasn't tried it. And again, the weapons are fantastic for their roles, and balance out very nicely online.			"

												I am one of those few who never liked the COD franchise.Well now I've started to play a couple and WAW has just left me wanting more. Being an old COD1, MOH & Wolfenstein fan. This game built on the love of those games and just wowed me.Screw you COD for having short campaigns. I want more from WAW. (Story wise, not zombies)The WWII genre game days are now over. You will be missed.8.5/10			"

												This in my opion was Call of Duty's high point. The story was well thought out, the characters were deep, and World War 2 setting was spot on. THe multiplayer was fluid, fair, and rich. All the modding was good, maps, player skins, and much more. But most of all it gave us Nazi Zombies, the wave based survial that started pratically it's own commuinity. World at War will always have a place in my heart and be remember as Call of Duty's best. (Note) I never thought Call of Duty would ever become what it is. Look at Call of Duty 4 and World at War, the best of the best. Black Ops 1 was the only other game I truly loved. I wish they'd wake up and realize that the true fans HATE the new games, the need to stop making games for 12 year olds. -Frieza			"

												For me this is the best Call of Duty ever created. The multiplayer is very good and balanced but sadly there are not many servers left to play on. The best part of the game is the superb zombie mode it makes so much fun and even more when you play it with your friends. If you decide to search for a lobby online you might encounter lobbys which are modded( infinite ammo, HP etc.) so i would recommend you playing solo or with friends. Some people might say i don't know what im talking about because i only have 175h on steam. but i used to play it on Xbox  a ton (~750h) before i joined the master race.			"

												This game made me want to puke... I really gaged! And that's great.You see... When you develop a game, EVERYTHING is thought. there are no rocks that are where they are for no reason.When you show the player something, it's because you want him to think or feel something. To experience. That's why videogames are sometimes called ""interactive experiences"". And this game made me feel like I really were in WW2. I won't give many details, I don't want to spoil the experience. But let me tell you something from the campaign: I felt the despair and desperation of the marines. I felt the anger for my ""motherland"". I was afraid from the red army and angry with the germans when I played as the soviets. And I felt the horror of war.I was afraid of the bullets, of the explosions. I always runned from a granade instead of throwing it again unless it landed basically on my hand.And the gore... Oh man... It really was a nice touch for the experience. Seeing my ""friends"" being blown to pieces made me angry, made me brave. Seeing my enemy scream while looking at his missing leg made me feel satisfaction... And made me feel ashamed.The sounds, the graphics, the music... All are awesome. Even to this day. Going back to WW2 was the best choice activision could take. And not censoring it really helped.PLEASE play this game.But NOT for the multiplayer... Hackers ruined it. Specailly aiming bot users.

												I would say its worth to buy if you wanne buy it for the campaign or the multiplayer.If you want to buy it for the zombies mode i would say its not worth a buy for 1 simple reason, people don't play zombies anymore, unless you're playing singleplayer zombies you're not gonna find any game of zombies.Sometimes people do play it, but thats just a matter of waiting.If you are buying it for multiplayer, multiplayer is really fun, you have alot of servers with a lot of players, alot of modded servers aswell and custom anti-cheats.For the time i've played, i did not encounter any cheaters, exploiters, etc.And ofcourse the campaign is fun to play!

												The fact that Jack Bauer is yelling at you all game is worth it! CoD WaW offered up to 4 player Co-Op campaign. The only CoD game to offer this level of play sans Zombies. Playing the campaign with even just two other people was a lot of fun. Calling out to watch your six and just be in the middle of total carnage with your buddies is a fun and worthwhile experience. That being said, the real gem is the Zombies mode. Battle waves of Zombies on your own to survive and complete objectives or have as many friends help you out. Treyarch allowed modding with this game and so the community built two really amazing Zombie mods. The first one was called The Rising and was similar to the regular Zombie mode pre-built in the game with the exception of allowing more players and custom maps. This is currently what most people play today with this game. I'm a fan but there was an even better mod released.ZombieX is a modification of the regular Call of Duty World at War game. When the map starts, everyone is a hunter and a clock ticks down from 1:30 to 0. When it reaches 0, one random hunter is selected as the First Zombie.The First Zombie starts out with 1,050 health and the ability to infect hunters by swiping them. All other Zombies get 450 health and can’t infect hunters but can still swipe them, explode on them and puke on them, slowing them down. You also gain the ability to throw limbs when 35% of the players on the map are Zombies. You must infect/kill hunters to change them into zombies.Hunters start out with a health level of 100, but get 3 bottles of Granny’s Special Sodas which give you 20 health points when you drink it. So you shouldn’t drink one until you’re at a health level of 80 or lower. Hunters also get 3 mines which can kill a zombie instantly. If a hunter becomes infected, he must drink two bottles of Granny’s Special Sodas to stop the infection. If you are out of sodas you can call a medic using the quick chat zombie options. If another hunter has a spare bottle, they can give it to you.There are Pandora’s Boxes spread out across the map in different locations. When a hunter opens the box, he can get a different weapon, an extra mine or an extra bottle of Granny’s Special Soda. It’s random so you could end up with a handgun. You don’t have to take it, but you have to wait about 5-10 seconds before you can open the box again. Zombies can only get two useful items out of the box. A rat or hunk of flesh that restores your health +50 or the ability (if you are not the first zombie) to infect one hunter in the round.So it’s Zombies vs. Hunters and whoever is left standing at the end wins. Most of the time it’s the Zombies.Unfortunately the community died off pretty rapidly once Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 came out and was basically dead by Call of Duty Black Ops. KiLL3R has kept his server up but it's usually empty most of the time. While the ZombieX mod doesn't have the players anymore I still recommend getting this game today and playing the Co-Op campaign or the Nazi Zombies mode.			"

But he wasn't going to get me games like that because you know its call of duty m8. Anyways after 6 years I just saw custom zombie maps that you can download and play it. Bro like you can play kino from black ops 1 and the guns are different. Nuketown from black ops 2. Like there was map called sponge bob and the zombies were ♥♥♥♥ing ghost. I mean this game is the best...I feel so dumb as well because black ops 3 is going to do the same thing and my pc is ♥♥♥♥ing beast (Beast=Potato) Get this game before the bo3 custom maps.For the multiplayer is different from the other CoD's. For example search and destroy is 10 points on WaW. But on Bo2 its 4. The graphics are not good maybe (i play on very low...) but game pulls you.Noob's get this game			"

												For me this is the best Call of Duty ever created. The multiplayer is very good and balanced but sadly there are not many servers left to play on. The best part of the game is the superb zombie mode it makes so much fun and even more when you play it with your friends. If you decide to search for a lobby online you might encounter lobbys which are modded( infinite ammo, HP etc.) so i would recommend you playing solo or with friends. Some people might say i don't know what im talking about because i only have 175h on steam. but i used to play it on Xbox  a ton (~750h) before i joined the master race.			"

												Got this game just 2 days ago after debating if I should get DLC 4 for Black Ops or buy World at War. Let me tell you that I made the best choice. I played World at War back in 2011 on PS3 and it was my first Call of Duty game. Loved the Campaign, the Multiplayer is awesome but nowadays you gotta search hard for a game that is either free of hackers or actually has people playing. Zombies is awesome. The four original maps are great, and the addition of Dev mod tools to create custom maps makes it 10 times better.10/10 Buy it now!			"

You can also have custom maps made by other people. SP is perfect. You have the 2 sides. American fighting Japanese. And Russia fighting Germany. The mulitplayer is really fun. Being able to customize your guns the way you want is always fun10/10			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is a lot like its predecessor, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. In most respects, this is a good thing. The guns are tightly tuned, the tone is gritty and mature, and the action is exciting and fast-paced. It boasts the same addictive multiplayer system as Modern Warfare, and even expands the multiplayer possibilities by allowing four players to play through the campaign cooperatively. Like every game in the series before Modern Warfare, this Call of Duty takes place during World War II. World at War does an admirable job of spicing things up, but between the well-worn source material and déjà vu game mechanics, there is a pervasive familiarity to the game. Still, though World at War lacks the freshness that made Modern Warfare such a hit, it nevertheless provides a hearty, filling meal--one that shooter fans are sure to savor.The most salient difference between World at War and Modern Warfare is the WWII setting. In the campaign, you split time between two soldiers in two offensive theaters: the Russian push out of their homeland and into the heart of Germany, and the American struggle to wrest Pacific islands from the Japanese. Though you'll alternate between them every few levels, the campaign feels like one solid progression, thanks to the adept pacing.Each soldier's journey begins at a low point. Weaponless and surrounded by the enemy, you get a taste of the despair many soldiers are never rescued from. Though the emotional tone eventually rises toward triumph, you never quite forget the fate you nearly met. The first few levels are a hard scrabble as you and your fellow soldiers try to gain a foothold for your country, while later levels are suffused with a sense of hard-won momentum as you fight bigger battles and push closer to your enemies' capitals. Throughout each level you are accompanied by a superior officer who sets the emotional tone through well-acted dialogue. The vengeful, spitfire Russian pumps up your adrenaline to intoxicating levels, while the grim, determined American provides a sobering influence. This grim sobriety is further enforced by the actual WWII videos, photos, and statistics presented in stylish interchapter cutscenes. The message is, by nature, a conflicted one: Though you may feel like an action hero, you are actually participating in the most horrid of human endeavors. How you ultimately feel about this message will depend on your personal disposition, but suffice to say that the elevated emotional timbre makes for an exciting campaign.Also exciting? Bayonets and flamethrowers, the two standout new weapons in World at War. You wield both in the American campaign, using them to enthusiastically dispatch enemies in trenches and fend off the aggressive banzai raiders. These raiders snipe from the treetops, or pop out of holes and charge you with merciless determination; this aggression makes the American campaign feel uniquely tense. The Russian campaign is slightly more predictable, but it remains vigorous throughout and ends in a spectacularly satisfying way. Explosions and gunfire will cause enemies to lose limbs and copious amounts of blood, making World at War a sight more violent than Modern Warfare. Still, in between the burning, stabbing, and gibbing, there is a lot of crouching behind cover and picking off enemies with your trusty rifle. This kind of action, and most of the other weapons, will feel familiar to anyone who has played a World War II shooter before. It's a well-tuned and exciting familiarity, but it doesn't make any notable leaps.World at War does make a leap for the Call of Duty series by offering two-player split-screen and four-player online cooperative campaign play. It's the same campaign as the single-player experience, though the number of enemies increases for every player that joins you. You can turn competitive scoring on and see who can earn the most points by killing enemies or reviving teammates, and this adds a bit of fun to the campaign and lightens to mood (it's hard to feel grim when there are point values popping up all the time). There are also special items called death cards in each level, and collecting these will allow you to enable a cheat for cooperative play (for instance, enemies die by headshots only or headshots cause enemies to explode). These add a little more spice to the pot, but the only tangible incentives are challenges. Completing these tasks (such as kill 100 enemies with pistols or take first 20 times in competitive co-op) will earn you experience points that go toward your multiplayer rank (co-op is not similarly ranked). Cooperative play is fun in its own right, but linking it to the addictive multiplayer ranking system makes it relevant in a whole different way.In case you missed it last year, the multiplayer system introduced in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is fantastic, and World at War has updated it to fit its WWII setting. The hook is experience points, which you gain by winning matches or completing one of the aforementioned challenges. As you earn these points, you'll rank up and earn access to new weapons, new accessories (like sights and suppressors), and new perks. Perks are special abilities that grant you a wide variety of bonuses, but you can only choose four (one of which is vehicle-specific). This introduces an engaging element of customization: Will you choose to toughen up by increasing your health and bullet damage, or will you go the stealth route and increase your sprint speed while becoming invisible to enemy recon planes? Perks are well balanced, and you have multiple save slots, which enable you to easily switch between your various pretweaked loadouts. This allows you to take full advantage of this deep, engaging system that is just as great this year as it was last year, albeit slightly less novel.There are, of course, new maps, and the bonuses you earn for kill streaks have been updated (notably, the attack helicopter you earned after seven kills in Modern Warfare is now a pack of nasty attack dogs). There are also a few maps that support tanks, powerful additions that mix things up without being too dominant. Most of the modes remain the same, though some have received slight tweaks and Capture the Flag has returned after a hiatus from Modern Warfare. The most striking new mode is actually a cooperative game called Nazi Zombies, playable when you beat the campaign (or play with someone who has). This absurd game puts up to four players in a house that is being assaulted by the undead. Killing the fiends and repairing the barricades earns you points that you then spend to replenish ammunition, buy new guns, and unlock new areas of the house. Each subsequent wave brings tougher, faster, more numerous enemies, and the game inevitably ends in grisly death. Though the random weapon box, assorted power-ups, and skills of your teammates add some variation, each play-through is similar to the last. Still, it makes for some intense, frantic fun and provides a welcome, if slightly bizarre, change of pace.By staying largely true to the formula that made Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare so successful, Call of Duty: World at War has ensured a proven level of technical quality, particularly in the multiplayer arena. On the other hand, one of Modern Warfare's strengths was its fresh approach, and by embracing a familiar setting and familiar mechanics, World at War achieves greatness but falls short of excellence. This is only a bad thing if you are expecting this game to top its benchmark predecessor. If, however, you are hoping for an exciting campaign, fun cooperative play, and engaging multiplayer action, then you'll find a lot to be happy about in World at War.			"

												This is what A Call of Duty needs to be. Classic. Zombie Mode is probably the best and funniest part ever introduced to the CoD series and the fact, that you can just get modded maps and modes for it, makes it amazing. I would Recommend it over every other Call of Duty or shooter (decludes Wolfenstein: The New Order). Best Game ever.10/10			"

												This is the most recent WWII game in the Call Of Duty franchise, and that is a shame really. Treyarch crushed anyone's dreams of a World At War II with the announcement of Black Ops III. I'm not complaining, either. Treyarch is my favorite Call Of Duty Developers, so I would have been happy either way. This game shows its age with a severe lack of basics such as achievements, modern multiplayer weapon unlock progression systems, and my personal biggest blow, no combat training. Aside from those small complaints, the game still looks pretty nice, the story is barebones but effective, the multiplayer isn't comepletely barron, and the custom zombies is the main reason for anyone buying this game in the first place. What's not to love about this timeless classic?			"

Jumps around a lot, which is common in future CODs as well. No amazing moments, everything was obvious and simple but not unfun for the most part. If you get this, do so on a very low sale price. 5$ max will net you roughly a dollar per hour, which is acceptable.			"

												World at war, the last call of duty based in world war two. Intense, pretty good graphics for its time and Zombies! My first call of duty I ever played when I was young and its worth getting on PC, spamming on custom zombies. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves call of duty, loves zombies and is interested in world war two. Go buy this game, install, play the story then Zombies!			"

												The last genuinely good game of the Call of Duty series. The single-player campaign is engaging and incredibly atmospheric (especially towards the final assault on Berlin) and it has a few of the best characters in the franchise in Reznov and Roebuck, as well as the small coalition of the unluckiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the entire war in Edward Richtofen, Takeo Masaki, Tank Dempsey and Nikolai Belinski, who of course feature in the infamous Nazi Zombies mode. Give it a go.			"

So I stick 2 the good old custom zombies, it's pretty active.. But you have to port forward and host if you really want to play, as not many people host.TL:DR  Multiplayer is solid and active - zombies requires you to port forward and host lobbies, it's actually a lot of fun.

												There is nothing quite like this game, a classic arcade shooter where the maps are perfectly balanced with players fighting over certain points even if there isn't an objective,  the guns all feel well made and just as deadly as they are in real life. Nothing beats the gore of throwing a perfectly cooked grenade and seeing the limbs of your foes fly across your screen. The game holds a perfect upbeat rythm without making it feel to repetitive, which isn't pretty common nowadays. It is easy to be dragged into playing for hours and you never have a dull moment. The campaign is a highlight of the CoD series and I feel is always trying to be recreated in the recent titles. I used to play this game a lot on console when I was younger and I saw it fall to hackers when the new title was released and support was dropped, but I saw to my surprise that on PC there are many dedicated servers running hacker free games and they are full of players pretty much all day. The game hasn't aged at all, honestly we see games nowadays with worse graphics than this. It just goes to show that simple really is better. A timeless classic I think will stay alive for many years.			"

												This game revolutionized the zombie gaming for future games like Black Ops/Black Ops II.  How could I refuse a game that went back into the ww2 topic (As it used to do) with a wonderful and even heart-wrenching campaign.  Also, if you want to go farther into more zombie fun, try different websites to download custom maps and experience the creativity and comedy of other eager gamers of the zombie frachise/map-making.  However, you won't find many servers that use the regular maps anymore, so plan to do it with friend you know before you buy this game.  I'll give this game a 9/10 for both its Campaign and zombie mode, but if you are not interested in the campaign and only zombies, please remember to plan before you buy! :D			"

												This was the best WW2 shooter to DATE. It was the barebones of Call Of Duty that brings me back to a time of the perfect balance of customization and simplicity. The zombies, fantastic, the formula was perfect and did not need to be tampered with at all. This game with its lengthy campaign in the Pacific and in Eastern Europe, really gave you the sense of fighting while enjoying co-op and Death Cards. Multiplayer was something of greatness, hours of my days were swept away with it, and with the 3 most perfect, simplistic kill streak rewards of a Recon Plane, Artillery, and Dogs was just amazing and made you keep playing. The only downside I see with this game is when you achieve dogs without using your Artillery, you lose the previous Killstreak. But Only demotes it to a solid 9/10			"

Yes, it's better then Black Ops one and two, and also Ghosts. It stands on the list of my favorite games next to Modern Warfare, and Modern Warefare 2. The rich story line of two Privates in both the U.S. Marine Raiders, and the Soviet Red Army, are both breath taking, and amazing. I highly recommend this game for its multiplayer, and story.  Sadly, there are hackers in the multiplayer, so please be sure to watch what servers you join. So you can get a true multiplayer experience in this game... Also,  Take out those ♥♥♥♥ing PT-Boats!  "

												This game revolutionized the zombie gaming for future games like Black Ops/Black Ops II.  How could I refuse a game that went back into the ww2 topic (As it used to do) with a wonderful and even heart-wrenching campaign.  Also, if you want to go farther into more zombie fun, try different websites to download custom maps and experience the creativity and comedy of other eager gamers of the zombie frachise/map-making.  However, you won't find many servers that use the regular maps anymore, so plan to do it with friend you know before you buy this game.  I'll give this game a 9/10 for both its Campaign and zombie mode, but if you are not interested in the campaign and only zombies, please remember to plan before you buy! :D			"

												Best COD ever made, hands down. For those of you noobs who love CoD, but haven't played this need to know the following facts.Pros:- Better than any other Call of Duty game. (yes, that means Black Ops 1)- Most perfectly balanced Call of Duty ever made. Every single weapon class has its perks and drawbacks, nothing is OP or too strong.- Quickscoping is extremely difficult, so no OP snipers.- Absolutely fantastic multiplayer maps.- Equally fantastic DLC multiplayer maps. (as opposed to the normal, disappointing DLC you feel disappointed by)- The original game for Nazi zombies with the quintessential zombie maps.- Great Story.- ONLINE ISN'T DEAD!!! (05/10/2015)Cons:- Lack of servers. This issue could be easily fixed by having more people buying and playing this game though, but the only decent servers up right now are Hardcore TDM (which is fortunately what I generally play, anyway)- Noob ♥♥♥♥ galavanting around with Bazookas.- Martyrdom still exists this far back in the Call Of Duty world, but it doesn't seem like a majority of players use it like they did in MW1.The good far outweighs the bad, and definitely deserves a try from everyone who hasn't tried it. And again, the weapons are fantastic for their roles, and balance out very nicely online.			"

You can mod most things in this game and that is how it's got this big community that tries to keep this game alive! Keep on impressing us, Treyarch. Black Ops 3 is probably your last chance.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War was the first Call of Duty game I played. It had just been released a bit before I got my hands on it. I had gotten a Wii and a friend let me borrow the title. I was instantly hooked on the shooter and played the Call of Duty series every year it was released. Sadly the Wii version excluded the beloved Nazi Zombies gamemode. Modern Warfare Reflex came out on the Wii, a month after I got MWR it was Christmas and I recieved a PlayStation 3. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 had just came out the month before. I also proceeded to buying World at War to finally get a taste of the game without using a gun with a remote attached to it. The game itself is great. To revisit such a devastating time in history really gave me insight of how and why we goto war. The storyline of the game was great, and the multiplayer was fantastic. Zombies is literally the most addicting and fun gamemode I've played. It has so much to offer. Teamwork is key to survivng the levels and progressing. It gets harder and harder to take the zombies down and more keep coming. Treyarch did a great job with this game.			"

												This might be a CoD game, but as a gamer who doesn't like the newer Call of Duty games, I must say that this is the best Call of Duty I have played. The singleplayer is tons of fun as you jump in the shoes of US soldier Pvt. Miller, who has to fight the Japanese in insane and heartpouning missions, and you get to play as Pvt. Dimtri Petrenko who has to fight the germans alongside with Reznov who is a complete badass in intense missions. Multiplayer is also great, but it really depends on if you like multiplayer games.Nazi Zombies is really great fun and I would suggest you get a pair of friends and start playing some.			"

												There is nothing quite like this game, a classic arcade shooter where the maps are perfectly balanced with players fighting over certain points even if there isn't an objective,  the guns all feel well made and just as deadly as they are in real life. Nothing beats the gore of throwing a perfectly cooked grenade and seeing the limbs of your foes fly across your screen. The game holds a perfect upbeat rythm without making it feel to repetitive, which isn't pretty common nowadays. It is easy to be dragged into playing for hours and you never have a dull moment. The campaign is a highlight of the CoD series and I feel is always trying to be recreated in the recent titles. I used to play this game a lot on console when I was younger and I saw it fall to hackers when the new title was released and support was dropped, but I saw to my surprise that on PC there are many dedicated servers running hacker free games and they are full of players pretty much all day. The game hasn't aged at all, honestly we see games nowadays with worse graphics than this. It just goes to show that simple really is better.

												I liked that you can play a great multiplayer game with random people and still have fun.You can also play zombies wich i love to play and it comes with 4 maps.I have been playing with friends that i made when i played zombies and multiplayer.The other great thing that you can do is get custom made zombie map at zombiemodding.com.My friend and i have played ever since i got the game i was also up on the game for 7 hours just playing zombies an multiplayer with my friends.The game helped me make friends that actually will play a game with me.So far i have made 4 friends just playing this game for 4 days.Great game to get friends,mess around,and to have fun killing zombies or facing people around the world.I wish they made more games like this and i have played every call of duty and this is the best in my opinion.I recommend this game to others if you get it hope you enjoy.

												The best Call of Duty game during a time when Call of Duty was a decent series. The campaign is amazingly good from a series that is mostly known for its multiplayer experience, the American storyline is presented with a refreshing low amount of nuthugging and the Russian storyline is presented with a refeshingly low amount of ""look at these satanic communists"" spiel. I was equally invested in both storylines, the 2 levels covering the storming of the Reichstag were incredible. The cinematic intros are also gorgeous, with some genuinely interesting statistics being presented to you in a visually attention grabbing manner.Also the gore! What the hell happened? Why is this fantastic gore not present in other CoD games? Im guessing its because of the ever corporate ""keep the ratings low for more sales"" but WOW, this gore adds so much visually to combat in the game.And co-op! Being able to play through my favourite Call of Duty campaign with my buddy is a blast, campaigns that work as singleplayer and co-op without ruining one another are sorely needed more!			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is by far my favorite Call of Duty game of all time. The main reason is becuase it was one of the first shoot 'em up games I really got into, and because of the iconic Nazi Zombies. This game truly is timeless due to the fact that modded maps are still being released today. In addition, the campaign is great. The only downside to this game is the difficulty in finding a multiplayer match that isn't corrupted by modders and hackers. However, it is still possible to find a legitimate match just like when the game was first released. Pick this game up; you won't regret it.			"

												Probably the best Call of Duty game. The story in the campaign is decent, the graphics are good and the gameplay is challenging and fun. The use of Death cards gives the game some personality and uniqueness in the COD franchise and allows the player to play in more difficult or silly ways. Cheats and mods are fully functional also. This is one of the ONLY CODs where the campaign has a coop function and also contains the original Nazi Zombies maps. Multiplayer is fun and has a ranking system as well as progressive unlocks as you advance.			"

												 Best Call of Duty of the Series in my opinion. It appeals to me as the last CoD installment to be set in WW2 as it provides the player with an above average campaign, really good multiplayer, provided you can find a match without modders, and by far the best Zombies maps in the series, as each brought something properly innovative upon release, that improved the gameplay, something modern zombies iterations fail to do.Not only this, but there are a ton of cool mods to try out to improve the experience.

												So first of all, some haters seem to forget this game was published in 2008, and that is 8 years ago.So I agree the graphics are not that good, but you guys forget that this game is kinda old...The gameplay is very good and I really like Campaign, it has such an amazing story!And Zombies... So amazing! You can create your own Zombies map and play it with your friends!So some things are amazing, and some thing are'nt that good, like the price, but overall, i think this game is amazing.

												Great game, My favorite part is in the zombies mode when you collect a horde of zombies and parade them to kill your unsuspecting friends. I cant get over the righteous sight of the zombies ripping your friends to pieces while you laugh over their screams of anger and betrayal. Its almost as fun as watching Donald Trump make stupid remarks about hot dumb Mexicans are and brag about being rich. I tried to get Obama to play this game once but he miss interpreted my email and ended up getting stuck in a Ceiling fan. Poor Obama.			"

												This game stands tall with Call of Duty 4.  It is great, and it is worth 20 dollars ALONE if you want to play the ""Nazi Zombies"" mode, which comes with 4 great maps, plus you can create your own.  I will warn you that this is not a user friendly editor, as you need a lot of experience with map making before you can even begin to scratch something together, but if you are dedicated enough, you can make some briliant masterpieces of maps.  Multiplayer is enjoyable, although there are a lot of modded servers and ""Increased Player Cap"" games, but they are fun to play in my opinion.  The single player campaign's story is pretty descent, and amazingly you can play the whole singleplayer campaign with a friend for some fun infantry killing action.  I would say buy this game if any of what I have said is interesting, because this game i feel is on par with the more recent games that have come out.8.5/10			"

												Best WWII shooter single and multiplayer ever. That being said, my main criticism for single player mode for this game and all war simulators is: CHILL OUT. War is not a constant train of frantic battles one after the other. Let me have some room to breathe, some down time while I crawl around the ruins. That can actually make it a richer, even more intense experience, as just when I think I am safe and able to just look around, a sniper takes a pot shot.MP could use some reality tweaks. Real people can't hop all day in heavy combat gear or drop from crawl to stand in a split second.			"

												While I do love this game for it's Single Player and Zombies, at present there are no official multiplayer servers for this game. There are only ""public"" rented servers which for the most part are poorly managed or have idiotic rules, like crouch only. There are very few US servers and those few allow people with pings well over what should be allowed. For those who say ping doesn't mean lag, try playing one on one with someone who has a 300 ping.			"

												This game made me want to puke... I really gaged! And that's great.You see... When you develop a game, EVERYTHING is thought. there are no rocks that are where they are for no reason.When you show the player something, it's because you want him to think or feel something. To experience. That's why videogames are sometimes called ""interactive experiences"". And this game made me feel like I really were in WW2. I won't give many details, I don't want to spoil the experience. But let me tell you something from the campaign: I felt the despair and desperation of the marines. I felt the anger for my ""motherland"". I was afraid from the red army and angry with the germans when I played as the soviets. And I felt the horror of war.I was afraid of the bullets, of the explosions. I always runned from a granade instead of throwing it again unless it landed basically on my hand.And the gore... Oh man... It really was a nice touch for the experience. Seeing my ""friends"" being blown to pieces made me angry, made me brave. Seeing my enemy scream while looking at his missing leg made me feel satisfaction... And made me feel ashamed.The sounds, the graphics, the music... All are awesome. Even to this day. Going back to WW2 was the best choice activision could take. And not censoring it really helped.PLEASE play this game.But NOT for the multiplayer... Hackers ruined it. Specailly aiming bot users.

												Holy @#$% this games zombiesZombies is literrally the only reason why I am interested in CoD anymore period, and this game being the original zombies game is the best or equal to Bo2 in my own opinion. Zombies is the main reason to buy this game wether your into the modding community or the plain original maps like me. I've always found that zombies is the most deep and engaging aspect of the CoD franchise because of all the different ways to play and stradegies you form. Zombies are much more zombie like in this game, I feel, because well.......their stupid!.Example""Oh! I had a lot of trouble here so mabye I should wait until round 4 then go their then i will be able to buy the next door!""The modding community is MASSIVE AND I MEAN MASSIVE and you could literally have 100x the number of hours you did with the base game. HOWEVERThe matchmaking system is HORRIBLE and you will wait around for possibly an hour or more refreshing and waiting to find a match. Also it can get very annoying when you want to have a legit online run and a modder ruins that fun and just makes everything fun in their eyes but bland a boring in yours.I give this game a 9/10 Lots of content with few downsides and lots of Zombies (BTW my hours would be 4x as much if it showed my console hours.)

												Worth it for the Zombie content. Both the standard WaW zombies. But also the hundreds of great custom zombie maps.Solo or multiplayer this is the best Call of Duty Zombies purchase.Modded maps are easy to install and the majority of them works with no further tinkering.  "

												It's a really fun game, that has a campaign which is fun to play alone or with friends. Best of all, it has Zombies, which is great to play either on a modded map or the standard maps which come with the game. The only problem is the price. If you do want to buy this game, get it on sale! Definitely an 8.5/10 in my opinion!			"

												Most likely too be the best CoD out there (On par with CoD 4). The multiplayer is amazing (without hackers), the zombies is great, and with mods making the experience even better. If you wanted too buy a cod game, I would reccomend this game or CoD 4. Also, the campaign (In my opinion) is GREAT. If you were too offer me CoD WaW, and Infinite Warfare, I would choose CoD WaW. The only downside is the ammount of hackers on multiplayer. The multiplayer can get REALLY annoying when there are hackers almost every game. But, most community servers (I think) have external Anti-Cheat systems, so Horray! to that. Anyway, I would REALLY reccomend buying this game, as well as getting your friends it too.			"

												This game is the main reason why I bought a gaming pc 4 years ago. It's easily my favorite game, if you couldn't tell by my almost 200 hours played, and i'll tell you why.Reason 1. Custom Zombies: I love Call of Duty Zombies. It's my favorite game mode in any game ever made. However, sometimes the old treyarch maps get old, even on the newer games, and you crave a new map. Here on PC Call of Duty World at War, you can choose from hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of great custom maps- Not to mention that you can make your own!Reason 2. World War 2 games are great.Reason 3. On xbox 360 and ps3, everyone mods call of duty World at War multiplayer, making it completely unplayable in my opinion. On Call of Duty World at War on PC, i'm yet to find someone running around World at War multiplayer with a Rainbow name who flies around in godmode during the game. Thanks punkbuster for perserving the greatest COD multiplayer ever!Reason 4. The campaign is solid. It's put together well, and actually makes sense unlike the newer call of duty campaigns. Reason 5. You could run this game on a potato. You don't need some fancy gtx 980Ti or anything to run this game, a 720 will run it perfect at maximum settings (I would know I used to have one).Reason 6. The value. It's the best $20 game you will ever purchase, and sometimes it goes on sale for $10.I could go on forever. The fact is if I had to choose to keep one game in my library, I would choose Call of Duty World at War.			"

												This review is mainly to counter the huge positive review base for custom made mods: only a thumbs up because CoD:WaW delivered an entertaining WWII shooter that matched the ambience of the theme and war being depicted. First, the biggest problem with custom mods, the lack of centralization of all of them. There is only a handful of them that are actually consolidated in a map downloaded on one of the official sites where you can download mods for zombies. How does that effect you? First of all, if you even get far enough to finding the right mod everyone is playing, or most popular that week, you'll have to wait on end to get people to join or find someone who is playing the same exact mod. The second largest problem is the way mods are loaded in WaW. Say you refreshed the server lists of all the people hosting a game, and you finally see someone hosting a mod you have, you now have to back to the main menu, click mods, then click load mod. After that, WaW will briefly restart itself. All of this can tack about five seconds if you are really fast, and maybe 10 seconds if you're new to the whole thing. Those five or ten seconds will make the difference between the time that lobby is empty, and the time the lobby is full, or you get the message, game is no longer available. It is extremely frustrating as, you'll be waiting another 15-30 minutes just waiting for somone to host a lobby with the same mod loaded, or you may be hosting your own only to be waiting for ever. One of the worst parts about all of this, is MOST mods include MODERN weapons! This is the biggest grip I had with custom zombies, I bought this game to play authentic WWII Guns, but it seems every popular modded server will have a modern weapon in it, and you have to use it for the late game part of the levels if you want to be efficient. Actually, do the previous reason mentioned, I strictly play vanilla maps, and they are hard to come by. Its true, if you are expecting to play vanilla map, the percentage or chances of you finding a lobby of someone playing vanilla map are worst than finding someone with the same mod as you. Its really hard to find someone just hosting the plain ol vanilla maps. To make matters worst, hackers and those users who think their cool loading this ""mod menu"" hack into the game to give ammunition and gun cheats just ruins the whole experience as it causes terrible de-sync issues with the server, so you'll game will freeze up and you'll be dropped from the match. That is the last reason as well, CONNECTION IN THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE. GOOD luck finding a game where you won't be dropped, what is worst than a host who uses mod menu? Constantly, de-dyncing, lagging, and dropping in the middle of the game. Its is terrible and ruins the whole experience. The multiplayer side is quite active, but the elites of the multiplayer mode are the epitome of camping, hand-eye cordination, and literally picking the most unusally spots to snipe you from. Almost any weapon in this game can one-hit kill you, so multiplayer is all about eye-recognization and speed. Be the fastest to see and shoot or you'll never get a kill (Its EXTREMELY hard to see enemies because their uniforms literally blend into the environment) Unless you are really good at spotting or camping really well, the multiplayer mode will be as frustrating as playing on a vanilla or modded zombies game. Good luck maximizing your rank in multiplayer if you are buying this game in 2016 lol.			"

If you think you might enjoy, this game is nice value. Even with how old the game is now people are still making new maps to play. Really fun with friends!Also the campaign isn't bad and the multiplayer is a change from the newer CODs...

												For me this is the best Call of Duty ever created. The multiplayer is very good and balanced but sadly there are not many servers left to play on. The best part of the game is the superb zombie mode it makes so much fun and even more when you play it with your friends. If you decide to search for a lobby online you might encounter lobbys which are modded( infinite ammo, HP etc.) so i would recommend you playing solo or with friends. Some people might say i don't know what im talking about because i only have 175h on steam. but i used to play it on Xbox  a ton (~750h) before i joined the master race.			"

While multiplayer shines with its custom map servers and single player with its interesting campaign, zombies is ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE.

I recamend that you buy this game, download some custom maps, and have the time of your life with all your friends (and if you don't have friends just tell me if you wan't me to play with you, also I'm twelve, meaning my voice might be a little annoying.)

												This game stands tall with Call of Duty 4.  It is great, and it is worth 20 dollars ALONE if you want to play the ""Nazi Zombies"" mode, which comes with 4 great maps, plus you can create your own.  I will warn you that this is not a user friendly editor, as you need a lot of experience with map making before you can even begin to scratch something together, but if you are dedicated enough, you can make some briliant masterpieces of maps.  Multiplayer is enjoyable, although there are a lot of modded servers and ""Increased Player Cap"" games, but they are fun to play in my opinion.  The single player campaign's story is pretty descent, and amazingly you can play the whole singleplayer campaign with a friend for some fun infantry killing action.  I would say buy this game if any of what I have said is interesting, because this game i feel is on par with the more recent games that have come out.8.5/10			"

												Zombies - endless hours of gameplay due to thousands of custom zombie maps and the variety of ways they all work, even the originals are funCampaign - campaign can be ok, but its better with co-op playersMultiplayer - havent played much of it, there are some hackers, and its ok in a non-cheater lobby. But if you want a good COD multiplayer shooter go for MW2 or MW3.Overall the game is a good 8/10, the zombies gamemode is amazing and makes up alot for the multiplayer and campaign. Just don't launch any custom maps with semper fi or they'll crash your game, and your mouse will be rendered useles until you restart your PC.			"

												I really love this game. I have it on 360 and now I have it on Steam, and I must say this game is much more enjoyable on PC. On PC you can get mods, cheats, and custom zombies without getting banned, unlike the console version. The only downside is this game does not have full 360 controller support.			"

												World at war, the last call of duty based in world war two. Intense, pretty good graphics for its time and Zombies! My first call of duty I ever played when I was young and its worth getting on PC, spamming on custom zombies. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves call of duty, loves zombies and is interested in world war two. Go buy this game, install, play the story then Zombies!			"

												This game is the main reason why I bought a gaming pc 4 years ago. It's easily my favorite game, if you couldn't tell by my almost 200 hours played, and i'll tell you why.Reason 1. Custom Zombies: I love Call of Duty Zombies. It's my favorite game mode in any game ever made. However, sometimes the old treyarch maps get old, even on the newer games, and you crave a new map. Here on PC Call of Duty World at War, you can choose from hundreds of thousands, maybe even millions of great custom maps- Not to mention that you can make your own!Reason 2. World War 2 games are great.Reason 3. On xbox 360 and ps3, everyone mods call of duty World at War multiplayer, making it completely unplayable in my opinion. On Call of Duty World at War on PC, i'm yet to find someone running around World at War multiplayer with a Rainbow name who flies around in godmode during the game. Thanks punkbuster for perserving the greatest COD multiplayer ever!Reason 4. The campaign is solid. It's put together well, and actually makes sense unlike the newer call of duty campaigns. Reason 5. You could run this game on a potato. You don't need some fancy gtx 980Ti or anything to run this game, a 720 will run it perfect at maximum settings (I would know I used to have one).Reason 6. The value. It's the best $20 game you will ever purchase, and sometimes it goes on sale for $10.I could go on forever. The fact is if I had to choose to keep one game in my library, I would choose Call of Duty World at War.			"

												Great game, My favorite part is in the zombies mode when you collect a horde of zombies and parade them to kill your unsuspecting friends. I cant get over the righteous sight of the zombies ripping your friends to pieces while you laugh over their screams of anger and betrayal. Its almost as fun as watching Donald Trump make stupid remarks about hot dumb Mexicans are and brag about being rich. I tried to get Obama to play this game once but he miss interpreted my email and ended up getting stuck in a Ceiling fan. Poor Obama.			"

												Its old but it is still alive with more than 2000 active players at any hour of the day, I decided to buy it again during the sales, I dont regret of getting it.The game has a really inmersive single player campaign, with realistic environments and weaponry. You can also play Nazi Zombies gamemode, playing it alone is a bit boring and also, its very hard to get to high rounds, its a gamemode where you have to play with friends (up to 4). The maps of this title are the best ones I have seen, in my opinion they are better than Black Ops Saga ones, this ones arent that much of a cluster of ideas, upgrades, rays and lasers.Multiplayer is fantastic, you can find maps of all sizes, small ones are not fun if there the server has many players, but the medium and large maps are quite enjoyable with big playerbases. Another interesting feature from WaW is that the big maps have tanks (T34 and Panzer IV), as far as I know, no other CoD has controllable land vehicles. Weaponry is well balanced in comparison to newer CoD titles. If you have to choose what to play, I recommend extreme mode, it feels the most accurate in this title since most weapons kill in 1-3 shots and you dont have the help of the crosshair or the map.

												Although this game has quite a few years under it's belt, it continues to thrive in more ways than not. Becasue of the ability to use mods (and Treyarch's overall acceptance of the modding community), this game is great for things like custom zombies, which is great considering you DO NOT have to have any other COD title, yet the maps made include weapons from all other titles in the series (past and future games). 10/10 would play zombies again.

												Best COD ever made, hands down. For those of you noobs who love CoD, but haven't played this need to know the following facts.Pros:- Better than any other Call of Duty game. (yes, that means Black Ops 1)- Most perfectly balanced Call of Duty ever made. Every single weapon class has its perks and drawbacks, nothing is OP or too strong.- Quickscoping is extremely difficult, so no OP snipers.- Absolutely fantastic multiplayer maps.- Equally fantastic DLC multiplayer maps. (as opposed to the normal, disappointing DLC you feel disappointed by)- The original game for Nazi zombies with the quintessential zombie maps.- Great Story.- ONLINE ISN'T DEAD!!! (05/10/2015)Cons:- Lack of servers. This issue could be easily fixed by having more people buying and playing this game though, but the only decent servers up right now are Hardcore TDM (which is fortunately what I generally play, anyway)- Noob ♥♥♥♥ galavanting around with Bazookas.- Martyrdom still exists this far back in the Call Of Duty world, but it doesn't seem like a majority of players use it like they did in MW1.The good far outweighs the bad, and definitely deserves a try from everyone who hasn't tried it. And again, the weapons are fantastic for their roles, and balance out very nicely online.			"

But if you want a good COD multiplayer shooter go for MW2 or MW3.Overall the game is a good 8/10, the zombies gamemode is amazing and makes up alot for the multiplayer and campaign. Just don't launch any custom maps with semper fi or they'll crash your game, and your mouse will be rendered useles until you restart your PC.			"

												When i saw this game and the nazi zombies trailer, I was like. ""woow"" (btw it was on 2009) then i asked my dad to buy this game. But he wasn't going to get me games like that because you know its call of duty m8. Anyways after 6 years I just saw custom zombie maps that you can download and play it. Bro like you can play kino from black ops 1 and the guns are different. Nuketown from black ops 2. Like there was map called sponge bob and the zombies were ♥♥♥♥ing ghost. I mean this game is the best...I feel so dumb as well because black ops 3 is going to do the same thing and my pc is ♥♥♥♥ing beast (Beast=Potato) Get this game before the bo3 custom maps.For the multiplayer is different from the other CoD's. For example search and destroy is 10 points on WaW. But on Bo2 its 4. The graphics are not good maybe (i play on very low...) but game pulls you.Noob's get this game			"

												This and Cod4 are without a doubt my two favorite releases in the franchise's history.  Cod4 brought new life to fps mp and then cod:waw went ahead and introduced zombies which I still go back to frequently this many years later.  I owned the non-steam version of the game quite a while before I got it on steam so I have a lot more hours than steam shows- For about a year I played this game with my friends for 6-8 hours straight at least once a week.  It was the last cod that didn't charge you for the DLC the console users had to buy and the modding community, at least the zombie side of it, is still alive and well.  If you have a few friends that want to do some zombies you will have plenty of content from the community to keep you busy for a long long time.  It's well worth the $20 price tag.			"

												Heres the thing about COD: WAW. When this game first came out I loved it on consoles. PC is so much better. This game has a lot of replay value because of the zombie mods. That is the main reason to get this game is for the zombie mods. They are never ending and give you a fresh new experience each time you play and load up a map.			"

												Best WWII shooter single and multiplayer ever. That being said, my main criticism for single player mode for this game and all war simulators is: CHILL OUT. War is not a constant train of frantic battles one after the other. Let me have some room to breathe, some down time while I crawl around the ruins. That can actually make it a richer, even more intense experience, as just when I think I am safe and able to just look around, a sniper takes a pot shot.MP could use some reality tweaks. Real people can't hop all day in heavy combat gear or drop from crawl to stand in a split second.			"

												Wow... Just Wow.  This is probably one of my favorite call of dutys of all time! The Campaign is AMAZING! It made me feel like I was in World War II, you have characters you actually care about (my personal favorite being Polonsky). and the story is AMAZING!The Muiltiplayer: From my time playing the muiltiplayer the game isnt very populated. There are only 270 servers as I saw and it lies about the player count.  If you play CoD for the muiltiplayer do not get this game. But it does have a great selection of weapons which is niceZerbambos/Zombies: The most fun and simplistic zombies yet! You have 4 maps and they are all really good. I love zombies on this game best zombies in any treyarch game!Verdict: The game is mostly for people who want to play the campaign or zombies. The muiltiplayer is not very good, If the game had more players and more servers I would have given this game a 5/5 but for now I give this game a4/5 Good but needs some work on the muiltiplayer			"

												For me this is the best Call of Duty ever created. The multiplayer is very good and balanced but sadly there are not many servers left to play on. The best part of the game is the superb zombie mode it makes so much fun and even more when you play it with your friends. If you decide to search for a lobby online you might encounter lobbys which are modded( infinite ammo, HP etc.) so i would recommend you playing solo or with friends. Some people might say i don't know what im talking about because i only have 175h on steam. but i used to play it on Xbox  a ton (~750h) before i joined the master race.			"

												I used to play this game on ps3 with my friends all the time. When I got my 360 this was one of the first games I got. This is COD back when it was enjoyable. This game is great probably one of my all time favorite games. Between 3 systems I bet I have near 1000 hours. This game was why I even downloaded steam in the first place. Great game, even by today's standards. There is a gritty feel here that other large titles have really failed in trying to replicate. The campaign is good by call of duty standards. CO-OP was fun but is pretty dead now. The real fun is in Zombies and Multiplayer. The zombie maps in this game to me are the best. It was before everything got so complicated. Its just you, up to 3 other people, some guns, some doors, and the occasional power switch. No staffs or fuses here. There are plenty of mods and custom maps if thats your thing though. A lot of later zombies maps are remade by the community as customs maps so you can have a pretty complete collection, as well as some totally custom ones. The multiplayer is great the maps are over two theaters of war and there is a lot of variety which means most people usually have a few maps they like. The MP is still pretty active especially on weekends. If you have trouble finding a game there is always the bot mod that allows you to beat on AI bots. I really cannot say enough good things about this game and the PC version not only looks better but is more fun. 10/10.			"

												Call of Duty: World at War is by far my favorite Call of Duty game of all time. The main reason is becuase it was one of the first shoot 'em up games I really got into, and because of the iconic Nazi Zombies. This game truly is timeless due to the fact that modded maps are still being released today. In addition, the campaign is great. The only downside to this game is the difficulty in finding a multiplayer match that isn't corrupted by modders and hackers. However, it is still possible to find a legitimate match just like when the game was first released. Pick this game up; you won't regret it.			"

												 Best Call of Duty of the Series in my opinion. It appeals to me as the last CoD installment to be set in WW2 as it provides the player with an above average campaign, really good multiplayer, provided you can find a match without modders, and by far the best Zombies maps in the series, as each brought something properly innovative upon release, that improved the gameplay, something modern zombies iterations fail to do.Not only this, but there are a ton of cool mods to try out to improve the experience.

So amazing! You can create your own Zombies map and play it with your friends!So some things are amazing, and some thing are'nt that good, like the price, but overall, i think this game is amazing.

												This game along with the first modern warfare is the peak of inovation within the call of duty series. Recent call of duty's have a reputation for being repetetive however World at War brought the fps genre and World War II games to a new level. It's campaign is one of few call of duty campaigns that really kept my interest, because it is both a brutal but accurate depicitons of what happened during WWII. It also introduced Nazi Zombies which was so unique and amazing, even though I feel it has been milked to death with recent Call of Duty's. All in all this games is a must get for any fans of WWII, call of duty, or the fps genre.			"

If you squint really hard you can almost see signs of aging.Surprisingly this game's multiplayer is still active with those who teeter in their rocking chairs and claim it's still the best one. Am I one of those people? Probably.But if you're a vanilla geezer and don't want mods you might get a little frustrated. So, um...use mods. Prepare to figure it out. The mods can be quite good and almost convince you that you're playing a newer game.That aside, it's Call of Duty. If you've played a first-person shooter you know how it is. If you haven't played one, this is a fair place to start.			"

												Call of duty 5 or World At War is one of my perosnal bests of the call of duty franchise this cannot be extended to the newer titles. but do not let the bad reputation of later installments put you off this game. World at war also comes with four epic dlc's which come with the game at purchase this title if baught on console with all map packs would come to a total of about £40 so this is definatly worth buying as a pose to colsoles. Also with the pc version of the game comes Custom zombies extending the limitations of the offical maps keeping customers engaged for hours on end. The campaign to this title is also complex even for a call of duty games with likable and relatable characters this will keep you engaged for hours as the campaign is also not easy to complete depending on your mode of play. Multiplayer for this title even holds up in the standards of 2014's competative market. Also one of the side games for this title Nazi Zombies is fun and engaging and has a complex and intreaging storyline which is followed up in other installments that even rivals the storyline of the main campaign this game is definatly worth the buy and i give it a solit 10/10.

												Best cod to dateI don't really play (or like) any of the call of duty multiplayer, I've always been more interested in the campaign and ZOMBIES. The campaign is by far better than any other COD yet (up there with MW2), allowing you to play as two of the allied forces during WWII. WARNING: THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING HARDEven on normal difficulty, I'll die maybe 12 times in a mission. Not sure if it was because I was rushing to unlock zombies, or if it is just genuinely challenging. Playing as Dimitri is way more enjoyable than playing as Miller. Playing as Miller just felt like midlessly being attacked by and attacking Japanese and his missions never had any depth. Playing as Dimitri is a GORGEOUS simulation of humiliation and vengeance, leading up to an insane climactic ending, mowing down nazis like a ♥♥♥♥ing machine. Pros:-Great campaign-Beautiful scenery-Nazi zombies-Great guns-Nazi zombies-Challenging-Best single player gameplay in any cod-Nazi zombies-Nazi zombies-♥♥♥♥ing nazi zombies-Did I mention nazi zombies? Cons:-Only 4 Official zombie maps-Some screen tearing -No functioning Multiplayer zombie lobby's			"

												Yes, i had this game on console, ps3, and it was amzing. so i thought stuff it, and decided to get it on steam...LOVE IT. All the cheat commands are great and i love godmode, no-clip, all weapons etc. although noclip doesnt work all that well. Anyway if you get the game please let me know, as hardly anybody has this game and we need people, like you hopefully, to keep classics like this alive. XD			"

												This is an aging part of the Call of Duty franchise, but in my opinion it's a lot better than the newer installments (Black Ops and Modern Warfare 3). This game was made in a time when Infinity Ward was more focused on making good, quality games instead of remaking essentially the same game and charging 50 bucks a piece each time. Awesome game!

												The best part of this game is definitely the mods. You could play community-made zombie maps for days on end and not try them all. The campaign is great, challenging enough to be fun, but not too hard. The graphics are pretty good for a game released in 2008. Multiplayer is smooth and very enjoyable, with a good map variety.

Call of Duty World at War Campaign ReviewCall of Duty World At War, the pinnacle of a World War 2 shooter? Or a complete bust?I would have to say that World At War is kind of in the middle. It’s definitely not the pinnacle of the series when it deals with World War II, I still feel that Call of Duty 2 holds that distinction, but it’s definitely not a bad game and in some ways it’s better than the first Call of Duty. In World at War you get two nations, the Russians and the Americans. Both sides of the campaign prove to be highly engaging and entertaining. However while it’s fun to shoot up bad guys, I can’t help but feel also a little sorry. Seeing how these people fought is brutal and gory. I almost feel like the developers want you to feel this disconnect. Almost to let you know that World War II was not a fun time for the actual people involved. Thematically it’s definitely the weakest Call of Duty World War II shooter, while the other shooters focused on the comradery and the force of working together, this call of duty does that, but not as well. Instead it kind of focuses on the heroes of this war or so it implies. Sgt. Reznov saying “Should a hero be held accountable for his actions?” World at War basically says yes, but no. Yes, because you are killing lots of people, but no because these people have to die. It’s an interesting thematic point, but not explored well enough.Now atmospherically and even cinematically it’s definitely the best Call of Duty World War II shooter. The gore is constant, the battles are intense, and the pain that is inflicted is on a great scale. This games does a lot to showcase the horrors of war. People burning and running to douse their flames or enemies surrendering and still getting shot or even the Japanese kamikaze all over the place. This Call of Duty shows the brutality of the Japanese and it’s pretty frightening from our viewpoint, but it’s also pretty frustrating from a gameplay perspective. The gameplay is as good as it’s ever been, but with a few caveats. You have a flamethrower, that I still feel is a little underpowered, and you have Japanese soldiers who kill you with one hit. The latter being an annoying mechanic in the later missions. You will die a lot even on easy, with these moves that throw you into a quicktime event, that for the life of me I could hardly ever get correct. Technically the game runs extremely well. I didn’t get any stutters like the earlier Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2. The game loads and saves seamlessly. I also ran it on a Windows 10 Computer with a GTX 970 spruced up a bit with Nvidia Inspector and at 4k resolution. It’s definitely a good looking and great performing game. This really comes into play whenever you get to see some of the game’s visual set pieces which, while feeling a little out of place for a World War II shooter, are still a sight to behold. All in all Call of Duty World at War is a great World War II shooter with an awesome campaign. That is a bit too short for my tastes. It literally took me 4 hours to beat the game and the rest of my time has been spent in Zombies mostly. So sadly while some of the new design influences from the modern games creep up in World at War, it’s still a great game at heart and worth your time on a sale.  Played on a GTX 970 Windows 10 Computer. Ran well at 4k resoultion and ambient occlusion enabled through Nvidia Inspector.   A really short campaign. You are looking at roughly 4-5 hours depending on how much you die and if you are playing co-operatively.  "

												Call of Duty: World at War ReviewAfter the success of Call of Duty Modern Warfare; which brought the whole first person shooter genre into modern day settings, infinity ward was slated to make a sequel. In the meantime, Treyarch was tasked to fill in for a year. How does one go about following up to Modern Warfare, arguably one of the best in the series? They didn’t go modern or push forward in time to the future, but instead went back in time once more to revisit World War Two. At first it would appear to be a huge step back, however it was the opposite. Treyarch made the right decision not to follow the same path as previous WWII entries by having the American campaign set during the invasion of Normandy. I mean how many times can you storm Omaha, seriously?! Instead the American campaign see’s the player fight in the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa on the Japanese front. The character is again a silent private who just takes orders without question, and is led by sergeant Roebuck who is voiced by none other than Jack Bauer himself: Keifer Sutherland. Running off of the same engine as Modern Warfare, the graphics still look crisp and new. If you have a decent rig you can turn off v-sync and run the game at 90 frames-per-second.The American’s aren’t the only ones you play as, the total badass Russians also have a campaign starting in Stalingrad, and ending in Berlin with the taking of the Reichstag. The campaign jumps from the American to Russian campaign with great frequency to mix up the setting. The Russian campaign culminates in some epic moments which might not have felt the same if it hadn’t started with the battle of Stalingrad, even though at first the battle of Stalingrad may not seem original. Starting in Stalingrad the player experiences the struggle to regain the motherland from the clutches of Germany and then takes the fight to them. The final level of the game gives the player some of the best Call of Duty blockbuster moments, where you are just awash with the waters of victory coursing through you. In other words, you do some very cool things which I will not mention for the sake of avoiding spoilers. Yes again the Russian character is a generic silent private led by a Sergeant Reznov, who is your typical portrayal of a Russian Commander-in-chief.The gun play and cover system is rock solid as usual, giving the player some nice snappy shooting with the ability to peek out of cover around corners. You can cook grenades and toss enemy grenades back at them. World at War pretty much follows all the common tropes of a cinematic Call of Duty game. The campaign can be played solo or co-op. World at War was really important because it introduced the now iconic solo/co-op game mode: Nazi Zombies. This was probably the biggest advancement to the Call of Duty series at the time. Nazi Zombies provides the player with extra hours of fun on a few different maps. The point of Nazi Zombies is to see how many waves of vile Nazi Zombies you can survive. This is definitely a game mode that you’ll get more out of with some friends. You start off with a pistol and some money which can be used to unlock weapons. The weapons are purchased by going up to the outlines of guns hanging on the walls and pressing the action button to acquire them. You can go back to previously purchased guns to obtain ammo by using the in game money of course. Now there’s the matter of obtaining money.  Around the map you will find boarded up windows and doors with slits to shoot through. When a zombie reaches one of these barriers it will begin to remove it board by board and once all the boards are removed will enter the player’s “safe zone”. You can replace the boards by going up to the opening and holding down the action button. Rebuilding barriers nets the player some cash, two hundred dollars a board to be precise. To successfully survive, be sure to constantly rebuild the barriers and remain calm and patient, scoring headshots on the nasty’s. I believe every Treyarch Call of Duty following this one included Nazi Zombies mode, that’s how successful it was. In addition to the stellar campaign and the frightfully fun Nazi Zombies is of course your standard fiesta of multiplayer modes. The game also has an emotional and tonally correct soundtrack, fusing an orchestra and choir with some electronic and metal sounds. Written by Sean Murray, it packs a real punch and lifts the whole single player experience even higher. My personal favourites all come from the Russian campaign. Ultimately this was an exceptional and important entry in the series. The thing that impressed me the most about Call of Duty: World at War was the fact that they had the conviction to go back to WWII after Call of Duty 4. They went back and they made one the best and most influential entries in the series next to 4. Some may say the original or Call of Duty 4 is the best, but my personal favourite is Call of Duty: Black Ops.8.5/10			"

												I really just bought this game for the Nazi Zombies mode, and holy BALLS, does it ever deliver! In addition to having rock bottom minimum system requirements, playing Call of Duty on PC with a keyboard and mouse just feels absolutely perfect. And as if that wasn't enough, all four maps for Nazi Zombies mode are included! Not sure I'd be able to justify paying full price for this game (the less money you have to give Activision and Treyarch, the better), but DEFINITELY pick it up if it ever goes on sale! Long story short, this game is absolutely worth playing, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who like FPS games on PC.			"

												A classic Call of Duty with an outstanding PC port! Call of Duty World at War brings back that WWII feel with the campaign and multiplayer. One of the best editions are the Co-Op campaign feature and the legendary Zombie mode. There are so many custom zombie maps to play adding a never ending fun!! For $19.99 and being over 6 years old, Call of Duty World at war is, in my opinion, one of the best Call of Dutys of all time.			"

Just play this game with veteran diffuclty enemies will surround you  and close combat on every second (mostly on pasific missions) you'll hear ""banzai"" screams, gun shots, bombs, grenades ... bullets will cover your sides and you will never walk or look with in safe. Finally you find yourself pinned on ground try staying alive because you'll learn staying alive almost like winning lottery...Most realistic WWII fps ever maded. But for sure this game have lot of problems ai not smart and not realistic, animations poor, mission bugs..etc. but everything because of games release year.			"

Only memorable mission was the last (Reichstag attack). Multiplayer got still much players and got very big amount of unnoficial mods.  Verdict: 7/10 - Good.			"

Just play this game with veteran diffuclty enemies will surround you  and close combat on every second (mostly on pasific missions) you'll hear ""banzai"" screams, gun shots, bombs, grenades ... bullets will cover your sides and you will never walk or look with in safe. Finally you find yourself pinned on ground try staying alive because you'll learn staying alive almost like winning lottery...Most realistic WWII fps ever maded. But for sure this game have lot of problems ai not smart and not realistic, animations poor, mission bugs..etc. but everything because of games release year.			"

But no I also enjoyed the game mode 'Nazi Zombies' I thought that this was very realistic, even more so than Gary Oldman playing a Russian (I joke ha ha) but no it was very good.War realisticness - 7/10Zombieness - 10/10 *Cheeky finger*Guns - 8/10Actors - 10/10 would act again.

The European campaign also was entertaining when you get to use the mobie mg42. Wish it was longer though.Multiplayer is just like the others exept ww2 weapons which is still fun as hell. Tanks though are boring and shoud have been left out(They were only good in UO and cod 3) but its good that they are on only 4 maps.Zombies, everybody who has played COD already knows about it and Der Riese will always be the best map in the entire Call of Duty Zombie games.

												A classic Call of Duty with an outstanding PC port! Call of Duty World at War brings back that WWII feel with the campaign and multiplayer. One of the best editions are the Co-Op campaign feature and the legendary Zombie mode. There are so many custom zombie maps to play adding a never ending fun!! For $19.99 and being over 6 years old, Call of Duty World at war is, in my opinion, one of the best Call of Dutys of all time.			"

												World at War was the first Call of Duty game I have ever played and boy was it a great game. This is the game that got me hooked on Call of Duty and I just love playing custom zombies maps now on the PC version of WAW. I really hope everyone purchases this game because it is worth all of this fun at such a low price.			"

												Fun game if  you like mods, expansion on zombies, or free dlc content. One of the best call of duties to this very day, and still playable and fun to get on after 9 years of it being out. Not to hard to run either, most computers can handle it. Overall one of the games I have the most hours on and the game i have played the most over the years. I really and strongly recomend this game.			"

												This call of duty is one of the best so far in my opinion. Sure now anymore you can only find some people on a server here and there but the best expirience you will have on World at War is the zombies. With thousands of custom maps up for grabs there is almost never a time when you are bored of zombies. The one thing I wish was that this game was paired with steams workshop. It would make it easier then having to search hours on google for a map that one of your favorite Youtubers played. But besides that I really enjoyed this game and up to this day the game still has a lot of potential. Thats coming from a game that a little more then 6 years old!			"

												Call of Duty: World at War, sure you'd be correct if you called it ""old"". But you gotta hear me out, this game is amazing when you play a custom zombies map. ""What is a custom zombies map?"" you may be asking, well allow me to show you the capabilities that these amazing modders (e.g. ZK,HexZombies and many more, even my good friend monkey is making a map) can do, some maps include ported weapons, (e.g. RaygunMK2, Peacekeeper, intervention, any other gun you can think of) which is basically bringing a gun from a diffrent COD or even a diffrent shooter game into COD:WaW, there can also be, Custom zombie models, custom weapon ""camos"" or models, or even custom playermodels (e.g. Cheesecube Unlimited -by ZK your playermodel can change to ""Iron Man"" when you put on a suit [and you do get to use the repulsors and rockets c: ]) This may already seem like a long review but trust me, if you get this game and download a few custom maps, you won't be sorry.My rating: 20/10Final note: If you purchase this game but need someone to play with you can add me I play this game quite often. If you need help downloading/installing custom maps you can message me and I can show you a youtube video that can assist you in downloading/installing custom maps. Good day to everyone, And happy gaming!~~~EDIT~~~Now the reson i needed to edit this is just to let you know, you won't find very many  (if any) Zombie matches that are open to the public, BUT if you need someone to play this game with You can add me (ingame name is ""Link-Zelda"") or a few of my friends (ign's ""jose09monkey"" or ""z506yy"" withought quotes of course) you will find some zombie matches listed under the ""mp"" list (aka open multiplayer and search for zombie matches there) but still not many. Happy zombie slaying to thoes of you who do get the game and to thoes of you that already have it, add my new in game account ""Link-Zelda"" May the Tri-Force be with you!			"

												Best cod to dateI don't really play (or like) any of the call of duty multiplayer, I've always been more interested in the campaign and ZOMBIES. The campaign is by far better than any other COD yet (up there with MW2), allowing you to play as two of the allied forces during WWII. WARNING: THIS GAME IS ♥♥♥♥ING HARDEven on normal difficulty, I'll die maybe 12 times in a mission. Not sure if it was because I was rushing to unlock zombies, or if it is just genuinely challenging. Playing as Dimitri is way more enjoyable than playing as Miller. Playing as Miller just felt like midlessly being attacked by and attacking Japanese and his missions never had any depth. Playing as Dimitri is a GORGEOUS simulation of humiliation and vengeance, leading up to an insane climactic ending, mowing down nazis like a ♥♥♥♥ing machine. Pros:-Great campaign-Beautiful scenery-Nazi zombies-Great guns-Nazi zombies-Challenging-Best single player gameplay in any cod-Nazi zombies-Nazi zombies-♥♥♥♥ing nazi zombies-Did I mention nazi zombies? Cons:-Only 4 Official zombie maps-Some screen tearing -No functioning Multiplayer zombie lobby's			"

 Call of Duty: World at WarI have played this game before, though being the CD key has already been redeemed I had to buy it on Steam. Call of Duty: World at War is a fun game, it was the first time 'Nazi Zombies' was ever in a Call of Duty game unless it was modded into COD 1, COD 2, COD 3, and COD 4: MW. Zombies mode is fine and you can download maps for your game ( ugx-mods.com is the site I use). Even without mods this game is fine and Multiplayer still has a good player count and you can fine some good servers.			"

												I love Call of Duty: World at War. The game is good. Here are the sections I would put for these.Mulitplayer: Still going good, I don't have to spend some time to look for a good server that has players in it. I just don't like the knifing system thought.Nazi Zombies: One of my favorites, even thought some of the stuff may be broken. (Example: When you hit round 163 or 200, the zombies hp go to like if it was round 1) I love the custom maps, and I can still find a good match with people.Campaign: I love this one, it was a ton of fun, but when I played the last mission, when the nazi zombies mini game came up and the cutscene, I got scared. To me, This game is GREAT! If you like zombies, a long campaign, and multiplayer with world at war  guns, play  this!			"

												The best Call of Duty ever released. Deny it. YOU CANNOT! It compels you to feel this way... The very game itself. My first game of the franchise was BlkOps1... similar to World @ War, although, it falls incredibly short of her.  Here in 2012 playing ps3,(playstation is garbage and not worthy of capital lettering) around Halloween I noticed a free DL of zombies maps... My lil brother tells me those were from W@W... the other Treyarch CofD game. Immediate launch after download and i started playing zombies regularly. I was mainly a BO1 MP guy up until that point. Those maps were that sick. I bought W@W the first time on ps3 a day later to enjoy the original gun mechanics and to play with others. Found 50 people in zombies lobbies. and about 5k total playing multiplayer and zeds... WTH? While BO1 has millions online at that moment, I felt as though the earth mother goddess of this profane son has more worshippers? HOW? Sadly, I see Steam PC version falling that same path... I fail to see why NO ONE plays this game ANYMORE? The Power of COD/W@W should compel you! (As it did me on a separate platform)Not dispel you into the future.I will ask of you, the reader a simple request:  To those reading this review in order to purchase this game: Please do. And when you do, please try to find active players and add them. On Steam and on the game GUI friends list as well. Its really up to us. The last 1s left in the squad. HOOAH? :iamsolame:			"

												Arguably the best Call of Duty game of all time, and it's right to be called that. Call of Duty: World at War is a first person World War II based game. Its single player campaign is amazing and rewarding, and its multiplayer is satisfying and challenging. This game was the first of the Call of Duty series to introduce its Zombies game mode, and it's still very fun to play. People also have modded servers, so there can be some crazy stuff going on in both Zombies and Multiplayer. Also, there is a co-op campaign, so you can play with three other people if you'd like. I'm going to go through each section of this game, and explain what each one has to offer. I hope this review helps!The campaign of this game is one of the best of the Call of Duty series. There are two stories to complete, and you complete each of the soldier's missions as you progress through the game. You play as both American soldier Private Miller, and a Russian soldier named Dimitri. Each one has their different perspectives from the war, as when you fight as Miller, you'll be going up against Japanese Imperial Soldiers, and as Dimitri, you'll be fighting against German Nazi soldiers. Each story has their different goal, but you will still be fighting for the greater good of each side. The campaign is well written, and each mission is challenging and fun. The campaign, as stated before, can be played with three other people, so if you wish to play the campaign with your friends, you can! This is, in my opinion, the best part of the campaign. The multiplayer game mode is the same as other Call of Duty games. You can choose what game mode you want play, and search for a server to play with other people. However, I like the fact that in this PC port of Call of Duty: World at War, you can choose what server you want to go on. This allows you to choose between regular servers, and modded ones. It's obvious that the modded ones will be more popular, and it makes sense, as the modded servers allow people to vote for the next map, get an increased EXP boost, and an extended amount of time for each map, usually ranging between thirty to forty-five mintues at a time. I would almost rather be on a modded server so you can get those EXP boosts so that you can get the weapons and perks that you really want. Speaking of, the weapons in this game are very different from one another, and they all take different approaches for combats. While the bolt action snipers may all be same in approach to combat, they have a similarity with all other weapons in multiplayer: they don't come down to how good they are, but rather how much you like them. This is an amazing part of the game, as it doesn't force you to use a bad weapon the entire time, but it gives you a selection of weapons to see which one you like the most. You can also experiment with different perks, to see which ones give you the better advantage to what playstyle you're going for. I should also add this: for people who are coming from the Xbox 360, then you're in luck. There are NO hackers on this version of Call of Duty: World at War, which is the best part of this port. The multiplayer is great, and there are no hackers to speak of, and you can actually play the game without worrying about hackers.Finally, we have the Zombies game mode. Obviously from its name, you will be fighting zombies. There are different maps to choose from, exactly four of them. But, each one are totally different from one another, and you'll need a good understand of the maps themselves if you wish to survive. Zombies is also a cooperative gamemode, so it'll only be better for you if you search for three other people to play it with. Obviously, there are modded game servers, and these servers are very fun to play on. While playing on this gamemode while being invincible is fun, it is nice to play it without mods to get the true zombies experience. There's not a lot to say about this game mode other than it's fun to play, and challenging when going into later rounds.In conclusion, I strongly recommend this game. It's fun to play with friends, and it's still active despite its age. It's one of my personal favorites, and I think that everyone who enjoys World War II games or first person shooter games should play this game. If I were to rate this game out of ten, I would give it a strong 8/10. What keeps it from being a 9 or higher is that the multiplayer does get repetitive, but only if you play it a lot. And there will be times where you're just not feeling in the mood to be playing this game. Other than that, this game is amazing, and I hope this review helps.			"

Posted: June 16, 2015
												Before I go into detail about anything, I'll just quickly say I give this a 8/10; ""Better than expected"".1) STORY/CHARACTERSThis game is set during the second world war. Across the single player campaign, you play as a total of three characters. For the most part, you play as a US Marine, fighting against the Japanese on islands across the Pacific, including parts of Japan, and a Russian infantryman fighting in places like Stalingrad and Berlin. For one mission, you play as a gunner on a US aircraft, shooting down other planes and destroying boats. You may notice that I didn't name any of the characters. That's because I don't remember their names. Well, I know that the Russian soldier was named Dimitri, but I'm pretty sure every Russian character in Call of Duty is named Dimitri. The other two had names, but like I said, none of the characters were very memorable. Most of them, I remembered as ""The guy with the trenchcoat"" or ""The guy with the banner"". The actual plot is very predictable -- and essentially not there. The story doesn't develop any personality for the characters, and it simply retells events that have already happened, so many people will already know what happens.2) REALISMThe game includes, between missions, actual film of battles in World War 2, and when comparing the film to the game, I can tell that the characters' uniforms and equipment are, as far as appearance goes, represented quite well. There are probably some discrepancies, but it looks as good as it needs to. I didn't bother checking to see how accurate the tactics used by NPCs were, but the tactics used seem plausible. For example, flanking enemy MG positions through their own trenches. Also, I've read that Japanese tactics were very inflexible. For example, once they decided on a plan they would go with that plan even if their enemies made it completely impossible. US soldiers in the game describe the Japanese enemies as ""stubborn"", and they tend to be unwavering for the most part, so I think they did reasonably well on that part. Now, as far as the actual gunplay goes, this game's idea of ballistics is entirely made up. Bullets are not affected by gravity or wind, and are always either too powerful or not powerful enough. One minute your enemy ignores a shot to the gut, the next minute his arm flies off from one shot.3) REPLAYABILITYBarely any. Like I said, it's good for when you just need something to take your mind off of how sick you are while you're laying in bed, coughing your guts out. I will probably play it next time I have a cold or the flu, but not much else.4) ENTERTAINMENT VALUEGenerally, I go with a ""dollars per hour"" system, where I take the price ($20) and the amount of time I spend playing it (6 hours) and, if it's a 1:1 match, it was worth the money. I actually got this on sale for about $10, but it's still not quite worth it yet. Chances are I will play it again sometime, but it's probably not worth it for the full $20. Also, keep in mind that I was able to beat the campaign in one sitting. However, multiplayer is quite enjoyable, which makes up for the lacking single player.5) MULTIPLAYER""Tactical Crouch Servers"" are the best. Just go join one and you'll see. The best part: People actually behave like civilized human beings, unlike the newer CoD games.FINAL VERDICT:8/10; better than I expected			"

												I played this game on PS3 and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is my favorite Call of Duty, maybe even the best one overall. I got this game just two days ago and have put in about 12 hours at the time of writing this review. The game still looks good today if you can crank up the graphics. Multiplayer isn't dead, but be careful. Some servers automatically download stuff to your computer, if this happens just backout of the game and join a different server. The singleplayer is excellent, and while it is just another run of the mill WWII singleplayer it manages to feel like much more than that. Zombies is the whole reason I got this game, The main maps are a blast and all of them are unlocked from the start, no need to buy them. Custom zombies adds unlimited amounts of replayability, and I never get bored of seeing what people can create with the mod tools in this game. The game deserves all of the praise that it recieves and I would've paid triple what I paid still been happy. But don't tell Activision that, because you know they start charging that.10/10 - Would give Activision more money.			"

												Ahh the rare game that just never seems to die, why? Cause it was bloody brilliant and still is! It may be old, but in many ways the cod of yesteryear is more advanced and more enjoyable than some of today's pathetic offerings we see.No waiting for matchmaking, let alone all the other troubles that come with it, nor reduced player numbers, why? You get server lists (with custom servers) showing ping , oooo, select a server based on ping or players or map...Also tons of free mods and maps to download, you get access to mod tools, free updates / map packs(bk in the day) etc.. yep.... the glory days of COD, before they decided to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it's heritage, use and abuse it's good name it had so rightly earned. :*(Quick Zombies review, why ? cause that's all i really care about! xD This game rocks, new maps still get released and are free to download from zombie sites .You can customise game play without fear of bans.Text chat in lobby.Host your own zombie server which appears in server list (port forwarding needed) and admin it.Some even have endings (goals) instead of constant survival, if that takes ya fancy.Custom content from newer cods (weapons etc) are included with some maps.So much more too.Best history lesson ever, go play this and find out for yourself why cod earned such a great name!Buy Buy BuyI think you get the idea, go have fun :PTL:DR The last thing Treyarch did right! Their best game !  it's been all downhill since ! xD			"

												This was a very exciting game. My first thoughts about this game was that the world would be at war. But that is not true, Only America fight Japan and Russia fight Germans. Where are the Arabians?? But no I also enjoyed the game mode 'Nazi Zombies' I thought that this was very realistic, even more so than Gary Oldman playing a Russian (I joke ha ha) but no it was very good.War realisticness - 7/10Zombieness - 10/10 *Cheeky finger*Guns - 8/10Actors - 10/10 would act again.

												This game is so damn good, I'm leaving a recipe for my apple pie: Ingredients:Double-Crust Pastry1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup Gold Medal all-purpose flour1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg1/8 teaspoon salt8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples2 tablespoons butter or margarineDirections1 Heat oven to 425ºF. Prepare Double-Crust Pastry.2 Mix sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt in large bowl. Stir in apples. Turn into pastry-lined pie plate. Dot with butter. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.3 Roll other round of pastry. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 3-inch strip of aluminum foil to prevent excessive browning. Remove foil during last 15 minutes of baking.4 Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust. Serve warm if desired.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Overall, this is a realy good game and I suggest buying it.			"

Multiplayer is also good but hard to 100% master, also there is a LOT of modded servers. But hey that's why I'm level 37 .

												Call of duty 5 or World At War is one of my perosnal bests of the call of duty franchise this cannot be extended to the newer titles. but do not let the bad reputation of later installments put you off this game. World at war also comes with four epic dlc's which come with the game at purchase this title if baught on console with all map packs would come to a total of about £40 so this is definatly worth buying as a pose to colsoles. Also with the pc version of the game comes Custom zombies extending the limitations of the offical maps keeping customers engaged for hours on end. The campaign to this title is also complex even for a call of duty games with likable and relatable characters this will keep you engaged for hours as the campaign is also not easy to complete depending on your mode of play. Multiplayer for this title even holds up in the standards of 2014's competative market. Also one of the side games for this title Nazi Zombies is fun and engaging and has a complex and intreaging storyline which is followed up in other installments that even rivals the storyline of the main campaign this game is definatly worth the buy and i give it a solit 10/10.

												The best Call of Duty ever released. Deny it. YOU CANNOT! It compels you to feel this way... The very game itself. My first game of the franchise was BlkOps1... similar to World @ War, although, it falls incredibly short of her.  Here in 2012 playing ps3,(playstation is garbage and not worthy of capital lettering) around Halloween I noticed a free DL of zombies maps... My lil brother tells me those were from W@W... the other Treyarch CofD game. Immediate launch after download and i started playing zombies regularly. I was mainly a BO1 MP guy up until that point. Those maps were that sick. I bought W@W the first time on ps3 a day later to enjoy the original gun mechanics and to play with others. Found 50 people in zombies lobbies. and about 5k total playing multiplayer and zeds... WTH? While BO1 has millions online at that moment, I felt as though the earth mother goddess of this profane son has more worshippers? HOW? Sadly, I see Steam PC version falling that same path... I fail to see why NO ONE plays this game ANYMORE? The Power of COD/W@W should compel you! (As it did me on a separate platform)Not dispel you into the future.I will ask of you, the reader a simple request:  To those reading this review in order to purchase this game: Please do. And when you do, please try to find active players and add them. On Steam and on the game GUI friends list as well. Its really up to us. The last 1s left in the squad. HOOAH? :iamsolame:			"

												I love Call of Duty: World at War. The game is good. Here are the sections I would put for these.Mulitplayer: Still going good, I don't have to spend some time to look for a good server that has players in it. I just don't like the knifing system thought.Nazi Zombies: One of my favorites, even thought some of the stuff may be broken. (Example: When you hit round 163 or 200, the zombies hp go to like if it was round 1) I love the custom maps, and I can still find a good match with people.Campaign: I love this one, it was a ton of fun, but when I played the last mission, when the nazi zombies mini game came up and the cutscene, I got scared. To me, This game is GREAT! If you like zombies, a long campaign, and multiplayer with world at war  guns, play  this!			"

												If you are thinking of purchasing this then it's most likely because you are interested in the Zombies Mode so I will mainly talk about that. The core 4 maps (which are all free unlike the console version) are all fun but compared to the newer entries they are obviously lacking. It's still an enjoyable arcade-y experience with the core maps being atmospheric and creepy. If you enjoyed maps like Kino der Toten you will probably also enjoy these ones,especially Der Riese (only map with PaP and also the classic catwalk camp spot).Custom Zombies is the reason you want this game for PC specifically, because the maps you get and gameplay-altering mods like Zombie Realism give you an entirely different experience. There are custom maps that have weapons and perks  from the newer COD games like BO2 and buyable endings among other things. The quality of custom maps varies from mapper to mapper and so does the difficulty in each map.For the best experience a premade group is recommended but I had plenty of fun playing with randoms and the discussion forums have people constantly looking for players to play Custom Zombies with. The game has both LAN and Online but if you are hosting Online you might have to port forward specific ports for this game in order for your server to appear in the server browser.All in all,buy this on a sale if you are only interested in the Core Zombies and Custom Zombies which are both plenty of fun. 20$ just for Zombies might be a bit too much for some.

												My favourite Call of duty game. I probally am saying this out of nostalgia because it was my first call of duty game. I originally owned this on the xbox 360 and when i bought it on pc the nostalgia came back to me. It is enhanced on PC in so many ways. Mods like custom zombie maps add an endless amount of fun and the base game alone is stunning. Campaign: The campaign is simply amazing'. You play as two different soldiers in two different armies. You play as an American soldier in the Royal Marines who is fighting the Japanese, and a Russian soldier fighting the Germans all the way from the siege of Starlingrad to the fall of Berlin. Multiplayer: The Multiplayer provides a ton of fun including drivable tanks with some amazing maps and weapons. You also get all the map packs for free on PC which saves you about £40. Nazi Zombies: One of the best game modes of all time. The Zombie maps on this are amazing with a gritty and survival like atmosphere.Overall i highly reconmend this game.			"

												WW2 Call of Duty which was released right after Modern Warfare 1. Includes a fairly entertaining 2-3 hr long campaign where you play as Americans in the Pacific and Russians on the western front. Lots of gibs, gore, and a somewhat active multiplayer can be expected. (Lots of empty servers, but still a few with a good amount of people on them.)Players can also control tanks in multiplayer on maps that are big enough to support them. T34 and a Panzer IV. Players may also choose from various tank related perks (increase turret rotation, reload, top speed, etc.) as well as various anti-tank measures such as equipping yourself with AT grenades, a bazooka, satchel charges, etc.I'm not a huge Call of Duty fan but I have a lot of fun with this.

												I got this particular installation of Call of Duty for free when I bought Black Ops 2 for as far as I can remember. It sat in my library for about a year, maybe a bit shorter maybe a little longer. Now, after installing and having played about half the campaign I can't help but be baffled at howmuch better this game feels while playing. It's FPS immersion at its best in my opinion. Not to say I dont enjoy modern FPS games and their developments, but I went into playing this game thinking I was going to experience some mediocre storyline with Michael Bay inspired action movie characters + explosions. Well, the explosion part might still be true come to think of it. But other than that I absolutely love every aspect of this game. Nevermind the fact that it started the COD Zombie series which I've enjoyed across all of its installations.Overall, I'd say this game is an easy 8/10 based solely on the campaign. I haven't touched the Multiplayer yet.			"

 Zombies, YES, everything else, NO.	The core purpose of this game is for custom zombies, so if you are looking to get this game for any other reason then you're tripping. Pretty everything the zombies aspect of this game surpases most of the current zombies experiences, as far as creativity and variety goes. You really can't go wrong because there is endless choices for maps and it makes up for the very slim selection that is included in the game. Besides that, the mechanics are pretty smooth besides the occasional annoying old game glitch, but it's really no big deal. Pros:	-Tons of variety (custom maps)-Decent mechanics-Excellent weapon choice (included with custom maps)-If you like story modes, WOW includes an  OK	 stroyline Cons:	-Multiplayer serves 0 purpose-It's really old so the graphics are quite bland-It can get repetitive enless you REALLY like playing certain maps over and over-The primary maps included aren't anything specialHonestly, if you are looking for a good custom and fresh experience then this game is perfect.

												The best Call of Duty in my opinion. I've played a good portion of them, mostly singleplayer, with my friends when they first came out.Out of them all, this one has the most engaging singeplayer to me. Each level is memorable. Played some multiplayer, up to second prestige. I'd give it a 10/10My CoD game ranking:1. World at War2. Modern Warfare3. Modern Warfare 24. Classic (Call of Duty 1)5. Advanced Warfare6. Infinite Warfare7. Modern Warfare 38. 39. Black Ops10. Finest Hour			"

												Great old Game. With many modes. Still going. Very fun and good graphics. Problem for me IS either you get these CROUCH ONLY MP servers monitiored by constant CROUCH POLICE..always telling to NEVER RUN... or you get these MP Servers where you are NEVER just WOUNDED.. always Instant Killed like a bot.. or Both. ...always must be a headshot.. ever shot ...oh yeah! These seem to be Hackers VS Hackers to play at ..all paying their dues and Protection not working on Steam Clearly. Who cares right Steam .. old game.			"

												ONE OF A KIND. This game is one of the best CoDs, with no stupid jetpacks or laser guns. There are still servers up with 60 plus WWII battles. Although there are hackers galor (activision gives up in a year on there games) this game is still enjoyable and the multiplayer and zombies can be played over and over again.Gr8 game i r8 8/8 m8 .

												I'd recommend you buy this game if you're into the cod zombie mode or really like the style of older cod campaigns.I wouldn't recommend it if you only want it for the mp mode since it's still alive, but it's not that good of a mp experience in my opinion.When it comes to custom zombie maps, there are plenty of maps to download with a lot of them being very well made.The only thing that is a bummer are the technical limitations of w@w, with some maps having weirdly fading out shadows, model/texture quality pop-ins and so on. It's not annoying, but noticable.Besides that, it's your basic game/shooter from a decade ago I guess. Graphics compared to newer games are weak, but other stuff like controls and sound is fine.It's not worth 20 bucks if you're planning to only play the campaign or only a few hours of custom zombies if you ask me.I'd recommend you wait for a sale, unless you are planning to spend a lot of hours on it and it's worth it to you.

												I love World At War not just because it was amazing for its time but because it allows players to make maps for zombies which makes it 300 times better then any other zombie call of duty. I wish theyd remaster it because that would make the call of duty community explode!			"

												I would recomend it if you have a nice computer that does't lag easily. The zombies mode gives an old school COD feeling, and its only better with mods. The campain has a nice story with great voice acting along the feeling of imersion of a real WWII battle feild. Multiplayer is also good but hard to 100% master, also there is a LOT of modded servers. But hey that's why I'm level 37 . Over all I give Call Of Duty:World at War four ppsh's and one screaming 12 year old			"

												Ahh the rare game that just never seems to die, why? Cause it was bloody brilliant and still is! It may be old, but in many ways the cod of yesteryear is more advanced and more enjoyable than some of today's pathetic offerings we see.No waiting for matchmaking, let alone all the other troubles that come with it, nor reduced player numbers, why? You get server lists (with custom servers) showing ping , oooo, select a server based on ping or players or map...Also tons of free mods and maps to download, you get access to mod tools, free updates / map packs(bk in the day) etc.. yep.... the glory days of COD, before they decided to♥♥♥♥♥♥all over it's heritage, use and abuse it's good name it had so rightly earned. :*(Quick Zombies review, why ? cause that's all i really care about! xD This game rocks, new maps still get released and are free to download from zombie sites .You can customise game play without fear of bans.Text chat in lobby.Host your own zombie server which appears in server list (port forwarding needed) and admin it.Some even have endings (goals) instead of constant survival, if that takes ya fancy.Custom content from newer cods (weapons etc) are included with some maps.So much more too.Best history lesson ever, go play this and find out for yourself why cod earned such a great name!Buy Buy BuyI think you get the idea, go have fun :PTL:DR The last thing Treyarch did right! Their best game !  it's been all downhill since ! xD			"
