												Avencast is an 'honest' game. The story is a little cliche, the plot is quite simple the visuals and sounds are a little dated. I received Avencast for free during a promotion and was not expecting much. I was actually impressed with the gameplay. Avencast focuses on spellcasting and there are two main types of magic (blood and soul). Both have some cool spells with nice visual effects. Casting relies on keyboard combos (similar to Magicka) to cast spells and execute attacks. The combat can get a little repetitive towards the end of the game and the quests aren't particularly original, but the environments are varied and there are a range of enemies. If you're after a simple action RPG where you can just spend a few hours blasting enemies into oblivion with cool spells, Avencast is exactly the right game. That's why it's honest, and that's why it's fun to play through.			"

												I just had to write this review and say I feel sorry for two other dudes that reviewed the game (now more, most of them played for about 40 minutes). No, this game it most definitely not a Diablo clone, and no, the game is not that hard, in fact, if you know what skills to choose you almost get God mode.I would recommend the game at least for the interesting way the combat works (funny how some people call it clunky just because it's different and they cant get used to it).Also, you can raise the limits of the camera zoom by tweaking game.cfg, this helps allot, but makes the game even easier.

												Extremely great game with somewhat discouraging aspects. Most players will probably dislike the odd camera views and clunky key binding. For me, I've found follow camera where it always stays behind your character perfectly playable. And unlike some games, keys are rebindable, so I've used Q and other easy to reach buttons as hotkeys too.Spell-casting mechanic is somewhat confusing to new players, but in my opinion it adds to the ""I'm casting a spell"" feeling. In this game you can use hotkeys to cast spells, but also every spell has a unique key combination like ""left-right-mouseclick"" that allows you to use all spells you know without needing to assign them to hotkeys. And some of them are pretty intuitive: e.g. when you press ""down, up, rightclick"" your character draws his staff from back to forth, sending a bolt of magical energy forward. Same goes for ""down, up, leftclick"" in which your character first leans backwards and then forcefully slamming his staff forth onto ground like a hammer. TL;DR It is an underrated gem which will turn off many players on first sight, but greatly reward those who have patience to get used to it.			"

												This is a game that could have been much more than it was. I have not beaten the game but I've played enough of it to know where it's going and how I'll get there.Avencast is an ARPG which tries to break up the right and left click ad infinitum by giving you smal lcombos to do with your spells as well as letting you put them on the function keys. for example pressing right then left, then right click performs a wide AOE blast spell if you've learned it, down then up and right click is a penetrating line shot, etc etc. Left click spells tend to be melee, right click spells ranged. Unfortuntately, for a game that focuses entiirely on magic, that's about as innovative as the magic gets. Only one of the spells I played with felt particularly ""impressive"" to land, though most all of them look fairly pretty. There are only 2 and a half trees of magic: One melee, primarily fire and poison based, one ranged, primarily ice and ""soul"" (read: ""purple magic"") based, and a final one based aorund summoning, but there's no real build to be done in summoning, you just pick the creatures that correspond to whether or not you're a Blood/Melee or Soul/Ranged mage.Spells are unfortunately rather boring. On the melee side you have... horizontal swipes, AOE bashes, and a few buffs. that's about it. The higher spells in the tree simply augment the lower ones to do more damage/slightly bigger AOE/etc. The ranged tree has a freezing spell that does do damage, but hits so few creatures you're better off nuking. There's also an AOE wave attack that tends to be your bread and butter spam, and a few single target spells that are hard to use due to the AI beuing pretty good at dodging. So mostly you end up spamming the wave attack over and over. Again, for a game that prided itself on being a mage, the magic feels very underwhelming, though flashy to look at.Combat is fast paced and full of projectiles and rushing enemies. There is no invincibility frames when being hit so a crowd of enemies can overhwelm you. Luckily the game makes you very mobile, with sidesteps and dodge rolls. Stick and move is the name of the game even as a melee mage. Despite the complaints above, the comat is actually fairly engaging. There aren't a lot of enemy types, but they are thrown at you in enough varied ways to where you need to actually pay attention. Bosses generally have a gimmic kthat needs to be overcome to kill them.Another issue is the levelling system. The level up points you get have to be split between both 4 stats (functionally, you will want 3, as there's no reason to mix being melee or ranged, but no matter whta you are, you'll need lots of health and mana.) and learning all your spells. This often means levelling your stats feels like playing catchup to even out disparities than it does you actually getting stronger. The game is not overly difficult and levels come fairly quickly, but with no real sense of 'strength' gain outside of the first time i successfully nailed someone with Meteor of Might, it falls a bit flat again.The story is not impressive. But let's be honest: Story is not the high point of an ARPG. Every dialog is voice acted, and to its credit, the voice acting is not terrible. The script? Not so great. But the voice acting itself is decent. Quests are your basic fetch quest variety, with a few puzzles thrown into the mix to keep you on your toes. Nothing too intense or brain burning but enough to break it up here and there. Reading is necessary. Don't expect a game thta will send you on a long magical journey, because for the most part, you will be looking at Avencast Academy for the entire game. Reminds me a bit of Dumbledore's Army and Harry Potter in a way.All in all, I got the game on the cheap and got my money's worth. I'll probably end up beating it. It won't end up high on my recommendation list, but if you enjoy ARPGs, you'll probably enjoy this since you'll like the twitchy spammy combat, even if the levelling itself feels a bit underwhelming. If you don't enjoy ARPGs and prefer your games a bit more cerebral or involved, give this a pass. It's no Diablo or Path of Exile or even Torchlight, but it tries, and you can tell. I just wish they'd have gone the extra mile.I give it a lukewarm recommendation if you can pick it up on sale cheap. 75% coupons for this game seem to grow on trees.			"

												I really dont get why this game has a low rating!!! The game is fantastic. There is litteraly nothing wrong with it!! There are no buggs, the storyline is smooth and great, always keeping you interested, the controls are perfect and on top of that they are also custamizable! (if u think that they are bad) You can even roll in the game!!!! Whats not great about that, hue xDIf people dont like to play a mage dont get this game, this game is all about mages; its a Hogwarts school like game but without wands. There are 3 types of magic, Blood magic, (spells that buff ur staff, so close combat) Soul Magic (spells and ranged combat) and Summoning (that works with both Blood or Soul, depending on what you wana go with).......well u can pretty much guess that one. The story is interesting from the start of the game and the many hours I have played the game (at this date and time) you can tell that the game is properly thought through. Furthermore, the games combat and controlls, i was personally very worried about really, arent bad. In the end i gave the game a try and its really easy to grasp. There is a combat system (the characters staff is out) were u may run slower but u can roll around to dogue things as this is ur ""battle stance"" when u fight enemies with spells or up close (depending on what abilities you use) and there is a running system (staff not out) were u run faster, that simple. There are 2 different ways to controll the camera if u dont like the original also 2 other ways to contorl it as the camera may sometimes get in the way. :D There is also key customisation with ur spells as you can set them from F1-F8 or use the keyboared shortcuts within the game (e.g W + A and right click make u cast frost shard) This may sound confusing as first but its really easy to use, especially for aoe spells whitch are many.Lastly the game overal has a great gripping story, visually pleasing graphics and a huge variaty of spells in the spell trees, for all 3 magic types (Blood, Soul and Summoning). There are many quests, most very humorus, to level you up and to even give you great rewards.  Its an RPG about magic, a boys life involved in this magic and a schools history. I really do feel that the devs really tried a lot to add a HUGE amount of gameplay & graphics, i dont understand why people dont like the game. This game deserves a 10/10 as it gives me a game that i am greatly enjoying and as i have YET to find any problems within the game. I feel like i got what i payed for and more. Well done to the devs ^^			"

												It's a solid game, but the RPG elements are really lacking. It's more of an action adventure with a strong emphasis on quests. Would I recommend it as an RPG? No. Would I recommend it as an action adventure? Yes. It's not like Diablo and it focusses a lot on evading enemy attacks while trying to hit them. Think of it as the bullethell of RPGs ;)			"

												One of the best action RPG I ever play.Avencast is not a classic hack 'n slash nor a common RPG: you control your character with the common WASD and you cast the spell like a beat'em up game typing combo with your keyboard an mouse.The story is nice though not exciting but the game is enjoyable, fun and suprisingly polished for this old game.Definitely recommended.

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews - Game 15AvencastPurchase Date: 3/14/2015I got this game for free thanks to a promotion from Bundle Stars.  I'm grateful I didn't have to pay anything for this, because this means the only thing I wasted was an hour of my life.I'll start with the few things that I didn't hate about this game.  The graphics were a little dated, but not bad.  Avencast provides some level of customization options which cover the basic configuration options, along with a handful of more advanced options.  The opening of the game begins with a nifty cutscene explaning the story.  I liked the art style used in the opening sequence.  The game explains how you are a young boy with an aptitude for magic, who is raised by an old mage before being sent to the Academy of Avencast to continue his studies.After the cutscene ends, the game begins inside of a classroom, and it turns out the boy is kind of a dumbass who is sleeping in class and gets scolded at by his teacher before being kicked out of class.  So now I get to explore the academy after the game tells me to pick up a staff and head out.As I explore I meet a few of the other instructors, whose personalities seem to either be 'bumbling' or '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'.  I'm quickly piled up with various little quests, mostly involving killing little critters.The voice acting wasn't terrible, but it wasn't very good either.  But something was really odd in the way the voices were recorded.  It's like the developers were trying to add some kind of echo effect, which I'm guessing was supposed to emulate what a voice would sound like in the halls of a castle.  It just sounded off to me.I soon was introduced to my first bit of combat.  It's become clear to me very quickly that this game wants to focus on the combat, and not so much the story.  Maybe that comes later.  But for now I am busy fighting imps.  The combat is really basic to start with, and involves 2 things.  The right mouse button shoots purple orbs, until you run out of mana.  The left mouse button swings the staff.  So basically combat strategy involves dodging attacks by double-tapping movement keys, while using either of these 2 types of attacks to take out enemies.Once you level up, you do get the oppportunity to spend skill points to get new spells.  One annoyance about the level up process is there is no 'commit' after spending your points.  I ended up spending all of my points on attributes before realizing I had to spend these same points to get spells as well.  Unfortunately the points are instantly spent so there's no take-backsies, unless you want to reload the game.I would have probably found these annoyances a little easier to deal with, except for one problem.  I absolutely hated the control scheme in this game.  If your game has multiple control schemes, and one of them is named ""Expert Controls"", it most likely means you're doing it wrong.  There was absolutely no need for the controls to be this cumbersome.You have 3 choices of control schemes, Easy Control, Expert Control, and Follow camera.  I found easy control and follow camera to be fairly similar.  In these modes, the camera stays pinned to your back.  Moving the mouse will then move the camera as your character turns.  But the problem with this control mode is that the mouse pointer stays pinned to the center of the screen.  So if you need to hit the icons on the left of the screen to bring up your inventory, you have to hold down the middle mouse button.Expert control is even worse.  In this mode, the mouse moves the mouse pointer without the character turning.  To move the camera, the middle mouse button has to be used.  This doesn't sound bad, but in combat, it's very trying to coordinate pointing the camera while trying to independently move your character.  In the end I wished they had just made this a first person game, or looked to some other game for some better ideas on controls.The best way to sum up Avencast is to imagine taking the world of Harry Potter, then stripping out any trace of it's charm and warmth.  Then add a bunch of uninspired characters giving out boring quests, along with a bunch of combat, a few puzzles, and top that all off with a control scheme that serves as a far bigger villian than the actual bad guys.Even for free I couldn't recommend this.

												This game is a fantastic throwback to the first three Harry Potter games by EA.  As someone who played those games into the dust, I really appreciate this one.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed that series, as adventure RPG fans.It's not a hard game, the difficulty seems to be geared towards children aged 10-14, with linear gameplay and some sidequests.  You get to run around the castle freely, meeting the other students and perfoming odd tasks for them in any order that you wish.  It's all very fun, especially when you get challenged by some of the minigames.Sometimes I get severe freezing and lagging during battle with the follow camera enabled, but that is forewarned in the settings.  All controls are re-bindable as you please.I picked this game up with a very large coupon from Steam (You know, one of those 'deals you can't refuse'), and I would say it's priced very fairly at 9.99-14.99.

												I had a couple dollars left in my steam wallet it was on sale for $2.50 so I figured I would give Avencast a shot and if I didn't like it no big loss but so far I like it a lot !  I actually like it better than torchlight (not better than torchlight 2).To get it to run on win 8.1 in Avencast options you have to keep the resolution set to default, it will crash on HD res.also I had to uncheck the video box at the bottom. the game seems to like it set to all the settings with the asterisk.Im really enjoying the game so far. the controls take a little getting used to but it has a good story and great level design and creepy atmosphere in some places with some puzzles as well.  Also its not point and click like most games like this. you control using a-s-w-d which I prefer, simple attacks are L / R mouse buttons major magic attacks are set up with hot keys, you can customize all the settings.  The graphics are a bit dated but its a solid game.  I would say its worth the $10 price tag but even better on sale.			"

												The game is a nice RPG in the fact that if you like magic based central characters it's pleasant to see the main character be focused on solely spellcasting and has a decent set of skill trees to choose from. However the problem I had when playing through it was that it all felt a little ""same-y"" after you've killed mobs in the same way every time without fail it gets a little dull. The story line is ok but not captivating in the sense it drags you in and makes you WANT to follow it rather you have to because the game is very linear and does not give you too much freedom to play it how you wish. The controls for movement are a little awkward I find but it could be worse and after a while you get used to it. All the running you have to do however can get a little irritating as there isn't much in it. The music is also very limited and gets a little annoying too as it plays the same loop every time a mob appears. I don't find it having any particular replay value that is worth again suffering it's faults and repetitiveness.Overall I would say purchase on a sale, but otherwise it's not particularly worthwhile.4/10			"

												Kind of a ""meh-ish"" RPG. You are in an academy for the entire game, which would be fun at first but gets boring and makes the game feel less than grand in scope. The story isn't that interesting. There is a lot of loot, but they mostly look the same and the pricing of items and value doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Also the stats on items aren't explained and you can't really tell the effects or how important certain things are. You can basically go spellcasting or battle mage. There is Summoning but you can't choose to go it, you just get certain summons based on your path. More could have been done with the summons, as I only got 3 the whole game and they were a obelisk, a scorpion, and a seahorse (daaaaaa...derp?). The summons don't level or change. You only get a few spells and most of the higher ones in the trees are just an upgraded version of your one before. They have to be bound to the f1-f4 buttons, which isn't handy, and you can only have 4 bound at once. They try to get cute and have you use direction combinations with mouse clicks to cast them if you don't use hotkeys, but they forget this isn't street fighter and in the thick of battle its hard to remember what 2 directions and which mouse click do what.....RPGs have 1 button spells for a reason. More could have been done to make the spellcasting intuitive and better all around. The spellcasting tree is basically a waste, as most spells do underwhelming damage and your high damage one takes 5 seconds to cast, leaving you super vulnerable, and you can't keep moving when you cast it meaning if they move out of the way at all (which they always do, must be smart AI programming) you always miss them. This means you basically just have to attack them when they fight your summon, and maybe cast a spell if they are in a corner and you know it's worth it. I didn't get a spell that actually felt strong or like it was helpful until about 9/10 done with the game. Also all the spells are offensive, and involve shooting or calling down something to hurt them. There are no healings/buffs/etc, which lacks variety, in the spellcasting tree. The game worked and was decent length. Like I said, serviceable, but don't expect much. 6.5/10.			"

If you will manage to learn how to set it, you won't need any mods.+/- Graphics - it's game from 2007, and it does look great for it's time. No need to compare it to other games, every game have own unique style.- Metascore - if you want to know if game is worth your time, then read user reviews, not critic ones. They are much more useful. It's always better to read about a game from other gamers than an incompetent magazine reviewer, isn't it? 68/100 isn't a bad score, but nowadays only the highest, like 80-85+ are counting as good game while other not. Sad but true.I'd recommend for sure this game to RPG fans, other people may check demo version (if avaible) or hunt for it on sales.			"

												I picked up Avencast on a whim before heading to work due to it being on sale. My first thought was that due to this game not having to worry about more than one adventurer style (Fighter & Rouge traditionaly) they would devote a plethera of attention to making an incredable magic system. Not only does this game fail on that but it delivers a horrible broken system of spells that makes the entire game an uncomfortable slog. Only devoting time to designing 2 branches of magic is lazy but this is compounded by the fact the spells are usless, boring, uncreative, and hold no promise of getting better as they reach higher tiers.

												The combat controls are extremely clunky - the aiming reticle freezes in place during an attack, which, during combat, makes it extremely difficult to quickly move to a different target during combat (or to manuever around an attack). The camera frequently gets ""stuck"", be it at an angle other than behind the player or right up behind the player's head, forcing you to pause the game, go into options, reset the camera, and then resume gameplay.

												I recommend this game I am really enjoying it not a great storyline but not bad it's in the middle and I really enjoy the gameplay. (I kinda feel like a badass Harry Potter) I easily recommend buying it and giving it a try.Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												I thought about it a lot, because I didn't bought this game (i won it), and there is a lot of positive reviews about it. If it were a third recommendation level between yes and no, i'd pick there, but so i have to pick no. I could tell i recommend, but not for everyone who loves hack'n'slash/rpg.The graphic is fine, nothing special, but it fits for the game perfectly. The story is not so bad, but nothing remarkable (cliches everywhere). The puzzles are good (but they forget the hints for the last one). The fight/magic system on first sight is unique and interesting indeed, but after a while it's boring as hell. Yes, to me it was boring, probably because the unnecessarily large amount of mobs and unbalanced boss fights. It's screaming out loud when you reach a part, which is just there to artifically stretch out the length of the game, and there are a lot of parts like this. When i was half way trough the crystal cavern (yes, in chapter 1) i get so tired of the meaningless fights i decided to lower the difficulty level, because i hoped i can get trough the game faster. Unfortunately thats not happened, the difficulty change didn't made the game or the fights easier at all. The only thing changed with it is a pacifier icon which is appeared on my character sheet (very funny). There was two other thing too which bothered me so much: the camera handling (with a parot of the control) is a disaster and the loot system is kinda messed up. I used the same staff almost till the end, which i found at the earlier part of chapter 2, because i didnt found anything better (seriously guys?). Oh and yes, there is two mage path, meant to be two different playstyle, still, this is the game you definitely won't replay after you finished once.Overall rating: 4/10 (recommended, if you can handle boring stuff, and don't really have other game in this genre to play with)			"

												I have played this game in 2010. It is the second game I bought from steam and it costed 10Euros if I remember in 2010. I dont remember if it was on discount when I bought it. Maybe 50%. I am not sure. It is a good game. I trully liked the story. Back in 2010 the game graphics where very good. I don't remember bugs or crashes. In 2010 I played it on Windows XP. Also it is not very heavy for the PC.Someone mentioned problem with saves. I don't remember something like that, but to be honest I always make backups of my saves from time to time and that is what I propose everybody should do. Not only for the circumstances of a bug or a loss of the original saves but also for remebering your adnventures. In the end keep some crucial save files only as memories in case you come back.The battle mechanics are different than what you will find in other games. They are mostly based on combination of keyborad keys. At first it is very weird to learn and remember the combination. Some spells have easy combinations... while other stronger spells have more compicated. This is uniqe in this game. Unfortunately this might not appeal to everyone. If the price of the game is very low (75% discount = 2,5 Euros) you can buy it without regretting if you dont like it. I don't belive the price for 10 Euros in good for 2016 as the game is relatively old now.  I always keep a place in my heart for Avencast. It is something unique in my game collection.			"

												A pretty linear action/rpg game: good controls, average character voicing, plain plot. There is a finite number of mobs, so there isn't a lot of grinding and this force the player to spend wisely his upgrade points. Extremely low replay value and a gameplay of 20~ hours if you're in a hurry, also you can access the option menu only when in an active game and not in the starting menu, and this is a bit annoying since the game starts with a low resolution and doesn't remember the previous settings. Overall, sufficient.			"

												This was a great take on the story of a mage.  The story revolves around a young mage who must fight evil forces to protect the world.  The story is pretty standard but what made the game thrilling to me was the combat and spells to use in the game.  The game chooses not to use the regular types of elements most people know mages to use.  Instead there are two types of magic: Combat magic and ranged magic.  Combat magic deals with up close and personal spells that deal lots of damage to enemies with in the vacinity.  Ranged spells are very powerful spells that can direct large beams or waves of energy but do not pack the same punch as combat spells.  Depending on who you are either can fit your needs as you are not limited to just one type of magic.  Environments are creative as later into the game the player delves into different dimensions and realities.  All in all this magical indie RPG is worth the money spent.			"

												Surprisingly solid low budget magic-oriented action RPG.  It feels like a mix of Diablo & NWN, except enemies don't respawn, you have direct control of your character and don't click to move.  You don't click on enemies either and must aim your spells.   Moving around using the wasd keys while moving the camera and aiming reticle with your mouse is very comfortable and fluid.  The story unfolds through cutscenes with still art, and there's full voice acting for quests and story.  There are three skill trees: Blood (close range), Soul (ranged) & Summoning magic.  You can buy skills in all three, but you use the same points from leveling up to enhance your attributes, so you have to plan somewhat.  Combat goes a bit slower than a hack & slash since it's more careful, but the game is paced so that there's never more than a few minutes without some type of action once you get past the beginning.  About 12 hours to do everything in the game.			"

												Loooong.  Took me 17 hours to beat it.  I guess that's not too incredibly long for a game, but this game just plays slowly.  Attacking, spellcasting, exploration... there's nothing fast about this game.  It's tedius and deliberate. All in all it wasn't a bad game, but it wasn't a very good game either.  I'm just glad it's over.  Not particularly recommended.			"

												Control in combat is frustrating because of the constant lock and unlock of your movement while some actions finish.  I can't entirely put my finger on what is broken about it, but it's not in any way smooth, and I very quickly found myself irritated at the lack of responsiveness.  Spells that move in slow motion are also just extremely lame.  You and an opponent can sling 4 spell bolts at each other, and then step aside so all of them miss.  Seriously?  How are these ranged attacks in any way supposed to be useful?  The only reason they work is because there is basically no AI, so if an attack misses it's because the target randomly moved, not because it intelligently moved, because otherwise they just walk right into these bolts of magical molasses.  Past that, the fact that casting advanced spells is based on a series of keystrokes on the movement keys, means you're dancing a magical jig to cast a spell, which I find silly at best and disorienting at worst.  I couldn't even play long enough to feel like I got my $1.50 sale price out of it.			"

												After 1.7 hours the game is not bad so far. I noticed there are different kind of bad reviews. I play on PC , and the controls came natural to me. Maybe I can write more about it later. (There is a lot of game I have to try out..:P But currently this is on my ""play it through one day"" list.) I began on hard level, but maybe it's recommended to play it on normal. It is not a good experience to die. But its not too hard on hard level either, just anoying to replay parts from the last saved game every time you die accidently. There is autosave too of course. There is skill points, items, quests, magic, combos for different attacks. Every character seems to have it's own voice too. So you may want to try it one day.			"

												What is there to say about Avencast? Well, the gameplay is definitely Action RPG, for one thing, as the player contends with room-fulls of enemies by making best use of a variety of spells, and survival depends mainly on staying out of the way of danger (By dodging. Dodging constantly).  You are given two different skill trees to draw from, one mainly dedicated to melee attacks, and the other to ranged (and a third set for summoning spells) and while you are free to invest in both, the damage of every spell in each set is governed by a separate attribute; therefore it seems most efficient to just pick one so as not to have to spread those attribute points too thin.Other things of note: the game is pretty much 100% voice acted, and there's a fair amount of eye candy in the level design. Overall, it's an acceptable game if you're interested in a straightforward, combat-centric fantasy title.			"

The combat system is kinda hard, but it is challenging. Some people's reviews that I read said that the controls is too hard, but it actually not.

												I got this game with the bundle and didn't have very high expectations. Between the primitive and lacking customization that only seems to be there as an excuse to avoid designing an interesting protagonist, the clunky UI, the very slow start, the lame lines and the ultra-generic setting it just didn't grab me at all. Fluff oriented players should definitely avoid...			"

												Even with all the the negative reviews I bought it. Okay, for a ridiculous price, but I did. I tried playing a few times, but was distracted. Then I tried again last night and it started installing some components I didn't let it install the other times. And then I quit and got to play other game.  And then I spent my whole vacation day playing Shadorun, and when I opened my friends list, It says I'm playing Avencast. But I never even opened Avencast. And it registered 24 hours of me playing Avencast. And  then I tried to exit Steam, and Steam tells me to close Avencast before exiting.Do you see where I'm going here? No? Then read the reviews that tell you about the nonsensical private information the game asks.I think Steam should investigate this. Maybe its some scam that no one noticed yet...			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: If I (the reviewer) have played a game that has less than 1 hour of gameplay and is not recommended, means that I did not enjoy or it did not live up to my expectations! Think twice before rating or giving out a comment...ALSO PLEASE NOTE: I gave this game a not recommended not because it is a broken/non-playable game or because it is not good, but maybe because of some features that the game offers which put me off. If this game did not have all the problems/features I complained about in this review, it would of got a recommended from me Avencast is a good way to the RPG genre, with its nice story line (till what I have reached), nice graphics and reminds me the times when I was a young child reading the Harry Potter series of books and imagining myself in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry which I feel the developer done a good job onBut I was put off very quickly (30 minutes into the game) but its awkward control scheme, voice acting that made me feel like the game was treating me like a child rather than a normal person playing a good RPG game and the ""fetch quests"" like ""Oh I need this, but before I tell you where it is, you must go and get me a special potion"", which really bugs me and I hate that in RPG games, I would like an RPG game where like in Enclave by Starbreeze Studios that make it all linear and to the story rather than fetching something so that the guy who asked to go and fetch it can actually tell you then when you traveled far and wide, the next person does the same thing! For me developers who do this just make it like that so that the can extend the story rather than let's say 6-8 hours of gameplay they extend it  to 10-15 hours of gameplay, and me personally I do not like really long gamesNow you might say ""Oh, so if you don't like fetch quests than that means you don't play RPG games at all"", no, not as such, I do play some RPG games that have only one or two fetch quests in the whole game, that for me is fine, but where you see a game where it is mostly 10-15 hours long, expect loads of fetch quests, which really makes me bored and sad that I cannot enjoy these great/good RPG gamesOverall, I am giving this game and not recommended NOT because it is not playable or is glitchy as hell and you can't play it, but because of its awkward control scheme and because of its ridiculous amounts of side quests and fetch questsBUT, if you like a nice game (like this) that reminds me that I am in Hogwarts, then this is the game for you, not kidding, it is actually a very good well presented RPG game, but puts ME off for its other features that most RPG games have NOT RECOMMENDED :(  I am giving this game and not recommended NOT because it is not playable or is glitchy as hell and you can't play it, but becuase of its awkward control scheme and because of its ridiculous amounts of side quests and fetch quests, it is actually a very good well presented RPG game, but puts ME off for its other features that most RPG games have  "

												Personal Rating: -Horrible game. The difficulty level should be named Hell Mode, Demonic Mode and So Evil Word Can't Describe instead. The spell casting requires you to press a series of keys. Once I targeted my crosshair on the monster, I had to press left + up + mouse 1 key which causes my character move to the left and aim is off. You can't move while casting and even if you bind a spell to a short key, you are bound to get hit.			"

												How this got favorable reviews and a 68 from metacritic blows me away. Blows my mind, unfathomable. I wouldn't give it above 40. For a game that was released in 2007, I swear to God it feels exactly like it was released in 2000 or before. It controls and looks to a T what a game from that time would be like. It would have been a 68 then, but not in 2007. Even Diablo 1 is a thousand times better than this. Literally one thousand times better. My God does this game feel old mechanically. The graphics are terrible, the controls not great, the spell skills are pathetic and boring, the enemies suck, the sound and music sucks. and the worst part is the combat just sucks. I was seriously laughing at how bad this games controls/combat is when compared to any isometric game I've ever played. The way you dodge and attack is just not comfortable at all. I got this for free and it is still not worth the time.I cannot fathom how someone might get some enjoyment out of this game. Then again I can because the top selling game for a very long time on Steam has been DayZ and that is a horrible, awful, bad game one of the worst ♥♥♥♥ing games ever made. The problem is that this game is bad enough that there is no sense wasting time on it when much better options exist at all price levels. Like Path of Exile for instance, which is free to play and infinitely better than this. The only way this game could get any better is if it did not exist. I would rather work as a janitor and clean toilets with my face for the rest of my life than ever play this again.			"

												Avencast is pretty atypical among the action-adventure clones of Diablo but still has pretty straight-forward arcade style gameplay. The choices here are much more flexible and tactical but the casting system and the magic itself lacks the pristine polish and substance found in Magicka or Nox and there is no lightning magic (an odd developmental choice, in my opinion).You can either choose to cast spells via an arcade style input (left, right, click... etc.) or by hotkey. I prefer arcade input myself. The story is cliche as hell but the setting is pulled off decently and worth a two-finger round of applause.Now, the SDK provides a good deal of potential and has a very detailed and easy-to-use readme. I put together a somewhat large mod myself, overhauling the Soul Magic tree and even added more spells. Overall, Avencast is certainly worth the asking price if you are a magic-user enthusiast like me and definitely worth it when on-sale.			"

												If you're looking for a magic-centric game, you could do a lot worse than this. The movement-as-casting mechanic takes a while to get used to (and you'll be pausing and reviewing what you have to press to produce a given effect a LOT), but it's oddly immersing once you've trained yourself.The plot, however, reads like baby's first adventure. Seriously, play it for the mechanics and the ability to throw magic around without worrying about a mana bar. Hell, take it up a notch and, for those 21+, take a drink whenever a storytelling trope shows itself. Halfway through the first major arc you'll be seeing triple.			"

												Avencast is a B-list ARPG that actually manages to surpass expectations in some aspects beyond what you'd originally expect.Starting off rather well, the game attempts to teach you all the different aspects in which this game differentiates itself from other ARPGs. You've got loads of combos to get by the end of the game, and a multi-type dodge system to boot, and that's not to talk about the summoning types, and the two-branch leveling system. All those are very decent except for the part where you need not bother with half those skills as long as you get the other more powerful types, and those are the ones you'll need since the game doesn't go easy on you as you progress through it, with the finale being quite difficult with hordes of enemies jumping on you at a time.The graphics are, I'll admit, mediocre at best, then again, I never got the appeal of great graphics with a bad game, so the gameplay is what took my focus, and the graphics never really annoyed me seeing as how some of it was atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing at times...rare times.The soundtrack is repetitve to the point of extreme annoyance by the end of the game since most of it is level based and the tracks repeat over and over considering how long the level is. The SFX is nice though, with great sound effects for all the different spells and monsters to help you differentiate between everything.The story is the weakest point of the entire game. With bad storytelling, shoddy voiceacting, and a bad script, the game fails greatly in that regard. Hence why I called it B-list.Overall, I ONLY reccomend Avencast to any serious ARPG addict like myself with a love for gaming masochism and one who feels rewarded by discovering games like this that are seriously diamonds in the rough. Avencast is for those that get what ARPGs are all about and don't mind anything else as long as they get their fix, and it provides the fix well, especially with a surprisingly climactic ending boss fight!

												Good combat mechanics/spell mechanics. You can actually remember and cast every spell without putting it in a quick cast slot if you know the spell directions. I didn't make it all the way through the game before my HD crashed and i lost my save and Havent tried to start it up again yet but while the story starts off a bit slow but I do remember being interested in what was happening next before the HD crash. Very unique combat I don't recall any other game I've played having similar spellcasting/attacks.			"

												When I first ran the game it crashed but then it worked good. You can enter the options only after starting new game. The camera control isn't as bad as other say but you need to get used to it. I didn't play it a lot just because it was kinda about getting quests and killing monstes which wasn't really interesting as in other games of that type.			"

												Just finished the game and liked it a lot for the most part. It's an old school game in the good sence. Its focus lies on dexterity - so simple button mashing won't work. Apart from that it gives you some riddles and puzzles - very easy ones and not so easy ones. Even the story is quite nice. The level system and ability trees make sense - although I only played the ""soul path"".Story, gameplay mechanics, loot and level up system are quite motivating. I don't know if I would go for another playthrough on the ""blood path"" though - we'll see. Don't judge it too hastily and try different settings, especially for the controlls/camera. I played it on normal difficulty and with a following camera. It never got too easy or frustratingly difficult.At this price you won't expect tripple a gfx, hans zimmer music or bioware style voice acting. Still all the technical aspects of the game are - at least for me - much better than expected and executed quite well. I'd rate this game 75/100. You should give it a try.			"

												This game is definitely something different in the RPG-realm, as far as I'm concerned anyway. You play as a young mage who gets to experience a little adventure on the academy of Avencast (the premise is pretty much stated in the title). You perform different magic- and melee-attacks with different movement combinations, which is really an interesting concept that is not taken too far, which is good in my opinion. The story, script and voice acting are more than good enough for me. The graphics aren't the most detailed, but design is colorful and vibrant and some of the effects are really pretty, so the game can still be enjoyed visually. In terms of gameplay, everything works really well for the most part. Switching between attacking and dodging at the right time can be a bit tricky, so using ranged attacks is often the easisest approach, but then again, it's probably a matter of getting used to it as well. Regardless of gameplay and graphics, this game has a certain charm to it, it's almost as if it's bringing me nostalgia although I haven't played it until just now. Maybe it is because it reminds me of the Harry Potter games, what with the setting and all. I can't help but wonder what it would have been like if it was actually a Harry Potter game, though - it would probably have a much bigger budget, which would have made for a more impressing technical presentation, but this kind of game would first and foremost have been a great Harry Potter spin-off game I think, with a new story from Rowling, new characters and a new opposing threat, all at the same old Hogwarts. Please make it EA. In conclusion, Avencast: Rise of the Mage is an underrated game which is worth a play, at least seeing as I got it for free from Bundle Stars. The only real con to this game is that when I play it, I can't stop hearing a girl's voice in my head saying ''don't underestimate my hate'',  but I guess I can't blame the game for that one.7.5/10Edit: When playing the game the day after writing the review, I had a boy's voice stuck in my head saying ''you actually do look like a magazine advert for coffee''. I don't like these voices very much.			"

												Avencast is a B-list ARPG that actually manages to surpass expectations in some aspects beyond what you'd originally expect.Starting off rather well, the game attempts to teach you all the different aspects in which this game differentiates itself from other ARPGs. You've got loads of combos to get by the end of the game, and a multi-type dodge system to boot, and that's not to talk about the summoning types, and the two-branch leveling system. All those are very decent except for the part where you need not bother with half those skills as long as you get the other more powerful types, and those are the ones you'll need since the game doesn't go easy on you as you progress through it, with the finale being quite difficult with hordes of enemies jumping on you at a time.The graphics are, I'll admit, mediocre at best, then again, I never got the appeal of great graphics with a bad game, so the gameplay is what took my focus, and the graphics never really annoyed me seeing as how some of it was atmospheric and aesthetically pleasing at times...rare times.The soundtrack is repetitve to the point of extreme annoyance by the end of the game since most of it is level based and the tracks repeat over and over considering how long the level is. The SFX is nice though, with great sound effects for all the different spells and monsters to help you differentiate between everything.The story is the weakest point of the entire game. With bad storytelling, shoddy voiceacting, and a bad script, the game fails greatly in that regard. Hence why I called it B-list.Overall, I ONLY reccomend Avencast to any serious ARPG addict like myself with a love for gaming masochism and one who feels rewarded by discovering games like this that are seriously diamonds in the rough. Avencast is for those that get what ARPGs are all about and don't mind anything else as long as they get their fix, and it provides the fix well, especially with a surprisingly climactic ending boss fight!

												Avencast is a nice action RPG, with a solid (although somewhat predictable) storyline.The combat interface took some degree of getting used to, using key combinations to invoke various spells, but by the time I reached the end of the game, I was able to navigate the combat system as if it were choreographing a dance as much as battling hordes of daemons. Additionally, up to 8 spells can be assigned to hotkeys, so if there are spells that are difficult to get the combo right, or ones that are used repeatedly, a hotkey helps tremendously.The character development is fairly straightforward, with the biggest gotcha if you fail to notice that the same pool of points is used for both learning new spells and increasing character attributes.Quests are generally fairly straightforward, and clearly explain well what one needs to do, with a marker on the minimap to remind one of which way to go for quest goals.There are some puzzles, which can all be solved easily enough if one explores and reads everything.The graphics are pretty good, for the time that the game came out.The ambient music and sound effects establish a mood that fits the environments well.The scripts were reasonably good, and the voice acting was okay, but for several NPC interactions, it sounds like they're speaking in an echo chamber.Other than that, all I can say is that it was a fun game that had a coherent story, a novel combat system, and fairly well-balanced combat encounters, with reasonable puzzles.

												Avencast is an action rpg which does many things well but is held back in many areasThe combat of the game is great it doesnt feel like buttonmashing in any way.There are many combo spells you must unlock and perform either by doing the combo orusing a quick key (whats the fun in that?)The graphics are decent I guess and the walk animation is laughable.The rpg elements are simple but get the job done.The game definately has a lot of content and is a hub open world.The voice acting is just acceptable.The level design is great and aside from the main quest there are numerous sidequests with unique rewards.The optimiztion on this game is outstanding and runs at a stable 30 -70 fps on my low end pc (64mb vram 2.6ghz cpu 4gb ram) The bad things are how the game fails to put in more spells and variety.You will fight many monsters and you will wonder why cant I a mage summon these too? (who wants a stupid imp)Also the controls are not goodUse the follow camera control the novice ones are the toughest to use7.5/10 (memorable)			"

												It may not be graphically on par with anything recent but it sure has nice voice acting, proper combat, and is easy to pick up and play.  The flaw I've seen so far is despite being able to zoom in and out there are certain things you can't do to make the view even better.  Still though for me this is not game breaking.  I don't not remember if I got this in a bundle or not.  I may have gotten this free.  Anyway what I can say is that considering people have the ability to ask for refunds if they don't like the game for whatever reason I say give this game a chance.  Is it worth the $10.99 Canadian price?  I think that is all up to the person.			"
