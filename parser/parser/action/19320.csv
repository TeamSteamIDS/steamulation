												Arkanoid where you control the 'ball'. And by 'ball' I mean creature. It has all the stuff you've come to expect from an Arkanoid title; powerups, bonuses, multipliers, everything. It's colorful and flashy. Casual gamers are definitely the target audience for this game.[Rating: 64/100]			"

												A colorful and fun arcade style game where you launch your Arkonaut from the bounce pad to collect DNA blocks.  You not only control the bounce pad but also the Arkonaut as well which adds extra challenge.  The avatars are cute and the music is catchy.  This game is deffinitely worth giving a shot.			"

												The game has great graphics. While they are simple there sharp looking and the sound is fine. The gameplay is kind of where it starts to fall apart. I would have liked it more if they would have kept it simple but nope. You see its not enough you have to clear a level you need to clear it with enough points. Ugh. I mean cmon really? Its a chore and slightly  annoying to clear all the maps but one because you failed to play the game the way they wanted you to play it. Booooooooooooo. Bad idea developers. I would have loved it if I could have played the game just to clear and move on to the next map. I would not recommend this to anyone because of this. Nope. 4/10 for graphics and sound but gameplay is a little on the unforgiving side.**Side note in the about game they compare this to other games Rainbow Island, Bubble Bobble and Arkanoid. You want to know what these all had in common? Once you got all the fruit or bubbles you moved on to the next level. This game is not like that at all.			"

												This is a tablet/console port for a low effort/shovelware game.   There are numerous problems. A quick note on what it is:  It's an arcade game where you bounce up and down and collect various objects hovering in space above your head.  You can move the trampoline and the character that is bouncing.   There is not much to the gameplay.Let's go over the problems:* No controller customisability* No proper KB+M support - you must have a game controller* Janky game controller controls and handling - won't work on most game controllers* No graphics customisability* No Fullscreen!!!The developer has made zero effort porting this to PC - this is just an outright cash grab with no redeeming features.

												Space Ark is truly a gem.  The game has handsome graphics, a fun soundtrack and is challenging enough to engage an adult and simple enough to be grasped by a child.  The concept itself is unique, using anthropomorphized endagered animals to bounce of a trampoline to unlock seeds that terraform a barren piece of rock.  While the gameplay itself is a familiar breakout arcade mechanic, Space Ark uses 3D to put a spin on the standard sidescrolling challenge.  Both widescreen and controller enabled, Space Ark is a game that every indie fan should own.			"

												The problem is, author F. Scott Fitzgerald didn't see the Jazz Age as all about hip music and sparkly clothes. He associated the entire period with materialism (""I want things! Lots of things!"") and immorality. For many of the post-World War I era's newly wealthy, materialism and immortality were the name of the game. The novel's star is Jay Gatsby, a young, rich man in love with a society girl from his past. A girl who, as it happens, is married to someone else.And that's not the only reason why Gatsby still feels fresh today. The novel's very title has become a kind of buzzword for periods of excess and fake luxury. The economic collapse of 2008 brought back distant and unwelcome memories of the stock market crash of 1929, casting the boom times of the 1990s and early 2000s as the modern-day version of the Roaring Twenties.In both cases, though, unsustainable boom times led to devastating crashes with profound cultural consequences. In the 1920s, it had been a bubble in stocks that brought easy prosperity, while in our own time the bubble had been in the housing market. In both times, easy money meant that many people could begin to dream of living out their days like Jay Gatsby, with life as just one grand party in a seersucker suit. But as that vision of easy luxury crashed and burned (in both 1929 and 2008), newfound hard times required a redefinition of the American Dream.And while Gatsby is a work of fiction, Fitzgerald's real life contains some suspicious similarities. (Gulp.) Narrator Nick Carraway is both mesmerized and disgusted by Gatsby's extravagant lifestyle, just as Fitzgerald claimed to feel about the ""Jazz Age"" excesses that he himself adopted. As an Ivy League educated, middle-class Midwesterner, Fitzgerald (like Nick) saw through the shallow materialism of the era. But (like Gatsby) Fitzgerald came back from World War I and fell in love with a wealthy southern socialite.			"

												So I got this as part of an indie bundle of 8 other games for $1.50, and upon looking at the store page, I became worried.Barely touched on steam for two and a half years and already had mixed reviews, I approached this game today with caution. The opening was cute. I liked the pop-art style intro. It reminded me of something like Little Big Planet.Then I saw those things up close.Those...creepy, soulless eyes...begging to die.Space Ark is basically an Arkanoid game (hooray for puns), where you bounce your Little Big Planet knockoffs around and about hitting objects this game calls ""DNA"" and  helping these creatures restore there planets to its (un)rightful glory.I was very skeptical about how this game would be, especially with how the screenshots were kind of a turnoff. But honestly, this game wasn't too bad. In fact it got a little challenging, because not only are you controlling your yoga ball around the stage, but you also have control in navigating your sock puppets that you call ""animals.""Granted, it's not as challenging as other arkanoid games that you can find here on steam, such as Ionball, but if you like to have color in your environment and like bouncing up and down cute...soulless...evil...creatures, then you'll enjoy this game.Though at a price tag of $5, I say wait, look for a sale, or look somewhere else.This game is worth no more than your typical dollar app, and shouldn't be priced any higher than that.Other than that, I (personally) can't recommend this game to anyone I know that is into arkanoid but likes this type of theme.p.s. This game cannot be played at full screen, so that's another thing to note about.			"
