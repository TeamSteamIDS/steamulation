												Whether you prefer Single Player, CO-OP or Multiplayer, this game has all three of them. I have reviewed all three parts of the game if you are considering buying this. CAMPAIGN REVIEW (Single Player):The campaign is about 6 hours long roughly. It can be shorter or longer depending on your selected difficulty. The story itself is very good and is set 5 years on from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. It is not a Hollywood Blockbuster but at the same time it is not some random quickly written story that was put together in a few hours. Every mission has different objectives and you can feel the climax building up to the finale of the game. Every level is action filled and there is never a dull moment in the campaign. As you progress you will play in different locations in the world such as: Afghanistan, Brazil, Russia, the Atlantic Ocean and the United States. Even after completing the story there are Intel collectables to find and of course Steam achievements. There are also quite a few Easter Eggs in the campaign levels. The story for this then continues on into Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3SPEC OPS REVIEW (Single Player / CO-OP):The Special Op missions are mostly the campaign levels but switched the other way round and with different objectives in the level. There are a total of 23 spec ops missions in MW2. 21/23 of these can be done on your own or with a friend. There are 2 Spec Ops missions that can only be done with a 2nd player. The missions get harder and harder as they go on. Some of the levels in this have been re-used from COD4. There is no matchmaking for the Spec Ops so the only way to find another player is to invite / join a friend and begin playing. There are also quite a few Steam achivements for this like with the Campaign.MULTIPLAYER REVIEW (Multiplayer):The Multiplayer is what is considered the strongest part of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. Unlike COD4 this time the game uses Steam Cloud, so your rank will all be stored online and will sync every time you close MW2. The highest level you can reach is level 70 with the addition of 10 prestige levels. When you reach Rank 4 you will have the ability to create your own classes where you can choose your main weapon, secondary weapon, perks and equipment. You can also stick attachments to pretty much all of your weapons on here. You can also unlock weapon camos for your main firearms, which some look very cool when placed on. You have the ability to join friends in a session and vice versa (provided there is space) and host your own private matches for this. Conclusion: I highly recommend buying this game if you are reading this out of personal interest or if the game has gone up for sale. I recommend playing the Campaign before going to Multiplayer to get a feel of the game, but it is of course entirely your decision.Things to be aware of - There is no direct controller support for this game. If you are considering the DLCs, it should be noted that there are less players than that of 2009 - 2010, so the only two main playlists are the base game and those who own both of the DLCs. If you only buy 1 DLC, you will find literally 0 games on there.MW2 Multiplayer has no dedicated servers. It uses a matchmaking system that will pair you up with other players in the same playlist and game mode as you.This game uses VAC. So if you are banned for cheating / modding the game, your ban will be permanent. There is no way to lift a ban. You have been warned.At the time of posting the Multiplayer peak for this is around 10,000 players which is more than enough to find a game and play. Campaign / Spec Ops population doesn't go above 5,000.If you have any questions or concerns with the game feel free to leave a comment.Single Player / Spec Ops Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10180Multiplayer Hub - http://steamcommunity.com/app/10190Thank you for reading and enjoy the game if you decide to purchase!

												This IS a good game. BUT BE WARNED - Multiplayer is littered with hackers and cheaters. There is a noticable number of players who are one or more of the following: Invincible Able to kick other players at will Able to unlock max rank etc. Using aim bots Using wall hacks Have unlimited knife/melee distance Able to control public lobbies as if they were private ones and various other things.Infinity Ward/Activision don't care, they're busy squeezing cash out of fanboys' pockets. I've contacted Activision support multiple times, and they literally don't care at all. Considering they're still charging £20 for the game, I'd say that's disgusting...It's a great shame, because it has a great single-player, great co-op, and the multiplayer IS good, but people have ruined it. All I can really do at this point is go to their Steam profiles and report a violation. Some people will rage in the text chat ""why must you hack? it's ruining the game"" or similar, and 99% of the time the response is ""hahaha cry more"" or ""shut up u ♥♥♥♥♥♥"", as you'd expect. It's be GLORIOUS if these toxic people were VAC banned, but I doubt any of the higher-ups will do anything about it.Not so much angry, as I am sad.Edit: Steam displays my hours played in single player. I currently have 69 hours in multiplayer at time of edit.Edit 2: The 'unhelpful' votes for this review are from fanboys who are infatuated with grenade launchers, trickshots, and probably some hackers themselves.Which reminds me... the playerbase in MW2 is outrageously toxic. The number of times I've been called a f#ggot, had cancer wished upon, been told to kill myself, insulted for using a certain weapon or equipment... seriously, someone wished for my mother to die of explosive diarrhoea because I was using an MP5K. I don't get it.			"

												What to say about Modern Warfare 2? Well, the fact that the multiplayer is practically dead, the only thing you can do is play the single-player, and spec-ops.Now, you may be asking, ""Why is the multiplayer dead?"" The reason why it's dead, is because of the amount of hackers and children. Hackers in this game are the worst, even if you report a hacker, another five are going to take that persons place. The game is NOT secure. I recommend you buy Modern Warefare 1, World at War, or any of the new COD titles. Such as Black Ops, and Black Ops 2, but NOT Ghosts. Ghosts is a terrible PC port, and is not worth it, but that is for another review.  Modern Warfare 1 is the most secured, due to its dedicated servers, which keeps it alive, and ""clean"" of hackers and cheaters.Some examples of hackers in Modern Warfare 2, are people who use:WallhackersAimbotsInstant Level Ten Prestige, and ALL UnlocksHud-Hacking (Yes, it does exist)Instant VAC BanThe Instant VAC Ban is the WORST thing that can happen to you. I really do advise you to make private games, and play them with your friends, or find trustworthy people on Steam who host games in MW2 that are safe.Please, please, please watch what servers/hosted matches you join. I really don't want innocent players to get banned.I've heard that Search and Destroy games are safe, but the player count is very little in most game types.If you are still going to buy this game, and play the multiplayer, contact me. I will try my best to help find SAFE games for you, but the chances of finding these are very small. I wish all of you people luck.Overall, get it for the Spec-Ops, and the Singleplayer.Edit: I no longer play MW2. The main reason why, is because I had a VERY close encounter with a hacked lobby. I'm no longer willing to risk my account.Stay safe, and play safe...and watch for hackers...-Cheers "

												I just get swept by all the notsalgia and fond memories from the time I first played it, everytime I play. So my views on the game are partially biased. God, I wish I could bring those days back. Now, about the game. The graphics are crisp to this day and the multiplayer still gives me a reason to hit it up every now and then. The Campaign is pretty intense and challenging, just like its predecessor. Sometimes it gets so intense, it tends to challenge your emotional stability. Especially the part where... Okay, no spoilers. People still play this, so yeah, to those of you think this game is dead, it isn't, not yet. I have played all the 3 games in the series and this was the best, for me. Just a wee bit ahead of MW1, and light years ahead of MW3. Edit : The only concerns are that of hackers plus these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unlock-everything servers that you get connected to without your notice that instantly promote you to level 70. Happened thrice till now and resetting the stats is pretty complicated. "

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 picks up after the events of its predecessor and awes you from beginning to end. The original Modern Warfare brought a whole new look to the series and was quickly one of my favorite of the series after just a short while of playing it. Infinity Ward returns to call all players to active duty across several systems including the PC.Modern Warfare 2 story kicks off after the events of the first title. Players are given a brief recap of the previous story and then sent through the obligatory boot camp tutorial. For those of you who haven't played the first game, I suggest picking that one up too, although knowledge of the first story isn't critical - just more rewarding. There are several major upgrades this time around though most of the cool ones are found in the multiplayer. As far as the single player experience is concerned, I did find the very beginning a little helter skelter. There wasn't much story to go on at first and I found myself a bit lost. This is really my only real issue about the single player campaign of Modern Warfare 2.As I mentioned above when PC gaming is concerned I am always favoring keyboard and mouse setups over a controller. This is mainly because of the use of mouse offers a superior aiming system. The controls are pretty solid and responsive and for those that use mice with side buttons I found it easier to pull off melee knife kills and grenade tosses by assigning both to those buttons if applicable.Modern Warfare 2 boasts a lot of gameplay options this time around. The three main modes that players can engage in are the single player campaign, multiplayer and the all-new Spec Ops mode. The main story while it doesn't really bring anything new to the table is fun and took me around 8 hours to beat. For those seeking a bit more of a challenge, Veteran difficulty will take a bit longer, as you'll most likely be dying a lot more due to some incredibly brutal enemy AI.The AI, both ally and enemy is better than before offering a much more realistic experience. The chatter heard when you're pinned down or flanking is more involved than ever before. If your squad says there are tangos behind a car or dumpster, they really are there. If you pay attention to what they are saying then you're less likely to be completely blindsided and it makes the levels go a lot faster.Before you even start the game you are given the option to skip the ""really disturbing parts"". While I didn't skip these parts, which I'm sure you've read about or seen on the internet by now, I found that had I skipped them I would have missed out on an experience that I will never forget. Without giving anything away its one of those scenarios that leaves you in deep thought about the world around us.Spec Ops allows for some engaging co-op fun. While it's not a co-op campaign like in World at War I found them to be quite fun. There are five levels of challenges ranging from Alpha to Echo, each with their own missions for a total of 23 scenarios lifted from deleted scenes and material from this and past Call of Duty games. You are graded and rewarded with anywhere from one to three stars based upon completion times or the difficulty level you're playing on. You can do these challenges yourself but it best if you do it with a friend. Players can team up with another player via the Internet to tackle these together to gain the maximum amount of stars. One of my favorite challenges is where you must aid a second player as they travel on foot through enemy territories from an attack chopper.The real improvements to Modern Warfare 2 are found with in the expanded multiplayer. One of the biggest features is the newly expanded kill streaks roster. Once you reach level 10 these bad boys kick in and the fun begins. You gain access to bigger and better kill streaks as you go like a Harrier strike or the mother of all kill streaks, the tactical nuke. Fear not, the kill count doesn't stack from match to match.Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 also features a much-improved Perk system from the original Modern Warfare. One of the things I will mention is the Pro Perks. These are gained by completing the challenge for say Sleight of Hand for instance. If you accomplish that challenge requirement you will be able to bring up the sights faster when you unlock Sleight of Hand Pro, which can be a lifesaver. There are a ton of perks to unlock and many challenges to complete, more than one review can cover, so discover away. The traditional rank up system in place in the first Modern Warfare is still there complete with unlocks such as weapons, attachments and camo. Players can still choose to enter Prestige Mode and start all over again if they want to at level 70.One of the only downsides and one of the biggest gripes amongst the PC community is the lack of dedicated servers and the 32 person matches got nixed. Infinity Ward's decision to make the experience the same across all of the major versions is not really a bad choice honestly. Sure it may make a lot of people upset but you still get a kick♥♥♥♥♥experience either way. Players are now limited to up to 18 players during certain matches, which is more than enough for the map designs provided.Modern Warfare returns with that same level of excellence the previous games had and surpasses it to a whole new level. The amount of detail that I saw on my 1920x1080 monitor with max settings was absolutely mind blowing. The sheer amount of individual animations on the clothing and gear mixed with the superb real-time physics makes this one of the best looking PC titles of 2009.One of my favorite effects is the new blood splatter used when you take damage. To think that just two years before this game we were still used to seeing the usual red damage tint on the screens that got progressively worse. Now we have blood splatter that actually hinders vision and adds a more realistic feel to the world. The lighting effects used when in night vision mode when you're in Washington D.C., as well as little details like light refraction on a damaged riot shield are all just simply amazing. I was also impressed with the rain and blowing snow effects seen in various chapters of the story.Modern Warfare 2 features some amazing sound effects, both with the environments and the weaponry. I've never heard any of the weapons used in this game in real life but they sound damn good. Infinity ward has done a fantastic job at capturing each of them for our listening pleasure. You literally can tell the difference between a M4A1 and an AK-47 as they are being fired at and around you. But as I mentioned above I absolutely love the battle chatter. Not only does it help you meet your objectives but it also immerses you in the whole experience. I also have to give a big nod to Hans Zimmer for creating a fantastic score for Modern Warfare 2. He truly is a musical genius.When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters of its time, and a truly amazing offering across any system.

												Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer. Now, 2016, i bought this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay.			"

												I'll be the first to admit that this is hands down my favorite game of all time. Not only because I get enjoyment out of it now, but from all the memories I have of it from Xbox 360 back in 2010. With over 1,600 hours on Xbox and another 70+ hours on Steam this game is timeless to me. Although there are some cheaters who take advantage of the game from time to time, I manage to find a good, clean lobby very often. Along with awesome Multiplayer this game has a spectacular Campaign and very fun Spec-Ops missions to play with friends. Call of Duty in general holds a soft spot in my heart. But this game, as I said before, is timeless. 9/10.			"

												Hello, it is that time again for my expert reviewing of all the new and hip modern games. Call of duty black ghost 4 is the sequel to everybody's favour shooter, Transporter 3. With new next-gen graphics all from 2007, a deep and compelling story from the greatest man on earth, Uwe boll and the same content you've been wanting since last year, DICE have really stepped up their game in this latest instalment.When you first start the game, you'll be in the menu, but when you click ""new game"" you're thrown straight into the actions. Right away the opening cutscene will amaze you with life-like visuals and sounds that make you feel like you're right there in the room. After you've skipped through that crap, you finally get to shoot stuff and save the world. At this point I closed the game and uninstalled because violence offends me.For $90 you can't deny that this is a bargain and you should buy at least 3 copies for yourself and others. A masterful movie with great actors, superb sound, explosions and russians, I give this banana/10. Would bang			"

												So you're thinking of purchasing MW2? Here's an in depth review of what to expect (I know it says I have no hours but they were played mostly outside of steam and haven't been added to my played hours) So first off, the campaign is great and you can play Spec Ops Co-Op with your friends as well as the Multiplayer. I'm sure most of you are reading reviews just to know what the Multiplayer is like and if It's worth playing, so I'll jump straight into it:There are still a lot of people that play this game, even on PC. You will have no problem getting into games and if you played this on the console then this will be a great nostlagia trip for you seeing all the old maps again. The transition from CoD console controls to CoD PC controls is a little hard to adjust to at first but after a few hours playing the game and changing some of the keybinds you will find something that works for you.I know there's a lot of reviews claiming that this game is filled with hackers and campers/noob-tubers. And well, there's not too many hackers. At least, I haven't come across any in 50+ Multiplayer games. Yes, you will come across some campers and noob-tubers but that's the way any shooter is, there will always be players that play like that. The great thing about MW2 is that there's no toxic community in it like there is in CSGO. You kill someone, they respawn and carry on. No complaining or stressing out over K/D ratio or whatever.One thing you should note is that you definitley should NOT purchase the DLC for MW2. I personally loved the DLC maps when I used to play them on the PS3. Overgrown, Storm, Carnival etc. They were awesome. Unfortunatley if you purchase them on the PC It's more or less wasted money as very few players actually have the DLC and you usually won't get matched with people for those maps anyway, rendering it pretty useless to purchase - Which is a shame, because the maps are awesome! If Activision was to make the DLC for this game come with the game itself, no doubt it'd make the game a lot better for the people who already purchased the DLC.There have been a few times where this game has triggered me but at the end of the day, that's what any FPS does at times. It's a bit savage to begin with as you are limited to a few guns when you start VS level 70s who have AK47's and what not. But you really get a feel of accomplishment as you level up and unlock each new weapon and it's respective attatchments, as well as Killstreaks, Titles and Emblems. Overall I would say this game is worth getting, especially for this price. The maps are amazing and the more you level up the better the game becomes. There is very little salt in comparison to other games, and very few players actually care about K/D ratio which means there's hardly any rage-quitting or arguments and stuff like that. Really wish the DLC came mandatory with the game as I really would love to play on Carnival and Overgrown once again, but besides that one issue - this is by far the best CoD game in terms of Multiplayer. You should definitley AT LEAST play it for a few hours and if you dislike it, refund it.Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the game if my review convinced you to purchase it!			"

												The very last great Call of Duty game. Hello, I originally began playing the original WW-2 set CoD on PC back when I was a boy on my Uncle's computer. I was fascinated with how fun and ""realistic"" it was. I was immediately hooked on the games. I played Cod 2 and 3 religiously, and I will never ever forget the day I heard about Modern Warfare. Finally. FINALLY a game of 21st century setting. I was ecstatic. I played through the campaign and had endless hours of multiplayer logged on my Xbox 360. After doing everything I thought possible in that game, my dream came true, and another was released. To some, there's almost no difference between CoD4MW, and MW2. To others, like myself, there's an indescribable gap between the two games, where MW2 is on a whole new and higher level. To me, no other shooter game has had the balance MW2 had. It has set a standard for me that I look to in other FPS games, often times I find no equal, save the original Black Ops game. This balance is what made the game for me. I've never been a person to be ""naturally"" good at video games. MW2 was one where I excelled. Because I had a fighting chance. I found my niche and I stuck with it. I maxed the game on my Xbox 360, and eventually grew into PC gaming, leaving consoles behind. I only have a few minutes played on this game so far, but I had to actually back out and type this up even after the first few matches. It has been such a trip for me going through the menus and the lobby system. If you're considering buying this game for nostalgia, do it. Do it and don't take any flak that comes to you. Do it, and relive your early teens of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ girlfriends, mountain dew, and yelling at your parents. If you've never played MW2 and are looking to see the hype, I'm afraid it's gone forever. There's a few people around on the servers, but the HYPE, the actual maxed pace heartbeat of a game that took the world by storm is gone forever and ever. Then again, maybe that's the beautiful thing. Maybe that's what has this game frozen in time as one of the all time greatest. Forever and ever, Modern Warfare 2. NuovaVita			"

												As a huge fan of Infinty Ward's Call of Duty series, I have to admit that this one, Modern Warfare 2 is my personal favourite. Well it is a simple First Person Shooter game with easy and simple mechanics (like almost every FPS game). I found the Single Player storyline interesting and awesome (great fights, and great scenes in general) and I have to admit that I wanted MORE of it when I finally finished it. Although there were many negative reviews and comments about it, and to be more specific, about the mission ""No Russian"" in which you are asked if you really want to play it or skip it, I think that Modern Warfare 2 is a worty replacer of its predecessor Modern Warfare, which was a huge success for Infinity Ward. If I have to mention something that dissapointed me, this is the game's community, which is small and...unfortunately very toxic. This is maybe the only reason, why I do not reccomend the Multiplayer on this game.I give this game 7/10 "

												Single player's alright, but Multiplayer is where it's at.There are plenty of games that don't offer a chance to new players. On so many other titles, you get completely f-cked by other players due to the difference in skill.This game is different. Instead of getting f-cked by other people, the game f-cks you instead. Half the time it doesn't work properly, and it's completely unbalanced with a degenerate community. Quite often you'll encounter a hacker, and it's not rare to get stuck in a modded server. There's no Server Blacklist included, so you can enjoy getting thrown back into the same sh-thole over and over again. Enjoy the modded server admins who DDOS you if you use a weapon that they don't like. All in all, it's the classic Call of Duty experience. This game is a known carcinogen and I thoroughly recommend it for ages 8 to slept-with-ur-mom for hours of aggravated fun.EDIT (9th Jan, 2015)The limited concentration that this game requires at the casual level, as well as its fast-paced low-strategy gameplay, results in the player becoming accustomed to passively playing with the potential for high success. Because of this, it will be somewhat difficult to start playing other games again, as you are used to no-tactics gameplay.			"

												This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.			"

												Unlike the newer Call of Duty games that are set in the future, with their parkour like movement systems and disappointing micro-transactions, and the older Call of Duty games set during the hard times of World War 2. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 manages to build upon its predecessor Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare and create what every Call of Duty game should aim to be. This means fast-paced combat with balanced weapons alongside decent graphics that represent the optimum power of technology the year it was created. This is exactly what Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 has done and why it stands out to me as the best Call of Duty game to this date.			"

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is my favorite Call of Duty that I've played. I feel that it is a nice sequel to Modern Warfare 1 with a fantastic storyline and the addition of Spec Ops, a series of short challenge levels. There are a variety of guns to choose from and different levels to play through. For the most part, none of them feel repetitive in any way. It looks great and plays great.On the other hand, multiplayer is a let-down. Its been a few years since release and many people have gone on to other titles in the series leaving Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer dwindling. They have the servers and the players but failed to incorporate some sort of anti-cheat. Multiplayer is filled with hackers. Not every game has them, but they are there (and you can definitely tell when its enabled). For whatever reason, they also got rid of the server browser so there are no more modded servers. The single-player and co-op experience is great. Multiplayer can be so-so. It's worth a few re-runs to beat Veteran and get all the intel!Obligatory Score: 9/10			"

												921 hours on record for Multiplayer only lol. Need I say more :P Buy it. Let's revive this game. I appreciate how it never had dedicated servers and is hosted by someone in game. This is how the game's online lobbies have survived. People still play and it is a tight community where most people know everyone else by now. Too bad the DLC's never go cheaper, it takes away from people wanting to purchase it now. It'd be a great game to go on a sale and reignite a hype. Id recommend it if you have the money to spend. I have a clan of Hardcore Mosh Players (current players) and we are around 60 of us. The people are still there, just need to add them when you meet them. Please put the DLC's and game on sale so we can get more players again steam. So many great memories, and still more to come. I can't bring myself to uninstall this masterpiece, and dropping nukes never felt so good.10/10			"

												Most people remember this game as the last good Call Of Duty Game. The multiplayer is good, but you should probably buy this on console. The multiplayer is entirely plagued with hackers. The neglect from Infinity Ward and hacking has gotten so bad to the point where hackers can ruin your game, and since Steam cloud saves your data, it's impossible to fix in some cases. There's no word from Steam when the community asks for soloutions.There are groups of legit players who play private matches, if you can find one, it's fun, but that's more of a tactic to avoid hackers for people who already have the game.Some of the things hackers can do is change your resoloution, your minimap size (to the point where it takes up the whole screen.) These problems can be fixed by deleting you config files and verifying your cache.They can also corrupt your rank, and this can't be fixed, unless you get into another hacked lobby and they rank you up to 70.This is a GOOD multiplayer game, but I'm going to thumb it down because of how prevelent hackers are, and people should know about. Unless you already have people to play with, I wouldn't buy it for PC.			"

												I remember the time when Activision actually cared about the games it's releasing. When the servers weren't overflooded with cheaters. When the DLC didn't cost like another game (hell, I remember when there were no DLCs at all). When players didn't spew trash in their mics in all chat, when the ""360 no scope"" meant nothing. When the main character was a person, not a dog.This game is from that age. If you want to know, what was all the hype about the Call of Duty series, just play this one. It didn't get any better after this one, anyway.I'd rate this game 9.0 out of 10.0.			"

-----EDIT-------A lot of people have been accusing me of cheating in MW2 Multiplayer lately.This is entirely false, I did not cheat whatsoever. At the time I was playing there were (and probably still are) A LOT of hacked lobbies. What happened to me was I logged into a modded game. After being in it for few seconds it disconnected me from it with a message saying ""Bad host"". So I was like ok but then I noticed that literally all of the stats were unlocked (Titles, Emblems, Weapons and their attachemnts, etc.), it also boosted me from being a lvl 30 or something noob to a lvl 70, allowing me to enter prestige mode. I didn't deal with that, just a bit worried. I looked up on some forum, found that people encountered the same problem and that you need to contact support as soon as possible otherwise it'll ban you. I didn't know at the time how to deal with it so I went with the flow, hoping nothing will happen to my account. Then after a few weaks I recieved a ban, saying ""Cheat detected"". I then tried to contact any support but people on the forum stated it's too late because Steam Support won't listen to people who got VAC banned. ALSO NOTE: I remembered that around the initial VAC ban my account was hijacked and couldn't retrieve it after a year when a Steam Support finally realized the issue. I assume that the hijacker went downloading the possible external software for the game and used it on it in order to get me banned. I remember that guy, go check him up, his name is ""solutioNNN"" and also has a VAC ban from MW2. I am not lying about this, no I am not making this up, this is my honest review.-------------------Singleplayer: Wonderful!Special Ops: Wonderful, even co-op is great!Multiplayer: THE WORST, EVERY TIME YOU GO TO LOBBY, YOU COULD ENTER A HACKED ONE, RESULTING IN UNLOCKING EVERY WEAPON, WEAPON ATTACHMENT, EMBLEM, TITLE, ETC. THIS WILL RESULT IN A UNFAIR VAC BAN.I do not recommend this game simply because of this mess. I recommend you to pirate this game just to experience the wonderful storyline.Oh, and if you happen to buy it and find that your items are all unlocked, I suggest you contacting the Steam Support before  getting a possible permanent ban.

I've seen many people complaining about Hackers in multiplayer, although there is an unhealthy amount of hackers in game, I never let that ruin my experince. If you notice that you've joined a lobby that doesn't seem ""vanilla"", simpley quit the lobby and find yourself a new one. If you're willing to purchase this game, be willing to give it some time, if you enjoyed playing it back when it came out, you would enjoy playing it now. Although there arn't as many people playing the game, it's still enough to fill the lobbies.			"

												When you look at the total package, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters out there, and a truly amazing offering across any system. With that being said, our score comes with a disclaimer. For those planning to check out everything Modern Warefare 2 has to offer – online competition, full co-op Spec Ops mode, as well as the campaign – you’re looking at a no-brainer purchase. For the strictly single player crowd, however, Modern Warfare 2 is surprisingly short, and doesn’t live up to the standard set by previous Call of Duty games. The campaign can be completed in as little as six and a half hours, and the missions make better scenarios and moment-to-moment adrenaline rushes than they do a cohesive, well-told story. If you’re going solo, you’ve officially been warned. Look at the complete Modern Warfare 2 experience though, and there’s no denying its rightful place at the top.			"

												I become genuinely sad thinking about all of the memories I made on this game, because of what it has become and because of the fact that those days are over and Modern Warfare 2 is dead. This game was literally my childhood to an extent and is also what I firmly believe to be one of the most beautiful games of all time. That is ofcourse coming from an original player, thinking on what it was then. Now adays it is nothing but hacked lobbies and emptiness. However, I think anyone that played the original can cosign on the fact that back when this game was new, it was nothing but beauty, Just look at my hours played. More than anyone else in this review thread. (Just noticed it only shows my hours played as 150 something. Which is WRONG. I have over 2,500 hours played on Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2)			"

												Well, actually, this game is the best one of the COD series. When I was still young I heard about this game in the news. That's really amazing, isn't it? I living in China and we don't have much news about games, but however, MW2 it.With the fantastic story of MW, MW2 lead us to the top of MW series, even it was published in 2009, it is still a great game.With 60fps on PC and the fantastic weapon custom system in the muiltplayer, and of course the great co-op makes you and your friends more easy to fight against enemies. So if you hadn't played this game before, I strongly recommend you to have a try, oh, before play this, you need to play MW first, that is the origin of all this MW series, and you will know how the story began!

												So Modern Warfare 2 is on PC and I've never played it so I decided to pick it up since I've heard it's pretty good. Looking down at the reviews however made me a little worried as it said the game was filled with hackers. Surprisingly though, I haven't really run into one yet. Maybe its' because I live on the East Coast? I have no idea, but everything works extremely well. I wouldn't pick up the DLC however because the servers take you and mix you in with the other people that have bought the DLC. However, you won't be able to play on standard servers (a.k.a the majority of hte MW2 community) and will have a hard time finding a match. Matches aren't the hardest to find if you look in the evening. Overall, wonderful experience as far as gameplay. Each gun has the right amount of ""oomph"" to it. If you are interested in getting MW2, I would recommend it.			"

Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare®2First of all, should you get this game? Multiplayer - Depends, the playerbase is rather small yet you can have fun in a couple gamemodes. Singleplayer - Absolutely worth it.With the campaign and the special ops modes, you're going to have tons of fun. The campaign's plot is so dubious yet somewhat predictable, that you will not be able to stop playing it before you've completed it.The special ops mode is for you and your friend to spend time with. You'll have different missions to complete, with various vehicles and weapon choices. With the vast amount of experience I have with FPS games the game was easier, yet completing the game on Veteran still remains a bit of a challenge. This difficulty level is something new, even when the AI remains dull and predicable, you'll need practice and fast reactions to survive. If you're looking for a challenge on an FPS single player, this game will definitely be a good choice.  Spec Ops category Difficulty*   Alpha Moderate   Bravo Moderate   Charlie Hard   Delta You will not survive   Echo Hard *All of the ratings are based on my own experience on Veteran difficulty, and may thus not be identical to your opinion(s).

												This game helped me through severe depression after my wife left me. I was a mess, binging on coke and strippers to try and forget the pain she brought to me. Next thing I knew I was shooting Heroin in a Vietnamese rice farmer's hut. Don't ask me how I got there and why I decided to stay for 7 months amongst his family of 12, but I thought this was the end of my miserable life. As I lay naked in a pile of my own and what was mostly the vietnamese family's vomit and excrement... there I saw it. The light glistening on the screen. It seemed MW2 had swept the world by its feet and even in the remote jungles of Vietnam it managed to find itself. It was clear to me, this was a sign. God himself intended for me to see it. The little vietnamese child obviously didn't know what he was doing, as the little noob camped in the corner with his ACR with dual attachments of a heat sensor and a silencer, I marvelled at the beauty of this game. At once I got up, and I ran. Did I know which way to run? No. But I didn't let that stop me. Sooner or later I was back in the humble streets of my hometown. I picked up MW2 for PS3 at tescos and went on to play the game for 4 days straight without food or water. My mother and father were a little worries considering they presumed me dead and I hadn't bathed since I was back. But if there's anything I learned it's that In those 4 days I was born again, although I soiled myself several times and passed out once, I knew what it meant in life to experience pure joy and happiness. As a married man with 2 beautiful children now I really hope MW2 is brought on to next gen consoles; it will bring the utmost joy to me, and my children will be able to relive the pure ecstacy I felt. Of course they're not old enough to play yet and not even nearly mentally developed to even comprehend what would be going on as they are still babies. But the bright and vivid images of their father getting that 30th kill streak with his ump-45 silencer will fill their small hearts with pride. As they watch their father roar in triumph as the screen goes white and the battle ceases. There I will stand proud a man. A man with a 5.2 K/D ratio. A true champion. A figure to look up to. A figure to learn from. And you better believe that once they are of legal age I'll teach them and guide them to achieve the successes I have. But alas as my imagination delves deep into a utopian world it hits me that in fact this is not the case. Instead I lay here in bed next to my Russian mail-ordered wife. where only these fantasies numb the cruel pain of life. Although I am happy to have a wife and children, my profession as MW2 montage specialist has failed to provide for me in recent years; in fact my primary source of income is the allowance my mother gives me weekly. I forgot to mention that my job situation has resulted in me living at my parent's home... But I digress. Thus I cannot even begin to explain the importance of bringing MW2 to next gen consoles. It has become a joke that not a single person will pay for a copy of my ps3 MW2 360 no-scope montages. The dedication and time I put into these videos cannot be overstated. I hope that this petition succeeds. For the sake of my wife Vladimir, and my children Terminal and Highrise I pray this comes true. Nothing will bring me more joy. Nothing.			"

												Truly fantastic game, and along with COD4, the game which really catapulted the Call of Duty franchise into the limelight.Much like its successor Modern Warfare 3, this game has the below standout attributes:  Superb sound design: guns and explosions sound like the real deal.  Outstanding single player campaign: the pace is brilliantly varied and does not let you catch your breath.  Astonishing multiplayer: the beginning of the now universally-recognised Call of Duty formula, with prestige, class creation, perk selection, etc.  SPEC OPS - incredible set of missions best tackled with a friend. Starts off slow, but ramps up quickly.The multiplayer is still active for this title, but beware of the hackers out there.Highly recommended, even just for single player and Spec Ops. Seven years after release, this game still stands the test of time.			"

												     This is going to be my first not recommended, but not because of the game because it's a great game.  I had so many good memories of playing this game on Xbox 360 a couple years back, but that was not the experience I came back to.  The servers are now all full of hackers and aimbotters and players that are invincible.  I was so hoping to jump back in when a friend bought it and play a couple games with them and really show them how much fun a Call of Duty can be before all the added stuff from Black Ops onwards.  Please do not purchase this game unless you do not plan to play multiplayer (which that is the only reason I purchased it).  Fair warning to all.			"

												I do reccomend this game although it has some stuff i diddn't like.It has a short story and i managed to pass it in about 7 hours which is really short.it has some boring moments where you don't even know what you're supposed to do or why.those are the only major flaws i see.But apart from that it has Amazing levels such as rio de janeiro afghanistan etc.. where u felt like i was legit in rio and it felt soo good.  It has alot of nice weapons and amazing graphics. The story kept me interested throughout the whole thing but the only missions i hated are the ones that take place in the united states.since the singleplayer is short there is a mode called spec ops that you can play after you're done and it is really fun by yourself and with a friend. I haven't played the multiplayer , main reason is because i hear you get VAC ban for no reason.if cod 4 was a 9/10 then this one is an 8.5 out of 10 but nevertheless it is a good game			"

												I loved this game, everything about it, the music, the levels, the betrayals. Had it since release way back in the day. 10/10 will undoubtedly play many times in the future.The campaign carries on from the events from MW, The early and late battles in Afghanistan are fun and stimulating, the Russian invasion of continental US is theatrical and memorable. These sections being my personal favourites the music and atmosphere are incredible, ""Of Their Own Accord"" and ""Whiskey Hotel"" are phenominal from the moment you start in the trench bunker until you stand at top the ruins.The Spec-Ops was a blast, both played alone, or co-op with a friend. A friend is optional but highly recommend specially if you're looking to play the 2 best levels, ""Overwatch"" and ""Big Brother""the  Mulitplayer I never touched so I wont pass judgement.			"

												My favorite Call of Duty, surprisingly. I remember grabbing this when it came out in 2009 and playing the hell out of it. The campaign, while it is the shortest of the series, is very fun. Makes you want to play level after level and not stop, Roach's levels being my preferred ones as they have the biggest environmental variety (at one level you're fighting the militia in Brazilian slums, and the other you're infiltrating a Russian oil-rig), with a copacetic soundtrack by the one and only Hans Zimmer.Spec Ops is a great addition to the game and pleasant to play with a friend, what disappoints me about it though is that most missions are composed of reused campaign maps, which feels lazy, uninspired, and rushed. It is also a shame that you can only play it in co-op by inviting/joining a friend, as there is no matchmaking and servers list to find randoms. You will need a friend if you want to complete every single mission too, as some require two players in order to be played.This CoD's multiplayer has in my opinion one of the best map designs of the series, Highrise, Terminal, and Underpass being my favorites. There's a nice balance between long and short range combats for the most part as well. 70 levels, 10 prestiges, and many things to unlock, perks and its pro abilities, attachments, camouflages, weapons, titles, emblems, and it's all addictive to do. Sadly there's likely to be frustration over the weapon balance, since a significant amount of people exploit what the game offers, and create overpowered combinations. Be aware also that there are no dedicated servers, only matchmaking. This piece is not without flaws, but it is still a joy to play. Nice job Infinity Ward. 8.2/10.0 "

												Seomthing ive been thinking about for awhile now is how blatantly pathetic major game studio ratings go with the hype of games. Let me get down with you guys on steam, as I tend not to post stuff like this on facebook. But more on here, where people actually give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ AnywayWay back when COD Advanced Warfare came out, anyone remember how the major game mags and sites all rated it 9/10 or just flat out ♥♥♥♥ing amazing? Like, you never saw one bad review from the big guys. On any call of duty game, or any game thats in the spotlight. Why? I think, its because there afraid of telling someone ""Your game sucks""All these major reviewers are afraid of never getting the chance to review a game with that company again, thus pushing themselves to give it a high rating due to the fact that they dont want to lose credibility with that publisher and studio.It just boggles my mind, how so many people rated COD:AW with such high ratings, but almost immedietly the general public♥♥♥♥♥♥it out and spit in its mothers face. We all knew it was gonna suck, and be something that we didnt want, yet all those big named companies praised it. Im just sitting here looking at statistics and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just baffled by how such a new and hyped game just doesnt show the numbers.Look it up on steamcharts. Statistics show that COD: World At ♥♥♥♥ing War has triple the amount of people playting it than COD:AW and MW remaster has COMBINED. Doesn;t that kind of say something? Why doesn't the producer shut out its community so much to the point that a game that was released almost 5 years ago it doing better than a game that came out late november of 2016?I dont know, something that im sitting here boggling my mind with. Wondering why a company like that just goes and does whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want, because they know they will make a profit even though its not what the players want. Kids just pool there parents money into it, and frankly thats what is keeping the series alive. Ive been re-playing MW2, and I actually paused the game on day 6, mission retake the white house. Like, that♥♥♥♥♥♥could actually happen. I paused and I sat back and wondered just what the world would come to if something like that actually came around from russian forces. Firing an EMP into our airspace couldn't be stopped. Once it explodes thats lights out for electronic devices within its range. Then, you have the newer ones. The ones with jumping exo suits and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like, when I played through the campaign on BO3. It felt more like a arcade shooter then anything. I didnt enjoy it from the story, I simply aimed and shot, then skipped through cutscenes because I couldnt give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥. But with MW2, I ran through the streets of a state ive been in before. Ive shot up a ♥♥♥♥ing airport.♥♥♥♥♥♥like that happens in real life, and I felt more connected to that then I ever will with a story. More modern weapons, no lazers or anything. I hope you get my point though. The more modern COD games were special and enjoyed because we the players have seen, and some people even live in the places they base the story off of. I know I shouldnt play COD for the story, but since its there I expect something more than a guided TDM against bots. I need to actually respect the chatacters and there backgrounds. The first time I played MW2, when sheperd betrayed you, little 13 or 14 old me was baffled. I sat back in my chair with my xbox controller in hand and just thought of all the things that ive done in the missions before this for commander. Then he just goes and kills roach, you the player and ghost. Using your character, but also using you as a player who went through all of it before. It shocked me as the bullet went through ghost's chest, and all the sudden im staring down the barrel. Its simply something that isnt in the newer CODs, and I guess since I grew up playing those types of games, I expect to have something like that every time. But its seems as though in the last few years that the companies who make these games simply dont care about what has happened in the past. Ever since BO3 and a little bit of BO2, the storyline aspect of the COD series has dwindled.

												Singleplayer: It's really rare nowadays to find a modern shooter campaign that isn't just ""shoot and spit on anyone who's not white.""  Sure this one takes a sharp turn onto Hollywood Effects Lane and Incoherent Storytelling Street, but it's definitely not bad, and at least it actually tries not to be racist.Multiplayer: I ended a round with a 360 dropshot noscope and everyone yelling at the killcam.  Then I returned to the lobby to find that I had been hacked up to Lv70.  10/10.			"

												Usually I don't like COD game. I found them borring and i don't like the community at all. But there is one exception ... mw2. I have great memory with this game it's actually the first cod I ever saw (I was looking my friend playing). Modern Warfare 2 as a great community (Still active in 2016) and I didn't find a lots of hackers.The people in this game (on PC ) are super fun and really cool. Since im a new player in the COD franchise they gave me a lot of tips. There is a something great about mw2 ... i can't describe the feeling but it's the only COD which give me this awsome feeling. The campaign is also great and the co-op mission are simply awsome !!!! One last thing if your a new player like me be carefull the people on the online are real MLG xD Worth every penny !!!!!			"

												Regarding the campaign, it continues the narrative from Modern Warfare, which is by far, one of my fondest memories of playing an FPS. This sequel is a solid followup, you grow to care about these characters, even if the scenarios they find themselves in are a bit contrived.I would recommend this if you are a fan of Modern Warfare, the CoD series in general, or just looking to scratch that military FPS itch.

												Up front: 9/10High production values stand up pretty well even by today's standards.  Controls are tight and the campaign is varied and interesting, as are the weapons.  There are times when there seem to just be an obscene number of bad guys throwing themselves at you, but that is forgivable given that the gunplay stays fast and interesting.  This is not an Arma sim, this is a well-polished arcade-paced gunslinger experience and it is just plain fun.  Beat the campaign on hardened (3rd of 4 possible difficulty levels) in 7.5hrs which was a bit shorter than expected.  The campaign itself has moderate replay value at best.  The special ops missions (roughly 3 dozen) give you the opportunity to challenge your skills in a wide variety of ways so there is some replay value there, especially given that they can be played co-op.  All in all, still worth 10 bucks on sale in the year 2016.			"

												Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay...			"

												Modern Warfare 2 is pretty fun for how old it is. The multiplayer is really fun and I really enjoyed the campaigns storyline. Modern Warfare 2 is one of the best Call of Duty games released. The game runs really well. You get a small amount of graphic controls but you should be able to play if your computer is not that old. The default control options are really bad; I recommend changing them.The multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) is really solid. Even though its old I have no problems jumping into a full game of Team Death match. The game is still well and alive. There are some cheaters but I don’t see the that often anymore. Since this is an Activision game, MW2 is full of DLC. I would recommend not buying any of them. Activision is very greedy and charges full price for a game from 2009. I would strictly buy this game for the multiplayer or campaign then nothing else. "

												Campaign and Special Ops are good. One of the best singleplayer aspects that could have been created.Ever since IW patched this game (like 6 years after release...) and removed Liberation, the Multiplayer has become an absolute sh*tfest filled with nothing but 12 year olds running around with Grenade Launcher classes and One Man Army.And you still get the irrelevant random who thinks he's the best ""OpTic Slayer reg. gunning God"" in every game mode you search, tryharding using whatever class and brain cells he has left to get a tactical nuke. Disgusting...People online produce more salt when you kill them off a nuke than all the salt packets from every fast food chain in the world put together.Overall, if you enjoy the campaign and challenging yourself in Spec. Ops to beat your score, this game is for you. Without Liberation, enjoy nothing but grenade launcher One Man Army spawn traps in Multiplayer.			"

												Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2 is a famous FPS game (obviously), as many players said, it has an explosive story, probably the best story among the whole COD series. Starting from Ellen who was trying to stop Makarov secretly, after several events, to Soap and Price who were trying to kill General Shepherd to stop him from realizing his plan of defeating the Russian Army in order to make U.S.A regain its violent 'reputation'.The game did give us a brand new experience on its graphics and new equipment in multiplayer mode, as well as the new cooperative mode – Special Ops in which you can play against several waves of bots either alone or with other players, this is quite challenging when you arrive at a high number of waves.I found this game's story really moving. It is one of the highlights of the COD series, this one was surely the game of the year and I definitely recommend this game to all the COD fans.Positive remarks +EXPLOSIVE storyline+new equipment +brand new graphics (at that time)+new cooperative mode Special OpsNegative remarks -Not many players are playing this anymore.

												5 years after the events of CoD MW, the ultranationalists in Russia secured the power, through legal ways. However, while the moderate wing is trying to preserve the stability and the relationships with other countries, a special team, with John McTavish at its head, is trying to retrieve an important piece of technology in Russia. But when an old foe is provoking a Russian-American war, it's up to McTavish and his team to prove that a terrorist from Russia is behind this attack, though there is also a traitor in their ranks. Besides, during the war, a Private is fighting in Pennsylvania and in Washington to repel the Russian Army, trying to avenge the death of those killed by the old foe - though they're not aware of that.You take the role of a mole, Joseph Allen, that will be one of the factors in the war though he didn't know that he was used for that purpose, of Roach, a member of McTavish's team, during the quest of finding any tie to the terrorist Vladimir Makarov, of a soldier, whose name is Ramirez if my memory serves well, that fights for USA's liberty after the wrongful invasion of Russia and of Soap, the hero from the previous game who will reveal himself as a familiar face for the player.Anyway, you need to play MW to understand why there is a war between Makarov and an American General, though the confirmation happens in the sequel. Anyway, between these points of view, you have the American soldier that isn't even aware of the plot, the mole that would like to explain the events but can't because well... he can't, the team searching for proofs that will wash USA's name from the affirmation that they're behind the attack. None are from the Russian's side, though the moderate wing doesn't know about Makarov's doing and that they were really reluctant to declare the war, and that seeing the story through Makarov's mind would be a long descent into a mad mind.The gameplay is still the same as COD: you shoot, you take cover, you avoid dying, you have no respite because of the enemies or the type of enemies that are harder to kill with these armors, you direct missiles to the ground, you have timed passages, you drive vehicles.... everything of that without having time to sight as the gameplay is still nervous as hell.However, apart the campaign, you have also missions to do in co-op (or alone), with different difficulties, like for the solo mode. And you have also a multiplayer mode, though I have to admit that I didn't play it, as I'm not interested in it.The graphics are also quite good, for that, I must say that I'm never deceived by that series. Even the little part in space is quite interesting. Anyway, fighting for the White House is a nice experience, and it's by night!But what I prefer in Call of Duty, it's the soundtrack. These tracks are really marvellous and fitting to the dramatic war inside.So, yeah, I don't know if the CoD that followed are as good as Modern Warfare or the WWII-era. But I know something: Modern Warfare 2 is a great sequel and a great game.			"

												 Out of all of the Call of Duty game titles, this is one of the best. I own many of the titles of Call of Duty and this is just amazing. The missions are fun, the veteran mode is supisingly hard and this is just the most amazing Call of Duty I think I have ever played. You guys have to get this!                                                                                                                                                    My rate: 10/10			"

												Spec Ops is great you can play it with your friends and have a lot of fun.Story line is good too.But Multiplayer is s**t as to this moment I've played it for 2 hours and I already played with 3+ cheaters, I mean I saw the Kill Cam I know that you have hacks, I'm not saying that I'm great at this game but I see that you are tracking me through the walls.So you CAN live without this game but it is still good, if you don't play multiplayer.And I'm sorry CoD but for that kind of money you can get a much better game.

The best part is I eun this gama amazingly well on my laptop/toaster.[!WARNING!] With this greatness the is a downfall.There is no Anti-Hack system and it gets a bit risky. I had a guy spout off my IP, service provider and other in a match and I beg that an anti hack is put in place.			"

												Brilliant FPS , It's the god of Call of Duty . But Infinity Ward and Valve really need too watch over this game . There is way too much hackers. Like once this guy was in a lobby rank 2 and all of a sudden hes rank 70. The story line is amazing . You in a snowy terrain then all of a sudden you chasing a guy in A Favela of Rio de Janerio. This is full with action just like the old Call of Duty 4 (Shoutout) . The one thing that they need to fix is it is really hard to join friends , pretty much impossible. The mute button does come in handy with the squeakers (little kids) that scream through the mic when they  get killed.Very good game. Why are you still reading this? get this game NOW!			"

												Got the game, because I had it back in the day on xbox.In seriously 2 hours I got into a modded lobby thus giving me everything, so there was no point in playing. A man ddosing me for no other reason, but the fact I used a riot shield and later getting into a few hacked games.The next day I play with 8 other friends who all got it. Noone plays ground war, so we all queued up for merc. tdm so we could all go against each other (Worst idea ever). At this time we managed to rage at each other, being called ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" by both friends and enemies.Over all, for this 16 hours I have been playing now along with this I am told to drink mountain dew, eat doritos, called ""gay"" or ""♥♥♥♥♥♥"" for using insert any gun here and to smoke weed ""because 420 blaze it"". Also, to not ""hardscope"" because all anyone ever uses snipes for is to quick scope.Note: Looking back. Nothing has changed since the x box version. 10/10			"

												One of the best Call of Duty ever with lobby ! but I prefer servers but anyway I recommended this game to FPS players. In the game is Single player/coop/multiplayer so it's worth to buy it maybe it's old but now is cheap ! I am also Battlefield player and to let you know if you are really fan of example cod and bf games it's perfect to buy all of them and finish missions to the end and play multiplayer. For me the best is multiplayer but it's good to know the story as well.			"

IntroductionI've spent countless hours playing this game everywhere. PS3, PC, wherever you can imagine. It was and still is the best game i've ever played (in terms of how much i enjoyed it)Story(No Spoilers)The story starts 5 years after the events of Modern Warfare. Imran Zakhaev has become a martyr, and his right hand man, Vladimir Makarov provokes war between Russia and the US. It's up to ""soap' McTavish and the Task Force 141 to stop him.Game TimeApproximately 8 hours.In detailIt's too late to experience multiplayer, since only a handful of people are still playing but the single player and coop missions are still playable and enjoyablePros+co-op missions. Best feature in my point of view.+Interesting plot, great cinematic cutscenes+During single player, you control either a Task force member or a US army ranger, depending on the mission, giving you the opportunity of experiencing war from the first line, but also the conditions of undercover black ops.+Great multiplayer. Everything is well designed, creating an enjoyable experience.+Great soundtrack, greatly implemented into the campaign.ConsSorry, cant find any :PConcluding, i totally reccomend it since it's likely to attract players for multi on a sale. As i said before, it's the most enjoyable game i've ever played.10.0 / 10.0 Merged 700 hours of gameplay (2 accounts)1. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10].2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10].3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10] "

												Game: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Original Release Date: 12 Nov, 2009Date of Review: 05 September, 2015Update Febuary 2016: VAC has now been made useless, where VAC bans do not prevent people from playing.The Good:- No overcomplications, no future/exo stuff.- Special Ops is kinda decent, and the campaign is alright.- Most guns are fairly balanced.- Config files not encrypted.- Fairly well optimised and decent graphics (by 2009/2010 standards) if you put them up to ""Extra"".The Bad:- VAC REMOVED, cheaters roam free with no punishments.- Abandoned by developers, no bug fixes/patches.- P2P Networking, no dedicated servers (Unlike every previous CoD), therefore more hackers then any other CoD.- No included DLC, even though the game has been out since 2009, so small community split even futher.- The start of Infinity Ward hating PC gamers.- No mod support (Unlike every previous CoD).- No map editing support (Unlike every previous CoD).- Locked 65 FOV (Unlike every previous CoD).- No developer console access (Unlike every previous CoD).- Have to edit config files to customise commands like max FPS.- High cost, few sales. £37.99 for the game and all DLC, 6 years after release.- Literally a killstreak that ends the match.

												I like the campaign and, even more, the special operations very much: they are fun to play with a friend and, some of them, very challenging. I prefer those missions which don't have a timer and you don't have to hurry up to finish them. Chill out and play them your way.About the player vs. player part of the game, which I'm not interested in, I've read in other player's opinions that it's also very well done.What do I miss in this game? A cooperative campaign, like in CoD World at War, and a FOV slider.			"

												Modern Warfare continues with the developers imagining the beginning of a contemporary war with Russia, started by the infamous airport massacre scene. The main campaign has it's good moments hunting down hostiles in the favelas or trying to save DC under heavy attack, but is quite short as usual (or even more). Using the riot shield is a nice change of strategy and a lot of fun and the game delivers the adrenaline rush that's expected, but despite SPEC OPS (which is mostly the same levels from the campaign with a few mods - packing an occasional surprise for specific COOP missions) and MP, there isn't enough to grow attached to this title, you basically just want to play the sequel that delivers the full blown chaos that continues the story...Perhaps that was the point?

												A game so cartoonishly over the top you will half expect an animated rabbit to be your squad leader, Modern Warfare 2 offers you all of the shooting you've come to love from your power fantasies, but none of the realism people tell you CoD has. But if CoD was realistic, half of the game would be waiting for your girlfriend back home to ship your spare underwear to base while you lazily play basketball in your off time because there's literally nothing to do, so I guess I'm fine with the wacky zany premise.

												I reccomend this game if you have played it before, as there are many hackers, and generally annoying people who play the game, and ruin the experience. If you haven't played before, I suggest you play a newer game, preferably Black Ops 2, due to a higher playerbase, lower likelyhood of annoying people, and no exo-suits, or supply drops. MW2 requires more skill than most of the Series just due to the physics. Once you get used to the physics, you will be fine.

												Right, about time I made this review.I remember this game, when it came out. Everybody was hyped for it, myself included. And unlike what you might expect, all my skyhigh expectations was suddenly very real. The gameplay was smooth (for a freshly launched game, mind you), the levels were well made, and the action was fast paced.Now, even after several hundred hours spent in the multiplayer, and many new titles being released since, I still find myself returning to this game from time to time. the amount of players still playing, is ever dwindling, as can be expected with an aging game.but the feeling this game gives you, of nostalgia, of pure fun and carnage, is unlike any other game out there (save for DOOM 3, and UT 2004). It really is, an all time classic. If you have yet to play this game, but like fast paced shoot-em-in-the-face-and-laugh type of FPS games, then this is for you. If you on the other hand like FPS games that require more though than duck, run, and shoot, this game (hell, this whole series of games) might not fall to your liking.However, given that its drop in price of the years, althought still not cheap by any means, it's defo worth a try. If nothing else, to take on your mates, and have a blast that you will all be able to remember.I hope this provided you with some usefull insight into this game.All The bestPvt. Mini			"

Review Upon Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2Written by:  Rias Gremory	Personal ExperienceI have recently decided to re-buy this classic game on steam. I have had no problems with the installation of the game, and have given a lot of time into this game in the past (When I was playing console) The game itself still looks beautiful for today's standards even though it was released back in the fall of 2009. I have already sunk a lot of my time into the multiplayer, and I am looking forward to re-playing the campaign.Game BalanceThe game is very easy to run, even if it needs lower graphical settings, The maps are large and have a lot of hot spots for gun fights, speaking of the guns... They are all balanced (Other than the Vector) The mechanics have a lot of detail, and have had no glitching problems so far.Problems encounteredAlthough I do have a problem with the amount of hackers, due to the VAC system not working to its full potential. Now I know it is classic for COD to have extremely sensitive feet (You can 1 hit someone if you hit their feet) but I have seen a lot of people 'Drop Shotting', if you are unfamiliar with this it is when you see a player you drop to the floor instantly and shoot, this makes the person stutter and they end up dying, but this can easily be bypassed by shooting their feet ;)Multiplayer ExperienceI have enjoyed re-completing the multiplayer stuff, and will continue to do so. Nothing else has really bothered me, and in actual fact the player base on here is much more squeaker free, and has more mature players.OverviewI would recommend this to any person who has played Modern Warfare in the past, and would like to re-visit the nostalgic times, even if you have never played Modern Warfare 2 I would still heavily say it is the best COD around. It has even guns, a nice amount of players, and overall I still great graphics engine.Extra InformationDeveloper(s): Infinity Ward, Aspyr (Mac)Publisher(s): Activision, Aspyr (Mac)Platform(s): PS3, Xbox 360, PC, and MacRelease Date: November 12th 2009Genre(s): Action, FPS, and MultiplayerSource(s):Personal KnowledgeSteam Store PageWritten for 11th Floor 11th Floor Group	 "

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was released in November 2009. It’s a first-person shooter game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. Modern Warfare 2 continues on from the story line of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The Russian ultranationalists have taken control of Russia. Imran Zakhaev (the bad guy from the previous game) has been made a martyr. Vladimir Makarov, loyal right hand man to Zakhaev starts a campaign of revenge, committing acts of atrocities against the west.  The player assumes various roles throughout the game, the two most prominent characters being Private First Class Joseph Allen, a Ranger for the U.S Army, and Gary Roach, an elite special forces Sergeant of task force 141. John Soap MacTavish makes an appearance in the final 3 missions. Using the IW 4 Engine, not much has changed from Modern Warfare’s IW 3 Engine. The quality of the graphics has improved slightly since the previous game. The weather effects are better and trees and grass are more realistic. It still works on Windows 10 on a modern PC.You never get stuck in the game as there is always a way point symbol on the screen to follow to the next objective. The game mechanics are the same as the previous Modern Warfare Game. You are given a lot of ammo to start a mission and should never run out, but if you do there are ammo crates scattered about the map and other weapons are also scattered about.The story is not as good as the previous game but still keeps you interested throughout. Action packed and adrenalin filled, you should be entertained from start to finish. The sound track is very good, adding to the atmosphere.Once again the game is quite short and can be completed in under 5 hours.The game is rated Mature. One of the missions may offend some people but there is an option to skip it.Overall I found the game very enjoyable.I give it 8.7/10			"

												Exactly 4 years ago I got this game so I wanted to write a quick review based on my previous experiances on this game. Please note that everyone has their own opinion so I am just stating what I feel. Firstly the single player story line which links into Modern Warfare 3 is very engaging, at times emotional and even intense. I have enjoyed completing the single player twice and am considering re-playing it very soon. (on the Playstation3 though). Overall if you include the time spent on this game on both the PC and PS3 it will be around 300+ hours which i feel is a well spent amount of time for a game. At this current time sadly with the release of new games this game has become more innactive, especially on the PC and servers are becomming more ""cheat based and hacked""; however from my experience in the past this game has been very enjoyable with it being fun to raise up your rank as well as customise your weapons of choice. With a variety of different game modes and and killstreaks this game really is one to put on the shelf as a modern classic. As I said this review is based entirely upon my own opinion so you all are entitled to your own opinion which may differ from mine. But definately a great game. At this time though it is best getting on the XBox360 or PS3 rather than the PC which has become more innactive due to other game releases over the last 2 years.			"

 Full of hackers, but still playable It's definitley not as fun as it was. Considering you're likely to encounter at least 1 person cheating in any lobby you join. It is definitley still playable though. I got it yesterday and have put 11 hours in. Still a lot of fun and a lot of nostalgia to it. I played hundreds and hundreds of hours of it back in the day on Xbox and got max prestige. The community overall is pretty toxic and like I said full of hackers. So if you don't mind that and still want to play I say go for it. I'm enjoying it a lot. No need to talk about the gameplay really, its MW2. Sometimes the servers will rubberband you all over the place until you leave the game. Idk if it's a person in the game doing it but it happens all the time. Minor inconvience to pay in order to enjoy one of the best FPS games of all time.			"

												I am okay with cheaters in my game, but if they are a horrible host there is something wrong with their ethics. I was in a game with one of those cheaters, decided to make everything fast without my consent. I asked him ""I want to play in a vanilla standing"" and he listened to me. Made everything normal. He was the best host I encountered too. The cheater chose only fun maps and didn't mess with our games after I requested him not to. The fact that cheaters can easily exploit due to the fact they practicly own the server when hosting makes it very vulnerable for cheaters, not to mention bad connection. I mention good cheaters that do not impact your experience negativly but those cheaters whom beat the game with their cheats is annoying, sometimes their cheats are shown in the killcam which is funny yet rediculous. I don't really like this game, p[layed it to remember the thrills of my 5th grade life. I remember having a friend over and we would be on split-screen Rust just quick-scoping for like 2hrs. I recommend it because it is slightly playable, like it was 6 years ago.			"

												Now, Dont get me wrong. Modern Warfare 2 is a good game. But nowadays, you get nothing but hackers who get in lobbys  on public and gives everyone a prestiege master hack or unlock all weapons. I would DEFFIENTLY play this game over Modern Warfare 3. And that's saying something. That Infinity Ward needs to stop making Call of Duty games in general. (Seriouisly, Ghosts is NOT worth it.)			"

												Modern Warfare 2 carries the good tradition of its predecessor. The campaign is nonetheless too short, and it feels too inspired to the previous one; on the other side, the multiplayer carries a lot of improvements, and Spec Ops is a well crafted coop mode. If you consider buying for online fun, this is the game that will steal your life for the months to come. If you're up to an unforgettable single player experience you might consider other more lengthy and original titles.			"

												Very similar to CoD MW3. The sucessor of Call of Duty 4. Here is Call of duty: Modern warfare 2.Modern warfare has console-like servers (as in MW3 and Black ops II), not community servers, which i hate.There is a mod which lets you play on community servers, and that mod is more active then the official game.The Sp is fun, special ops (co-op) is fun with a buddy, and multiplayer is fun.The multiplayer is what most people buy CoD for, so i'll talk about that.Since the way the servers are, if there is a undected hack, hackers won't be banned.there's not really a large community on the stock game, and i find the servers to be a bit more laggy then normal games.Slight of hand + Stopping power + Steady aim with a decent rifle and rapid fire attachment makes a easy OP class.I had a bit of fun on this game, i prefer CoD4 to it.

												Overall, one of the best games i have ever played. When i played back in 2010-2011 on my PS3, i didnt realize how good it actually was. And im talking about both experiences: singleplayer and multiplayer.Now, 2016, i re-bough this game on the steam winter sale. And god, what a good choice this was.About the multiplayer: its the strong point of MW2. The community may be smaller now, since there have been so many new CoD games, but there are still people playing. You can find a party even 4 am on a wednesday. The multiplayer quality is fantastic. The amount of content keeps you coming back for more. A lot of customization options, which includes call signs, emblens, perks, attachments... Killstreaks are a good reward for the players skills. I personally like the matchmaking system instead of dedicated servers, becouse it keeps the game alive, becouse everyone can become a host, we all know there are a lot of limitations to host a dedicated server. There is also a mode that can be played both singleplayer and multiplayer, called Special Ops. Here you do some very cool missions, usually not very long. They use some locations from the campaing. But its very good becouse its VERY challenging. Its very skill based, and it will take you some time and patience to do all Spec Ops missions. Its much more fun to do with a friend rather than doing alone. Spec Ops gives MW2 a very unique perspective over the other CoD games, becouse in my opinion its a better mode than Survival and Zombies.And theres the singleplayer campaing, which continues the story from MW in a very good way. The story is short, you can probably beat in in 5-6 hours in the regular difficulty, but its a very entertaing story about war. Although you probably wont spend a lot of time in this mode, you will enjoy the cinematics and the whole story a lot.Is MW2 the best CoD game so far? Yes. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the bests.But wait, isnt the game too old? Yes and no. ""Yes"" becouse it was launched 7 years ago, but ""no"" becouse the game aged really well in all aspects. Im talking mostly about graphics and gameplay.			"

And, of course, speaking about MW2, I can't but mention, probably main feature why this game is so cool! Yeah, you are right, I'm talking about its multiplayer. It is so exciting and dynamic, that i had nearly ♥♥♥♥ed in my pants ;D. I still consider that MW2 multiplayer is one of the best among existing online shooters. 10/10! ♥♥♥♥♥♥s won't understand..			"

												Yes, the multiplayer section of the game has hackers in it. Yes, the multiplayer portion is a broken in terms of the weapons, perks, and ""noobtubes"".However, with all of this being said, Modern Warfare 2 will always hold a place in my heart for being one of the last ""good"" Call of Duties.The game most certainly is not ""dead"", plenty of people still play this game, and I do not blame them. MW2 is perhaps (even with the hackers and broken multiplayer) one of the most fun CoDs out of all of them. While I do not have many hours here on the Steam version, I played this game the most on the Xbox 360, before I got the ""red ring of death"".This game is perfect for casual gamers like me, who just like to relive the nostalgia of the Modern Warfare franchise, and not always aim for the highest score or the most kills.One thing I do not recommend about this game is the DLC. While you do get the classic CoD 4 maps and such, they will hinder your matchmaking, and you may or may not find any games at all with them equipped. The only positive benefit to having the DLC is that most hackers do not have it or use it, therefore allowing you to play ""legit"" matches.			"

												Though shunned by others as a lousy and inefficient game, this game is good in my opinion. The story is well written, with tensifying moments in between with a shocking discovery in the end. If you're interested in getting a good COD game, I would suggest at least giving this game a try instead of wasting your bucks on rubbish COD games like Ghosts or Advanced Warfare. Though I say that this game is good, it ain't a bed of roses either. And by that I mean the multiplayer of this game. Let me tell you this: Stay away from the multiplayer of this game if you know what's good for you. Cause if you don't, something bad is going to happen to you....... (Hint: Take the first three letters of the word 'vaccine' and take the first three letters of the word 'banana'. Put them as two words.) So what do you get?So I highly recommend this game for the story and the spec ops, all in which are well done. I personally loved the story the most. Oh yeah, and did I mention that you shouldn't touch the multiplayer of this game cause you'll be in deep trouble if you do?			"

There's just so much quality content packed into this game that it will almost certainly be one of the most-played games in your library for a long time to come. One of the best FPS Multiplayer games on PC. A breathtaking campaign and an awesome multiplayer. Great graphics with good sound.

												P.S: Review is only for the campaign, didn't try the multiplayerIt's ok, mixes enough elements on the levels without boring me, game wasn't able to keep me from playing it in one seating or at least more than 2 hours at a time. Average story, at least somewhat memorable characters. It's still a very linear shooter which is not bad since there's going to be rarely any bugs pr complications compared to open world. Definitely cool graphics for 2009. but the story length is only 5 hours (played at hardened difficulty, veteran is just BS, you need to know where the enemy pops out to be able to shoot them first)			"

Rank: 6.5/10Recommendation(s): Play Call of Duty 4. Be able to deal with very high game pace.Major Theme: High game pace, high action title.Bought at Price: $0.00 (Gift at full price of $60.99)Yes, even a long time ago, I used to play Call of Duty. Say What!?! Yes, even as a strong advocate of the PC Gaming ecosystem, I too enjoyed a Call of Duty title. It probably wasn’t the best title to get, but at the time it was reasonable. At least on the PC, this was the last average title to be cranked out.Obviously Call of Duty isn’t realistic (I certainly hope you understand that), nor was it really intended to be (I hope not). The appeal too many is the quick, non-stop action and the ability to use Kill Streaks along with perks to change up gameplay. “Fair” isn’t a term I would use, as each Call of Duty title has its own overpowered or unbalanced class and weapon setup. If you are looking for actual competitive play, Counter Strike is where you should go.The graphics are ok, the FOV is like taping your face to the screen, and the singleplayer plot is kind of dry and confusing. For sure however, this title stands on its own – just like Call of Duty 4 on PC.I might go back and play this game again, but I don’t think it would be for a long period of time. If you are into the Call of Duty series, Black Ops 2/3 will have a much upgraded experience for PC players. For “COD purists”, this title will be the one.			"

												Despite Infinity Ward selling DLC in all their games, microtransactions in their most recent game, almost never having to pay for server hosting, making more than most other game developers from tremendous sales... despite all of that, they don't spend the money on upkeeping their old games.It's unbelievable that they drop support for a game once the next one is out, and the PC is always the last priority for them.  There is still a ton of life in this game...or even COD4, but Infinity Ward doesn't even look twice at them anymore.  Both games are plagued with a LOT of cheaters online.  It's almost as if the game has become like a 'Thieve's Landing' type of place... a place where all cheaters get together because they know there's no law enforcement there.  Cheaters cheating against other cheaters.  It really is something that has to be seen to be believed.			"

												I love the Call of Duty games, especially Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and I am glad to announce that Modern Warfare 2 lives up to it's predecessor. The core gameplay is mainly the same, but you'll fight in new settings, with a larger arsenal than ever before. There is also Special Ops mode, which is a very nice addition. Although the Campaign is very good, my only real complaint is the mission placement. I really didn't like how it constantly switched between the British and U.S. missions. It gave me whiplash. I also found the Multiplayer to be dull, but I don't buy CoD for the Multiplayer anyways. Overall, the game is worth every cent.9/10			"

												Great fun with a decent community still. If you play Tdm you will still find games. This is the point where CoD multiplayer was at its best in my opinion. I understand that people really enjoy CoD4, but this game is easily just CoD4+More - more attachments, more weapons, more killstreaks, deathstreaks, more reasons to prestige, titles and emblems, more ways to play and be unique in your play. Campaign is one of the best in the series, but much better if you play the Modern Warfare series in order because they all connect and have the same characters. SpecOps missions are fun side things to do co-op with and have decent replayability with the varying difficulty and needing to do better at them to unlock more missions. Overall, great game with a great campaign and the point in the series where multiplayer was at its best. I have yet to run into any hackers in my first ten online games.Part Two:Right after writing the review I had a run of like, five games with hackers in them. So, there are a lot of hackers in the game, but if you just avoid where they are looking or are playing on a big map there's nothing to really worry about. Remember, true skill always is better than manufactured skill. You can still destroy them even if they see you through the corner.			"

 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2	  is the game that absorbed most of my time in a singleplayer mode. Never before had I passed all the missions on veteran difficulty nor found all the hidden in-game intels. Highly recommend, the plot is not only gripping, but also very enjoyable. Furthermore the soundtrack owes an applause since it was created by Hans Zimmer thus it has to be astonishing.			"

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 was one of the first games that got me into CoD and gaming in general and CoD MW2 is one of, if not THE VERY BEST CoD game. (IN MY OPINION) I remember me and a bunch of my mates finding out we all had gaming consoles like PS3 and XBox 360s. We added each other and saw this game at the store. There was like 8 of us in one party it was great fun. We all laughed and had a good time playing this game. I would DEFINITLEY recomend this game to ANYONE that is looking for a good, classic, fun FPS game for PC. Fantastic job on this. (Sorry for being such a long review. I just need to let people know to buy this game.)			"

It's not as dedication-rewarding as the newer games, prestiging resets everything litteraly so it's not very fun to prestige. The guns are really fun though. Lots of traditional weapons such as UZI and M4A1, good off-hands (shotguns are secondaries, overpowered but fun). All the guns are fun in their own way if you know how to use them. Attachments are as usual. Red dot sights, silencers, noobtubes (which are horribly overpowered in this game and has never been fixed, probably because IW doens't care about gaming experience), nothing new. You can unlock different versions of attachments by using that attachment which is pretty cool. Using the Red Dot Sight unlocks Holographic Sight, using underbarrel grenade launcher unlocks underbarrel shotgun, stuff like that. Emblems and titles are really cool and well-made imo. Killstreaks is nothing new. Care package, chopper support, airstrikes, controlling AC130s weapons and being a chopper gunner, stuff like that. They're cool and fun to get but not original.Maps are really cool. A russian snow map, a woodland map with a really cool cabin on a hill, tight urban combat in an afghanistan-like map, love the maps in this game. They're the best maps in any CoD game imho. You can also buy a map pack that gives you the maps from CoD 4 (not sure if all of them) which is really coolIf you're a CoD fan then this game is nice to play sometimes when you want a good CoD game to not dedicate yourself to or take seriously.

												The single player game is fun and relatively engaging for the 5 hours it takes to complete.  The story is nonsensical with only the barest thread linking action pieces together and since you play a multiple characters the plot understanding fragments  further.  Oh, and the plot requires you to suffer and die a lot and on purpose.  So annoying to be kicking♥♥♥♥♥like a mofo only to have the game kill you up because you didn't wait for the scripted event to begin, or worse when you're laid low by a plot-mandated injury that you'd normally be shrugging off due to regenerating health.  Understand the single player game is locked on rails like a roller coaster crossed with a shooting gallery and your expectations will be properly set.  My serious complaint is the game dresses itself up to *look* like real-world military units, but the missions and orders you receive are ludicrous from a real-world POV.  Fun to play for what it is.  Not worth $60, but ok at $30.			"

												The last great Call of Duty ! Rest are just big cash grabs flops !Great campaign, great Spec ops, and an amazing and adicting multiplayer! I still play it after 3000 hours from time to time and im still hooked about it !You will find some  hackers @ online lobbies, trickshot lobbies but its ok they are rare than they used to be last year ! Anyway if you get this game feel free to add me ! I host big private lobbies and we play like how COD used to be played back in the old times ! An instant classic ! 11/10 !			"

												You won't find a better single player Call of Duty game around, except maybe Black Ops 2.Should you buy this? Maybe. See the section on the Multiplayer for the big warning about this game.This is a great single player game, because it's such a well-rounded experience in general. The gameplay feels sharp and responsive, and incorporates and improves on Call of Duty 4's mechanics. The levels in the story, and the spec-ops bonus missions, are well planned, well-designed, and varied, taking the player all over the globe from South America to the White House, all over Russia and to the Middle East. The plot is far beyond what you would expect from a mil-shooter today, willing to subvert the jingoistic American Police State that these games often build up. It's not Shakespeare, and at times falls to pleasent stupidity, but again, it generally rises above the rest.The multiplayer.If you want to buy this game for the multiplayer, DO NOT. This game is quite old now, and several new generations of COD have come and gone. The game also features console-style P2P gaming, so the lack of players has hit the possible pings hard. Half the game modes will be empty, and the other half will be playing against people across the globe. There are mods out there to reinvigorate the multiplayer with servers instead of P2P (rightfully so, as it is insanely adictive otherwise). Look into these options before you buy this game, because to get anything out of MP, you'll need to download one of them.			"

												The story is astonishing! I've never seen such a great campaign in years. I'm not going to bore you to death. So here goes.Pro's- Great story line- Graphics are great even on sluggish computers - Story line is over six hours!- Variety of multiplayer modes for all- Different variety of weapons, perks, attachments and unlocks.Con's- Hackers (But can be countered if you know how to use Windows firewall correctly)- Has unbalanced multiplayer (Guns, attachments , perks etc...)Is it worth the buy? Yes if you know how to stop joining cheaters, you just need to know a little about networking.10 / 10 for story! I love the characters.			"

The Russians decided to focus only on the dead American at the airport, not the other 2 dead Russian terrorists, or the fact that one of the terrorists used a Russian gun. Soap decided to bring thermal scopes just incase the Russians decided to pop smoke.... on a oil rig.U.S Navy seals can often be found with U.K flag on it.

												A great Call of Duty game with lots of replay value in it, thanks to the Spec Ops and Multiplayer modes, this game is a 3-on-1 package, offering a lot with a decent price. Modern Warfare 2 has stunning visuals, with the music composed by Hans Zimmer making the game's soundtrack so enjoyable, the single player might become one of the options, along with the addicting multiplayer, to buy this game! The already-perfect Create-a-Class, that defined Call of Duty's gameplay since CoD 4 also makes a return in multiplayer, with more guns, perks and killstreaks to choose from.Unfortunately, due to the lack of dedicated servers and the majority of people focusing only on the latest Call of Duty titles, you will have a hard time connecting to online matches instantly. For that, Four-Delta-One offers a Dedicated Server mod for those, who want a fluid, seemless online experience with no delays in joining what-so-ever. Keep in mind, though, that Valve's VAC Protection will not work in this matter, so you should download this mod at your own risk (don't worry, there's no viruses in this mod). Still, as long as you have friends playing this game, the fun never stops on your end!			"

												10/10 this game is one of the best call of duty's ever made, and ill tell something about those hackers.These hackers only pretty much just create a lobby and they then can kick you from the lobby, there are not that much lobby's on pc with wallhackers, or aimbot/eb users. Those reviews that say that there are so much hackers on this game, are not true at all, and even those poeple that can host lobby's, the most of them just want to get last and trickshot xD.ill make a list of how much hackers there are on pc.-Lobby creators: 65% of the poeple.-Aimbot/eb users: 5% of the poeple.-Wallhack users: 5% of the poeple.-Godmode users: 5% of the poeple.-Xp lobby creators: 5% of the poeple.So, result: not too many cheaters of all the hackers, and the poeple that just make lobby's and kick you, they just want to trickshot, so just go into a other gamemode like SnD or TDM, cause in those gamemode's there are almost 0 poeple hacking or even making a lobby. Don't doubt buying the game cause of all the poeple that say there are so many hackers, cause thats actually more on like the PS3 or the Xbox 360. There only is one thing thats better on the consoles then on the pc. It is those tryhards noobtubers or campers, its FULL of it. I personally like it more to play with friends on a private match and like play Tricky Myers. But if you dont like that, just try to beat all the tryhards, it will work, trust me ;).			"

												Well, I think most people should know this game by now since its not the ""newest one"" lol. But if you are reading through all reviews to see if this game is still enjoyable in 2016 all I can say is YES. The Story mode is intense and plays much like a movie with some cool cinematics and fun gameplay.  If you decide to jump into multiplayer warning from my side, there might be alot of servers with hackers, but I also had playsessions over 9hours without a single hacker met, soo yeah it kinda depends :P Overall i recommend mw2, the graphics still hold up pretty well (same old engine ofc) and the multiplayer is also fun , especially if you play with some friends (5 at best).

												This is hands down the best Call of Duty I've ever played. I have played pretty much every Call of Duty that's ever existed, from the first one to Black Ops 3, and none of them have ever even come near the enjoyment I've had with this game. My dad was actually the one who got this game in the first place. He played it for the campaign (which was short but very epic and fun), but never really ever touched multiplayer as he knew he wouldn't be very good at it (he also didn't like tubers, campers, and knifers). I played the campaign and multiplayer a lot after he got mostly done with it until our family computer crashed and broke down while I was playing it. I didn't touch the game for a few years until about a month ago; and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥did I reveal a holy grail. I'm now completely addicted to this game. I don't know what it is that makes this game so damn fun, but whatever it is, the developers sure did it right. This game exceeds above and beyond what other shooters can't do, and I would DEFINITELY recommend this game to anyone who wants a old game that's still insanely fun. Also, since this game is relatively old, there has been trouble finding games. As far as I've seen, people either play TDM, FFA, or Domination.			"

												10/10 this game is one of the best call of duty's ever made, and ill tell something about those hackers.These hackers only pretty much just create a lobby and they then can kick you from the lobby, there are not that much lobby's on pc with wallhackers, or aimbot/eb users. Those reviews that say that there are so much hackers on this game, are not true at all, and even those poeple that can host lobby's, the most of them just want to get last and trickshot xD.ill make a list of how much hackers there are on pc.-Lobby creators: 65% of the poeple.-Aimbot/eb users: 5% of the poeple.-Wallhack users: 5% of the poeple.-Godmode users: 5% of the poeple.-Xp lobby creators: 5% of the poeple.So, result: not too many cheaters of all the hackers, and the poeple that just make lobby's and kick you, they just want to trickshot, so just go into a other gamemode like SnD or TDM, cause in those gamemode's there are almost 0 poeple hacking or even making a lobby. Don't doubt buying the game cause of all the poeple that say there are so many hackers, cause thats actually more on like the PS3 or the Xbox 360. There only is one thing thats better on the consoles then on the pc. It is those tryhards noobtubers or campers, its FULL of it. I personally like it more to play with friends on a private match and like play Tricky Myers. But if you dont like that, just try to beat all the tryhards, it will work, trust me ;).			"

												I highly recommend this game to all CoD veterans out there, since this is one of the best CoD's out there.A huge props to IW for implementing many new features such as wide variety of killstreak selections, plenty of new attachments (excluding Grenade Launcher and maybe Thermal Scope which can be really frustrating when a troll or all-season camper uses them), ofcourse new weapons and customizations for multiplayer characters such as Ghillie suits for snipers, can be unlockable via in-game challenges.The singleplayer campaign is just as epic and breathtaking like it's predecessor CoD4 (maybe even more action-packed than before).Spec Ops missions are great addition to a game too - just get a friend and play co-op online or take a challange and do them on your own.Last, but not least. The multiplayer connection - it is smooth as silk. The hit detection in this game is awesome! No shoot first and die bullsh*t like in future installments.Personally this is my 3rd CoD that i enjoy the most, and i'm sure that you will like it the same as i do or even more. Nevertheless, the game is out for some time, but good stuff never gets old, so grab your gear and go dominate some noobs, soldier!			"

												Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (CoD: MW2) is a thrilling sequel to the original modern warfare game from Activision. It expands upon the same elements that made the original so enticing , but takes a step backwards in multiplayer for its lack of dedicated servers. Still, CoD fans should rejoice since the game still provides a Michael Bay-inspired singleplayer campaign that continues the story from the original modern warfare. It should be noted that there are two DLC packs that add to the multiplayer experience.			"

												Takes place right after call of duty modern warfare. Gameplay and story wise was just great. Spec ops would keep you busy for awhile, roughly around 2-4 hours depending how good you are at the game. Multiplayer is def a no go. Since hackers have took over the game, every match you will get into, you will be fighting a hacker. Does that mean i shouldnt buy it? No it does, if you just want it to play the single player and follow the story that and spec ops will keep you busy.			"

This game practically revolutionized the Call of Duty experience with the new killstreak system and graphics, and paved a road for the future installments. This was a balanced game, and even when I was losing a match I was having fun. This is a game that can basically keep you playing for a whole weekend. I would definitely reccomend this game.			"

												This game was the only COD that interested me in playing it.Singleplayer: One of the only COD games with lots of Winter-Pack actions and with Survival-Type save the base missions with Sgt. Foley! Multiplayer: It was a good multiplayer but the only problem was 1. NO Console 2. Private Matches have no custom classes. 3. No Default Classes. 4. Noobtubers. [But overall it's not that bad if you are a Pro Player after all.			"

В Call of Duty 4-Modern Warefare, было всего 2 запоминающихся момента: это ядерный взрыв на Ближнем востоке и миссия в Припяти. В Call of Duty-Modern Warefare 2 таких моментов больше: пригород США, битва в Вашингтоне, тюрьма для полит-заключённых, база Российских подлодок, наконец бедные районы Рио-Де-Жанейро.			"

""History is written by the victor."" -ShepardModern Warfare 2 is my personal pick for the best game in the Call of Duty franchise, and arguebly one of my picks for the best FPS game of all time. I have so much history with this game. I've put so many hours into the multiplayer back on console, and just beat the campaign for the 4th time. This was also my second Call of Duty game; My first being kind of an obsure one: Call of Duty 3 on the Wii. I still remember playing this game for the first time like it was yesterday, and it just blew me away. It was once I played the game after growing up a bit where I realized how great this game really is.Positives- The graphics have aged like fine wine. I always like to use this game as a game that has aged really well. The graphics on max settings still look great. It looks nothing like a game released in 2009.- The campaign is fantastic. I would know because I've played it 4 times. It has some of the most memorable missions in CoD. My personal favorite mission is a close tie between Enemy of my Enemy and Second Sun.- The campaign can be challenging on a higher difficulty, actually requiring you to use cover. Yes, using cover in a Call of Duty. I know it sounds bizarre. It's also rewarding to play on a high diffculty because you get achievements for every mission you beat. I beat the game on Hardened, and will possibly play through it again sooner or later to get the Veteran achievements.- Spec Ops gives you some neat little missions to play after beating the campaign. You can even play through them with a buddy!- Voice acting is pretty good.- The characters are great, and memorable.- The game is so well written. It is a very quotable game.Negatives- Multiplayer is a mixed bag. It's pretty broken. Let's be honest. Noobtubing is way too OP. The PC version is also said to be riddled with hackers that can get you VAC banned by giving you level 70. So Multiplayer is actually dangerous to play on. I have 6 hours into multiplayer and have actually not ran into many hackers, and I haven't been VAC banned. Most of the reviews that claim this are old, so maybe they fixed their anti-cheat or something.- There's no FOV slider to increase the disgusting 65 FOV. You can increase your FOV in SP and MP using third party programs. There's a guide on how to accomplish this here. I personally use 80, because 90 makes your arms look like they're 5 feet long, which looks odd. If you're worried about being VAC banned online for ""cheating,"" I've used the FOV changer in MP and I haven't gotten banned yet.- This game is still priced at $20, with the game+DLC being a ridiculous $45. It's 8 years old. That kind of money for an 8 year old game is laughable.- Singleplayer and Multiplayer are two seperate Steam games, which can look awkward. I don't know why they didn't do what GTA V did[i.imgur.com] with their singleplayer and online mode.SummaryModern Warfare 2 is a great game. I always just loved it. It's a game that I can play any day of the week, and still have fun playing it. The campaign and spec ops is worth a purchase alone.Should you buy it? YES, but only on a sale. $20 is too much for a game this old. "

												Before I start I must explain that the reason I do not recommend this game is not because it is bad in any way, it is because its multiplayer is full of hackers/mods/spam and broken equipment (it also has no developer support). The game is however very good, the single player has a gripping storyline that is full of action and great cinematic cut scenes. It includes a variety of wepons and settings so that each level is interesting, one level could take place in a desert and the next in a forest. There are intense moments and plot twists that really do get your emotions going, it's possibly one of my favourite story modes of all time. However it's slightly short and on veteran difficulty certain levels can be near impossible without touches of luck.Single player also comes with 'spec ops' (which can be played co-operatively), spec ops adds another layer of difficulty to the story mode and alters story mode levels to suit a different challenge. It's divided up into a variety of categories including races so the diversity is enough to keep you playing when one type of mission is frustrating you. The frustration is worth it however as when difficult spec ops are completed you feel extremely satisfied. Overall I would say it is a great game however its lack of developer support and its toxic hacking environment (online) mean it cannot be worth its price tag.			"

												If you liked Call of Duty MW, then you will be disappointed. They completely ruined the awesome server system they had in the first MW and replaced it with this IWNet bs that doesn't let you choose the server you wanna join. Because of that it has become a paradise for cheaters, hackers and all sorts of rubbish. Combine that with the gameplay that has been more optimized for campers and snipers than ever before. Some of the perks and killstreaks you can acheive with camping are so overpowered that it ruins the whole experience. The single-players is just as good as the other COD games, but I bought it mostly for the multiplayer, so I would say it was a complete waste of money.			"

												This game was the game that got me into competitive FPS games, and gaming in general. It had most fun and the best multiplayer experience I have ever had (and with sadness in my heart, will probably never have). I had 1100+ hours on multiplayer and 70+ hours on singleplayer/spec ops missions (on my lost steam account). It was the best investment in my gaming career ever. Had so much fun with this game. And I feel sad that time run over this gem (with addition of quickscopers and hackers). With a tear in my eye I grade this masterpiece 100/100. The best multiplayer game I have ever played.

												Singleplayer: Short as f*ck but not that bad.Co-op: Yeah that was really fun to play with friends when game was released (2009).Multiplayer: Hmm.....How to start....Awesome and Legendary FPS with many modes (you can max 4 or 5 of them beacause other nobody plays) full of 5k no brainers, Russians who tubing you all the time, spamming claymore, using RPG or shield. Host should be guy with potentional best connection for the game, unfortunately many times you feel like he's from Transylvania. Very common is also modded lobbies (may happen that modder will take your levels, attachments and weapons you already got before), texture hackers (undetectable), aimboters, wallhackers, norecoil hackers, rapid fire scripts or god mod. I personally prefer very popular mod Search and Destroy, where you average find around 6 games (5 of them are ususally trickshot virgin kids which literally dont let you play because of constant stunning, tubing or instant kick and let alive only the biggest idiot of your team as victim to do trickshot on him). Useful thing is tool called MW2sa by dint of you can kick hackers or tubers. The author of this tool asks in readme to try behave like adults and warning other people before kick them for some reason, unfortunately, his wish is not always heard, so often happens that 12yo kid kick you because you just winning with him or he maybe dont like something you said before. Some months ago Steam decided enable players which got VAC ban in this game (everyone should get a second chance or not ?) continue to play so many people can play again. So what are you still waiting for ?! Just pay 20 EURO and buy this 7 years old game !!! 11/10 "

												Bought this game when it came out, because i liked the first MW and it was a fine choice. Though the campaign was a bit short, it was a fun trip, especially on harder difficulties, but the spec ops missions and the multiplayer made up for it. Some criticize the frequent use of killstreaks in multi, but boy, it feels awesome when you manage to get a chopper, the AC-130 or the nuke. Nowadays the servers are probably vacant, but this game still worth its price, if bought on a sale.			"

												Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 is one of the most popular games in the Call Of Duty franchise. I am one the biggest fan of this and other Call Of Duty games. But every game has it's flwas including Call of Duty such as: When the missiles blew up the sattelite, it came crashing down right at the exact spot where Ramirez was and so they were lucky. Also, how did Price even get in prison. But those are the little questions that no on really pays attention to. The thing that caught my attentio was how the enemy who remains the enemy ""Makarov"" helps out Price even though they want to strangle eachother. Also it was unique on how the main hero kills the main villain, with a throwing knife, now you dont see that in any other game. Also you had no suspicion that Shephard would betray you until he does.			"

												Yes, I have Modern Warfare 2 and would love to play it!!!!!!   It stopped working!  Everytime I try to play it, it tells me steam must be running!!  Well it is running!!!  I have called activision several times and steam has no VERBAL contact!!!  Only emails with remedies that you need to be a computer genius to make it work!!!!!!!  My other call of duty games work.  Modern Warfare is in my library just like the others but won't let me play!!!  Makes no sense!!!!!!  Activision tells me it is a steam problem and steam is no help!!!!  Why doesn't steam allow verbal communication!!!  Iam at the point I want to uninstall it and purchase another but I am afraid it will not work either!!!!!  Any Fixes out there!!!!!Would love to recommend it if I could play it!!!!!!			"

												I should preface this with the admittance that I am not a fan of First Person Shooters.  I played the original Medal of Honor and Call of Duty games before the franchises became more focused on special effects, shock value, and multiplayer than they were about storylines; but I had a falling out with the story when $60 games couldn't be expected to offer any more than three hours of enjoyment outside of dealing with the horde of snotty kids online.I did, however, play through Modern Warfare 1 and 2 as they went on sale, and I was thoroughly impressed.  As you can expect just by looking at the store page, the game is visually stunning.  What you don't see, however, is the storylines (plural) that you follow as Army Rangers and Spec Ops fight to ensure America's continued global dominance amidst emerging threats (MW 1) and to ensure America's survival as all hell breaks loose (MW 2).While the single player game is challenging (frustratingly so on some parts), the story line only gives you about 5 - 6 hours of gameplay.  What this game offers is continued single player play through challenges outside of the story arc, giving you an alternative to braving random games with complete strangers - who, let's face it, are probably better than you!All in all, I'd give the game an 8/10.

												MW2 has the best multiplayer I've ever played. The imbalance and OP kill streak made this game so much fun and addictive. Though singleplayer part is kind of too much noise and fast pace. Which made this part not as great as COD4. But it still is one of the greatest single player campagin. Got all the achievements on PS3 and XBOX, now it's PC time.			"

												Installed this the other day and still find it the gold standard for FPS. The graphics engine still looks great after this time.The music is greatGraphics engine still very nice.Story for the campaign mode isn't bad.The array of weapons is nice.The only thing I'd comment on is the fact that pulliing a knife out of your chest at the end of the game is highly dubious.By all accounts, CODMWF2 is superior than the rest of the garbage that Treyarch and the new Infinity ward team produced. I was sad to hear about Infinity Ward's break up and it is likely that we won't see another succesful gaming franchise post Infinity Ward. "

												Modern Warfare 2 is by far, and without a doubt my favorite game i have ever played. This game is easily one of the best Call of Duties made so far. The game itself, while recieving much criticism about minor issues, is still an amaing, well put together video game, of one of the best series ive played. The only problem with PC Modern Warfare 2 is the growing number of hackers, and the decreasing number of players. Its a lie to say there are still a lot of players on MW2 now days, but it IS wrong to say there are no people at all. It is still fairly easy to find a game, and the actual gameplay is amazing. The campaign is one of my favorites, with lots of action, and you can play it multiple times and still enjoy it. The multiplayer is amazing and is in my opinion, fairly rounded for a Call of Duty. Sure there are some things that arent 100% rounded, like noob tubing, but that doesnt change how good the game is over all. Final rating: 9.5/10			"

												Where do I start? Best Call Of Duty of all time. I don't care what other people say about Black Ops 2, Ghost and Advanced Warfare. Here we fight like men, no fancy suits, no unrealistic guns, no 8 year old ragers. Just pure FPS like it suppose to be.If you don't believe me. Come on, I dare you to try this Amazing game. Even a pc that can't run Pac Man can run MW2.15/10 multiplayer 20/10 CO-OP 12/10 Single playerI recommend this to all the true hardcore FPS guys. It never gets old. Jake out.			"

												This was my first Call of Duty game ever. Sadly I don't play this game as much anymore but I will tell you this game is still worth buying, especially if it's on a sale. May not be a lot compared to the old days, but this game still has a lot of players. There are unfortunetely hackers in this game, and I'm not so sure if VAC works on this game now, but there aren't a lot. Aside from hackers, everything in this game is perfect. The campaign, spec ops, and definetely multiplayer is awesome. If your looking for a fun Call of Duty game to play, this would be great. The price of this game isn't bad, but I suggest getting the game on sale or through a site that sells a key for cheaper than the steam price. 10/10 long live MW2.			"

												Another episode of Agrobal reviews an FPS xDOh, wow. This is the peak of mindless fun. I honestly liked the campaign. For the most part, it was boring but the plot built up with my monotonous expression on my face until I felt I was engaged enough to want to finish it. They managed to make a badass character and I dont think I need to mention that character. Infinity ward know how to do good storytelling but I'm just not that invested in the setting or gameplay. Why am I playing it? Because it was just there on my library and I wanted to give it a review. So I beat the campaign. For any CoD fan, I'm sure you will like this more than me. Grab it.			"

This game is how I made a few of the friends I'm still playing with today, the reason I like search and destroy so much, and in my humble opinion, probably the most worthy successor to Call of Duty 4, surpassing every other iteration of Call of Duty since.

												I've had my fair share of this game on PC and on console. MW2 has many flaws but overall it's a good game, the story is alright, it's just plain but it's good. Now, Modern Warfare 2: Multiplayer, the mp is actually decent, other than the final stand and noob toobing with OMA and the hackers. I personally got VAC banned for randomly joining a game and got my level to 70, which is stupid, but hey, it's whatever. Overall, I'd give this game an 8/10. Purchase this for spec ops and for the mp; if you don't mind the hackers and possibly getting VAC banned.Overall summary;Graphics: Good for it's time.Gameplay: SmoothControls: Easy enoughMultiplayer: Good, but at the same time, it's terrible.

The campaign is still great, probably my favorite in the series before it went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The graphics still hold up and the game looks relatively good. Multiplayer is still pretty nice, not too many hackers from what i'v experienced so far. All in all my favorite call of duty to date and in my opinion it should be remade.9/10			"

												COD MW 2... now this is when COD used to be fun! Even the MP seems more fun, no more 360 in-the-blind-no-scoping-with-knives from the other side of the map. This is when COD was good, this was when COD was king of online MP. Not to mention the story isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

												""Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2"" is a first person shooter that is a sequel to Modern Warfare. The storyline follows 2 different characters (and a few more but for the most part, just 2) It's a great storyline with betrayal and plot twist, and will end fittingly in Modern Warfare 3. Modern Warfare 2 is arguably my favorite game in the Call of Duty series (I lost interest after MW3) and I recommend it. The Online is in fact alive but you have to navigate through a few modded/hacked lobbies (and I believe some may bring a VAC ban). I played MW2 and MW3 quite a bit on my PS3 but as I revisit it, it's just not as fun as it used to be for me. (It's worth a buy while on sale though!)Pros: Great storylineNostalgia for some people :)Fun spec ops missions with quite a bit of replayability (though MW3's survival mode is much better)Many environments to exploreCons: Not many ""legit"" lobbies leftWithout a friend, spec op missions aren't nearly as enjoyable			"

												Ah, a classic FPS. Love it or hate it, you woln't get anywhere with a gaming discussion without bringing this game up.Most of you kiddies under the age of 12 might not have got this game because of mere lack of intrest or your parents are liberal. If the answer is liberal and you want the game, you are probably adopted, kill it before it lays eggs. If you just dont like it, What is wrong with your taste of video games? If its both...well♥♥♥♥♥♥For the singleplayer portion, you mostly play as Srg. Gary ""Roach"" Sanderson. He does have a fiery death on the mission ""Loose ends"" where you are tracking down Makarov.For the multiplayer portion, its darn fun. I mostly use a LMG and a launcher with lock-on for those planes. But I recommend an LMG for the UAVs, though. UAVs are weaker and can be destroyed with one shot with a rocket, but, save the rockets for the♥♥♥♥♥hat copper/plane.Overall, I would rate this installment 8.5 UAVs out of 10, putting this game on my recommended list.

												In all the COD games I've played I think I can see that in terms of story, spec ops, and multiplayer that this one is probably one of my favorites. With a kickass story that picks up after the first along with notable characters, new weapons, and amazing levels, this game in terms of campain lives up if not succeeds its predecessor. Spec Ops is an amazing solo or coop experience (I would recommend two player for extra fun) that brings you back to the campain levels completing different objectives. Lastly the multiplayer is so much fun with plenty of different game modes, maps, weapons, and more that in combination with the limited hacking that seems to have taken over the previous COD multiplayer gives this game a 10/10 would buy again. There is a reason that this game is still $20 after all the years it's been out.			"

												My favorite Call of Duty game in the series. This and Black ops are the only CoD games I currently have on steam. I have played every Cod Game and those two have always been my favorite. You cannot simply beat the modern warfare storyline. The Black ops storyline continues to be one of my favorite aswell, but making a second one in the future messed it all up, and I was utterly confused when they did so. For the most part the CoD games are always a goal of trying to kill a supreme antagonist ( example: Shepard, Makarov, Steiner ). But in these ""earlier"" games it was more than that, they were both traitors, or people killing airports ful of innocent people. Unlike Black Ops 2 when there was  just a dude, oh we better kill him. The spec ops was probably my favorite, along with the nutorious multiplayer. The Soundtrack in this game is the best of any Cod I would say ( ESPECIALLY the Army Rangers round winning music). This game is a perfect example of you buy the game, you get all the content ( not including the bonus multiplayer maps ) This is ALSO a perfect example of a very good game franchise which, eventually there only focus was spitting out sequels to close- ended games to keep a continual money stream.Overall : 9/10 "

												Modern Warfare 2 and its MP is full of the craziest BS as opposed to any other CoD, and yet it's the one that stands out as the definition of CoD. CoD4 revolutionized first person shooters, but (at least, for many fans) MW2 was the cherry on the top. Super fast-paced multiplayer gameplay, a wild, absurd (not to mention controversial) campaign, and one of the greatest video game soundtracks ever orchestrated make this CoD different from the rest. Some say Black Ops 2 takes the cake, other say Call of Duty 2. But MW2 (in my humble opinion) is where CoD reached its peak of originality. Now as for recommending this game, I will say yes. Not because of the hacked multiplayer lobbies and people calling it the ""Ultimate Rage Simulator,"" but because of the nostalgia and good moments of the game. When the going gets good in MW2, nothing gets better than hearing Craig Fairbrass as Ghost saying ""Tactical Nuke ready. Turn the key."" As far as the price goes, it is worth half the price of 20$ on the market (excluding sales). Wait for a 50% sale and buy the game if you're a fan of CoD and will have nothing to do with the new, futuristic rip-offs of Titanfall and whatnot. Several hundred people play everyday, and chances are you'll run into a few nice people along the way (like I did). 1v1 with friends, go for nukes, and experience the sixth Call of Duty as it is - Absurd, unbalanced, yet downright incredible. And you don't like the BS of MW2, then play its predecessor, CoD4. But in the end, Modern Warfare 2 is the most memorable CoD to date. I can't very well describe the feeling of MW2. You just have to play it for yourself. And if you don't like CoD, go play Battlefield. Or Arma. Or Minecraft. Many dislike it, but for those who appreciate MW2, it's one of the greatest games in video game history.			"

Still some parts doesn't make sence but still much better than the last CoD titles.It has fights those look much more realistic than any CoD that came later. Less explosions in your face, more tactics, more immersion insted of ""we put more pew-pew-pew and kaboom so it looks like cool skrimish there player doesn't get harmed"".Most importantly, it has guns that feel and sound more or less like real ones. No carboard shooters.It has stupid matchmaking system in Multiplayer where you can't chose a server you want to play on (only gamemode) and sometimes you get connected to a hacked server with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ custom game mode (zombie survival). You disconnect and try to get to another server with same gamemode but get connected back to the same server. Pefect.Too bad Acitvision closed down Four Delta One project - normal server browser system with server admins and much less hackers.

 Originally posted on July 17, 2010 MW2 contains nothing new. Very similar multiplayer to CoD4 (same formula) and very similar single player to CoD1 (exact same formula). Infinity Ward has proven once again that it has no idea how to innovate. Of course, why should they, with one of the best selling franchises of all time. And if these were all of my concerns, this would still be a pretty damn good game. However they only scratch the surface.Graphics/Audio/Presentation- The graphics engine for the series has not visibly changed in nature since call of duty 2. Despite what infinity ward says, I have seen no visible innovation or improvement in the engine, with the exception of new skins or slightly higher resolution models. This is because of the limiting hardware of current consoles. The game consequentially looks mediocre at best and is not well optimized on the PC. It runs rather poorly. The cinematic effects of course are rather good, with blood splattering your screen when you are hit and good usage of the first person perspective in cutscenes. The audio is for the most part good, with voice acting being quite good, but the gun sounds are rather tinny and canned. They don't really sound like real guns if you've ever fired one before.Story- The story is complete trash. Straight up. CoD 4 had a ridiculous premise, but at least it was somewhat coherent and it made some sense. Mw2 is even more over the top and makes NO SENSE AT ALL. no exaggeration, the plot seems to have been written by someone with a penchant for cinematic effects and a complete lack of storytelling ability. I wasn't even sure who I was (or why it mattered) more than half the time. I had to look up several articles online to even get a sense of what the plot was about, but it still doesn't make any sense at all.Single- The single player gameplay itself is very linear, and really hasn't changed since CoD1. Regenerative health is maybe the only exception. ridiculous amounts of enemies shooting at you, and only you, ineffective allies, chase scenes etc. nothing new here. Exciting, but old and incredibly unrealisticMulti- The multiplayer is clearly the game's greatest strength. They have taken their addictive FPS/RPG multiplayer leveling system from CoD4 and refined it, and for the most part, it works very well. Unfortunately. The PC version of the multi is incredibly deficient. No dedicated servers, no mod support, no server browser. No choice of which map to play, or any choice. You are matched using P2P technology with other players on a random map in the gamemode of your choosing (what a luxury) and are forced to deal with whoever is selected by the system is host. It is an insult to PC gamers everywhere. In addition, the game costs 60 dollars, and the map packs are 15 bucks each for 4-5 maps, which any decent company would include for free in content updates. Multi is also completely infested with hackers, and VAC is unlikely to do anything about it.Coop- spec ops is a nice addition for playing with a buddy and can actually be quite challenging at times.Overall, the game is CoD, through and through, and if you don't mind the thought of the unchanged gameplay, the price tag, the lack of servers, the hackers, and the overpriced map packs, you will have a good time, and get many hours of fun out of this game.

												Probably the best call of duty ever made. I had played it on 360 for such a long time and had to buy it on PC. I was kind of diasspointed that you couldn't use a controller to play it, but after a bit I got use to keyboard and mouse and its so much better. The campaign is still great, probably my favorite in the series before it went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The graphics still hold up and the game looks relatively good. Multiplayer is still pretty nice, not too many hackers from what i'v experienced so far. All in all my favorite call of duty to date and in my opinion it should be remade.9/10			"

												""Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2"" is a first person shooter that is a sequel to Modern Warfare. The storyline follows 2 different characters (and a few more but for the most part, just 2) It's a great storyline with betrayal and plot twist, and will end fittingly in Modern Warfare 3. Modern Warfare 2 is arguably my favorite game in the Call of Duty series (I lost interest after MW3) and I recommend it. The Online is in fact alive but you have to navigate through a few modded/hacked lobbies (and I believe some may bring a VAC ban). I played MW2 and MW3 quite a bit on my PS3 but as I revisit it, it's just not as fun as it used to be for me. (It's worth a buy while on sale though!)Pros: Great storylineNostalgia for some people :)Fun spec ops missions with quite a bit of replayability (though MW3's survival mode is much better)Many environments to exploreCons: Not many ""legit"" lobbies leftWithout a friend, spec op missions aren't nearly as enjoyable			"

												Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 offers an amazing online and single player experience. As far as single player is concerned, the plot of the storyline is really interesting and intense that keeps you attached till the end. It's not all about killing enemies in a battlefield like many other ordinary first person games. The storyline is structured in such way, that brings an abundance of emotions and suspense. In addition, the missions that are involved in the Spec Ops game mode are really enjoyfull and challenging. The huge variety of well built maps and different tasks included in the missions followed by rewards make the particular game mode extremely amusing. When it comes to multiplayer, words are not enough to express the greatness of this game. Personally, I believe that Modern Warfare 2 offers the best online experience in the ""Call of Duty"" franchise. There is not a single Call of Duty game so far that can be compared to MW2 when it comes to online experience. By the huge number of  extraordinary challenges, game modes, titles, emblems, killstreaks, perks, attachments, camos, pretty exquisite maps and guns, this section of the game is extremely addictive and absolutely close to perfection. The only problem is the small amount of cheaters that sometimes ruin the online experience. But not that big of a deal. For me, definetely a ""must play"" for fps gamers. It's a 9.9 out of 10 by me.			"

												I wouldn't be bothered to write a review about this game as I believe that it belongs to the past. However, I noticed that the product has a serious discount (50%) and as an old player of MW2 I would like add few words since I didn't have the chance to do it earlier. Nowadays it's not that easy to find the ammount of players that we used to find back at 2010 but still MW2 has its fans. The campaign and co-op modes worthy enough of the 12,49€ and if you're looking for something to spend some cash on it I think this game is a pretty good solution. All in all, this game is recommended by my side but only with its current price.			"

For the most part, it was boring but the plot built up with my monotonous expression on my face until I felt I was engaged enough to want to finish it. They managed to make a badass character and I dont think I need to mention that character. Infinity ward know how to do good storytelling but I'm just not that invested in the setting or gameplay. Why am I playing it? Because it was just there on my library and I wanted to give it a review. So I beat the campaign. For any CoD fan, I'm sure you will like this more than me. Grab it.			"

As age has shown and newer tittles have been released, this community is quite lacking, expecially for us folks in Australia. Not to mention one of the funnest arcade like sniping systems around still, such a silly and out of place game with many over powered things such as the ""commando perk"" being able to lounge many metres for a knife kill or even the ""noob tube"". Just a great funny game, in which many hours can be lost. :)Never the less, a great game and always has BEEN! a great pickup for most gamers out there and not many pounts I can jump on that haven't already been sprouted too!Final verdict - 10/10 Paano's Stamp of Approval			"

The second thing is the god dam One man army perk like come on why would you even let the enemies get no ending grenade luncher ammo all they want for the rest of the match it's just stupid. When it comes to singleplayer the campaign is just to short and yes it's a good campaign but it's just ambaresing short but you get the bonus map Museum witch is really fun to mess around with.The spec ops missions it's just fun when you have a friend to play with.

												Amazing game, here's a brief rundown of my personal preferences of the 3 types of playstyleCampaign - BEAUTIFUL! If you thought the WaW campaign was good, wait untill you see this one. Sniping into a russian base turns into close combat firefights. You need this game just to experience the campaignSpecial Ops - Pretty decent. If you want maps that you can remember from CoD4 and MW2, play this mode. You can run the S.S.D.D couse untill you can nail it with a 30 second run.Multiplayer - Decent but bad. Why is it bad? Hackers, hackers everywhere. I get lucky enough to not get hacked lobbies as much as i used to. Hitting level 70 legit is pretty difficult. But i managed it and it can be done10/10. BUY THIS GAME			"

												Not having been able to play this game for years (because for some reason they didn't maek MW2 for the Wii, my only other gaming system) and finally getting the chance to open it up and play through the campaign in one day was a blast. The story was very interesting, gave me chills at multiple points, and kept me fully captivated throughout. Ending was great.Only downside: Multiplayer. Good luck finding a legit server that doesn't instantly boost you 40 levels upon getting a single kill, or making other players invincible. Worth the 20 bucks if you've yet to play, but just be sure to play the original modern warfare first. That's partially what makes it.			"

												Just like ""The Terminator"" said, this is the last GOOD Call of Duty game ever made (other than World at War). The Single-Player is great, and the Multiplayer WAS good up until a bunch of hackers, campers, & spammers came along and killed it completely. That's why there's barely anyone that plays it anymore. Especially now that Black Ops 2 and that new COD: Ghosts came along. Don't worry though, there are still some people who play this game, just not much!All in all, this game is worth the money. But mainly for the SP. (in my opinion)Spec Ops: Meh, i'm not really into this game mode that much...			"

												Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 offers an amazing online and single player experience. As far as single player is concerned, the plot of the storyline is really interesting and intense that keeps you attached till the end. It's not all about killing enemies in a battlefield like many other ordinary first person games. The storyline is structured in such way, that brings an abundance of emotions and suspense. In addition, the missions that are involved in the Spec Ops game mode are really enjoyfull and challenging. The huge variety of well built maps and different tasks included in the missions followed by rewards make the particular game mode extremely amusing. When it comes to multiplayer, words are not enough to express the greatness of this game. Personally, I believe that Modern Warfare 2 offers the best online experience in the ""Call of Duty"" franchise. There is not a single Call of Duty game so far that can be compared to MW2 when it comes to online experience. By the huge number of  extraordinary challenges, game modes, titles, emblems, killstreaks, perks, attachments, camos, pretty exquisite maps and guns, this section of the game is extremely addictive and absolutely close to perfection. The only problem is the small amount of cheaters that sometimes ruin the online experience. But not that big of a deal. For me, definetely a ""must play"" for fps gamers. It's a 9.9 out of 10 by me.			"

												Modern Warfare 2 is by far, and without a doubt my favorite game i have ever played. This game is easily one of the best Call of Duties made so far. The game itself, while recieving much criticism about minor issues, is still an amaing, well put together video game, of one of the best series ive played. The only problem with PC Modern Warfare 2 is the growing number of hackers, and the decreasing number of players. Its a lie to say there are still a lot of players on MW2 now days, but it IS wrong to say there are no people at all. It is still fairly easy to find a game, and the actual gameplay is amazing. The campaign is one of my favorites, with lots of action, and you can play it multiple times and still enjoy it. The multiplayer is amazing and is in my opinion, fairly rounded for a Call of Duty. Sure there are some things that arent 100% rounded, like noob tubing, but that doesnt change how good the game is over all. Final rating: 9.5/10			"

												Installed this the other day and still find it the gold standard for FPS. The graphics engine still looks great after this time.The music is greatGraphics engine still very nice.Story for the campaign mode isn't bad.The array of weapons is nice.The only thing I'd comment on is the fact that pulliing a knife out of your chest at the end of the game is highly dubious.By all accounts, CODMWF2 is superior than the rest of the garbage that Treyarch and the new Infinity ward team produced. I was sad to hear about Infinity Ward's break up and it is likely that we won't see another succesful gaming franchise post Infinity Ward. "

												MW2 has the best multiplayer I've ever played. The imbalance and OP kill streak made this game so much fun and addictive. Though singleplayer part is kind of too much noise and fast pace. Which made this part not as great as COD4. But it still is one of the greatest single player campagin. Got all the achievements on PS3 and XBOX, now it's PC time.			"

												There is something about this game that makes me wonder why everyone else holds it at such a legendary status. Sure, it is a good first person shooter, but it is not amazing. It does nothing to really seperate itself from the rest of the modern military shooters out there. The environments aren't great either, with a vast majority from the campaign feeling quite bland and brow-ish. It is, however, still a good first person shooter with fast paced action.

												Are u considering buying this game ?Are u wondering if its worth the money ?I've played Multiplayer for 2764 hours as of now, and i consider it one of the best Call of Duty games out there even if its from 2009, is it worth buying it ? Yes, if you can stand the low ammount of Modders & people using Kick tools in Search and Destroy and Free For all, its not a big ammount of them, but they do exist.Havent played story mode that much, i have completed it 2 or 3 times and i did enjoy it, but the big thing about this game is the multiplayer. you wont get bored of the multiplayer , ever. :)if you're wondering if its enough players to find games? oh yes there is a lot of people still playing this game, but some gamemodes is not played as much as others. Most active game modes is probably Team Deathmatch, Free For All, Domination, Demolition & Search And Destory.+16 Maps with Good Variation. (not alot of people playing the DLC maps)+Well Balanced Perks.+Decently Balanced Weapons.+Community is decent. it was better when the game just releasedA 6-7 year old game still doing good.im raiting this game 10/10 clearly i have enjoyed all my 2764 hours i've played! :)Is MW2 the best CoD game so far ? Yes by far. Best FPS game so far? No, but one of the best. Is it worth buying ? Hell yes! No question about it! Buy Buy Buy Buy now ! :)			"

												This is one of my favorite games.  I poured so much of my time as a teen playing this game, and I'll always have fond memories of it.  Although, can I recommend it now?  I'm not sure.  The problems I have with this game could honestly keep some of you from wanting to purchase it, and it also doesn't help that Activision KNOWS this game is not worth $20 anymore, it's worth maybe 5 or less on a sale.  PROS:-Fun singleplayer (not the best, but fun)-Spec Ops is great as well, super fun co-op missions with a lot of variety-Multiplayer, at it's core, is fantastic.  CONS: -Again, the cost of the game.  I've purchased this game twice in my life, and I'm not too sure why besides nostalgic reasons.-Grenades.  This killed the game back then, and it mutilates it now.  I can't go into a lobby without multiple people abusing the ""One Man Army Danger Close"" class.  It's honestly one of the most broken aspects of a video game I've ever experienced, and this game is almost six years old, so no way is it going to get fixed.-Toxic community.  Of course this is COD and there are a lot of young, immature people.  Back in the days of console, I'd just mute everyone.  Now, I can't get rid of the sidebar chat.  Sure, it's not nearly as bad as annoying voice chat, but it's pretty bad either way.-Lack of players.  Few people play this game anymore, and as a result, most of the game modes besides TDM & Free For All are dead.  I'd love to play Hardcore SnD, but that's not possible anymore.Honestly, the purchase is up to you.  Just know that this game will never get any better than where it is at now.			"

												Not a bad arcade shooter. Deviates very slightly in the single-player mode from the usual COD approach to gameplay (straight-jacketed, die-often-unless-you-work-out-exactly-the-strict-order-of-move-shoot-run-precisely-as-the-linear-design-dictates), but not enough to really set it aside from equally entertaining tasks like pulling teeth or sawing your own limbs off.At least it has a story you can enjoy... but I expect that the contraversial let's-kill-lots-of-innocent-bystanders level sold more copies than the storyline, and that's why it's there (no such thing as bad publicity - maybe they'll have a 'throw puppies off a cliff' level in a future sequel.Multiplayer is okay. Longevity is encouraged by having a 'reset' button (""prestige"") once you've ranked up. Ranked up fully and nothing else to do? Why not start again from scratch? Guys, this is not how you extend shelf-life - we could just delete our save games for the same effect.Massively out-gunned by superior games.			"

												Not having been able to play this game for years (because for some reason they didn't maek MW2 for the Wii, my only other gaming system) and finally getting the chance to open it up and play through the campaign in one day was a blast. The story was very interesting, gave me chills at multiple points, and kept me fully captivated throughout. Ending was great.Only downside: Multiplayer. Good luck finding a legit server that doesn't instantly boost you 40 levels upon getting a single kill, or making other players invincible. Worth the 20 bucks if you've yet to play, but just be sure to play the original modern warfare first. That's partially what makes it.			"

												The Campaign is great! Good story and great characters that you will remember. Now, the multiplayer is what this game is most famous for. The multiplayer used to be great, but sadly there are very few active players nowadays, and a lot of those who are active, are eighter hackers or unfair players (campers, noobtubers etc.). The only playable gamemodes these days are team deathmatch and free for all, as far as I know. With all that being said, It's a GREAT game, but it's not what It used to be :/			"

												Modern Warfare 2 is by far, and without a doubt my favorite game i have ever played. This game is easily one of the best Call of Duties made so far. The game itself, while recieving much criticism about minor issues, is still an amaing, well put together video game, of one of the best series ive played. The only problem with PC Modern Warfare 2 is the growing number of hackers, and the decreasing number of players. Its a lie to say there are still a lot of players on MW2 now days, but it IS wrong to say there are no people at all. It is still fairly easy to find a game, and the actual gameplay is amazing. The campaign is one of my favorites, with lots of action, and you can play it multiple times and still enjoy it. The multiplayer is amazing and is in my opinion, fairly rounded for a Call of Duty. Sure there are some things that arent 100% rounded, like noob tubing, but that doesnt change how good the game is over all. Final rating: 9.5/10			"

												This review is mostly based on the single player mode only.PROS- Awesome graphics for the year of 2009 (They still look impressive compared to some triple A games released in 2015.)- Fluid and easy to learn keyboard controls.- The gunplay in this game is one of the best and refreshing in the Call of Duty Franchise.- The story is one of the best in recent years (There are actually great surprises and plot twists in this game.)- Most of the characters are pretty memorable and unforgettable. (Especially Soap, General Shepherd, and Captain Price)- There are multiple characters that you play as. (Each one shows the different perspectives on the war between the U.S and Russia)- The story actually continues on well from its previous game (Modern Warfare, COD 4).- Every mission/level in this game seemed very creative with its gameplay other than standard COD shooting for the entire campaign. (Ex: You get to escape from a collapsing prison in one section, you drive and shoot in a  motor raft in another section, and you actually play alongside the main villain in an entire mission.- YOU GET TO DRIVE SNOWMOBILES - The Spec Ops are pretty fun and can be addictive for people who like time trials and challenges.CONS- There is no controller support to this game-The online multiplayer is completely broken with cheaters so DON'T buy the game if you expect decent online PVP.- This game is a little too expensive just so you can just play single player. ($20 for a COD game in 2009, but surprisingly its one of the cheapest ones on steam right now.)- There are some characters that are really disinteresting and boring (Your squad while defending the U.S from Russians is forgettable. I can't remember a single name from the Rangers missions except General Shepherd.).- The campaign is kind of short (But it's a great story and campaign so it has lots of replay value.).Final Thoughts- This is one of the best COD games to date with its continued on amazing story from COD 4 that leaves you actually remembering characters and plot elements that you don't see often in recent COD games. If you are dying to also play normal online multiplayer without tons of cheaters, buy a pre-owned Xbox 360 or PS3 copy of this game. Otherwise, this is a fantastic game that every COD fan should own.9/10 PC VERSION A Must Buy When On Sale			"

												Probably the best call of duty ever made. I had played it on 360 for such a long time and had to buy it on PC. I was kind of diasspointed that you couldn't use a controller to play it, but after a bit I got use to keyboard and mouse and its so much better. The campaign is still great, probably my favorite in the series before it went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ The graphics still hold up and the game looks relatively good. Multiplayer is still pretty nice, not too many hackers from what i'v experienced so far. All in all my favorite call of duty to date and in my opinion it should be remade.9/10			"

(Play CoD4 then play this) -Very good graphics. -Nice weapon costumization. -Very nice multiplayer modes. (I recommand Domination) -Good title/emblem system. (First CoD game with this kind of system)-Bad facts: -Some of the maps are just... sh*t. -No team balance. Note: A lot of you are saying there are too many hackers. Nope. I saw just 1 hacker and he got VAC banned.          Worth it!			"

												My game time shown is probably for the single player (20 minutes). But it doesn't show my 23 hours invested in the multiplayer, and that's just here on Steam. I have about 1 month and a week of total play time on this game on PSN. This game is how I made a few of the friends I'm still playing with today, the reason I like search and destroy so much, and in my humble opinion, probably the most worthy successor to Call of Duty 4, surpassing every other iteration of Call of Duty since.

												I first bought a PS3 for Cod4: MW and must have played that game for hundreds of hours, prestiging all the way to max, having so much fun with my friends.So it was only fitting that the hype was huge around that time for MW2. And the game blew my mind, lived up to the hype plus some. It was the last COD I would play on my PS3, and all my friends now older, moved on. Thus, I bought it here on Steam to relive that magic again.The first two Modern Warfare's are me favorite in terms of single and multiplayer. The campaign for these games are incredible and it's heart racing action that keeps the pace. Even MW3 had a great campaign, had to mention that.But the multiplayer for MW2 is by far my favorite out of them all, IMO it struck the perfect balance of (Cod4 and World At War) in terms of stratigic play and all out barnburners (pun intened).Battles online can feel tense, very quiet, and scary. Other times it's an all out war. This is IMO how COD should have always remained as the atmosphere takes the game to another level. This is helped also by the community as the playerbase is very active and not cutthroat about anything.The campaign is worth a playthrough for any FPS fan, and the game has lots of achievements to unlock, which im a huge fan of.The game took what MW brought to the table, and perfected it IMO. It was also better optimized, so for people with toasters, It even runs smoother than the first.I can't recommend this game enough, it does everything right. Single/Multi/Coop.9/10. Must play.			"

												I have played this game for a long time and i think it's time to review it.PROS:-Best Call of Duty game of all time.-Graphics are great even on sluggish computers.-Fun to play with friends.-Variety of multiplayer modes.-Storyline goes over 6 hours (Unless your a freak and can do it under 2 hours)-Great storyline yet so sad (R.I.P Ghost and Roach)CONS:-WAY too many hackers (mw2 uses VAC, But you can still play it even though you have a ban).-Noobtubers.-Boosters.4/5 I highly recommend buying this game, also i will mention this. The mission called No Russian where you go to a airport and shoot some unarmed civilians, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SHOCKING and you were also given the option to skip the mission so don't cry about it.

												I used to play this back in 2009-2011 on XBOX360, I will never forget those wonderfull times, especially when our friends came over and we would play in local.Coming back to this game after years is amazing, I have played 4/5 matches, for now no hackers seen, but it'll come, thats the biggest part I am afraid of.Anyway, the multiplayer is still being widely played and I'm loving it!Oh yeah and the singleplayer? It's CoD Modern Warfare! 10/10! "

												I miss the modern warfare series. This is an excellent game, and I personally felt a little bit longer than MW3, (maybe I played it slowly or whatever). Every FPS and COD fans will love this, undoubtedly. Sadly, I like modern warfare which is more realistic than advanced warfare and its the last. Highly Recommended.PS: Mac users: works perfectly fine. Mine is 13'  MBP Mid 2014.			"

												This is one of my favorite games.  I poured so much of my time as a teen playing this game, and I'll always have fond memories of it.  Although, can I recommend it now?  I'm not sure.  The problems I have with this game could honestly keep some of you from wanting to purchase it, and it also doesn't help that Activision KNOWS this game is not worth $20 anymore, it's worth maybe 5 or less on a sale.  PROS:-Fun singleplayer (not the best, but fun)-Spec Ops is great as well, super fun co-op missions with a lot of variety-Multiplayer, at it's core, is fantastic.  CONS: -Again, the cost of the game.  I've purchased this game twice in my life, and I'm not too sure why besides nostalgic reasons.-Grenades.  This killed the game back then, and it mutilates it now.  I can't go into a lobby without multiple people abusing the ""One Man Army Danger Close"" class.  It's honestly one of the most broken aspects of a video game I've ever experienced, and this game is almost six years old, so no way is it going to get fixed.-Toxic community.  Of course this is COD and there are a lot of young, immature people.  Back in the days of console, I'd just mute everyone.  Now, I can't get rid of the sidebar chat.  Sure, it's not nearly as bad as annoying voice chat, but it's pretty bad either way.-Lack of players.  Few people play this game anymore, and as a result, most of the game modes besides TDM & Free For All are dead.  I'd love to play Hardcore SnD, but that's not possible anymore.Honestly, the purchase is up to you.  Just know that this game will never get any better than where it is at now.			"

												From some wiki:""The year is 2016, and despite the efforts of the United States Marine Corps and the British Special Air Service, the Ultranationalists seize control of Russia and declare Imran Zakhaev a hero and martyr, erecting a statue of him in the heart of the Red Square. Meanwhile, Vladimir Makarov, one of Zakhaev's former lieutenants, begins a campaign against Europe by committing brutal acts of terrorism over the course of five years.""Some of the best missions you could hope for in single player FPS. Having not played it for 5 or so years, I was pleasantly surprised at how well it still looks with maxed out graphics.  Its 2016. Its still brutal on the harder levels and pretty forgiving at the Normal.  Your team mates still can't shoot straight.  You will be doing the majority of killing, which means hundreds if not thousands of dead terrorists, Russians, oh yeah, and lets not forget the civilians and the responding police force.  Excellent game for $20 I paid.			"

												This was my first Call of Duty game ever. Sadly I don't play this game as much anymore but I will tell you this game is still worth buying, especially if it's on a sale. May not be a lot compared to the old days, but this game still has a lot of players. There are unfortunetely hackers in this game, and I'm not so sure if VAC works on this game now, but there aren't a lot. Aside from hackers, everything in this game is perfect. The campaign, spec ops, and definetely multiplayer is awesome. If your looking for a fun Call of Duty game to play, this would be great. The price of this game isn't bad, but I suggest getting the game on sale or through a site that sells a key for cheaper than the steam price. 10/10 long live MW2.			"

This game is how I made a few of the friends I'm still playing with today, the reason I like search and destroy so much, and in my humble opinion, probably the most worthy successor to Call of Duty 4, surpassing every other iteration of Call of Duty since.

												The Campaign is great! Good story and great characters that you will remember. Now, the multiplayer is what this game is most famous for. The multiplayer used to be great, but sadly there are very few active players nowadays, and a lot of those who are active, are eighter hackers or unfair players (campers, noobtubers etc.). The only playable gamemodes these days are team deathmatch and free for all, as far as I know. With all that being said, It's a GREAT game, but it's not what It used to be :/			"

Replaying it many years after release, single-player felt fresh and really enjoyable to run through once again. Highly recommended entry in a great FPS franchise.			"

Higher quality of missions, More dramatic story, Even more optimized gameplay, It was a fantastic battle. +) Optimized gameplay including aiming, choice of weapons, ammos, mapping, etc. +) Amazing Background music. +) Very dramatic story. +) Higher quality of missions. +) Mission select menu afterwards. -) Some enemies don't die right away while climing up and down a ladder, jumping over an obstacle, or while commencing programmed behavior. -) You can get stuck in the corner by friendly npc.

												Not a bad arcade shooter. Deviates very slightly in the single-player mode from the usual COD approach to gameplay (straight-jacketed, die-often-unless-you-work-out-exactly-the-strict-order-of-move-shoot-run-precisely-as-the-linear-design-dictates), but not enough to really set it aside from equally entertaining tasks like pulling teeth or sawing your own limbs off.At least it has a story you can enjoy... but I expect that the contraversial let's-kill-lots-of-innocent-bystanders level sold more copies than the storyline, and that's why it's there (no such thing as bad publicity - maybe they'll have a 'throw puppies off a cliff' level in a future sequel.Multiplayer is okay. Longevity is encouraged by having a 'reset' button (""prestige"") once you've ranked up. Ranked up fully and nothing else to do? Why not start again from scratch? Guys, this is not how you extend shelf-life - we could just delete our save games for the same effect.Massively out-gunned by superior games.			"

Anyways it's still my favourite game despite all those cheaters, hackers, campers, tubers and other ""random"" pros here. Some maps are really great and I'm sure they are still in top 10 among all maps in CoD franchise! Highrise and Terminal - you know that :) I wish it's ~2010 year now :( good old school times... you're missed... CoD won't be the same anymore...			"

												I have played this game for a long time and i think it's time to review it.PROS:-Best Call of Duty game of all time.-Graphics are great even on sluggish computers.-Fun to play with friends.-Variety of multiplayer modes.-Storyline goes over 6 hours (Unless your a freak and can do it under 2 hours)-Great storyline yet so sad (R.I.P Ghost and Roach)CONS:-WAY too many hackers (mw2 uses VAC, But you can still play it even though you have a ban).-Noobtubers.-Boosters.4/5 I highly recommend buying this game, also i will mention this. The mission called No Russian where you go to a airport and shoot some unarmed civilians, IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SHOCKING and you were also given the option to skip the mission so don't cry about it.

												내가 처음으로 산 정품스팀게임이다. 사실 그 전에 레고레이서2라는 게임이 있긴했지만그 게임은 콘푸로스트를 먹으면 주는거였기에 무시하자.어찌 됬건 명작이다. 이 게임을 하고 암벽등반 잘하는거 아닐까 하는 환상을 품어 영화 에베레스트를 봤더니 크레바스가 무서워서 등산가는 포기했다.피시방에서 250원 주고 30분동안 이 게임하던 기억이  난다. 피시방 사장이 삼촌 친구였는데 날 존나 싫어하듯 처다봤지만모던2가 재밌어서 한 동안 250원만 들고 피시방갔다가 피시방이 망해서 없어지곤 돈주고샀다. 그 피시방의 경영악화에 내가 한 몫하지 않았을까 싶다.

												Probably the best COD game ever made, you know before they got super reharshed and attracted legions of haters .The gaphics are good, the story also and multiplayer is simply amazing. There is not much wrong you can find with the game itself. It's truly a great game.That said, multiplayer is full of hackers and those bloody servers that instantly promote you to level 70 which is then a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to fix. So that kinda ruins it all for us honest players.Overall i'd still say the game is worth it especially if you have a few freinds to play with.			"

												Its a great game with an amazing campaign, amazing music froom Hans Zimmer, and spec ops. I like the multiplayer other than the fact that the hit detection is trash and how there are alot of other flaws with multiplayer.8/10p.s. the multiplayer is so rage inducing that i dont under stand why people like the multiplayer.

												Campaign and Spec Ops is fun, but Veteran is annoyingly difficult and frustrating, and Hardened is too easy. There is no in between; it's ball bustingly hard or a walk in the park.Multiplayer is the part most people come to in COD games, and for good reason. It's just as fun as I remember it to be back when I played it 7 years ago on consoles, but a few things bring down the experience. For one, there is no cheat detection program in the backround so hackers are free to use aimbot, wallhacks, and/or kick you. This goes hand in hand with the fact that there is a smaller playerbase*[steamcharts.com] than other online games on steam, which is frankly mostly populated by multi-prestige veterans and the aforementioned hackers.*As of now, steamcharts seems to be bugged and showing that there are currently 0 active players in multiplayer. This is false; the numbers are usually around 500 - 1000 at it's lowest point and 2500+ at it's highest.Also, it's satisfying to level up and get new gear (as it is in other games that do it, like battlefield) but it just feels like you're getting destroyed early game just because the higher level guys have access to more powerful or borderline overpowered weapons, and levelled up perks. I feel the worst offender is the glock. Tons of fun to use yourself but damn it melts everyone FAST. I'd go as far as to say it's better than some assault rifles. And, of course, the ol' intervention. It's pretty much an awp with the stopping power perk, but at least you lose the ability to 1 hit kill when hitting the chest without it.Speaking of multiplayer, here's a warning: Do not purchase the multiplayer map packs. After buying them, it restricts you to only being able to queue against players also with the map packs. This wouldn't be as big as a problem if it had a larger fanbase, but right now it practically makes you queue against only maybe 1/8 of the playerbase or less.In conclusion, it's got some pretty big problems, but I still recommend getting it nonetheless. Get it on a 50% off sale here, or if you can't wait for a sale you can get it for $5+ cheaper on G  2  A.			"

												Still lives up to how much fun I had when I played this game many years ago on the PS3.Campaign is just a simple story, (Good Americans and Brits, Russian Invasion, Betrayal and a chase on an International Terroist), nothing really too special but each level has something new to bring in terms of gameplay. The campaign is short, but has a lot of replay value with collecting hidden 'Intel' and clearing the game on the hardest difficulty being 'Veteran'. Spec Ops is like a group of bonus missions that have various unique objectives, for example wave defense against enemies and stealth evasion to an objective. Spec Ops is especially good with a partner. Spec Ops has a total of 23 missions and are ranked based on difficultly in groups; ""Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta and Echo"". The multiplayer aspect I thought would be dead by 2016. But when I picked this game back up... there are still plently of people and small communities looking to grow with hosting servers. The Notably 'MW2 DediGamer' which are a set of host located in Australia for us Aussies. MW2 had a hectic multiplayer and still is today, with a crazy variety of weapons, perks, killstreaks and more. (I myself have over 100 hours on the steam version, but I played the multiplayer most during its prime)As always multiplayer is prone to hackers, lag etc. But it still is a fun game espically having not played this game for many years. Overall 8/10 This is a game I have enjoyed for many years and is definitely a classic of 'Call of Duty' games. Definitely would recommend this game if you have not played it before, or if your just interested in Call of Duty. This franchise has been up and down lately, but the older games are some of the most golden. Pick it up when it is on sale!			"

												Best campaign of any shooter I've ever played (haven't played loads, but still). Was pleasantly surprised. Fast paced and interesting missions across vastly different scenarios. This the first COD game I have ever personally owned (yet I've played the multiplayer on consoles at friends), and I must say, it is definitely a good entry to the franchise. I don't think I'd go any older that Call of Duty 4 or newer than MW3 though, as after MW3 from what I've seen and played at friend's, it sucks. Anything older and you'll have to work around the jarring mechanics of ancientness. This game was probably the highlight of the COD franchise, this and MW3, in my opinion. #MakeCODGreatAgain			"

Although it's a tie between Call of Duty®: Black ops® and Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® 2, this game will always have a place in my heart. To see a remaster 10 years after in 2019, I'm already sold.

												Do MW2 powróciłem po 3 latach, sądziłem że odbije sie od tej części jak od wielu innych gier do których nadal czuje sentyment lecz łatwo sie do nich zraziłem. Gra być może nie zaksakuje grafiką jak kiedyś, aczkolwiek nadal oferuje świetną zabawę w postaci kampanii oraz misji specjalnych, dodatkowo wzbogaconych świetnymi achievementami wymagających w pewnym stopniu umiejętności. Dla osób lubiących FPS-y jest to oczywiście pozycja obowiązkowa.			"

												Everything a COD game set in the modern age should be.  Interesting SP story, great mission based Co-op and good graphics for its time.  Worth your time and your dime.It's an FPS built around co-op.  The backstory is detailed and interesting and teamwork is often critical to success.This game is about co-op.  Other game modes exist but the real fun is reaching objectives with a buddy along.  One thing you shpould remember is that every COD game since has based it's gameplay on this game especially co-op (when there is any.)That means your best introduction to modern COD games is with Modern Warfare 2.

												Neither the best, nor the worst Call of Duty game.The single player story is nice and the single player is fun to play. But, of course, its only 6 to 7 hours till its over. The multiplayer can be fun, but sometimes youre pretty ♥♥♥♥ing close to smashing your keyboard. This game is like an on-off relationship, you start playing, and if you have a good run, you continue for several hours. But if you are surrounded by idiots and campers, you just rage quit. But i think every shooter game is like this, so dont decide by this point. If you liked Modern Warfare, i think you should like this one, too. And if ou like MW3 then you seem to like every shot you get, so, of course, also this game. Have fun :D			"

												Very awesome game. Amazing game has the best campaign for a call of duty game that I have ever played. It is worth every cent for this amazing game. The multiplayer was fine but multiplayer is just not my favorite thing with games. Spec ops missions were great too but there was only one with a new map in alpha, bravo, and charlie.

												내가 처음으로 산 정품스팀게임이다. 사실 그 전에 레고레이서2라는 게임이 있긴했지만그 게임은 콘푸로스트를 먹으면 주는거였기에 무시하자.어찌 됬건 명작이다. 이 게임을 하고 암벽등반 잘하는거 아닐까 하는 환상을 품어 영화 에베레스트를 봤더니 크레바스가 무서워서 등산가는 포기했다.피시방에서 250원 주고 30분동안 이 게임하던 기억이  난다. 피시방 사장이 삼촌 친구였는데 날 존나 싫어하듯 처다봤지만모던2가 재밌어서 한 동안 250원만 들고 피시방갔다가 피시방이 망해서 없어지곤 돈주고샀다. 그 피시방의 경영악화에 내가 한 몫하지 않았을까 싶다.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is by far one of the best call of duty games and also other master piece, i think was the last hight from the franchise. In my opinion i think call of duty 4 still better but i cant deny this game is near to perfect. This game is super addicted, really good graphics, the gameplay is improve from morden warfare 1 mainly in multiplayer, the single is kinda short but is so epic, co op is amazing to play with friends! I even played more co op then multiplayer it selft! this game have a pick longivity because of the multiplayer.

												At this point in MW2's lifespan I would advise you not to buy this game, due to its extriemly small player base. The only way I could recomend this to someone is if they're a die hard fan of this game. P.S. there are only 300-400 people in the game at a time from what I've seen.			"

												Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare was good! But i mean really good a master piece. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is by far one of the best call of duty games and also other master piece, i think was the last hight from the franchise. In my opinion i think call of duty 4 still better but i cant deny this game is near to perfect. This game is super addicted, really good graphics, the gameplay is improve from morden warfare 1 mainly in multiplayer, the single is kinda short but is so epic, co op is amazing to play with friends! I even played more co op then multiplayer it selft! this game have a pick longivity because of the multiplayer. One of the most nice things about this game is the fact this game age really well, even today looks amazing. Review: 9.5/10			"

												The multiplayer in this game is great fun! I keep coming back to it.Positives:+ Breakneck pace+ Tasteful weapon balance+ All-or-nothing class perks, multi-leveled.+ Stages are well structured and rather large+ Killstreak rewards are absolutely satisfying in this game+ Game/round-winning killcams are a joy+ HOST F*CKING SUBSTITUTION, meaning the game isn't over when the host player leaves.+ Challenges breathe life and replayability into the game. Not just progress-based challenges but also situational.+ Buttery-smooth and responsive gameplay and networking when pinging low. Friendly to snappy reactions.+ Zero split-screening+ Fun with friends+ Arguably still the best multiplayer in the series+ Not dead at allPotential negatives:- Odd respawing. The game tends to place you near the person who last killed you and vice-versa.- All-or-nothing class perks. They can get annoying when everyone decides to be the Mad Bomber or power-buff an already high-powered weapon.- The Vector SMG is the only weapon with stable ACOG sights. Use the attachment with caution on other weapons- Extended Mags ""attachment"" can be VERY tough to unlock- P2P-host/client multiplayer. A game can fall apart due to host's terrible connection. Host migration DOES kick in during these situations though.- Not without its hackers. But I've actually run into some fun hacks.- Not open to mods. Bummer... The game's flexibility encouraged me to make some Perfect Dark mods.			"

												I only played the campaign. And that said, I really enjoyed the campaign.Infinity Ward took a risk with one of the opening levels, No Russian, where basically you massacre an airport with Russian terrorists, only for the player character to act as a scapegoat, inciting a war between the States and Russia. The ensuing storyline involves home defense, playing as a United States Marine, and espionage missions where you fight your way in various parts of the world to gather intel in order to reveal the truth about the airport massacre.Overall, the campaign was pleasant.8.9/10			"

												This game is great, a must buy. With the flaws of unbalanced multiplayer and spec ops not being as addicting as zombies aside, the game is great. The characters are probably the most memorable out of the franchise, the multiplayer is the most insane yet satisfying I have ever experienced, and the campaign is mouth watering just agaze of the gameplay. The game was definitely what it hyped itself to be. Each mission had a purpose and didnt need a cutscene or explanation for its existence. Almost no filler!! Personally, I liked spec ops and wouldnt change the multiplayer at all. My only personal compalint is only that MW3 and the latest CoD games dont live up to what Infinity Ward 2009 and before made and why CoD was more than just your next Military FPS. Hopefully one day we can get another memorable story, character based, action packed, joy ride of a Call Of Duty game like this one again. But, at least we still have this.

												I bought this game to replay the singleplayer portion of the game since I used to play it a lot when I had an Xbox 360 and I wanted to experience the nostalgia of playing through it once again. And I have to say, it sure delivers on that and more!I played through Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare right before jumping into this one to better understand the story and of course to re-experience CoD 4 as well. During the 8 hours I spent completing the campaign of Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) on Veteran I never once got bored, this is a game filled to the brim with action all the way throughout the campaign and there's never a dull moment, this game had my adrenaline pumping and my heart beating like crazy during a big portion of the game.I am not going to get into any details about the story here in this review since it would take too long, but the story is a story of betrayal and most of the story takes place during a war between Russia and the US. You get to play as multiple soldiers during the campaign and as such you get to play with different teams of soldiers as well. I found this game to be a lot easier than CoD 4, I played both on Veteran but I found MW2 to be the easiest one. CoD 4 just has a lot more difficult missions and scenarios compared to MW2. That said, this game is not afraid to give you a challenge should you choose to play on the higher difficulties.If you are thinking of buying this game for it's multiplayer alone I would stay away, the game's multiplayer has a very low player population and a lot of the players still playing are cheaters.I found this game to be an amazing experience and I would highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters but I would highly recommend that you play CoD 4 before this one, it is not required to understand the story however CoD 4 is an excellent game in it's own right and you will get to know some of the characters in MW2 during CoD 4 (MW1), that way you will already be familiar with a lot of the characters when jumping into MW2.

Its true that there are occasionally hackers, and noob tubers, but many are gone. There are still about 1000 people playing this game. The game itself still has servers, as well as some privately hosted servers and facebook groups. Its alive and its fun.			"

A lot of people still play it, sou don't worry about finding a lobby, it takes about 3 seconds for me to get into a lobby on TDM or FFA.And about the campaign, the Modern Warfare series has a great story to offer, so it is worth to play through. Not talking about the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer is a god.			"

												Wow, it's tough to believe it has been nearly seven years since this game came out. It marks a really cool time in my life, when I had finally moved on to go to university after community college and I was meeting all sorts of new people. A few people I had recently met were picking it up, so I figured, why not?I know the CoD series gets a lot of flak for being casual, having an over-the-top campaign, and being a rehash every year, but I think of it as a series that pumps out constant quality on a yearly basis for people who want this kind of thing. CoD is a great time, because the multiplayer has a high skill ceiling while managing to be addicting in the right ways. The campaign is stupid, but it keeps you going and it is just pure action porn in a good way. The Special Operation side missions are frustrating but keep you coming back.I think this was a pretty fun game, and I can't believe it was seven years ago that I picked this up for full price from some record store in Santa Cruz.

												I bought this game to replay the singleplayer portion of the game since I used to play it a lot when I had an Xbox 360 and I wanted to experience the nostalgia of playing through it once again. And I have to say, it sure delivers on that and more!I played through Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare right before jumping into this one to better understand the story and of course to re-experience CoD 4 as well. During the 8 hours I spent completing the campaign of Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) on Veteran I never once got bored, this is a game filled to the brim with action all the way throughout the campaign and there's never a dull moment, this game had my adrenaline pumping and my heart beating like crazy during a big portion of the game.I am not going to get into any details about the story here in this review since it would take too long, but the story is a story of betrayal and most of the story takes place during a war between Russia and the US.

												Truly a great game. I love shooter games and i especialy love Call of Duty. Next to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare this is my favorite game in the series. However latley this game has been swarmed with people who accuse you of being a hacker just becuase you are better than them or because you are winning. It also has people who use a mod that allows you to kick players if you are the host, I myself have been kicked from many games just because of the fact that the host does not like the way I play or im not doing what he or she has asked. This really pisses me off because this has also only happend in free for all matches which for those who dont know you can do anything you want. This game is really fun but it really cuts back form the fun when there are so many people out there who think they have a right to screw up some one elses gameing experience. Also i would recomend buying this game on a sale becuase even though it is a great game its not worth twenty bucks. :)			"

												Suprisingly, very alive player base, within the first 3 hours of Multiplayer gameplay for me I have not come across a single hacker. Brings back nostalgia from my good ol' PS3 days. Although you should be warned of people hiding corners, grenade launchers, the UMP45, Akimbo G18's, and trickshoters. In conclusion still a very good game or at least better than that Call of Duty Galactic Warfare BS.			"

												This game is pretty whack, even after nearly 7 years. I don't run into that many hackers, although it wasn't that long ago that I wandered into a lobby and got promoted to Lvl 70, which isn't that great considering I wanted to unlock everything myself but whatever,And about the campaign, it's still the fun, chaotic, and epic campaign we all remember. Definitely better than the newer campaigns.			"

Please do not buy this game, valve cannot keep all the hackers out of it and it is basically paying $20 for a VAC ban.			"

												This game is great, a must buy. With the flaws of unbalanced multiplayer and spec ops not being as addicting as zombies aside, the game is great. The characters are probably the most memorable out of the franchise, the multiplayer is the most insane yet satisfying I have ever experienced, and the campaign is mouth watering just agaze of the gameplay. The game was definitely what it hyped itself to be. Each mission had a purpose and didnt need a cutscene or explanation for its existence. Almost no filler!! Personally, I liked spec ops and wouldnt change the multiplayer at all. My only personal compalint is only that MW3 and the latest CoD games dont live up to what Infinity Ward 2009 and before made and why CoD was more than just your next Military FPS. Hopefully one day we can get another memorable story, character based, action packed, joy ride of a Call Of Duty game like this one again. But, at least we still have this.

												Play the game for singleplayer experience. The Modern Warfare series has a very interesting story with excellent world execution, voiceacting, scenario and music. Also, the story has great plot twists. I'm no expert but I felt like I'm taking part in a realistic war in a realistic world. The spec ops cooperation mode provides loads of fun if you play with a friend and it's challenging too!The multiplayer mode.... Well... I played only one match and leveled to maximum level of maximum prestige. Hackers. Hackers everywhere. Don't play multiplayer.			"

												Pretty Good Game Review Considering (PGGRC) 7 Hours to Complete TL;DR - (The first game I played on my Xbox 360 so slightly biased). The best singleplayer and coop in a cod game to date. When the game did have innovation and not trying to ♥♥♥♥ your wallets.Performance - As you could expect good. Solid 60 fps and looks great. Nothing more to say it will run on a lot different setups.Graphics - Good even now. Textures in places are weak which considering its linear they could do a better job of hiding.... It’s got a more of a realistic look with a whole colour palette to choose from than what other games in the franchise use; MW3 grey colour palette and Black Op 2 orange colour palette). Why they don’t vary colours is beyond me but at least this game does not. Gameplay - Good. Guns actually have recoil, good punch through and feel military grade. Movement is also quite slick. Equipment as well as a selection of combat scenarios that vary up. Stealth sections are instant fail sections (for the most part) and if you’re good enough you can get through them loud. Less hand holding in this game. Feels more open and free though the odd corridor does loom over you from time to time but that’s expected. Replayability - From the campaign there are some missions that you will want to play again as they were unique (Enemy Of My Enemy), just plain awesome (Cliff hanger) or just ♥♥♥♥ed up (No Russian). Spec Ops also has a range of mission modes to cater to different playstyles and different challenges. Get to Echo set of missions to know what I mean. And best of all try to collect 69 stars.Conclusion - If you can’t tell this game is great for a reason. Cod at its peak when it was not rushed, lacked innovation and climbing over each other to take more money from you. Multiplayer is filled with hackers which is ♥♥♥♥ but singleplayer and spec ops make up for this and are worth for a great purchase.
