												Extremely enjoyable third-person action-adventure game, involving space, alien worlds, super powers and a great soundtrack. Kinda like a Star Wars Jedi Knight game, but without the lightsaber. Shame it didn't sell well, the worst thing about the game is that it ends with a cliffhanger and we will never see how it continues.			"

												One of my most favorite games, sadly ended with its first chapter because of a stupid Alphabet Letter Finding Game in the Xbox. Storyline is fantastic (Star Wars meets Halo), Combat is fun (slightly reminescent of 3rd person Unreal/Halo mix). It is a little Glitchy but still stable enough to play.I do recommend getting the Advent Revising UnOfficial Patch that fixes video playback (especially on Vista/7 or higher).http://www.miketyndall.com/setz/Advent%20Revising/EDIT: Brought to my attention that the contest was an Alphabet finding game. I dont know why I thought it was a Red Crayon.			"

												Good game. It has a great story. Moreover, I think they made the story first and wrapped the game afterwards. It's just linear gameplay but the story makes it up. This thing also has A LOT of cinematics. and I mean A LOT.There's an unofficial patch that makes the Cinematics better and ADDS more cinematics that was remoeved when they ported it to PC. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you do the patch.Mechanic--wise, It's your average TPS game. and similar to old TPS games. The BOSSES are a ♥♥♥♥♥ to deal with. I was stuck with ONE boss for 2 HOURS. It sometimes crashes but no big deal. Rating this one a 7/10. "

												Take part Mass Effect, part Halo, and throw in a dash of Star Wars and you get Advent Rising. This is the utmost praise, however, as Advent Rising is a fantastic game. It is clear that Mass Effect borrowed heavily from this game as the Geth seem to be ripped straight from it. The fiction behind the story is some of the most engrossing sci-fi I've seen in a while, which is no surprise since it was written by Orson Scott Card.The gameplay is third-person, with the use of guns and special powers. The guns do feel really nice, but I found myself using the powers more often, especially in the later game. The level design is superb as well, and I never felt lost, even in some of the bigger environments.The game is not without it's faults, however. Consulting  PC Gaming Wiki [pcgamingwiki.com] is a must for essential fixes, but I still had a fair number of issues. There were graphic anomalies when things got intense and there were lots of explosions. cutscenes would sometimes hicup as well, although the dialogue did not skip. The most annoying thing were the game crashes which happened a handful of times. Thankfully, the game saved at the exact point of the crash so nothing was lost, but still annoying.Iffy port aside, this game is fantastic. It really is a shame we will probably never see the planned sequels as this game builds a very promising lore and world around it. It's certainly worth playing, just know that it will probably never get a proper finale. "

												Advent Rising is a game that I randomly found. I saw many steam reviews saying that it was one of their favourite games of all time. And had a person in my steam friend list who also was super excited about it. So, I recently played the game to find out if it was all nostalgia or if it really is a masterpiece.You start the game off by getting on to a spaceship and receiving your training. You visit an alien form that warns you of another alien group that is about to attack. When you return to the ship it is under attack and you have to escape. I have to say the first 2 hours of the game really felt boring to me. The gameplay felt like you were just going from room to room killing aliens. The only positive was that you have choices in the beginning. Which you, sadly and strangely, don't have as you continue further into the game. After those initial 2 hours it finally starts to get interesting. Also your weapons are levelling up and you are unlocking new cool powers (It comes over weird in the story that you randomly unlock new powers though). The game has so many powers and weapons that I haven't been able to try them all out. This may be because you are limited to one weapon or power per hand. Also, I have to say that the end bosses were pretty challenging overall, I wasn't expecting that. The driving sections in the game can become really exciting, except if you have to shoot. In the end the game took me 10 hours to complete on normal difficulty.The story is pretty well written and had me coming back to the game. I am sometimes amazed that they actually did what they did with the story. I reached a part of the game that made me wish to stop playing, but the story helped me push through it. There are times when the story felt cheesy and cheap (And sadly the not CGI cutscenes looked really poor). It is also obvious that the screenwriting took inspiration from movies popular at the time of the game's release. The game has many slow-motion animations while jumping or finishing an enemy to make it more cinematic. This is pretty cool but after a while it can be really irritating, because you are just waiting for the animation to end.The sound design of the game sadly feels strangely rushed. There are too many instances to list: The game is missing walking and explosion sounds and there are a lot of other strange audio issues. Such as an NPC having the same voice as the protagonist when they get hit. The soundtrack on the other hand is really great and done by a real orchestra. The Graphics thanks to the style and can look really great, but sadly the textures mostly look bland. ( I had that the game crashed several times, and sadly it never putted me at the last checkpoint. )I would recommend if you play this game:To use the  Advent Revising Mod [www.miketyndall.com]Turn off auto-aimingFinal thoughts:I think it is sad that Advent Rising is a forgotten game. The game was much too rushed in production and had a boring beginning and ending. However, I still think that if you can accept the complaints there is a great experience to be had in the game.			"

												One of my favorite games ever.  Originally played it on the Xbox when it was first released, and have been waiting for a sequel ever since.This isn't the greatest port ever made, but that doesn't detract too much from the experience.  Framerates will sputter no matter how overspec'd your computer is, but the story is incredible, and the combat system never gets old.  Worth every minute.			"

												Advent Rising is one of these games that just can't seem to get it all together. Despite excellent production values and a compelling sci-fi story there are some less-than-perfect gameplay flaws that mar what could have been one of the best games of the year.Advent Rising tells the futuristic tale of Gideon Payne, an altruistic hero and rookie pilot that attempts to save all humans from an evil alien race. The Seekers are hell bent on destroying the humans that colonized the galaxy while another benevolent race revere the humans to be fantastical creatures with extraordinary gifts. In Gideon's case this turns out to be true as he is imbued with superhuman powers such as levitation, energy blasts and energy shields.An action-based shooter, Advent Rising incorporates elements of role-playing in that you unlock new skills, powers and weapons and increase your ability to utilize them in different situations. This game has already been released on the Xbox where the control system attempts to replicate the keyboard and mouse combo of the PC. Now that it's been released on the PC these features are somewhat redundant. Some of the technical problems that plagued the Xbox version have been addressed such as the chugging framerate which is as smooth as glass on the PC but there are other problems that keep this game from reaching the top of the heap.This isn't your typical shooter. It's marinated in a good story, good graphics(keeping in mind it came out in 2005), great effects and an excellent soundtrack produced by two Emmy award winners. The story was written by Orson Scott Card who was responsible for Halo as well as other sci-fi publications. Playing the game on the PC it seems to have more console elements to it. It's reminiscent of a console to PC port such as Max Payne. Not only do the main characters share the same last name they also use a dodge move that slows down time. It's called bullet time in case you just fell off of the turnip wagon.The pace is a little slower than your average shooter but that's because of the all-encompassing storyline. It justifies situations in the game. There are lots of interesting plot twists and turns. It's like a great comic book come to life. It's just too bad there are some control issues. Some of the weapons are slow such as the plasma and rockets. Character models are irregularly elongated and have a spongy bounce to their movements which doesn't feel very solid. There are also instances where characters get stuck in the environment.The voiceacting and soundtrack are second to none. The music doesn't just mimic the action it actually foreshadows events in true Hollywood fashion. There is some cornball dialog that seems like it came from an anime production but thankfully those moments are few and far between. The explosions are impressive from both a visual and audio standpoint. They almost set a new standard, which is good considering that some of the graphics are rather boring, especially some of the overused textures.Advent Rising is a good game, it's short but it's good. There are some flaws that you need to overlook but there's nothing here that will ruin the entire experience. The lack of a co-op or multi-player modes reduces the replay value but you can go back and experiment with different combinations of powers.			"

												Originally supposed to be a gaming trilogy, which unfortunately ended up with only the first game of the series...An alien race founds the location of human world, those aliens are peaceful and almost worship the humans, because of the galaxy legends, but they also warn humans that a different faction of aliens is about to destroy their homeworld and annihilate every living human. You take on the role of Gideon Wyeth, young human pilot, who happens to be in the middle of the events and later learns why humans are worshipped by one race while another wants them dead. And with the help of the aliens, he learns much more than the stories...The game itself is somewhat old - yes, the graphics are outdated, but the important, the best part of this game is it's story, it's music and the gameplay. Story and music are just perfect, you need to try it by yourself to know what i mean, time can't take that away.Gameplay is really enjoying as well, but the game is filled with bugs, which kinda ruin the overall experince. There also is a flick targetting system that is sometimes pain in the a** to use. Game has fair number of weapons and abilities with progression system, meaning you get more skilled with the weapon/ability the more you use it and eventually open up secondary modes that are mostly very different from the originals, making it a different weapon/ability.When you beat the game, there is a huge cliffhanger ending, proof that there was meant to be a sequel(s), and you wish they continued the story, but it never came out. As much as i love Mass Effect series (i think they are similar), i wish they rather finished Advent series with more love than the game got in the first place, much more polishing and it could be as good as Mass Effect, if not better.If you want epic sci-fi game, it's certainly worth a shot!

The action and the intensity of this game is so awesome because he have so many battles with aliens, robots and bosses.3. You have so many ways to kill the aliens, you have human weapons, alien weapons, grenades, melee and powers.4. What it's so awesome at this game it's that you can level up your abillities like jumping, melee, powers and weapons and when you level up you make a SICK explosion which destroy everything around.

 A space opera ahead of its time Advent Rising was something very different from what I thought it would be when I opened it for the first time. I was expecting a game from my childhood, but what I got was a game with solid gameplay, a fleshed out story that just felt  right  and somewhat dated visuals that after some time became a part of the games charm.The only con is the cliffhanger ending that leaves you gasping for more, and no rumors of a sequel have been confirmed yet. Overall, Advent Rising is a great game with fun gameplay, a rewarding skill progression system and a captivating (albeit cheesy at times) story.9.5/10			"

												I got to say, this game is a complete surprise, I really did not think what to expect and maybe playing this after just now completing the mass effect trilogy is giving me great perspective on this.This game is creative in many ways, I love the dual wield mechanic, a rocket launcher on your left hand, asult rifle on the right and mixing both. There is also Psy powers and vehicles, it gives me this unusual feel of a love child between Halo (vehicles, guns) and Mass effect (psy powers, companions).The game main flaws are the crashes it constantly when entering cutscenes (fortunately, the autosaves are very well placed) the movement is wonky and a bit unnatural and the story... yeah the story is really awful. I can't help but think this game would have been great as a comedic title or as a parody of scifi games (specially mass effect, this game shares so much with it and it actually came before), sort of the Duke Nukem of scifi games. The story is completely rushed and absurd ( first contact with friendly aliens for the humans living on their current planet, they warn you about second race of aliens looking to delete humanity, said aliens arrive within the hour of first alien contact, girlfriend is taken from the space station, earth is going to be destroyed by lizards with guided meteors, find female pilot to escape earth before it's being blowed up, get felings for pilot not 2 hours from having girlfriend taken, get superpowers in an alien training montage...) so why didn't they go full comedic? The characters are very awkward and badly developed. The main character is a complete wet towel that is constantly escaping calamities leaving a lot of people behind to save his own butt without any remorse.I really can't be invested in the plot, as I said, if it was comedic it would have made much more sense. But the action? The gameplay? hell yeah, the gameplay is quite fun.			"

												I am legitimately surprised, but this is actually a really fun game. As I recall, it was supposed to be a ""halo killer"" back in the days when games didn't just crank out sequel after sequel after sequel (yes i'm conscious of megaman and final fantasy) and effectively kill themselves from a lack of innovation, but it's got a decent identity of its own and it's just straight up fun to play. Lots of frantic action, intuitive controls on PC, lots of big booms, and a big boobed damsel in distress. Or something.I think one of the things I like most about it is that it's a relic from an era before every shooter became obsessed with pseudo-rpg elements like leveling up and gaining XP. Advent Rising has weapon proficiencies, but they're almost unnoticeable and are kind of just a vague foreshadowing of the direction the genre would eventually head.It's far from perfect (respawning enemies, lots of crashing, still honestly a pretty blatant attempt to capitalize on halo's popularity, written by that dumb mormon gay-basher that nerds jerk off to all the time) but it's some of the most fun I've had so far since I started this whole mess. It looks like garbage, but it's 11 years old already and I honestly don't give the slightest ♥♥♥♥ about graphics unless they're beyond stunning so whatever.Final note: I think it's interesting how badly the graphics from that era have aged, but in a completely different way from the ones on ps1 and n64 (by the way, there is absolutely nothing uglier than an n64 game to modern eyes). They're serviceable, but I honestly remember looking at some of the xbox era ♥♥♥♥ and going ""man it can't get much better than that."" Anyway, Advent Rising goes on sale a lot for like a dollar and is bundled relatively regularly so if you're down for a little bit of jankiness and don't mind something a little older, you could do a lot worse, IMO. I'll be finishing this one up.			"

												A sci-fi third person almost-shooter written by Orson Scott Card, sounds excellent right? It is... for the most part. The game controls well and looks nice (well, nice for a classic Xbox-era game anyway) and the story has a nice feeling of weight that is punctuated by the excellent score. Unfortunately, some of the levels are derivative and the ending makes it clear the developers were expecting to make three games instead of one. The story, while epic, is pretty silly and treats the whole ""humans are demigods"" plot point far too seriously. That being said, the game is solid, enjoyable, and well worth the ten dollars.			"

												Advent Rising is a nice 3rd, or 1st person shooter from the time when they where coming out in high numbers. This was a hyped game with a long development and had some big promises to keep. In 05, when it was released originally on the x box, these promisises where overshadowed by bigger and frankly better tittles coming out of  the time including halo 2 and a new stable of games coming out on the brand new 360. I bought it, because it was cheap very early in its life, and happened to enjoy it back then. It had its issues but it was a fast and rather flashy shooter whith good graphicks and production values and what have u. It diddnt all come together like u would hope but it was fun and has and still has a simple but well told and engaging story. played it once, never needed to or thought i needed to again So fast forward to 2016. Now im 30 and this game that i had fond memories of pops into my head out of nowhere and I dicide to see if its on sale on steam. It was for like 2 bucks or something. So id like to happily say that this little tittle is one of the finer aging shooters. the story is sooo refreshing from what you usualy get out of shooters. I optimized the controls and graphics quites easily and i find that it still looks quite nice and the framerate issues from the console version are gone. this game performs well on my weak laptop and that makes it look better in its own way. It doesnt feel perfect but it feels modern enough. But the wierd thing is is that its been a long time scince ive sat down and was truly pulled into a single player game and i realy am with this 1. with its pressures of its initial release failures the game has been able to breath new  again and im very happy to play it. has a few dings but all in all it should be played if u like shooters and want to see a good example of a game riding the line between old school shooters such as doom and the hybrids of production of today like mass effect. hope this helps. steam version gets 7.9 out of 10 "

												Honestly, you're only going to love this game if you're the sort to become a cult fan of titles. The game has a potentially great story, amazing world opportunity, and is probably the precursor to good telekinetic powers before any Star Wars game ever got it right.With that being said, it has a huge number of bugs, does not deliver on as much as it tries to, and needed some serious optimization work. If you're willing to deal with those hassles, then go for it, and you may fall in love like I did.			"

												I love this damn game.  It's got a great story (written by Orson Scott Card, who, love him or hate him, can whip up a mean sci-fi plotline) with a great soundtrack, and, as your character is some kinda crazy psychic Halo Jedi thingamapoop, it's a power trip to play.  It's a tad buggy at times, and a few of the cutscenes are awkwardly cut off, but I like it anyway.  Tragically, the story is obviously meant to be the first third of a trilogy, and the rest of it was never produced, but it's certainly worth a look, personal opinion.			"

												My first negative review, and I didn't even mind the game that much. It's just that all it's good points didn't make up for the bad.I got tired of the constant cycle of ""Epic cinematic"" (that looked really outdated even with the patch, so it loses its effect) followed by fighting dozens and dozens of samey enemies, interspersed with bad checkpointing leading to another ""Epic cinematic"", and then repeating again, sometimes culminating in a boss-fight where you'd have to wrestle with the messy targetting system to exploit weaknesses, and sometimes simply crashing to the desktop.The game picks up slightly when you get your powers, but then near the end, even that is made boring again.You might love it due to nostalgia thinking back to when it first came out, but if this is going to be your first experience with the game, I'd suggest you just skip it.

This game proves that no matter how good the story is if the basic mechanics aren't done right you're going to have a miserable time.Issues:- Camera sensitivity/mouse sensitivity is aweful and different verically vs hortizontally. - Lock on targeting is required for powers but any movement breaks the lock. This is what ultimately got me to stop playing. - Driving sections are like the inside of a pinball machine and you're the pinball.  "

												This is a great game that was brutally overlooked on release. As 3rd person action games goes this has a lot going for it, with a really nice feel to the movement and special effects. The duel weapon system, combined with a well designed group of ""Jedi"" type powers lead to some strategic and variable battles, where you can choose to save ammo by throwing people into deep space ;-)The storyline is really a beginning unfortunately (as the title will never see it's trilogy completed) but the voice acting and feel of the scenarios are both dramatic and driven. The score written by Tommy Tallarico really adds to this and can make many show piece battles feel of emotion. Voice acting is also top notch here (some of the best I've heard).Unfortunately the age of the game really lets it down now in terms of visuals and it is by no means bug free but these are very small gripes and will not hinder your enjoyment!

												One of my favorite games for the original Xbox.  In a lot of ways, it can be seen as a predecessor to Mass Effect: a sci-fi shooter with a deep plot (where decisions made in the first game theoretically would have transferred over to the sequels, had there been any) and some RPG elements (though these are incredibly light RPG elements when compared to those of Mass Effect).  It's a bit glitchy at times, but the graphics are pretty good for the era and in no way detract from the experience.  Personally, I can't play this without a controller, but I think that's just because that's how I learned it.  All in all, a great buy for the price.			"

												Overrated game if you read other review websites. You can play fine unlike many of the older games(used Windows 8). The screenshots fools you into thinking this game has some space battles, including the intro start of the game. Don't be fooled, this is not a ""Space sim game"". This is a third person shooter game. The screenshots are hover vehicles in land/volcanoe battle. If you are looking for a Space sim game this is not your type of game. There are no secret to unlock for this game so you don't really have to be bother to play highest difficulty or looking for secrets. There are much better games than this during 2003 since its release. The only good thing about this game is the fighting system and skill perks which made this game unique for its time. It might disappoint some people as this is just a generic third person shooter with a good story and gameplay.Should I recommend this to people? Maybe. I've been waiting to play this game so long since 2005, and after beating this game. It isn't a bad game, but, the gameplay didn't age that well. It kind of disappointed me. I was too hoping for a mix of space sim due to the screenshots.Beware buyers: There are two endings for this game depending who you save at the very first mission. The real last mission happens after the credits scene. So do not expect that you have finished the last mission after the credit scene starts. Some may like this game, some may not. If there was a neutral option I would have picked that.			"

												I was quite disappointed with this game. It has a pretty cool sci-fi setting, and the main characters from what I've experienced so far seemed decent enough. But the gameplay is just so rough around the edges that the game becomes a test of patience a lot of the time.The combat seems fun and all. Some battles in the beginning were quite fun, especially with the whole chaos going on aboard the space station. However, that whole area was just gunfight after gunfight. And when you're not engaging in gunfights, you're crossing vast areas doing nothing but walking, like the first plains area right after the space station. I spent a good minute or so crossing it, then died in a battle, then had to cross it again, two more times.And shortly after that there was a car driving section. The control for the car is quite awkward, and I ended up giving up when I kept failing to make it over a gap between the cliffs whilst trying to dodge enemy gunfire. It's not my idea of fun. If you thought controlling Mako in Mass Effect was bad, think again.In addition to frustrations in the gameplay, the game also crashes a lot. You can't save when you want, and checkpoints are quite far apart, so every time the game crashes to desktop, you lose a lot of progress.There are some good ideas present regarding the setting, and some of the mechanics are nice, like doing dodging manoeuvres during gunfights, but in general the game feels very rough and even unpolished, with no regard to the player's time, so I can't recommend it.

The joystick V/Z axis is always on, so whatever you have that bound do, it will provide full feedback on, meaning your camera is always turning, or your character is always walking. It sounds like there is a workaround if you intend to play with a controller, but I don't- I just want to use keyboard and mouse. This makes the game literally unplayable. Waste of time.			"

												Unless I can summon some otherwordly patience within myself to finish this game, I can't recommend it which is a huge shame. I remember hearing about this game when it launched on the Xbox back in the day and when I saw it on Steam, I got excited to try it out after seeing the good reviews. Unfortunately, I have to disagree with most reviewers. With the understanding that this game is 10 years old, I'm not going to bother talking about the graphics. It's understandable that they're dated and don't hold up well. The controls are beyond awful and controlling vehicles is a nightmare. The game crashes... a lot. I even installed the Advent Revising fan patch which is supposed to fix a lot of the bugs and crashing issues. Didn't help much. The combat seemed fun at first, but after the 20th encounter with a pack of enemies, you realize that there isn't much in the way of strategy or diversity. Run around, shoot the seemingly endless string of bad guys, repeat. At least the guns are cool.The game also seems to have a variety of random glitches and errors which I encountered a bunch in my short play time. Some of them are incredibly frustrating and require you to completely restart the level to resolve. Not sure if these problems are prevalent on the console version or if it's a port issue, but it's just one more thing that makes this game a serious test of patience.The one redeeming quality for me was that the story seemed interesting and well-written. If I do end up finishing this game, it'll be for story alone. That's if I don't go online and just read about it first.I'd say avoid this game unless you're looking to replay it for nostalgia's sake. It just seems broken in too many ways.			"

												I got this game on sale, for 1 euro. The game is a fun 3rd person shooter. There's nothing particulary revolutionary about it, but the game gives you new stuff to play around with at a rather rapid pace, as there's a bunch of special powers, each having a special mode when you level them up and every gun also has a special mode when you level it up enough. I'll tell you something that took me a while to figure out: you press 1 or 2 in order to switch modes for your left, or right weapon/power. Some bosses or monsters require certain powers to kill them, or to kill them quickly, so watch out for that. Try to think of what makes sense and you should make your way through the monsters no problem. The game doesn't have very many bugs. I'm certain there are some, but after playing the game 5 times over the years I never found any.I played the game once on Steam, and as you can see (or can't incase I decided to replay it) it took me about 10 hours, on Easy difficulty. It might take you less, or more.Overall I'd actually rate this game a  9.5/10  because of generic problems with old games, definetly a hidden gem of the videogame industry, rating definetly heavily shifted by nostalgia. I have no idea what someone who never played this before would rate it, certainly lower.			"

												Dont be fooled by this game's overwhelmingly positive reviews, it is a ♥♥♥♥fest of bugs, poor design and infuriatingly repetitive gameplay.The story begins moderatedly good, until hour 1 or 2, when it plummets into ""oh god, why am i still playing""... I got the gameplay time i have and played it til the end for two reasons: 1. I paid for this crap, so i expect to ""enjoy"" it fully. 2. I am one stubborn masochist who does not like leaving ♥♥♥♥ half-baked.Your character unexplainably gets superpowers, which makes the game cooler... until you actually have to use them in game, then it's one infuriating combat after another, until you ""level up"" your power into something that is still not useful at all, and dont even get me started with ""dodging"". the dodging animation just flips you into way more danger than it supposed to escape you from, and then when you land, the character is ""animation-locked"" in place until the landing animation ends, making you take even MORE damage.

												An old game, sometimes doesn't agree with steam, but a good game.The storytelling is a little awkward with rapid jumps in time, introducing new powers with the same animation makes them seem a little less important, and you're regularly thrown into new environments that you become a little shell shocked to the ambiance - and likely can't appreciate the fullest of the worldbuilding. Similarly, the controls are a little awkward at certain points. I don't mind dual wielding rifles, given the statements about recoil in this universe - but more importantly, the Throw ability is a little hard to use. Normally I wouldn't complain, since there are many otehr abilities that work without flaw - but the Throw ability is used in a number of boss fights.Now, even with all of that? I enjoyed myself.It was a unique narrative, in a unique world. A lot of different faces, mixed characters, some of whom I grew attached to more than others. The deaths of characters stood out to me, and though I wish there was more choice - I can safely say that this game doesn't parade behind an Illusion of Choice system. When you have to make a choice, which may be rare - but given this game's age I can understand that - you still greatly appreciate the results of your choice.Combat is interesting, and but not a change of pace from the usual archetypals. It's relatively smooth to go and decide what you want to equip, though knowing how much more XP you need to level a skill requires going through multiple menus. Having said this, I really like one thing about this game: You cannot max everything. I do not think, unless you play on easy, and grind away at mobs tirelessly, will you max all of your skills. That makes your gameplay choices a little more meaningful, and my character reflected it.In short? Yes, some of the voice acting isn't great. Its an old game. It can be clunky in some places, but all in all - I recommend fans of High Science Fiction pick it up. We'll never see a sequel, but we can smile at what was Advent.			"

The bottom line is that it is too rough around the edges to be worth your time and money.Pros+good general story line+good visuals+original combat mechanics (telekinesis and other powers are quite fun)Cons-awkward dialogue/cinematics-mechanics extremely uncomfortable at times-poor character development-bad port-why don't you get to fly a spaceship more than the first 2 minutes of the game???It was a good use of 99 cents but only because I have a lot of free time.6/10			"

On foot you'll get stuck everytime you try to jump or dodge a bit out of the standard path, and lastly the narrative and the characters are mediocre at best.

												Sci-fi action RPG where everyone has silly looking legs. The gameplay is pretty solid, with interesting combat and a somewhat compelling story. The voice acting is actually great, but the script is super cliche, so it hits a sort of balance as an okay story.Apparently, it was written by Orson Scott Card. One of the bosses is Barrakka Bahma, and the objective is to defeat him. Yep, definitely O.S. Card. Despite being 2005 graphics, and me playing on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, I was actually really impressed by some of the worlds they created in this game. It has a unique feeling and is fairly immersive. The different stages have very distinct tones, including the architecture, wildlife, colors, enemies, and textures.Game ends with a massive cliffhanger, and it will likely stay that way for eternity.

												One of those games where it's ambition clearly outweighed it's quality. Majesco had big plans for this game back when it was originally coming out. Slated as part one of a new trilogy, A massive marketing campaign, A tie in comic series. And after all of that the game ended up tanking at retail. It was a game that aimed for the stars but ended up hitting the sun. But putting it's history aside it's a surprisingly entertaining game with some great production values (For It's time anyway), fun run and gun gameplay and a fantastic score by Tommy Tallarico which might be the only real memorable thing about this game. It's more of a curiosity than a hidden gem but fans of science fiction and obscure older games may find some fun with this.			"

												An outstanding but deeply flawed experience. Unique gameplay and a wonderful script are dragged down but not ruined by the mother of all clunky control schemes. Thankfully once throughly rebound (make use of Mouse4 and Mouse5!) the game is very enjoyable. The plot ends on an unfortunate but very well done cliffhanger that will never get it's sequel and the pace of the story is too fast. All that being said, once you get used to the controls fighting becomes great fun, from dual wielding rocket launchers to stealing enemy superguns to things I can't get into without spoilers. It's definitely worth a pickup if you're a fan of space operas, however be prepared to deal with frustrating situations brought on by difficult controls.			"

												82/100 Overall, this is a fun game to play with a unique and interesting story written by Orson Scott Card. If you liked Halo Combat Evolved, you will definitely like Advent Rising. Cons: Reduced rating because the game is not fully compatible with Vista / Windows 7. Although the game can still be played on Vista, it randomly crashes every once in a while during cut scenes (so keep that in mind). Finally, this game was meant to be part of a trilogy of games. Unfortunately, the sequels were canceled. Nevertheless, this game is still worth playing.			"

												Advent Rising is one of those games that tries to tell a very good story behind some relatively good 3rd person dodge shooters with some fancy-shmancy powers. The result is a bit of a mixed bag though, but for a 10 year old game it held up pretty well. Unfortunately, the game is sort of a sleeper hit that never was popular enough to finish the other two games in the trilogy. The story penned by Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game, etc.) has the Wyeth Brothers (you control Gideon, the younger brother) be the pilot taking the ambassador to a first contact with a race of aliens who worship the humans almost as Gods, and they bear bad news... while they are perfectly peaceful... their enemies, known as the Seekers, are about to wipe out all the humans, and they will be here in days. And just as the shuttle head back for home, the Seekers arrived early with a full fleet, and started to invade the human space station. Fighting through the chaos and waves of aliens cutting through the hull and marines defending till the last, Gideon witness the Seekers appear to be scanning humans as they execute them. He was able to get his brother to escape pod, but his fiancee Olivia had been captured or lost. Pod landed on the planet, but there's full enemy action there too. Fighting through more enemies, they arrive at the city, fought through more enemies, reached the general in charge, but was told they need to find a ship off the planet... Seekers are using asteroids... any one not getting off are dead. As the asteroid bombardment begain, Wyeth brothers have to run through a collapsing base to locate the last available ship... Well, I've barely covered 1/3 of the game so far. Later Gideon discovered he has powers that he barely knew how to tap, and with the help of some friendly aliens, he may survive long enough to figure out what is going on... And let's just say there's enough plot twists left and right to keep you guessing. The game itself is third-person with some vehicle sections. Basically you control this guy, very athletic that can jump, pinwheel, dive and roll, and so on. He can also dual-wield two long weapons (or short) and achieve phenomenal accuracy if you lock on to the targets. So the game basically is a lot of shooting and jumping around, even a few fisticuffs when you have no weapons (and later, fight with your powers). The problem is, you only have two active attacks, and if you need a third or a fourth you have to remap them and things get dicey, and in the late game boss fights you will need more than two attacks. Consider this a hint. :)  You do get to drive a vehicle sometimes, and the ""Scythe"" is almost a bit like predecessor to HALO's Warthog. Your brother or allies will get in and man the gun for you. And it handles pretty well. It also has a bit of a booster for the more difficult jumps that you may sometimes need to make. And yes, you can run enemies over. Seekers also have hovertanks that you can borrow. There are also sometimes stationary turrets you can appropriate against Seeker gunship/dropships. Graphics is obviously a bit dated by current standards, but not excessively so. Animation is decent, and while architecture is a bit square-ish it's not too bad. Good story, lots of action, though a bit cliche-ish at times. This game really needs a bit of love, even though it's a decade late.			"

												Rating: 8/10Advent Rising is scifi adventure following a human named Gideon as he teams up humans and aliens alike to combat one of the most powerful forces in the galaxy. In this epic scifi story many aliens hold humans at a near god-like stature and have been on the search for them for many years believing that they posess vast powers. The aliens find the humans just in time to warn them of a major threat that is heading there way and could be the end of the human race.The story in Advent Rising is nothing short of excellent. I bought this game on sale and did not expect to play for very long, 3 days later I have completed the game. The story is just that entertaining. Each section leaves you wanting to see more of the story unfold. You are in for a treat with this one.While the overall gameplay is that of an early 2000s game (which this game is) the combat is very addicting. You will be using melee, a huge variety of guns and even special abilities you unlock which are very fun to play with. There is nothing like throwing an enemy into the depth of space using your telekinitic-like abilities or boxing an enemy inside a forcefield and watching them kill themselves. You can also control turrets, drive land and flying vehicles all with their own weapons and abilities. The boss fights each have a specific strategy and it can provide quite the challenge to figure out.The game is not without its flaws though. While the combat is addicting, the style in which the enemies approach is very repatitive and sometimes the targeting system will work against you. I found myself aiming manually as opposed to using the target system due to this. Also the game tends to crash randomly after cutscenes. Luckily the game saves quite frequently so this is not a major issue, but is still rather annoying. There is also one bug where the game can't recognize proper input if you have a game controller in. This is easily remedied by unplugging the controller though.Advent Rising was far more than I expected it to be. It was one of the better stories I have played through this year. The gameplay is repetitive at times but the combat is still very satisfying. There are a few bugs with the game but they are not decision breaking. The story alone in Advent Rising is worth the full price tag. If you find it on sale it is a steal.			"

												Temper your expectations. This game is a very solid 8 by virtue of having more amazing qualities than terrible ones. The music is good, story is good, voice acting is decent - in other words the backbone is solid. However, the graphics arent great even for the time, the sound design is bad, the character models are a horrific joke, and the combat? Meh. However, it is extremely entertaining and always makes me want the sequels to be made, along with a remake of this. It's pure entertainment, and that's what a good video game should be.			"

												I kind of love Advent Rising. Sure its a bit buggy, and sure the flick targetting is a bit rubbish, and the power selection controls are kind of terible, and sure the writing at times is a bit cringeworthy, BUT its sci fi space opera where you get awesome magic powers, and by cheating (tab/useammo) with unlimited energy its not only easy, but ridiculously fun - running around in slow time while firing giant energy bolts  into some enemies, and jump kicking the rest is a real blast. I fully recommend this game, and wish the sequels got made, both to see how the story (would have) progressed, and to continue running around with superman powers (esepcially since one would presumably start the second game from the ending power level of the first, which would thereby miss out the entirely underwhelming gamneplay of the first half of the game where you are just a guy with a gun or two).

												Critical ErrorGeneral Protection Fault!- Game closedI almost liked this games, a few times. I love sci-fi, i love Orson Scott Card, but to recommend this would be to say it is ok to release games in this state. It's not.This game crashed in the high double digit number of times. At one point, it crashed multiple times at the end of a long checkpoint, making me nearly give up. There are so many bugs too, such as not being able to pull yourself up on ledges, not being able to select boulders (a certain boss). The mouse is also broken, with some weird deceleration going on that I could never fix. Even getting it to work with a controller proved impossible.The game was also part of a story arc that will never be completed. Do yourself a favour, and play a finished game that isn't a buggy heap. I'm sure it would have been a good series of games if the dev's didn't go bust and had time to patch out all the bugs and oddities.5/10			"

												I cant put into words how much I love this game. I remember playing it when it first came out and loving every second of it. In my opinion, it has a great story that I wish could have been expanded on in its sequels had it not been cancelled. The controls may be a little wonky at first, with the scroll targetting being a little difficult at times, but overall, I don't believe it takes away from the game.			"

												I remember playing this game back on the original Xbox and the three things that stuck out that I remember was the story(Which is very good.), the music(Which is epic.) and that the game was very poorly optimized. While the PC version does run a heck of alot better than the Xbox one it doesn't hide the fact that the game is buggy and has random difficulty spikes. That said if you can tolerate it you will get a great story and a fun time when the game decides to co-operate.			"

												One of those games where it's ambition clearly outweighed it's quality. Majesco had big plans for this game back when it was originally coming out. Slated as part one of a new trilogy, A massive marketing campaign, A tie in comic series. And after all of that the game ended up tanking at retail. It was a game that aimed for the stars but ended up hitting the sun. But putting it's history aside it's a surprisingly entertaining game with some great production values (For It's time anyway), fun run and gun gameplay and a fantastic score by Tommy Tallarico which might be the only real memorable thing about this game. It's more of a curiosity than a hidden gem but fans of science fiction and obscure older games may find some fun with this.			"

												I loved this game when I was younger and was really looking forward to playing thru it again on pc but the control port does not support a xbox 360 controler. It does how ever support a logitech or 2 other types of gamepad which I'm sure were popular around the time this game was released. without the ability to use a xbox 360 controler I just won't have the time or the desire to play the game since If I played the entire game usiung a mouse and keyboard I would either end up with sore wrist or I would not be wanting to use a mouse and keyboard during the times that I need to use them.I simply am checking a no for my reccomendation since this is a game that really needs to be played on a gamepad and the only ones it supports are outdated.

												It's like Mass Effect and Halo had a baby with the intelligence of a duck.Fun game, cool mechanics, I liked the whole toggle between first person and third person, can be really difficult to control at times, graphics aren't the best (it is 11 years old though so I can't really critique), story-line has a lot of potential but there are some plot gaps. The biggest thing that turned me off to it were the glitches. Over all, 8/10			"

												Critical ErrorGeneral Protection Fault!- Game closedI almost liked this games, a few times. I love sci-fi, i love Orson Scott Card, but to recommend this would be to say it is ok to release games in this state. It's not.This game crashed in the high double digit number of times. At one point, it crashed multiple times at the end of a long checkpoint, making me nearly give up. There are so many bugs too, such as not being able to pull yourself up on ledges, not being able to select boulders (a certain boss). The mouse is also broken, with some weird deceleration going on that I could never fix. Even getting it to work with a controller proved impossible.The game was also part of a story arc that will never be completed. Do yourself a favour, and play a finished game that isn't a buggy heap. I'm sure it would have been a good series of games if the dev's didn't go bust and had time to patch out all the bugs and oddities.5/10			"

												We are all entitled games that suck but we still love despite their shortcomings. The story behind this game is unsurprisingly good, written by Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game). It was meant to be a trilogy but only got this first installment done due to issues the company had later on.I played this game for the story but I loved the combat system. It combines close combat, guns and magic in such a way that it is completely seemless. The targeting system is a bit troublesome at times.At the time of writing, the game is only 10 dollars and it is well worth it for a decent 20 hour story-based game.			"
