												It has a nice theme. The cutscenes are gorgeous. The concept is fresh. And the overall style is neat ... BUT ... : ...At first you'll have to play a level !!! E-X-A-C-T-L-Y !!! as it was thought up by the developer AND you will have to restart a level quite often just because those damn turrets sometimes simply don't shoot at the leading guy but keep changing firepower from enemy to enemy. What's worst about it: this behaviour is not foreseeable by the player. Sometimes the guns do their job well, some other time they totally ♥♥♥♥ up your defense.Now what's MOST ANNOYING is that the GUI doesn't securely get your mouseclicks. Sometimes you have to click 2 - 3 times before it's recognized. Naturally regarding the totally weird difficulty curve of this game this behaviour will have you to restart the levels quite often too.ON THE TOP OF IT: Each time you leave the game it produces a nice little memory leak which is absolute ridiculous for THE leading benchmark producer ... though I must assume I haven't gotten better experiences from their benchmark programs either ... and I've got  a quite decent setup ...Don't get me wrong. This game can be fun when it's played on easy difficulty but don't expect to reach any of the heigher achievements anywhere soon in this game. Look at the achievements stats and you can clearly see what I mean ...The good thing about this game is it's arcade mode which stands synonymously for freeplay and can be a lot of fun for a coffebreak or some ...Get this game only on a large discount and try the demo first!

												Unstoppable Gorg is a tower defense game of the sub-genre I call ""pointlessly manic"" -- to play it properly you must fail a level repeatedly while figuring out a sequence, and then click 8 billion times per round and hope against hope that something random doesn't get in the way of the exact movement/clicking sequence ""strategy"" that the hardest difficulty requires to 100%. Repeat until you beat... or in the case of this game, don't bother. Because it's not even worth it. The orbit gimmick is stupid and never should have left the drawing board. Forcing players to memorize sequences and deal with RNG on top of that nonsense (to say nothing of the glitches and gotchas that ruin round after round) is just lazy tower defense design and a luminary like Futuremark should be ashamed of themselves. With the gameplay removed this would be a great screensaver, but a great game it is not.I love tower defense games, but man do I hate tower defense games like Unstoppable Gorg. The music, art, and presentation are all top notch -- I especially love the bad sci-fi movietone reel feel. But the gameplay is just atrociously designed spew. Even many flash TDs and war3 maps were far better. Unstoppable Gorg isn't just a bad game, it's gameplay is actively annoying, irritating, and head shaking. Deleted.			"

												Unstoppable Gorg is a tower defense game with a twist: Your defense towers must be placed on concentric rings: you are placing defensive satellites in orbit around a planet. Once in place, you can swivel the rings to reposition your towers to face attackers from different directions.I loved Unstoppable Gorg's 50's sci-fi aesthetic, but I didn't really enjoy the gameplay as much as I thought I would. I would recommend this if you are a fan of tower defense games in need of a new challenge, but those new to the genre might prefer the more straightforward approach of a traditional tower defense game like Defense Grid.

												I'm a sucker for tower defense games, so I picked this up. Unstoppable Gorg puts a few new twists in the genre by allowing you to swing your entire defense row in a circle. There are 21 stages, 4 difficulty levels, most stages will be beaten within 10 minutes or so.I would have liked the ability to see the stats of my foes at a glance, and the ability to survey the map before I start the battle. The game gets annoyingly difficult quickly. I always feel like I'm under pressure, as enemies assault you within seconds of your establishing an economy.The cutscenes are fantastic, mimicking 50's science fiction films, complete with cheese. If anything, I played the game just to watch these, however short they were.Despite the amusing cutscenes (which can be watched on YouTube) , I am not recommending this game. It's short, kinda frustrating at times, and to me has little replay value. I had richer experiences with Flash TD games.EDIT: With the new reviews system, I changed the default thumbs up to a thumbs down.			"

												A silly tower defense game.  Fortunately, I happen to like silly tower defense games.It offers a decent variety of towers and enemies, always a key ingredient.  (Although I found some of the tower types more or less indispensable, and others pretty worthless.)  You get money from killing enemies, but also from building generators, so there is that tension between investing and beefing up your defenses.  Lastly, the game brings us something new: orbiting towers.  All your defenses must be placed at preset points in 2-4 rings surrounding your ship/station.  These rings are fixed in distance from the center, and the build points are fixed in distance from each other, but the entire ring can be rotated.  This lets you move your towers into position near the enemy's attack paths (highlighted by glowy dotted lines), or even follow a wave around to keep it in range longer.  Since the levels are in space, with no real 'terrain', this is a good way of doing things.One of the game's strongest points is actually not the system itself, but the whole aesthetic.  The entire thing, down to the last detail, is done over to look like a cheesy, low-budget, 40s/50s sci-fi movie/TV show.  The costumes in the live-action cutscenes, the flying saucer enemies, the robots that look like they were patched together from old car parts, the towers that look like they're made of cardboard and tinfoil, and the buttons & iconography on the menus all appear just like you'd expect them to.  I've never played a game that did something similar, and while I wouldn't want it to become a trend, it really works here.			"

												While fun at first, and made better by an interesting play mechanic, this game is frustrating to say the least (and not a in a buggy way, purely in terms of play).  I'm a huge fan tower defense in general but this game feels a little unbalanced and too hard to be accessible to the masses that I imagine they intended to sell this one to.For 99 cents or some other low sale, give it a try, but don't feel a need to pay retail for this one. It is largely disappointing...and did I say frustrating.			"

												A middling tower defense game. Has decent graphics and cool retro-futurism designs and cinematics. Its very original concept, a tactical perimeter based on satelites and orbits around a base or planet, is ruined by  emplacements restriction, the marching of foes timed to the second, and the random trayectories of asteroids that prevent get better classifications. Sometimes the weapons point to closer enemies instead of ones first of the row... Requires many patience and perseverance to pass levels at high difficultly with perfect stadistics. Worth with a great discount.			"

												An nice little tower defence game, seems fairly challanging. Not my favourite genre of game, so perhaps you should look elsewhere for a review of gameplay comparisons, but I can say I found them enjoyable. Being able to rotate the orbits of your defence buildings is an interesting mechanic, meaning the placement of your guns takes a little more spacial awareness than it would elsewhere. As far as I played, the maps seems smaller than other games, where you'd place less towers, but as you're expected to move them this is a good thing. Means you have to conisder your placements even more.Why I love this game is the style. Playing through the story you get 50's style info clips, with a perfectly done voice over, perfect cheesy style, film of bad alien costumes and spaceships hanging from wires, It's lovely, and fits so well. It even has a couple of easter eggs in the films, which was a nice touch. Anyone who has ever smiled at cheesy 1950s sci-fi stuff will enjoy these scenes. You couple that with a like of tower defence and spacial awareness puzzles and you should maybe buy this.			"

												Unstoppable Gorg is a unique, retro-styled approach to the Tower Defense genre and takes the whole gameplay into space. Instead of towers, you have a wide selection of satellites that you have to carefully place on one of the available orbits of the habitat that you have to defend.You have to constantly rotate the orbits to move your satellites towards your enemy's routes, which is also the biggest difference to other TD games where you simply place your towers and wait for the enemy waves to pass by. This is a cool twist as it can cause quite a few hectic moments, but involves the player a lot more into the actual gameplay.The story mode features a total of 21 levels and has some really cool cutscenes in between. Additionally there is a Challenge mode where you can replay all 21 levels with additional, pre-defined modifiers. Last but not least, there is also an Arcade mode, which is basically a survival mode where you fight endless waves of enemies for the highscore.Good stuff!			"

And the gameplay isn't the only awesome thing this game has to offer: the inter-mission cutscenes, stylized as humorous sci-fi movies from the first half of the previous century are brilliant and well-made.

												TL;DR summary: A tower-defense game with an interesting twist and a fun theme. Recommended if you can get it while it's on sale.This one was a pleasant surprise. I think everyone is sick of tower-defense games by now, but this one has a pretty interesting mechanic. You place your defense sattelites on building spots on orbits. Each orbit can be freely rotated, but only the entirety of the orbit can be moved. So you can click and drag your towers to make them follow the critters, but you run the risk of moving other towers on the same ring *away* from enemy paths. Similarly, you might end up moving support towers near enemies where they have no business being. So it's a bit more involved than just placing towers and clicking ""go"". So that's fun! The difficulty seems alright, too. I can generally make ""Moderate"" at first try. ""Hard"" and ""Unstoppable"", not so much. There are a few nuisances - like having to reassign Research Points at the start of *every* mission - but nothing too grating.The writing is pretty nice. Obviously, a game like this isn't going to have astonishing Deus Ex-esque plot - actually, the fact that there's a plot at all surprised me. It's deliberately patterned after horrible old sci-fi movies, which is nice if you like it. (I very much do!) If you don't, well, you can skip the cutscenes and you won't lose anything. So on the overall, I'd say this is well worth it, if you can get it for less than 10 dollars. A few things made me roll my eyes - really, you don't need to tell me five times about what enemies are vulnerable to - and obviously it's a bit rough around the edges, but nothing big. I could see this do nicely on mobile devices. How about an Android port?			"

												I absolutely LOVE this game -- it's probably my favorite indie title ever.  It has a goofy retro sense of humor which perhaps some younger gamers don't appreciate, so just to avoid any possible confusion: it is NOT trying to be serious.  Some folks complain that it's too hard for a ""casual"" game, but I didn't find that to be true at all.  True, I had to repeat some levels several times before I got through them -- but do you really want a game that you can beat in one sitting?  I think of each level as a puzzle that has to be solved rather than a simple anything-goes shoot 'em up.  Most of all I appreciate that this game has in abundance something that most are completely lacking: style.  I periodically return to play through the whole campaign just to experience that.  An unreserved thumbs up.			"

												This is a really nice Tower Defense game. It's pretty unique where you place your towers (actually Satellites) in concentric rings around whatever you're trying to protect. Most of the time the rings are moveable, allowing you to focus fire on an enemy by sliding the ring around, keeping your tower on them.It's got a decent steep difficulty so it's no walk in the park. The best part is the story. It's a campy 50's style with news feeds and breaking news, along with multiple aliens trying to wipe out earth. The production values, while cheap looking, actually are pretty cool in the detail presented. It has deep gameplay - with many modes and difficulty levels and challenges. High replay value Highly recommended if you like TD games.			"

												I love a good Tower Defense game, and i love all the innovative versions people come up with.But the sad fact is that this game didn't quite deliver. Well they delivers a whole lot, but the overall product isn't good enough. The pace, the difficulty, the upgrades, together they don't feel right. And a good feeling is the most important in a TD game, however vague i was in explaining what that feeling really is.But the developers should get credit for running with their idea all the way. I love the old black and white sci-fi feel to it. But even that feel forced since they have them before and after every mission. Half of that would have sufficed.Close, but no prize i'm afraid, as i had high hopes and really wanted this gem to have been more pristine.			"

												I recommend this game, but after changeing to the ""Easy"" in options... ""Normal"" is way too hard. And I finished many, many games, also tower defence.In general: Visulas and this great, super-funny (for me) retro-feeling is OK. But the game becomes way too difficult after a few missions. It's due to the complete lack of decent pause, or active pause. You also cannot look at the paths of your enemies at the begenning of the mission... Thus strategy and planning is quite difficult - when yor're playin on ""Normal"" difficulty. On ""Normal"" you have re-play missions for many, many times, losing any fun in it pretty soon....But when you change for ""Easy"" (and it's a must, belive me), game becomes ""Normal"" ;) It's a great relief, because it's worth it - to own it and to play it! So if  it's on sale, and you like tower defence games, just buy it. Quickly change difficulty level to ""Easy"" and have fun!			"

												Unstoppable Gorg is a charming tower defense title with, unfortunately, some flaws. Planet Earth is your base, and you can use orbits to place sattelites (which are your towers actually). It's just that it's very limited... since there are predetermined spots where you can place sattelites. When I bought this game I was initially thinking I would be able to place them anywhere on the orbit lines, but that's just not the case.Besides that, the game can get frustratingly hard, resulting in an aweful lot of replays.Now, the graphics do look good and the sounds get the job done as well. But it's nothing special really. The movies inbetween are kinda cool though, using real actors and stuff. But in the end it's all about the gameplay, and Unstoppable Gorg just isn't the tower defense title I hoped it would be. Still, you really can't go wrong with tower defense games, so if that's your genre I suggest you try it out anyway.[Rating: 63/100]			"

												Tower Defense in the form of Satellite Defense.  There is a high level of challenge in later missions, especially on the ""Unstoppable"" difficulty level.Many will appreciate the humorous cutscenes.  There are a few game modes - Story, Challenge and Arcade, so there's some decent gameplay hours if you want to finish the game.			"

												Pretty fun tower defense game.  The ability to move your defenses around being a nice twist.  Great 1950's schlock sci-fi theme with cheese ball short movies between levels.  (Yeah, the Roman numeral says 1914.)  Shortish story mode that doesn't over stay it's welcome and is relatively easy to beat on easy.  Also has challenge modes that are unlocked as well as an infinite wave arcade mode.  Not as polished or as in depth as Defense Grid, but still a great game over all.			"

												Unstoppable Gorg feels like an average run-of-the-mill tower defense game. There are various orbits to place towers around whatever base you are trying to protect for a given mission, but there are only certain spots in each orbit where it is allowed. The key is that once towers are placed, you can rotate the orbits effectively moving your towers to defend different lines of attack. There are a handful of different alien types, about 20 different tower types, and basic damage upgrades to those towers.The hardest part in the game that I found was generating enough income to purchase towers plus the story is pretty comical making this a game hard to take seriously.

												Pretty generic. There is no sound effect for turrets firing and the music ♥♥♥♥ing blows hard. And it's one of these types of games: if you do not play EXACTLY as the developer intended, you lose. You have to deploy the turrets and stations that the developers want you to set down in the order that they want. There is zero freedom to have fun and play how you want. You have to play how they want you to play and follow a predetermined pattern to win a level because if you don't deploy exactly the right turrets in exactly the right amount of time, you lose. What a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ lousy tower defense game.			"

												Get ready to experience a revolution in tower defense that will send you spinning. Unstoppable Gorg challenges you to defend the solar system from fearsome aliens by sending satellites into orbit. Unlike other tower defense games, in Unstoppable Gorg you can move your towers by rotating the orbits that surround planets, moons and space stations.Unstoppable Gorg is a lovingly crafted homage to vintage sci-fi films from the 1950s. Flying saucers, rubbery aliens, dodgy effects, it's got it all. The game's story scenes were shot on film using models, miniatures and live action actors and then edited together with genuine archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of this world.

												A tower defense game where you need to reposition your towers (which are satellites) by shifting them forward or backward in orbit to protect your objective. The gameplay is a bit more active than a typical TD. The FutureMark guys made this, so as you might expect, it's a good looking game. Unstoppable Gorg is not well-known, but I remembered and liked it enough to give it a positive review years after playing it.The cutscenes are hilarious, by the way.

												An interesting spin on the tower defense genre; Unstoppable Gorg takes the preset ""trenches"" that enemies travel through and allows you move your towers around them in orbit. Instead of places your towers and not needing to worry about them outside of upgrading or possibly selling them later for one that's more efficient, a lot of times you need to travel along the paths the enemies follow to get more damage done or set up towers in better ways based on how you can move them around in orbit. I powered through on Unstoppable difficulty in about 6 hours (with guides - the game doesn't really allow for experimentation on higher difficulties; it seems as though there's one strategy per level on hard/unstoppable that will work and nothing else).Long story short, if you like tower defense games but are looking something a little different with some challenging later stages, I'd highly recommend picking it up.

												Unstoppable Gorg is nice to look at - the cheesy sci-fi movie style is unique and fun. The game's premise may sound pretty cool - tower defense with changing enemy paths and rotatable rings of satellite towers.But in practice, the orbit system is just a tedious chore. Most levels have a strict solution you can only figure out with dull trial and error. There's very little room for experimentation or choice.And it's hard to tell what each tower is good for, which results in more annoying fumbling.This is not a very fun game. If you love bad sci-fi, are good at multitasking and don't mind repetition, you might enjoy it. Otherwise I can't recommend it.			"

												Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by.  They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun ""Super Hexagon"" way.  Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah.  The worst kind of time sink...Unstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial.  It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way.  Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists.  There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.Ok, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good.  It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick.  It does a phenomenal job of it too.  All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off.  The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be.   One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking ""War Rocket Ajax"".. *cough*.. I mean ""Invincible"" :) .. about 40 years too early, :)Unlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final ""death scene"", each level begins and ends with a ""Galaxy News"" transmission.  . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced.  Right up to the end, the game feels ""fleshed out"", there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.The game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes.  As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial.   The ""orbital slots"" are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time.  Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.  There are only 22 ""single player"" levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something.  The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of.  Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you.  I never found much use for the ""sweeper"" or the ""webber"", they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it.  Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better!  I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.One strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites.  Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves.  Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up.  So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too.  The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies.  It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much.  I quite like it.  It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).Don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games.  It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.I do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.

At the Time of WritingGame: Unstoppable GorgPrice: $9.99*Genre: tower defenceTime Played: 16 hours**Personal Enjoyment Rating: ☺☺☺☻☻GeneralTower defence is pretty much my favourite genre of game, and although this one won't be making my top favourite TD game list, I found it to be perfectly enjoyable. It certainly held my interest long enough for me to complete the game.Although it doesn't offer the sort of playtime that Defense Grid does, I found it a nice change to have a game that is a full meal rather than an uneatable feast. I love to have uneatable feasts, but there is something to be said about having a satisfyingly full meal which comes to an end.GameplayYour standard tower defence concept of waves of enemies which you must stop otherwise you lose the level. Build different towers which have different stats (range, damage, damage type, expense) and upgrade them.I like it when tower defence games bring in a slightly different twist and then also execute it fairly well. Not some silly bit of fluff that doesn't change the game in any way. Unstoppable Gorg has you place your towers in set locations, however they are generally on moveable rings which allow you to position your towers as needed. You can even click and drag to slowly keep your beefed up tower in range of the enemy for as long as possible.This ring mechanic is very interesting, and although some levels take it a little further - by either making a ring spin continuously or locking the ring from being moved - I felt that this concept could have been developed a lot more. If it had been, and to the point that it required you to do some real strategising in order to win the level, then this game would have got four happiness out of me.Speaking of strategy, I should talk about the difficulty level of this game. There have been other reviews which say that the difficulty is much too hard. This was actually something which prompted me to purchase the game, but I was disappointed on that score. The four difficulty levels are: easy, moderate, hard, unstoppable. I did not find that there was a very noticeable difference between moderate and unstoppable, which was odd. I'm afraid that as a long-time fangirl of tower defence games I'm probably reasonably good at them, but when the unstoppable difficulty never posed much of a challenge for me (except for just one level out of 21***) I'm really not convinced that this game is very hard.ControlsNice and simple. One can use just the mouse, but the game also has things linked to hotkeys. Each tower type relates the the number keys, and you can toggle the speed of the game between fast and normal with the spacebar with esc essentially being your pause button.StorylineI find it funny that this game does try to provide a storyline. I know that I don't ""get"" this sort of humour at all, but I do recognise that they put quite a lot of effort and work into the little movie clips.Before and after each level, you get a short B-movie style clip. They make me think of Star Trek Voyager (Captain Proton) and Thunderbirds. It's an extremely basic, banal storyline, but it is entertaining to see all the custom spaceship models they created, the ""special effects"" and the silly costumes.One thing I really wish they'd done was to include some sort of 'click to continue' button for the clips, because some of them were essentially newspaper articles and there was no where near enough time for my dyslexic self to read them. I wasn't desperate enough to read them to go to the lengths of snapping a screenshot.SoundRather one dimensional I thought. There are pretty much two tunes (maybe three, I wasn't counting) and they get played over and over and over again. Although I didn't find it annoying, I certainly didn't find the music to be very engaging.There is one sound effect which is relevant to gameplay - the sound of a tower that's about to explode. GraphicsEnjoyable enough a look. I can't say that the graphics are ground breaking, or that they particularly help to create an exciting new visual universe to immerse yourself in. The visuals let you know what sort of tower you're looking at, what sort of enemy is coming your way, and the path that the enemies will take.However, I will say that there were a couple of rather enjoyable ""bases"" to defend, in the form of the moon, and planet earth.Pros+ different ""moving ring"" mechanic+ silly B-movie style clips+ fully consumable length of gameCons- not very challenging- silly B-movie style clipsHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you.

												For me Unstoppable Gorg falls into the Tower Defense genre, and promised something new and fresh with the system of ""orbital"" towers.The game offers you to approach each mission with the difficulty level of your choice (I rarely went beyond the first two levels, among four) ; and once you've finished them, you are awarded medals depending on your efficiency in different fields - like Anomaly Warzone Earth does - plus Science Bonus to spend into your towers to level them up before battle.Different enemies and towers are introduced all along the storyline, so each mission feels like novel. In spite of these nice elements, the game puzzled me to the point of giving up. I expected some level of careful planning for both the tower type and placement but the later missions mostly felt like unforgiving. Any wrong choice could sentence the planet you're trying to protect to a general abduction -  even if you can reposition you towers at frantic speed.Even if I was initially enticed by the idea of orbital towers, the game felt like too hard to beat even in easy mode. Eventually this drained the potential fun out of it so I never finished it. Sadly, I cannot recommend it.			"

												well, i finally got around to playing Unstoppable Gorg after it's been sitting in my backlog for ages. as TD games go, it has an interesting concept but that's really all i can say in it's favour.graphics: the animation scenes are nice but the gameplay graphics looked blurry and pixelated on a large screen. i think the game might have been developed with smaller screens in mind.gameplay: interesting concept as i stated before but it has several implementation issues that makes the game feel clunky.towers: i didn't explore all the towers but from the ones i did unlock the timing, target aquisition, and target locking seem to be wonky. the towers don't stay on an enemy until destruction but seem to bounce around based on angle and time to reposition, not a bad idea, but not implemented well.destructable towers: one of the few TD games that i've played that have this mechanic and i can't say that i'm a fan.so, to sum up, cutscenes are nicely done and gameplay concept is interesting but actual game is unpolished in my opinion.

												I'm not a typical fan of tower defense. I hoped the corny scifi theme of this game and the orbit-based tower locations would prove engaging, but this has turned out to be even more tedious for me then most tower defense. The difficulty is either higher then normal or too demanding in terms of what the developer expects from you. I never felt like I had room to experiment in a map without failing and starting over a few times. If you approach tower-defense as a special kind of puzzle this might make sense, but I don't find the puzzle of Gorg to be at all fun and thus I've grown too frustrated to bother continuing.			"

Production value is really high, and the gameplay is fun if you like tower defense games.  Where's the sequel and why did it take four years to hear about it?!  Make another one and market it!

												Tower Defence games have so far passed me completely by.  They just don't seem all that interesting, an exercise in game over.. again.. game over.. again.. etc.. but not in the fun ""Super Hexagon"" way.  Setting all those towers, and then failing at the very end, when the very last minion makes it past your last carefully-laid planned route, and deals the death strike that spells a do-over.. Gah.  The worst kind of time sink...Unstoppable Gorg attempts to shake the tower-defence up a bit.. The levels are short, the number of towers small, and their placement is quite crucial.  It also adds an interesting twist: You can spin the towers around to face enemies coming from a different way.  Like Space Run, Unstoppable Gorg takes the Tower Defence idea and adds in a few little twists.  There's just enough here to make it stand out a little from the crowd.Ok, game mechanics to one side, the rest of the game is pretty good.  It draws heavily from 1950's Sci-Fi imagery and schtick.  It does a phenomenal job of it too.  All the painstaking hours of cutting footage and re-creating that wobbly-saucer-on-a-string feeling really pays off.  The storyline is as cringe-inducingly 50s as it can be.   One thing which made me giggle was the brief appearance of a few 10-Base-T BNC terminators acting as the engine pods on a very dated-looking ""War Rocket Ajax"".. *cough*.. I mean ""Invincible"" :) .. about 40 years too early, :)Unlike some games which seem to peter out in the FMV in later levels, and just give text or voice instructions (low budget maybe?) only to spring back to FMV for the final ""death scene"", each level begins and ends with a ""Galaxy News"" transmission.  . Each one is lush, well filmed and voiced.  Right up to the end, the game feels ""fleshed out"", there are no 'thin' parts, if you see what I mean.The game plays very well at lower difficulties: the placement and timing of the 'towers', erm, I mean satellites, doesn't matter too much. You can get away with making mistakes.  As you get to higher difficulties, however, the fun starts to turn to the usual Tower Defence Grind Syndrome: placement and timing are crucial.   The ""orbital slots"" are very carefully placed by the level designers, and it requires the right satellite, with the right level of upgrade placed in the right order, and the slots have to be spun into the right position at the right time.  Getting a level finished can require playing it repeatedly over and over and over until the placement and spinning becomes muscle-memory.  There are only 22 ""single player"" levels, so even grinding won't make the game stretch to the buttock-achingly 400+ hours you get out of Skyrim or something.  The levels come with research and a selection of satellites that you can select a subset of.  Most levels obviate the satellite choice, and some leave it a little open for you.  I never found much use for the ""sweeper"" or the ""webber"", they just seemed to take up a slot and not do enough to justify it.  Replacing them with a missile or ray gun would do far far better!  I'd increase their range and effectiveness a tad.One strategy which I totally missed through my first playthrough was selling satellites.  Enemies come in waves, and I'd build my satellites to eventually counter all the waves.  Once I realised that selling satelites and reconfiguring for a next (more powerful) wave was an option, a whole new avenue of play opened up.  So, as you can see, there's quite a lot of replay value too.  The game invites you to try to get better, and beat it on harder levels with better strategies.  It's not punitive, and doesn't rub your face in defeat too much.  I quite like it.  It's a friendly-feeling game, which you can pick up, play, and put down.. or stare-at for hours-on-end (as I did).Don't recommend it to anyone who doesn't like a bit of rinse-repeat gameplay that typifies these sorts of games.  It's better than most, though. It can make you scream when, after a long battle, you see you lost two medals because you lost 1% of your ship's complement to a stray asteroid some time while distracted killing the mothership.I do wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who has a laptop and sometimes just has a spare few hours (on a train, in an airport, or lying in bed waiting for sleep to kick in), and wants to have a bit of retro-movie fun, and doesn't mind a bit of action/puzzle.

												What little I've seen I like quite a bit. The developer( s ) have put a bit of time into the game itself in addition to the load screens and story.Tower defense with wandering lanes, limited positions to place defenses / research / money satellites with the ability to move them on the fly. The wandering lanes occur between waves and sometimes more than 1 will be active at a time.I haven't spotted many bugs so far, unless you count being able to instantly move satellites around and when you buy one and move the orbit and set another ( at the original spawn location ) both satellites are forever linked together ( this may be intentional so you need to be happy with the offset you place the satellite otherwise you can't change it ) [ or 3 satellites... ]...There is a proper sound / music slider ( independent ) in addition to other options: Visual quality ( slider; several selections ), resolution, full-screen ( toggle ), subtitles ( toggle ), language ( toggle between English and German ).The bad: The game wasn't developed with dynamic resolution in mind; if you play in windowed borderless using a thirdparty software, the rescaling of the window will render correctly but your clicks will be off by x percent... To fix: Use the render-area size to determine click event locations; the rendering is fine just click-events are off...I'd say it is worth the price at $5-10; if you can get it on sale or in a bundle then great. Otherwise it'll still be worth the asking price.			"

												A very interesting take on the Tower Defense genre.  I found the rotating rings to provide an action like quality to the game.  It'll keep you on your toes until you perfected your builds for each challenge.  Aside from that the game has a beautiful retro sci-fi aesthedic that carries from the in-game elements to some very well (bad? lol) done B-movies style cut scenes to propel the story forward.  This game is well worth a try!			"

												I can't recommend this game unfortunately.It has some novel game design ideas and the art style is fantastic 50s classic sifi. Unfortunately the levels are basically puzzles where you have to figure out exactly what combination of units you are expected to buy and deploy. Stray from the ""correct"" formula and the levels are pretty much impossible to win.This takes all the creativity and tactical freedom out of the game which makes it go very boring very fast.			"
