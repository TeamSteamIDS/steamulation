!! This review will be deleted after revision is made !!Luxor 5th Passage. The fifth game in the Luxor series. A match-3 marble shooter set on another adventure through Egypt.The main objective is to stop the evil deity Set from taking over the united lands while fighting alongside his nephew Horus. Throughout the game, you must create matches of three or more colored spheres and prevent the scarabs from entering your pyramid. Unlike the other games in the series, this one features Blast Mode and Player's ChoiceMy opinions of it all: To some players of Steam, this review may seem a bit misleading. Recommend watching some gameplay of this game before purchasing. The writer of this review is not responsible for any disappointment upon this game's purchase.The GoodBefore Steam, I used to play simple games such as this one and didn't really complain too much about the repetiton the game had. Another interest was the [Egyptian] mythology that grabbed my attention. Though small, the soundtrack was very fitting, and the power-ups were lovely whenever collected, especially the four new ones exclusive to this very game: Black Hole, Double Shooter, Lead Barrage, Spiker.The BadAt some point in the game as I neared the end, one particular power-up seemed to bug or glitch, malfunction upon collection: Sorter. If the stage was cleared and this was collected, Luxor 5 would instantly crash. Restarting the game, it was obvious that the progress wasn't saved, leaving me to start over. Sorter also didn't exactly work as intended, having all the spheres pushed by the scarab closest to the pyramid vanish from the screen and never reappeared organized by color.OverallThis was, yet, another awesome game in the Luxor series. I managed to complete the game all the way in a few hours, but time doesn't matter all that much to me. Again, this writer is not responsible for any disappointment receive upon the purchase of this very game. You have been warned.--Hermix			"

												A fun match three game, but not as good as Luxor 2 HD. I would recommend Luxor 2 HD before this game.			"

												Luxor 5th passage is a Zuma game by Mumbo Jumbo that is a quite enjoyable title.  Fullscreen mode is supported, although the screen is stretched from a fairly low resolution window, but unfortunately the Steam Overlay is not supported.  The game features a wide variety of detailed scenario backdrops and ball paths, as well as a nice selection of power ups, extra point gems and coins and end level achievement trophies that are in game only. Altogether this is one of the better casual puzzle games on the market and I would recommend it to anyone interested in a solid casual challenge.			"

												I enjoyed playing this game, but recent troubles with a virus that had infected my machine throughout were traced back to this game. DO NOT BUY - The troubles and subsequent cost far out weigh purchase.			"

												Luxor is BACK! In it's incredible new fifth installment it's back with more ball matching, matching and precision ball shooting that ever before. Like Egypt? You will like enjoy matching balls upon ancient pharaoahs and anubis... will yout fight back seth's hoard or will you succomb to the tide of orb? only with bravery can you face the sphere			"

												Just one big reason why I have to NOT recommend this game.The screen resolution.800 x 600 ONLY!!What the hell do they think we use for monitors here in the 21st century?? Even when I had old CRT monitors I would of been ticked off with this game! But to sell a game in this resolution is a joke. As far as I know, there is nothing that you can do regarding some sort of widescreen hack etc, like you can with some older games.The game itself, playablity wise, MAY be okay. But to be honest, I just can't bring myself to play Luxor with oval shaped stretched balls coming down the screen.Just glad I didn't pay much for this one. :( "

												Don't get me wrong with the negative review, this game is very good. Fun power ups, easy to learn, good gameplay.However, theres issues with the game that makes it unplayable. Sometimes I encounter a bug that renders the shooter unable to make the balls hit the target. I can shoot anywhere, it never registers. The resolution on the game is also painfully small for someone with a wide screen. 800 texture on a 1900 monitor just doesn't work and playing it in windowed mode makes the game screen too tiny.
