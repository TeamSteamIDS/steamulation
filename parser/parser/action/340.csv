												It was basically a short mission containing new graphics. I honestly thought this was going to be,""explore"" the lighthouse and town that would take hours, i was disapointed when i found out you can do this under 15-40 min. The graphics were good though. I reccomend this if you want to see a new tpye of grapics or whatever, but people, IT IS NOT A GAME.			"

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is some kind of show-case made by Valve to introduce their new High Dynamic Range method of applying light inside the Source Engine. Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).After playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years -  I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows. At the same time, it also made me a bit sad, because, well, how long has it been since we got the latest Half-Life content? Oh well, who knows....Since this one comes for free in the Orange Box and the Half Life 2-complete package, I guess most of you who played Half-Life 2 at some point, have this in your game collection. If you haven't tried it yet, by all means do so, but be advised: it's very good, but also very short ;-).Overall rating: 8/10			"

 My Review :Rate : 10/10Lost Coast is a small technology demo showing off the Source engine's HDR rendering capabilities and it is an additional map originally planned as a section of the chapter Highway 17 of Half-Life 2, but was dropped. Only download this if you like Half Life or Source Engine or waiting for Half Life 3.  This game (or demo) is included with the purchase of Half-Life 2. Game doesn't cost $39.99 USD, ""Half-Life Complete"" does!			"

												One of the most inspiring, most enlightening games of it's time. After finishing this game for the first time, I had to go back and play it several more times. In fact, I replayed this over 70 times and I still wasn't able to fully soak the story of the lone fisherman and his quest to help the protagonist Grodan Friedman and his trusty companion, the crowbar. I spent many hours up at night just trying to fathom what exactly went through the mind of Friedman as he traversed through the barren landscape of Highway 17. Don't even get me started on how much the High Dynamic Range adds to the whole game. Seriously. I mean, you couldn't get anymore detail and lighting even if you went outside, took a rocket to the surface of the sun, and stood there even though you'd be burning up. Overall, I give this game 8.76 times the square root of pi out of ten. Plus, you get more Garry's Mod Props. Awesome, right?			"

												Although it's a damn short game, only clocking in at around 30 minutes to 1 hour at the most, I was really interested to know how the process of developing a game was like. To do that, you need to turn commentary on. This commentary came straight from the developers from Valve, like Gary McTaggart, Robin Walker, and Chris Green. After playing and listen to what they had to say, I understood the process of making a game a little bit more. As far as graphics and level design go, I would give it an A.			"

												This is not a game. This was orginially a demo for Half-Life 2 and the Source Engine. Now for some FAQ:""Is it good?"" Sorta""WTF! IT IS 39.99 FOR A DEMOZ!!!! VALVE SCAM!?"" Click the name and look at the page*.""Why don't they sell this speratly so I can see if I like Half-life 2?"" I really don't know.This game, because it is a demo, shows you all of the cool things that the engine can do in-game. I like this more because it seems to be filled with action (also not repetitive). It is a good time killer for only 15-30 mins. I give it a 7.5/10.* If you type in ""Lost Coast"" the price will be shown as 39.99. If you press on the tile-thing and look the the page for it, it will only be able to be sold with the bundle, that is why it is that much.			"

												This really isn't much of a game, but more of a tech demo for the technical geeks. This little gem includes most elements found in its complete game, Half-Life 2. Originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter of Half-Life 2, this unused concept was scrapped, possibly due to time constraints or maybe based upon the fact that this game is a prototype all on its own.This demo details various visual and graphic capabilities that are found in that said complete game. All the while, this ''game'' just shows how immensely strong the Source engine is, considering it was pretty new for its time back in 2004, and how it would become the most essential game engine to date, what with various Valve and 3rd party games being built on top of this incredible engine. The most clear concept that is shown off is the high dynamic range lightning that is now most commonly used in nearly all of Valve's games. There isn't much of a story or a narrative in this demo, you're none other than Gordon Freeman, who is stranded on a lost coastal cliff, (The clue is in the title.) that you must climb up to destroy a Combine artillery launcher in a monastery, which is rebelling and attacking a nearby town. Though this is just one massive chunk of a technological demonstration, it has several story elements that didn't make the cut in the final game. As a result, this level received a good response from the community, as if the fans haven't been missing anything at all.While I would say, this game is very interesting if you love to dig down and unearth various unused game content and maybe discover a little of the history that had been closed.

Good, old memories...So one day, after school, I met with a friend at my home. We were both very young back then. I just got my first PC, but only played a few browser games on it. My friend however knew this one program which I thought would be illegal at first called ""Steam"". The dark design of it and the fear of the unknown made me feel like a hacker. The reason why he forced me to download it and create a new account was a special sale, where AMD graphic-card-users would get some games for free. These games were Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. Lost Coast was my first First-Person-Shooter. After we killed every enemy and annihilated the chopper, tried every path, spammed ""E"" at every door in hope that we could open it, we gave up. We played a whole 2 hours (!) without knowing that it is just a showcase of the beautiful Half-Life-engine. But it was great. And it felt great. The scenery was beautiful and we both knew that we would get killed if our parents would find out. Actually, I believe that the fact that we played it secretely made it even more exciting. To hide Steam and both of these brutal amok-games from my father, who checked my Computer from time to time to install security-updates, I created several sub-folders in folders, all with unique categories about ""Pokemon"" yes, I played Pokemon a lot back then :D. I will never forget the day I started PC-gaming, nor my first FPS-experience. This day will be in my memory for all time. And no, I did not run amok a single time. At least not in real-life :PEdit: I played the game on another account though.			"

It has a nice atmosphere and well made effects (for 2005).At the start of the demo, it feels like you're taking a little vacation from the main story of Half-Life 2.

												Lost Coast is a short showcase of the new power of the Source Engine after its upgrade in FY 2006. It introduces High Dynamic Range lighting and features a chapter which was cut from Half-Life 2, which takes place immediately after Highway 17. It only lasts a few minutes of gameplay, but it's worth playing right after you finished Half-Life 2.			"

 The Story Some people might be asking “Atratzu, why are you reviewing this? It's not even a full game, it's a demo”. My answer is... I dunno It's a game in my library and I want to review every game I've played.There's not much to the story, you meet an old man (the fisherman) who takes you up a flight of stairs to unlock a gate to let you up to the chapel. Then you get ambushed by the Combine and need to demonstrate the amazing Half-Life 2 source engine to those jerks and kick their butts.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was used as a “Technology demonstration” showing the graphics, style, lightning, combat, and generally demonstrating the Source Engine in Half-Life 2. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was developed by Valve the same time that Half-Life 2 was being developed, Lost Coast was released on steam in 2005. Gameplay 	Keep in mind that this game came out in 2005. Today and in the future a Technical demo like this might seem silly, but at the time it was dazzling 3D graphics to onlookers.The controls are the same as Half-Life 2... First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.Actually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.Conclusion	To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17). The Gameplay was identical to Half-Life 2 because it was basically a town in Half-Life. The Achievements were non-existent.

First person view, different types of weapons can be found and switched between using the scroll wheel or 1-2-3-4-5-etc, pew pew.Achievements: This game has the hardest achievements out of any video game I've ever played. They're broken down into one category: unforgivingly difficult. Beat the whole game in extreme-FUBAR-murder-death-mode. Play for 1,000 hours. Reach notorious hidden objectives, slay the hidden spider queen, and many more.Actually, there aren't any achievements in the game.Price: Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is priced at $39.99, for the stand alone game, it's crazy, isn't it? Imagine how much fun you could have with a game from 2005 for $39.99? I think that's a solid price, I think Valve could get away with charging an extra hundred dollars for the game and it would still be worth it.Actually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the “Buy Half-Life Complete”.Conclusion: To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17).

												This game had been sitting in my library for years, and I finally gave it a try today. Well, this isn't really a game. It's a tech demo. You see, you play through a small section that was cut from Half Life 2, and you can enable the commentary of people who work at Valve. It's pretty much a short museum tour with a guide. I mean, I really love museums myself, and I really enjoy learning stuff about game development, so I liked this. Sadly, it's quite short, it will probably take less than 20 minutes to complete. But damn, even for a 2005 game, the graphics are still quite decent, and they don't look horribly dated like some stuff from that era. Plus, Gaben talks to you.			"

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a short map placed in the Half-Life universe. Even though it got cut from the final game, it still offers a good short story, like a small chapter of Gordon's journey.The graphics are stunning, making full use of the Source engine's HDR, and the map design is really good as well. The final moments give a true sense of the ""calm before the storm"".Highly recommendable, and, in fact, I'd suggest you, imaginary gamer reading this review, to play it every time you feel like replaying the HL franchise. In my personal canon, the events of this game actually take place between the events of Half-Life 2 and Episode One, while Gordon is supposedly beneath all that rubble.			"

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a very short tech demo where the developpers of the source engine talk about their work. Originally, it was part of the Half-Life 2 campaign, but was cut in the end.+ Lord Gaben greets you+ There is some shooting+ Interesting cliff map+ Makes you think about what if this map wasn't cut- Cringy old man...I'm glad he was cut.- It's very short and can be played through in about 10-30min. Depends if you are interested into the audio messages of the developpers.- Tech demo onlyI'd recommend playing Lost Coast if you are interested into the source engine or if you want to see about this mysterious Lost Coast map that was cut from Half-Life 2. If your interests don't meet these conditions, don't touch Lost Coast.Replay value: NoneRating: NoneRecommendation: It depends			"

Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a short and brief tech demonstration showcasing the new mechanics and posibilities of the Source Engine used in Half-Life 2 itself, as well as giving you a brief introduction of what the core game itself is like. The segment used here was originally planned to be a part of the original game but was ultimately cut and used as the demo for the game instead, it's short and sweet, a nice and effective demo.			"

												This is obviously quite excellent, because it's a...well, I guess by modern Steam standards it would be called a Half-Life 2 ""DLC"", though ""playable technology showcase"" also seems to cover it quite well.     It's not a game in itself, it's a brief but enjoyable scenario/side-quest set in the Half-Life universe.  Made by Valve.  So obviously excellent, but I wouldn't exactly go buying a $40 pack for this and this alone if you already own all or most of the other stuff in it.  But if you got Lost Coast for free, as I believe I did, then there's truly nothing to complain about, is there?     On the other hand, if you're the ""independently wealthy"" type, $40 might be the equivalent of a piece of chewing gum in the back pocket of us lesser plebs, so you may as well just spend that much on a 30-minute ""game"" irrespective.  Or you could be more generous and give it to the derelict currently rifling through the trash can on your footpath, if you're that filthy stinkin' rich.     OH LORD HELP ME, WHY AM I EVEN BOTHERING TO WRITE THESE WORDS?  I think I may have an addiction to game reviewing, this is my second one tonight...Verdict: 9/10 (as long as you didn't pay anything for it).			"

 Half-Life 2: Lost Coast As the Steam Store page mentions, LC is a tech demo that was originally planned as a section of the Highway 17 chapter in HL2. It is a free download and is automatically added to your Steam Library when you purchase a copy of HL2.The demo is very short and you can probably rush through it in under 30 minutes. You have access to all of the weapons from the original game to fight your way up a cliff side and retake an ancient church which the Combine have garrisoned into an artillery platform.The main purpose of the demo was to showcase Valve’s new HDR (High Dynamic Range) lighting and demonstrate how it integrates with the Source engine. Despite being released in 2005, the results still look relatively impressive today. Highlights include how light reflects on water and wet terrain, and how it refracts through glass. There is also an interesting section where HDR tries to imitate the iris of a human eye by using light blooms when the player is suddenly exposed to daylight after being in shadow.Additionally, LC introduces a commentary mode to the HL series. In this mode, audio nodes can be found which play a track recorded by various members of the development staff. These nodes provide some insightful commentary if you are at all interested in the development process, or if you simply want to get a little more replay value.There are some rough edges in the demo; I encountered some graphical flickering and occasions where the enemy AI would not respond as cleanly as in the original game. Despite this, LC is a beautifully presented and swift diversion that can easily be included in your play through of the HL2 series.			"

												This is the absolute greatest game ever made. It is a brilliant expansion to the critically acclaimed Half-Life 2, and adds bucket-loads of exclusive new content: New character, an intriguing plot, improved graphics, and a guest appearence by Gabe Newell himself. It is truely a masterpeice. 10/10 You've done it again Valve.			"

												More than a game, this is a technical demo for the use of HDR in the Source engine. It was to be part of the campaign's original Half-Life 2 but the cut for this reason. It is still quite entertaining this map, with about 30 minutes, maintaining good quality (even no dialogue) and variety. Turn opens the way comments, where developers can discuss changes and game details. A fun, free cut-content map from Half-Life 2. Great voice acting work, fun gameplay. There's not a lot I can say about it.			"

												Ten dollars. Only a few hours of gameplay. 16-bit graphics compared to the flashy 1080p stuff in standard games.But... wow Half-Life 2: Lost Coast blew me away. It doesn't need flashy graphics or even fanservice to falsify its enjoyment. It just does things right, and boy that was one immensely enjoyable experience.I think most of the magic of this game comes from knowing absolutely nothing about it. I got this game from a friend and just decided to play it since it looked very interesting and it was getting good responses. So I went in completely blind, knowing nothing but the game's name. And I'm glad I did, because everything the game presented to me was unexpected, notably dark in places, and very emotional, which would have been lost entirely if i watched someone else play it. So, if you happened to have been flooded by everything Half-Life 2: Lost Coast on tumblr (god help us) and the entire story's already laid out for you, the magic has been lost and the game won't be as incredible of an experience. I'm sorry.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast's ability to completely turn the tables of its story depending on your actions is massive. Upon your game's startup, every little thing you do will be set in stone in the game's story pathing. If you're the type who immerses yourself into the game's charming music, laughs at the childish but hiliarious anctics, and is willing to hork down healing items just to prevent yourself from killing a monster just because a fight is difficult, the game rewards you. It opens up a very character-developing and world-unfolding story, along with some of the most emotionally invested boss battles I have ever experienced. You know a game is good when it breaks the fourth wall so well that you're shaking in your seat in true fear and can't stop the shivers, all while having to fight a hopelessly overpowered god of a boss. The amazing writing only starts once you beat the final few bosses, and the story doesn't stop being good from there onwards.On the other hand, what makes this game different is that it keeps its dark side from you, and its entirely your choice to experience it. If you scoff at the game's sparing choice since you're too cool or grown up to possibly be nice to people, you can go around and intentionally sink your weapon into a monster who just wants to be a friend. And unlike many other games, this isn't just a simple ""Oops, I killed another unnamed enemy, let's reset the game and nothing changes"" moment... the weight of a dark choice is huge. It forever changes your playthrough. Reset the game, and the characters know. Events change. And with each curious kill, you, in turn, turn from the only human in a land of monsters into the biggest monster in a land of innocents. In the end, ignoring what Half-Life 2: Lost Coast sets out to do, which is to let you experience childlike innocence and fun, only makes it delibrately change the game into a quieter, more grim story. Very little character development, and the world isn't explained to you, nothing. There's very little reward for going through this route. Yet it is a choice you can do. Granted, you get two of the hardest boss battles by becoming the murderer and will be forced into Game Overs repeatedly from them, but even that is a message from the game... It's trying to stop you from getting to the end of this route. Before its too late.It's as if you're doing deeds in an actual living, breathing world. And that's what makes it even more terrifying when you decide to become a murderer instead of a savior, because only you know that you're willingly going forward to obliterate every weakling in front of you. It's a test of your willpower, and it's your choice. The worst thing? The damage cannot be repaired. Go clean, or go home tainted. The game even gives you the choice to completely delete everyone's happiness after the most satisfying happy ending. The happiness you worked so hard to earn. And you can even become the murderer after saving the world, which will only permanently taint your game and never let you have a satisfying ending again. That's absolutely brutal, and yet that's still a choice. Amazing.Yes, this game might not be for everyone. The humour may become dry after a while for some people, and tons of gamers nowadays like to bash at popular games instead of trying it out, just because they feel accomplished by doing it. But, if like me, you are willing to experience why everyone's been talking about this game, give it a shot. This game does the morality concept so well that other games can only dream of doing the same, and it is one not to be forgotten.It is a sin to call Half-Life 2: Lost Coast a game. Doing that would categorize Half-Life 2: Lost Coast into the bland and consequence-free ""kill-em-all"" genres that a lot of games are falling into now.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast a story-driven, emotional experience.

												UhNot too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes insteadIngredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												the graphics in this game are the best I have ever seen. It is beautiful in every way and if its graphics were combined with a good story it would be extremely immersive. It made me feel like I was the character. The weapon draw time is perfect and it looks as if youre actually taking a gun out from its sling. The gun mechanics are perfected without a flaw, when you are either shooting or reloading, its movement and sound are as convincing as a real gun. And the lighting and reflection make it seem as if it were real life. I would not recommend spending the $40 as its more of a demomstration and explanation of HDR rather than a story. But if its on sale i would highly recommend purchasing it because it will be very enjoyable and will definetely spark a conversation.			"

The commentary is great throughout, providing interesting insight into the game developing process, as well as HDR.It'll only take you about 15-20 minutes to complete if you take the time to listen to commentary and admire the surroundings, and nothing is particularly difficult, but it does show some fun gameplay with combine soldiers on a cliffside.All in all, if you bought Half-Life complete and are wondering if you want to play this, go ahead and do it!

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is an amazing game , its a short game to show the dynamic feature of the source engine .Its not only short but great , fast and you need to use your brain sometime.But mainly this game is the most unplayed game on steam , i was like whaaat ? are you serious , ok i  accept the fact that its a short game and you need half life complete to get it no other way, but still who dont like half life ? Everyone love it so please install the game beacuse i know you have the game in you library its only 400 mb thats nothing :) I hope you enjoy my review , i  enjoyed the game even only for 0.2 hours  Pros:-Story-Fisherman-Boss Battle -All weapons- its half life duuhCons: -You need Half Life Complete to play it grab it now its only 9,24 euro - Too much ennemy and i would like to admire the little village			"

												It's a neat tech-demo with a cool HL2 level to boot. I recommend playing with HDR and commentary enabled. It has the usual Half-Life 2 gameplay though it is quite short. The environment looks great.Listening to Valve devs talk about engine and game development is surprisingly interesting.If I were to give a negative, the difficulty is kinda all over the place. The first ṕart (in the cliffside) has quite a bit of difficulty, but every thing after that is kinda easy. The game defaults to Easy difficulty but the difficulty fluctuation makes it quite hard to recommend something in particular.As far as wasting your time goes, you could be doing worse.			"

												Lost coast isn't something big, or another one of Valve's materpeices, it's just a stump. It's just ONE map with ONE goal, but in that short period of time, it is one hell of a fight against the combine, and an introduction to new Source things (have you seen the details they put into this game?). Some could even call it a minigame. In short, it's just something to pass the time in Gordon Freeman's world.#Half-LifeFTW			"

												Short but beautiful. The HDR graphics as well as the setting of the game makes this a very important part in Valve's history and in gaming as well. The music that plays in the church not only makes the scene look very alive, but makes you think back on Half Life's history, remembering the impact and memories you've had since it all started.

												This is one of the few short games I happen to enjoy. The game is fast-paced, unrelenting, and quite a fun experience. It plays rather smooth, even on potato-PCs (Thanks to the Source Engine), making it even more enjoyable and fluid. My only real complaint is the amount of ""game time"" this game has. It admittedly feels more like a short mission in the actual HL2 game than a standalone title. I understand it's supposed to be a tech showcase, but I think there could be more added. Other than that, the game is a fun and fast paced experience that I think you'll enjoy just like how I did. "

												I guess Lost Coast is a cut episode (or something like that) that was suppose to be in Half-Life 2 but was removed. Not sure why but it was interesting. Sadly it was WAY too short, but i guess theres a reason to this. I can recommend it, but its not really necessary to get it unless you want to and at this point its only available through packages so if you got most of the valve games (especially the trilogy of Half Life 2) you would probably throw possibly around $30 down the drain just for this (depends which package you are buying from). The challenge is fairly good, so if you are that kind of person then go for it.			"

Reason being, it used HDR lighting and that is a feature of the Source engine that HL2 didn't use at all. People were upset by that but hey, here it is now. It's fun, beat it in 19 minutes but it came with my HL2 purchase here on Steam. It wasn't advertised with it but it was included. It's nice to see, the HDR, but it's not a must own.			"

												Very good graphics, good story, but i don't know if i would buy it for this price.The graphics and lighting are amazing, but still, $40 for this one level? Not really worth it.It's not a game or anything, more like a level. If you just absolutely Had to have it, i would recommend buying the Half-Life Complete pack so you don't spend as much money on this, well, 'level'.Btw, when I get bored, I play this.			"

												Half-Life 2: Lost CoastAlthough this isnt really a game, this really shows us what the Source engine can do. I think the Source engine is an on point engine to make games with. Anyways, lets get to what this game/level is about. I can see that this level/game is not linked to the Half-Life which is fine by me. What I find alot about this, is that there is a great amount of puzzles to solve to finish the level, which I find quiet difficult, but at the same time, quiet good. I really like the end of the level, shooting down an enemy helicopter, now thats a good ening to a level! ;)Valve, please keep making more games. Also what I recommend doing is that if you ever are gonna make Half-Life 3, you should release a tech demo, so you can show us what its like, but try not spoil the story, if there is one, of course.9/10			"

												Hello Fellow Physicists,Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is a great level. I won't even call it a game because it's just supposed to be a small portion in Half-Life 2, but it was a cut level. It exhibits some of the greatest graphics of the time that it was released which were absolutely stunning. I strongly recommend trying the game because this is a game that matters. It's a game that exhibits some of the newest graphics of its time! I love seeing things that truly mattered back then, like the water or the atmosphere. I love the game, it's a great level, I would have rather actually seen it in the real game, though! Definitely worth the money to play an extra level of the incredible series!-Kyle James			"

												TIME TO COMPLETE: 0.5 hoursAlthough HDR updates have been an integral part of Half-Life 2 and its episodes, Lost Coast offers an interesting outlook on what decisions Valve had to make and their attempts at improving it.Now I strongly advise you to not watch the ""Video Test"" before playing it as it's just a stroll around the level and will simply spoil everything for ya.It is worth a shot (expect short, interesting encounters) but not worth buying Half-Life 2 for the sake of giving it a try. If you already have a copy of the game, then give it a go.			"

												Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was supposed to be for Highway 17. Personally I don't know why they removed it. The puzzle solving in this is very true to regular Half-Life, (No duh) and for once you can kill the helicopter. The lighting is very nice and shows the true potential of the source engine, and quite honestly, the overall campaign (if you can call it that) wasn't half bad. (No pun intended) Overall, very nice if you want to get a bit more out of Half-Life. Final Score: 9/10			"

												A free addition to owners of Half-Life 2: The Lost Coast is more of a hardware test and interactive commentary rather than a game (or a mod, for that matter).Not much I can say about it really. It's common knowledge that the Lost Coast is actually a level cut from the original iteration of HL2 set to take place between the ""Highway 17"" and ""Sandtraps"" levels. But if you have Half-Life 2, take a look at it. Play through both the actual level and the commentary and you'll be pleasantly surprised.Plus, hey! Free Gmod content, whats not to like?			"

												Half-life 2: lost coast is an expansion to Half-life 2 that is a side story at one point in the game. Lost coast is by far the shortest Half-life expansion to date, a 15 minute game overall. The good part is when you buy Half-life 2 it comes with this game, So if you want to play a Half-life expanion and have beaten Half-life 2, Check out Episode 1 & 2, This expansion comes free when you buy Half-life 2.

												This review will be incredibly short as this is only one mission and it's incredibly short, so let's get straight into it.Half Life 2: Lost Coast is a cut section of the highway 17 chapter in the original Half Life 2 where you are taken to a city St.Olga where you are tasked to take down a combine artillery launcher who is shooting down headcrabs into the town.As stated before it's incredibly short. It took me 10 minutes to finish the entire chapter and it's still incredibly fun. The reason this was released was to showcase the incredible range rendering and the new feature which was implemented into future valve games, the commentary mode. Since you get this for free if you own Half Life 2 I see no reason not to check it out. It's still Half Life and it's still great. Final Rating:7/10 - Play It If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked the review post in the comments on what you disliked.

												This is a tech demo of sorts to show off new gaming technology (at the time). It's short. There's boats and a fisherman and then some stuff happens but it's all easily forgettable.

												First thing i wanna say: Remember in the original Half life 2, (you know the original not episodes 1 or 2) in the 1 part where the residence was bringing youre buggy, (along with you in it) while hanging from a magnetic crane, this ""lost coast chapter"", was originally supposed to happen in a blackout or something in the middle of that chapter. Thats why its only about 20 minutes long, because its a lost chapter. Pretty good gameplay, with some guns along the progress of the chapter. I also just wanna thank Valve for putting this lost chapter on steam. :)8.5/10			"

												This is a Tech Demo Game of the classic Valve first person shooter single person campaign. You don't need it , it was not part of the original Half-Life 2 story.  It was given out free in certain bundles.  Has developer commentary mode.The extra short story of Gordon Freeman. Exploreable environments and useable / moveable objects, voiceover actors with alternate conversations. Is linear but you can explore alittle of each map. Autosave works good. Has a Short story.

												Hmm. Given you can't get this on it's own, I'm not even sure what the point of a review is. But here goes:Created to show off the Source Engine's recently added HDR lighting features, Lost Coast is a chapter that originally would have taken place during the coastal section of Half Life 2. It's short, but very pretty, and well designed with a couple of good puzzles and some strategic gun fights.I'm surprised they haven't just edited it back into Half-Life 2 and made it part of the game..... there are fan patches that do that, but I could never get them to work.

												This one is difficult. It is a technology demo for High Dynamic Range Rendering in the Source engine, set in the level supposed to take place after Highway 17 in Half Life 2. Even though the Source engine is falling behind compared to other engines nowadays, this game still looks great, and the added graphical effects make all areas express more detail. Aside from the technical stuff, everything else is the same as Half Life 2 in terms of how it works. I wont spoil anything.Now, because it is only a technology demo, it is only about half an hour long, and there isn't much to do afterwards. Oh well. Not sure why it has such a high price individually, though is harmless on collections like the Orange Box. If you want to get it, get the Orange Box, as it comes with the other Half Life 2 games. Overall, it is effectively a small part of Half Life 2 with better visuals. I'm not going to give a rating, ill let my words speak for themselves.			"

Thumbs up because it's part of the HL2 storyline.=============================Played on ""The Beast""i7-3970x, 64GB RAM, 2x GTX 770s 4GB VRAM, WinXP x64 Pro, 4x SSDs, 2x HDDs, Rampage IV Extreme, X-Fi Titanium Fatal1ty Pro, custom water loop, 2x BD-drives, TJ07-BW, 850W PSU, and many fans!

												As of this moment, I have not yet beaten Half-Life 2. However, it came with this little gem that I like to call Lost Coast.The main game itself is great, but for an absolutly free DLC, this game is pretty sweet. The level is pretty well designed, and even though it's really short, only took me 19 minutes, it was still really fun. Plus the little boss battle at the end is real satisfying, knowing how many times I died to that helicopter in the canal in the main game.9/10			"

												Considering that there are only two ways to get this single-level game worth a maximum of an hours gameplay, those being through the Steam NVIDIA offer, and buying the Valve Complete Pack, you could think of this game as a collectible.

												lost coast only came out bundled with half life 2 ... or at least i hoped it did. the point is it was ""GONNA""  be wait for it HALF LIFE 3!!!! but became a 15 min long dlc. it is fun for a sort time and then it becomes a on trail fps. it gets pretty anoying when you had to kill some dudes in the pump building thing while you wait for a guy next to you to break open a door. the thing ends with going back from where you came from making it POINT LESS.                                                                                                   PLAY BACKthis is worth nothing it comes with half life 2 and it has one charter from the game that can only be downloaded thought this dlc. why do i say downloaded well if you have GARRYS MOD then it might be worth a dam... well you will need half life 2 so ya. you can play it agin with some comments around you .... how ever, most of the time a guy or pack of dudes will come and destory the comment they'er gun fire noise will overlay the comments and make that point less its worth like 10 bucks and it is with half life 2 so i say ........

												Sooo, Lost Coast is a not really a game, its more of a tech review demo for Half-Life 2.There is really no plot, you just climb a hill, killing some Combine soldiers and solving an easy puzzle. Over the level you find developer commentary speech bubbles and that's basically the most important part of the game, the devs talk about the development of HL2.The main goal of Lost Coast is to show High-Dynamic range rendering or something of the sort, I guess they were really proud of that so yeah.Well, since this game can only be purchased in a pack, I cannot recommend paying 28 euros for a tech demo. If you are buying any of the packs, the full games will be your interest, not this, unless you is mental.			"

												Lost Coast.What a fun, short experience.Or was it?!!?!??!Did you ever notice the Illuminati watching you the whole time?No?That is because you weren't looking for it.See, to find it follow these instructions perfectly.1)As soon as you have control of the Freeman, Turn around and take 47 steps forward.2)Walk left until you run into something.3)Next, find the box that when broke open, drops only ammo.4)If you get ammo, then turn around and listen to the nodes in this order,...3,7,1,2,6,4,6,5,6...5)After that is complete, simply carry on with the level.6)That is, until the helicopter fight.7)During the fight, after hitting 2 of the 3 shots you need to hit, jump off the cliff and hit the final rocket. Aim for the water.8)If you die even though you hit the water, you succeeded.9)Now beat the boss, go to the area under the fight and use the elevator to get down.10)Now, before the man finishes talking, kill yourself above him, any way works.11)By doing this, you skrew up the dialogue, as you are not supposed to be able to die.12){FINAL STEP} This will accidentally trigger 4 seconds of dialogue that features 2 men talking about their masters and moreI don't want to spoil the rest, so...Go have fun, it took me 27 tries			"

												Good, but not worth 39 dollars. I only got this because I bought HL2 when all of the games in the series were on sale, and since Half-life: Complete costs 9.99 at that time, it gave me Lost Coast. Let me tell you why the game isn't worth it:Only 1 chapter, with one map. That's less then Half-life 2. The only objective is to take out a gunship, and it's easy as ♥♥♥♥, and barely any Combine soldiers try to stop you. The map is short and only takes a few minutes to beat, while actual chapters in Half-life 2 take about a half hour, or sometimes a full hour. (Unless your playing the beginning chapters.)Valve, you could've done so much better. Though i'm not saying it's bad. Just not worth the money. Valve, lower the price, and I'll recommend this game.

Why is he helping this random stranger that could be a combine spy, he's an old guy, in plane site, where the combine could shoot him down... And last, if Freeman really got knocked out and tossed to the end of the coast, how dose he still have his suit!?I mean I know he had his suit the rest of the games but COME ON! He's lost at sea, he woke up on a pile of rocks with a bunch of broken boats, and he still has his suit... His suit would have pealed off and shorted out but the time he got there...			"

												Well... lets see... Hmm... let's think really hard. What are the good things about Half Life 2: Lost Coast? Well... I don't have any idea. It's as simple as that. Nothing.                                          --------Ask yourself this. Would you buy a game where you get stuck on a stupid little part about 11 minutes into the game where a bridge always breaks after a combine breaks it? No. Exactly. That is why it comes free with Half Life 2. There's no point in those people on forums that say ""Bwagghhh I bought HL2 So i could get lost coast troloolo lawlz"", it doesn't make any sense. Wait, woah woah, you've never heard of those people? Exactly, there is no people like that. Please, do not waste your time on lost coast. Play HL2 and have fun.			"

												And you thought Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes was overpriced...Its summer, sales are going on. Half-Life series goes on a flash sale. I buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes for a total of around siz bucks. I go to my library to see something odd. Three other games I have no record of purchasing.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is more of a sightseeing tour than an actual Half-Life game. The game is supposed to take place sometime during the ""Highway 17"" chapter of Half-Life 2, but it really dosnt fit in.Half-Life 2: Lost Coast introduces nothing new to the series, exept a heavily modified Source Engine. The water is more reflective and Gordon's pupils ajust to lighting. Thats it.The game looks more like Counter-Strike: Source that Half-Life 2.Standalone, you pay $50 for a 10 minute experience. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes is $30 for the main 2 hour mission, plus side missions. Half-Life 2: Lost Coast has one mission, and one mission only. Do NOT buy this as a stand-alone game. Buy Half-Life 2 and both episodes (if you havnt already) and you will get this for free. You will also get Half-Life Deathmatch: Source and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch. Three free games for the price of one and two expantions? Thats a good deal.Half-Life 2:Lost Coast isnt a bad game, its just unfairly priced. If anything, it should be free.2/10			"

												First of all, I love every single half-life game that was ever made, except this one. The only reason why I'm giving this a bad review is because it costs $40 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars for a simple tech demo! You can beat this in about 15 minutes but all this is that valve is just simply showing off some new tech they got their hands on, that is it. There is no story, and from what I have heard this is one of the most un-touched games in steam. You can get it if you like, but you also get it for free if you buy half-life 2 episode one (Or one of the half-life games). So do not get this unless you want to just sit there listening to the programers jabber on and on about how minor things wil improve the game by a lot.			"

												I came into this knowing well that it would not be a full game, but merely a demo. However, I'm still greately dissatisfied. While my computer is not quite top of the line and quite a large step from it, I am able to play Episode 2(which honestly has much better lighting than this and wasn't realeased all that long after this) at between 30-60fps on maximum graphical settings. I got no higher than 40fps and it dropped as low as 15fps at times on this. I wonder if it might be poorly optimized, considering so little gameplay exists in a ""game"" that is so large in size. It's roughly a quarter the size of Half Life 2 itself.(half life 1 is close in size to this, I haven't even finished it and I'm more than 3 hours in if I remember correctly!) I have, and this is for apparently 30-40 minutes of gameplay. I'm glad this only cost me a few extra bucks from my buying the Orange Box, I'd be infuriated beyond levels describable if I had to pay $30+ for basically a graphical demo.			"

												Eh, it's alright. I expected at least a little bit more. Perhaps a quest through the town, or exploring around a bit, but there's really not much here. It's like looking at the deleted scenes of a movie: you get some good things at the sacrifice of a plot. There's litterally not much to do in this game. In fact, it's much like a demo version of Half-Life 2. Easy to beat, gives you a taste of action and not too much to think about. Most of all, it leaves you wondering where the rest of the plot went, which then would influence people to buy the game. Hence why I think it should be a free demo. Overall, 8 out of 10 as a demo, 2 out of 10 as a game.			"

												It's a very short tech demo showing off some of the features of Source Engine. Worth getting along with something else, if you can, but not worth purchasing for itself. As it can only be had via Packs (at least at the time of writing), weigh the pack purchase based off of the other games you're currently lacking - if there's some that warrant picking up the whole pack? Sure. You get this along with it.But if you just don't have this and a couple other things you don't necessarily want/need? Don't bother.			"

												It's meh, mission was kind of confusing because it didn't show a clear way to actually get up the mountain, it has maybe a 1 hour gameplay, and I personally believe that this was probably made for nvidia users only (pardon my ignorance if it was probably mentioned) because the world was broken to hell, I almost didn't finish it because I couldn't even see the helicopter.4/10 starsAlso, to everyone saying ""this wasn't worth ten dollars"" or ♥♥♥♥ like that, keep in mind that you get Lost Coast when you purchased Half Life 2 (recommended), you don't really have to download it if you don't want to, this was just a mission to show off some fancy shmancy lighting and graphics, I played it out of sheer curiosity, and the map is available on Garry's mod if you have both Lost Coast and Garry's mod if you just want to see the map to know what I mean aboutit being broken.That's all			"

												The horror of Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 begins and ends with a hallway. Down its dark length lurks walking robot animals out to kill me, and I’m only armed with a goofy bear mask and a flashlight. If I light up the hallway, I’m treated to snapshots of terror: toothy jaws hanging open at weird angles, outstretched arms of patchy fur and gut-like cables, and eyes with a pinhole-sized glow staring right back at me. The hallway is a funnel of fear.I peered down that hallway a lot during my roughly six hours playing Freddy’s 2, sole developer Scott Cawthon’s followup to his first spooky suit stalker simulator released in early August. Cawthon didn't wait long to leverage word-of-mouth popularity and YouTube celebrities’ horrified faces with a sequel that further establishes his skills at crafting a truly frightening experience.What I wanted from a Five Nights sequel was more mind games and more uncertainty. I wanted the plodding animatronic suits to find me and rip my face off in new and interesting ways. I wanted working legs. What I got was a horror game dipping heavily into deception and subtlety, a wonderfully cruel cocktail of supernatural mystery and jolts of panicked adrenaline. Enjoying the good parts, though, comes with a cost of a frustratingly steep difficulty.Once again, I’ve made the questionable career move of taking the overnight security shift at a children’s pizzeria for a measly pay rate. Strange Things occur among the tiled corridors and empty dining rooms at night, and staying alive entails warding off walking murderous animatronic animals by tracking their movements through grainy camera feeds.I’m still rooted in place with no degree of movement beyond swiveling my head left or right; a slight disappointment to my hopes of freely wandering around. The first game used that restriction as an added layer of stress, and that’s effective enough the second time around, but the novelty feels a little worn now. Freddy’s world is interesting enough that I want to explore it. I wouldn’t mind poking around a corrupted version of Chuck E. Cheese’s.			"

												Hi, this is Gabe Newell, and welcome to the Lost Coast. In this tour, we're going talking about a new graphics technology we've been developing, called High Dynamic, Ranged Lighting, to HDR. We'll also be giving you some insight into the design and production challenges during the construction of the Lost Coast. First, a quick explanation of the commentary system. To listen to a commentary node, put your crosshair over the floating commentary symbol and press the +USE key. To stop the commentary, put your crosshair over the commentary node and press your +USE key again. Some commentary nodes may take control of the game for the purpose of showing something to you. In these cases, simply pressing your +USE key will stop the commentary. "

												This game is like the quiet kid everyone makes fun of that always sits alone at lunch.What I mean is, if you ask someone what their favorite Half life game is, they will never mention lost coast. They probably won't even know that is a thing.			"

												What is this crap?  Developer commentry saying how water look pretty but when I go 3 metres above sea level I see wave slashing on skybox.Final developer commentary say they make more like this but I see no other Day of Defeat: Lost Coast.  This is a waste of precious Afghani broadband, my affendi.  This idea clearly from era when George Bush was declaring war on the nation of Terroristan.  Even my camel laugh, and he laugh at no joke.  NO JOKE!			"

												Downvoted only due to the following:The practice of paying for mods is antithetical to the nature of the modding community; an optional ""DONATION"" button is not (Just like on the Nexus http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/? ). Was a fun game, The fact that Valve is doing this and that Bethesda is endorsing it and they both taking the largest share of the modders' work is American Corporate greed at it's finest.Take something artistic and done for the love of the subject matter, monetize it, then allow the accountants to define art as widgets, and then creativity is now run by the mercantile class, the middle men, who are ""America Corporates"".If they had any integrity and decency, any moneys brought in, at the very least, should be 100% donated to charities on behalf off the modding community in conjunction with Valve or Bethesda or whomever. See Gaben, you don't need the cash grab, you can win by getting good press which in the long run would do better for you to show you are not like EA et al.			"

												The game is rediciously priced, costing $40 for just a game about Gordon Freeman washed up on the coast, while a fisherman says the Combine took over the island, and Gordon goes on a mission to go and defeat them. The storyline is cliche, the enemies are way too overused (a little too much blue Combine soldiers). But the graphics pay off a little of these problems, but overall the game is really crappy, and I don't recommend to buy it. Unless if you're willing to mod it or in for the graphics.Also, it takes 10 minutes to complete. 10 MINUTES!!!!			"

												Half-Life 2 Lost Coast is a tech demo to show of Source's HDR lighting and it uses a level that was removed from the Half-Life 2 campaign.As you travel through this level you encounter various objects and sceneries that come with a little narrated explanation from Gabe Newell and his goons.It's a tech demo, and not a very good one at that. If you want to test your system, go get 3DMark. If you want to learn about the making of Half-Life 2, go google it. And if you want to hear Gabe Newell's voice I am sure there are places that can help you with that too, also you might need to see a medical professional about that.			"

												I'm so sad that I had to put this in the negative comments. I bought Half-Life 2 and it came with Half-Life 2 Lost Coast so I thought that this game would be good... it was so short and I had no idea what was happening. I believe that it takes place after Half-Life 2 but it just made no sense to make this game. Again I'm really sad that I had to post a negative comment on this.			"

												Ok lets start with what this game is! Well this game is a overly rushed game that disappointed me when i played! I dont even know what in the heck is going on because all you start off with is some guy approaching you with a boat! Then the combine comes and screws everything up! I got done with this game in less then 20 minutes! Thats how bloody short it is! Really Valve? You could have done better then this...			"

												First off this game does not show case new ""graphics"" very well the only improved graphical feature is the lighting effects. Secondly this was first $20.00 it is now 39.99 WHY? this is not even a game and it also sucks at showing you how they made half life 2. Hint this game is the same price has the half life complete pack and it also comes with half life 2 stay foar away from half life lost coast  I blame GABEN!!			"

												Okay we all know any Half Life game is awesome (execpt for the one on PS2) but there is only 1 minor setback it's just too short i thought it might take an hour or two to beat butit takes like 20 or 30 minutes and that's a little bit sad			"

												A short, extra level for HL2, this game takes place in a beach, where we fought Combine soliders and a helicopter at the end. My favorite part of this particular deleted stage is that we can easily throw enemies down the cliff into the water, which is ultimately satisfying. This game would be better if it was longer, with perhaps the addition of aquatic enemies, such as the Ichtyosaur.			"
