												When I got this for Christmas in 1999 along with Half-Life, I didn't even know what it was. When I got home two days later and installed it, my family wouldnt have access to our computer again. I used to trade off every 5 deaths or 20 kills with my little brother until the late hours of the night. When I would get in trouble, TFC would be taken away, and I would have to go outside and play. I can still remember my best friends names, though I doubt they still play it. I can even still remember my favorite medic. I remember mulching until I could finally kick the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of anyone (this was before stat tracking, though I would assume the hours would be in the thousands.) VIP, Climb, and Jump maps were perfect to kill time and be silly with all your friends. Though I havent played since TF2 came out, I miss this game more than anything ever. Definitely the fondest memory I have as a child. This game made me fall in love with Sierra (VALVE), and to know what real FPS's should be like. I have purchased this game three times after the initial gift, to install on friends and girlfriends computers so that I could play at their houses. Buy this even if it's just to have it in your collection and you never play it. At least you can say that you have it and pretend that you are OG. I love you TFC.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is not at all what I was expecting when I launched it for the first time. I went in assuming I was going to be playing an old school downgrade of Team Fortress 2. I was wrong, TFC is in its own rights a completely different game at first glance. The story, the graphics, and even the controls feel different, but if you play it long enough you will come to find that the game is Team Fortress at its core. The game itself has all the Team Fortress 2 ""DNA"" in there you just dont quite see it at first. If you play a while you will not only feel the Team Fortress-ness in the game (its the original Team Fortress so obviously) But you will get to see where the masterpiece that is Team Fortress 2 comes from, you get to see its ""roots"" so to speak. That in and of itself should be reason enough to play, but If I have not convinced you yet here is another reason, the best reason to play as a matter of fact. Team Fortress Classic is fun!			"

												Team Fortress Classic has nothing to do with Team Fortress 2. They are completely different games with different mechanics, although the classes seem similar.General:-TFC has grenades.-Classes also have armor.-Health Pool is different.-Bhop is possible.-While in TF2, the best gamemodes are Control Points, King of the Hill and Payload, in TFC it is actually Capture the Flag.Scout:-In TFC, he is used for his speed to cap the flag, rarely fights.-No double jump. Concussion grenades are used and they are way more powerful.-No Scattergun, has only a weak shotgun and a Nailgun used against sentries.Soldier:-Soldier has normal grenades and nail grenades - which shoot nails in 360 degrees and deal damage.-Has a normal weak shotgun and a more powerful one.Pyro:-No airblast.-Flamethrower deals damage depending on the amount of armor the victim has.-Has an Incendiary Cannon which acts as a Rocket Launcher, but sets enemies on fire.-Has normal grenades and Napalm grenades - which set enemies on fire.Demoman:-No Stickybomb Launcher, replaced by the Pipebomb Launcher. Pipebombs don't stick to surface.-The Grenade and Pipebomb Launcher share the same ammo pool.-Has a single-barrel shotgun.-Has a detpack which has the ability to clear obstacles and open new entrances.-Has normal grenades and MIRV ones - they split into smaller grenades which explode.Heavy:-Has 2 shotguns.-Also has MIRV grenades.Engineer:-Cannot pick-up buildings.-Has powerful EMP grenades which blow up the enemy's ammo and cause damage.Medic:-Medic is also used for capping flags because of his speed and concussion jumping ability, but is more powerful than Scout.-Can infect classes with his medpack.-No Medigun therefore no Ubercharge.-His super nailgun is good against sentry guns.Sniper:-Basically TF2 sniper with the Classic and grenades.Spy:-Has a Tranquilizer Gun.-Has a shotgun.-Can feign death. -Has Hallucination Grenades.Civillian is the last class which is used in special gamemodes.Teams are pit against each other where Red uses defensive classes to protect their flag from Blue, which use mainly Scouts and Medics to capture it.The community is very small and there are only a couple of servers at a time, but the game is a classic and I recommend it.

												A great underrated classic that still has populated servers 24/7. (You can check for players with the in-game server list, bots won't be shown.) TFC offers one-of-a-kind exciting fast paced gameplay with tons of tactics and ways of playing the game. Easy to get into and enjoy, hard to master. However, you're bound to have fun along the way.Despite old age, the game has a timeless design with a completely customizable appearance; you can choose from many custom models, sprites, skins, textures etc. There are active community servers hosting many of thousands of custom maps total with official game modes like; Capture The Flag, Control point, Attack/Defend, Escort, Deathmatch as well as custom ones like King of the Hill, Hold or Score Ball etc.If you're interested in skill jumping (with weapons) there are servers hosting maps made for conc-, grenade-, rocket- and pipe jumping. There are also a lot of movement skill maps where you can climb, bunnyhop, strafe, surf, ramp slide and even water glide (shark) on a few servers. Or if you just want to play some random fun maps and mess around, there's escape, puzzle, hide & seek, sniping, role-play, secret hunting, low gravity and so on. As for mods, there's NeoTF (which gives you extra abilities and buildables), AdminOP (Ent Mod, Radio Mod, Hook Mod) and others.It's not just one of, but The most popular online multiplayer game of all back in 1999 before CS took the crown. Nowadays, there are barely any FPS games that don't get boring after a few hours. TFC will have you keep coming back for more, time and time again. Without relying on achievements or item drops.			"

												13 Years later still the ONLY FPS game on PC that I can actually play for more than 5 mins at a time.  In fact I can play for days at a time.  The speed, control, strategy and overal logic this game uses is pure beauty.  Although it blatantly breaks nearly every realistic law of physics known to man kind, it still easily trumps all of the zombie filled, fantasy land, role-playing nonsense this next generation has grown to obsess over.  It makes no sense how fun and enjoyable this game STILL is, regardless of it being ''dead'' and bereft of nearly all organized play (outside off all of the low-lifes wasting everyones time using Perfect Player packages in the pickups ofc).  You may need to be born before 1990 or so to truly grasp the awesomeness of this game, but if you do, kudos and thank you for playing.  Nuff said.rufi0			"

												It's painful for me to not recommend this game because TFC is without question one of my favorite games of all time. I've played the game for thousands of hours and in hundreds of clan matches of all skill levels, but today there's virtually no servers left, and of those that are remaining, most are filled with lousy bots most the time.If you are lucky enough to find real players, the majority of them playing today are experienced, and trust me- if you're brand new to the game, they'll absolutely crush you. I don't care how good you think you are at other FPS games, they'll run circles around you :) There's just a lot of skills to learn in TFC, and it takes most people years to become a decent player.5-10 years ago I would recommend this game hands down. It is in my opinion one of the greatest multiplayer FPS games of all time. Sadly it's just too dead now for me to recommend.Edit: Some people keep mentioning that it says I only have 6 hours in the game. I can assure you that I have thousands of hours, some before Steam started keeping track, and even more before Steam even existed. This was back when you connected through WON to play the game. Trust me, I know TFC. :)			"

												I bought this game in 1999 and it changed my life.  I never liked first person shooters so much but this thing was sheer genius.  I flunked out of law school because of this game.  It was worth it, though.  That law school was awful and I never would have found a job as a lawyer graduating from that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ law school.  So in that sense, this game really saved me.  I played it loads.Then TF2 came out.  I was skeptical but TF2 really is a superior game.  Since 1999 the only games I've played on a regular basis have been Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2.  Of course I don't play Team Fortress Classic anymore but it was great for it's time.

												I saw this game a while back when my dad played it a lot and got to try it but i got my♥♥♥♥♥rekt too hard. It's hard to find players for it these days, but when you do it gets pretty fun. It takes a bit to get used to the game, especially if you're coming down from Team Fortress 2 to try this out. Conc jumping is one of the coolest things about this game among other stuff.*9000 RANDOM EXPLOSION NOISES GOING ON FOR LIKE 8 HOURS AND SOME GUY SCREAMING ""EXCUSE ME, I NEED SOME MEDICAL ATTENTION""*Find a group for it on Steam like the TFC Revivers or something and jump in.

												Let me be honest right up front. This is for new and potentially new players. Vets of the game already know why TFC is still for sale, and not F2P like it's ""decendent"". TFC is a game I've been playing for over 15 years. It is, without a doubt, the most FUN game in my library. You have the same 9 classes as TF2, however, with many differences. The Spy can't turn invisible, but can ""feign death"". Be careful with this ability, as it's not impossible to spot a Spy trying to pull their tricks.Grenades! TFC has grenades, and lots of them! Every class(except Sniper) has a class specific secondary grenade. All classes(except Scout) have your normal issue ""Frag"" grenade. Using these grenades can help you either kill an enemy, or assist your movements. When you first begin playing, you WILL get your butt handed to you. A lot. This is normal, and all TFC players have been through it. Don't let that deter you. The game engine has lots of nuances for you to learn, but it takes time. Really, it takes lots of time to learn, but many players are willing to teach you. All you have to do is ask. You may encounter players who have forgotten what it's like to be new to the game. Ignore them, or mute them. I may not be the best TFC player around, but I'm a team player, and I don't mind teaching what I know. Feel free to friend me, and just ask.Don't expect ""Hats"". TFC is a game where tactics and skill are utilized, we don't need no stinking Hats. ;)Edit: One more thing I'd like to add...While I'm not the best player ever at the game, I do know lots of tricks, and skills. If anyone would like me to teach  you some of what I know, feel free to add me as a friend on Steam, and just ask. New players will keep this game alive for another 17 years, and if I can help you along to enjoy the game more, I'm quite happy to help.			"

It hasn't aged the greatest, though.Story: Doesn't need one.Graphics: Quite good for 1999, Actually. The textures are bland, but quite detailed for when this was made. Gameplay: It appears TF2 significantly streamlined the experince. The gameplay isn't bad at all, but it's very unintivutive.Grenades: It has. Overall. you have to appreciate it as a product of it's time. I would give it a 8/10.			"

												You must try this game, who knows, maybe you will like it.The game mechanics are somewhat different from the ones used by TF2, and I could explain most of them:And yes, I will try to compare this game's features with TF2's, assuming that most players are now coming from it.Control point mapsIn control point maps, instead of staying on a capture point until it gets claimed, you have to bring a flag on it. While this doesn't support much the teamwork strategy because everyone is like ""The flag is now mine, I am going to cap"",  some people play the right way and let the scout do the job while they offer covering fire.However, some maps like Dustbowl on the first stage are messed up, the RED team camping near the grenade backpack and spamming all the way until the round ends.Capture the flagSame as you can see in TF2, that's how CTF acted in all team fortress stages, excepting that, unlike TF2, the place where you have to bring the flag is different from the place the enemy can find your flag, making this a bit confusing for new players.Even in this moment I bring the enemy flag to my team's flag in 2fort.EscortA great gamemode, that in TF2 got brutally converted into payload. (there where alot of reasons I will explain later)In this gamemode you will have to escort (AKA help a a guy reach a place alive) a class called ""Civillian"" (yes, TFC  has 10 classes).The civillian features low stats, having only 50 health points, no armor, grenades or weapons other than an umbrella, which is a crowbar reskin.There are 3 teams:The escort- only the civillian available. Only 1 can play as the civilian in a game.The bodyguards - the people who must escort the civillian to the destination. Only soldier, heavy and medics available.The assasins - must prevent the civillian to reach the destination. Only playable as snipers.In TF2, the escort mode was scrapped for multiple reasons, such as the fact it had too many limits.You had class limits, being forced to play as medic, heavy and soldier as bodyguards and as sniper on the assasins.Also, certain civillians were trolls, refusing to get out from the spawn or jumping in front of the enemy.No more saying there could only be 1 civillian, releasing many flamewars between players.Then Valve made a similar gamemode, where you have to 'escort' a bomb cart by staying near it so you can 'push' it, while the other team prevents you for doing that.ClassesThe scout:Unlike in TF2, the scout was NOT made for agressive combat, not even for combat itself. It has a 'syringegun' called nailgun and a single-barrel shotgun.Players use the scout's speed and the conc-jump technique to quickly complete the objectives.Unfortunatelly, the scout has low health, being able to be killed by a single rocket, and lacks double jumping.The soldier:The soldier from TF2 seems to not have changed much.The only differences between them is that the TFC soldier has 2 types of shotguns equipped at once and also has hand grenades.The pyro:Oh pyro... poor pyro, the class valve forgot to buff.You basically have a flamethrower that shoots rapid-fire 'bubbles' of fire, that will never hit someone.Also, the afterburn is only like 2 seconds and deals like 4 damage/tick.The pyro also has a rocket launcher that does not need to be realoaded, but deals no damage at all and ignites the enemies that stay in range, but again, the aferburn is weak.You also have a single barrel shotgun...The demoman:A class you will rarely see played, same as in TF2.People don't know the air detonation technique, which is deadly in TFC.As the demoman, you have a grenade launcher with a clip of 6 and a sticky launcher with also a clip of 6. They use the same ammo and clip, tough.The demoamn also has a single-barrel shotgun, and the unique abbility to set a bomb that is able to open new routes on a map by removing certain walls.Heavy weapons guy:The heavy is more decent to play that in TF2, you have a plenty of health and armor, and a powerful MIRV granade that creates explosions similar to the Sentry buster from TF2.You also have 2 shotguns types: The one-barrel and 2-barrel.You cannot deploy your minigun without firing, so you will stay more in combat rather than camping near corners, like people do in TF2.Engineer:The engineer is quite weak compared to the TF2 one. I mean, you have a double barrel shotgun, which is very good, and a railgun, which is the worst weapon in the game due to the slow projectile and low damage.The sentry upgrades instantly if you have enough 'metal' (called 'cells' in TFC) and is the only upgradable building.The sentrygun cannot rotate, the engineer being forced to place the sentrygun in corners, or to rotate it manually.The dispenser is not upgradable and does NOT generate ammo, health and metal, as it does in TF2, so the engineer has to fill it manually.Also, the enemy can use your dispenser.You will rarely see an engineer building a dispenser, unless they are really bored, because it does not heal, does not provide ammo unless filled with, and does not give metal, so players preffer to collect backpacks filled with goods at every corner.The only good thing about dispensers is that they can repair armor (if filled).The teleporter is not upgradable, but efficient.The lack of hauling buildings and the addition of grenades in TFC makes it hard to be an engineer, trust me.Medic:The medic is actually an upgraded version of the scout, but not worth playing.The lack of 'assist' in the kill feed and the fact that you don't get points for healing, will end up with you having 0 points even if you were an efficient medic that deserved #1 in TF2.What do I mean by upgraded scout?Remind scout's weapons? Nailgun and single barrel shotgun, also a crowbar.Medic's loadout? SUPER Nailgun, DOUBLE barrel shotgun and the medkit (as melee).The medkit is the most overpowered weapon.Why? once hitting an enemy with it, it will become infected, causing his health to drain constantly until dies or healed by a medic. Also, the infection can be spread trough teammates... darn it valve.Also, the medic is designed more for combat, and healing teammates that are hiding, because you cannot heal while you or your teammate move.The sniper:Remember the sniper rifle in TF2 called ""the Classic""?Use it to see how being a sniper is like in TFC.The spy:The spy, a kinda broken class, has a tranquilizer gun that slows down enemies, a double barrel shotgun and a knife.The stupid thing about the spy is that the disguise takes about 5 bloody seconds (while just like 2 in TF2) and you have no cloak feature.However, the lack of spychecking weapons other than the medic's medkit, may do the job.You can feign death, but you have to stay down, as a random dead body, and if you move, you actually spin like a drunk hobo and suspicious players will shoot.The backstab seems to be broken most of the time, resuting in failed facestabs.Additionally, if an enemy scout or spy runs into you, your disguise is removed.Only things I don't like on this game (along with the broken classes) are these:-Lack of resupply cabinets: If someone spawn camps you and you are hurt badly (or infected) you are forced to die.-Solid hitboxes: You cannot get past teammates as in TF2 and you cannot do the bump-spycheck.-All classes use the same voice, the only lines you will hear being ""Medic!"" and ""Excuse me, I'm in need of medical attention."" thus making it hard to see which class is approaching.On short, totally worth playing, and if you are bored you can try the FUN servers (which are better than the TF2 ones because the civillian class is used alot in them), and if you totally suck like me, you can enjoy playing singleplayer with bots.+8/10			"

												This is an amazing game. You just have to know that if you treat it like Team Fortress 2, you're gonna have a bad time! This game is significantly different than Team Fortress 2. It has a more competitive, fast-paced feeling where people try to work together to complete the objective. If you're used to Team Fortress 2, you have to know some differences before you get in game, get your♥♥♥♥♥wooped then go to write a negative review about this. Scouts are not designed for combat and are just for completing the objective. Getting a single kill as a scout is hard to do.  I personally like this scout concept over the Team Fortress 2 one. The people that still want a fast combat class in the game, don't worry! There's still a class for that. Recently, Team Fortress 2 got a new rifle called the 'Classic'. If you know how that works, you can grasp the concept of the classic sniper pretty well. Although, the TFC sniper does not suck as much as the classic. Soldier is the same except he has two shotguns. On the topic of shotguns, there are two of them. A double-barreled one that does more damage yet a slower fire rate and a slower reload and a single-barreled one that does more damage yet a faster fire rate and a faster reload. Shotguns in this game have no fall-off.Demoman is pretty similar. Your pipebomb launcher is your stickybomb launcher as Team Fortress 2 players are used to. Except the pipeboms do not stick. You have a single-barreled shotgun and you can place an instakill detpack that explodes in 5, 20, 50 seconds. The detpack can also be used to open entrances. Medic is the most changed class. Medic is for combat, healing, and capturing objectives. Your medkit can infect enemies and you have two shotguns. You also have a conc grenade that you can use to conc jump which we'll go over later. HWGuy has the same difference as soldier. You still have a minigun, but you have two shotguns.Pyro is weaker than his Team Fortress 2 counterpart. Your main job is to confuse and it is not to wreck. You have an incendiary RPG and you cannot airblast. Spy is the second most different when compared to his Team Fortress 2 counterpart. You have a double-barreled shotgun, a pistol that slows enemies down, and a nailgun. You can disguise still and you can do a crappy feign death that makes you turn into a corpse. No one falls for it and it doesn't even show up in the killfeed. It's good for hiding yet it sucks for tricking. YES BACKSTABS STILL EXIST. Engineer is pretty similar. You cannot upgrade dispensers and teleporters, but you can upgrade sentry guns. Sentry guns can be upgraded in 1 hit as long as you have 130 cells (metal). You also have a weak railgun that's more for finishing off rather than taking on a full health target. Dispensers only give armor and ammo, but no health.General Differences: There are grenades. Grenades. Every Team Fortress Classic class has a frag grenade (except scout), and a special grenade. Scout has two special grenades.Movement is a lot more intricate. You can jump with grenades and bunnyhop. There are more gamemodes and maps.On flag capturing maps, you don't take the flag back to your flag and you take it to somewhere else.There is armor.			"

												I played Team Fortress Classic for the first time in 2013, it wasnt my game, it was awful for me, couldn't stand a chance agaisnt scouts, I was really really bad at the game. But now,after 8 months of not playing it, I understand that this is a huge game with lots of things to do, and guess what? You need skill. How much skill? Lots, lots of skill, the first class I played as was as the Scout, it was fun to mess around and die in 1 hit by a direct rocket hit, hehe, but then I got serious in the game, started playing it like a competitive game, and then, I got good at it, I played lots of matches, some were versus bots and some with veterans, then, I started playing with the most ''useless'' classes that people think that are really bad and that people should never play with them, played as demoman, got a 4 kill streak once, played as pyro, killed the entire opposing team in a match, and they say that the game is dead, bad, unbalanced, not fun, not worth buying, those people are wrong, very very wrong, this game is worth all of your time and your money. Buy it, you will not regret this massively fast paced first person shooter. Player name: Johneehboi, you can find me playing on medium populated servers such as Twisted Dustbowl and some others. Many thanks to the Steam user ''Tom Fortress Classic'' for giving me this game as a gift, thank you very much.			"

												I remember when I was younger this was the one game that my dad would always play. He was always a Sniper or a Soldier. The servers he played on mostly consisted of his friends.Fast forward a decade later. I finally get this game along with the Valve Complete Pack for Christmas. I go in, and well, not surprised to see how many servers are open and the most I can ever find is 10 people in just one. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the nostalgia. That booming voice, the triumphant music, the grenades... All sounds just spamming together into one huge orgy that even porn websites can't compete with.The game is really fun, has mechanics so different from Team Fortress 2, that it will be confusing for those who only play its sequel. Grenades are so fun to mess around with until you throw one at yourself. I suggest actually finding a server to practice with each class and all features that each class has, and obviously, must read what the default key binds are. You don't want to be spending 4 minutes trying to find the grenade button or the Medic button.I recommend new players or curious TF2 players to try this. But don't think just because you're good at other shooting games or good at TF2, that you're gonna do well in this. Oh, and also:YOUR TEAM CAPTURED. THE FLAG.			"

												This game can be very challenging and frustrating at first, and is almost an entirely different game than Team Fortress 2. If you are an experienced TF2 player, do not expect to be able to walk right into this easily. This game was released in 1999, and there are people that started playing that year, and still play to this day. This is one of the main reasons this game is so difficult. However, I personally enjoy a challenge, and like TFC better than TF2. It just has the classic game design that I love. It also has a wider variety of practical strategies and more maps. Unfortunately though, it has a relatively small community and few servers. If you are questioning whether you'll buy this game or not, I highly recommend waiting until a Steam sale to do so.			"

												I am a true lifelong fan of TFC, being the best Half-Life 1 MOD since 1999, the fact that this game now has its own series gives Valve a hefty profit. Whilst I'm not much of a fan of TF2, the huge differences are the fast-paced gaming and the seriousness of the actual game, especially for the year it was made. Ever since OpenGL took place it's still been a brilliant game and still has a working public server list with users player. It's a shame it's almost dead but still a fantastic game and beats TF2 by far.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is a precursor to TF2 a highly popular Hat Simulator made by valve, so let's take a step back and look at the first game in the series. Team Fortress Classic is similar to all early valve multiplayer games and by that I mean, Counter Strike and Half Life Deathmatch. The gameplay is similar, but there is a different gameplay spin in each game. For example in Counter Strike you use real life weapons, in Half Life you use iconic weaponry from the games and in Team Fortress you have classes.Classes range from a heavy who uses a mini gun, to a spy and a medic and many many more. All of them have different weaponry and all function differently on the field. Some weapons do more damage, but fire slower or vice versa. It all boils down to skill and it's really fun.Gameplay wise, I only got the chance to try out Capture the Flag as it's the only server I found which still contains a nice amount of dedicated players which is nice. Other gamemodes have a few players, but the game is pretty much dead and I will get into that a bit later.Graphically this is a mod of the Half Life game similar to Counter Strike, so a lot of the same assets and models are in this game. It's not aged well, but overall graphics are not the selling point for this game.Gameplay is really fun, it's challenging and rewarding and it's general a really good gameplay design.Now the only bad thing is a major problem with the game. It has a dying community and it's dying rapidly. I only found one server that had 13 people in total, while others only had 2 or no players. It's a dying game, but the people that play it, they are very dedicated players so you can get in touch with a community and get  a game going.Overall Team Fortress Classic is a fun game, is it as good as Team Fortress 2 ? No, not really. While I like the gameplay more in this game, I still think Team Fortress 2 is the better game.Final Rating:6/10 Pros:+ In Depth GameplayCons:-Dying Community			"

												Great game, it's 1990's fps in it's purest form. If you can look past the dated graphics, then you are in for a great time. - The community may be pretty small, but they are still humble and not totaly toxic. (Looking at you Fortress Forever)- The classes are all well balanced. Except combat Medic and Scout who can go totaly ham when in the right hands.- There are only a handful of constantly populated servers left, but when you find them it's really fun.- Very high skill ceiling. It's the defenition of easy to learn, hard as balls to master. So if you want a rewarding and chalenging fps, then this is up your alley.- Pretty dated graphics, but again, try your best to look past them.- When the game is on sale it is dirt cheap. I picked it up for 1 dollar, worth every penny.8/10 - Good game. "

												Team Fortress Classic is class-based multiplayer FPS developed as a mod for the original Half-Life. There are ten classes to choose from, each of them with varying strengths, weaknesses and abilities, Although one of them is literally useless and only appears in one game mode as a target. There is a heavy emphasis on teamwork between players of different classes requiring a well-balanced offence and defence. The game modes can revolve around capturing the flag, territory captures, or protecting a VIP. Typically, players have the choice of two teams (Red and Blue) with a maximum of 32 players in a server .Team Fortress Classic is much like Team Fortress 2 , and it still has hundreds of servers running so you won't find it difficult to find yourself servers to play.8/10 From MeSweep "

												This is a historically important game as far as multiplayer FPSes are concerned, but is it worth playing now? Well...if it's on sale and/or if you adore vintage shooters, I'd say yes.Comparing this to Team Fortress 2 is kind of like looking into a time capsule. It's janky, not that well-balanced, and the grenade spam is real (real stupid, even.) The Spy has no cloak or sapper, instead he can feign death as a fake corpse, and if anything that makes him even harder to play. The Pyro is kind of useless, and the Medic usually ends up launching himself at the enemy team to poison them with his medkit, which let me tell you is far, far less intuitive than TF2's mediguns.Both he and the Scout have concussion grenades that let experienced players literally fly all over the map, in addition to bunnyhopping letting you go faster in general, although at least the game doesn't totally revolve around them like Fortress Forever does.On the other hand, there's not hundreds and hundreds of hats bloating the game, and since there's no unlockable weapons & less hidden ""pro level"" mechanics to learn about, it's actually a little more intuitive overall than TF2 is at this point.It can still be fun - it still has that Team Fortress magic, but with the high percentage of veterans in the playerbase and the age of the game, you'll have to come to terms with it like most old school titles. There's not that many players; the daily average is around 100. Some of them will clean your clock if you're new, as mentioned before. If you want to experience this, ideally you'd get a couple friends to join you, or find a 'TFC revival' group that arranges pick-up games.			"

												This game isn't like Team Fortress 2. Let's just be clear on that matter.It is hard to find a server since well this is a ""newer"" version of the classic TF game. What you know about the Team Fortress games are still the same. Work with other players and defeat the opposing team, with each and unqiue class that is design to fit you. Sure that may say a lot of a game like this. But either way, this game is much as fun as the secondary installment of the Team Fortress game, only that one is a bit more cartooney. This one works with the Half Life models that are dotted throughout the Half games and are specifically design to suit the class.If you want pure mulitplayer nostaglia. Get this game today!			"

												PROS:- Somewhat solid gameplay- Good weapon balance- Classic, well-known, and kickass maps- Set the basis for the game we know and love todayCONS:- Controls feel stiff at times- at it's worst, unresponsive.- The community is lacking, as to be expected from a game that is 17 years old.- Can get very drab and slow at times (in my opinion)OVERALL:This game is a ♥♥♥♥ing classic, and really provides an interesting look at the game that molded the amazing game we know today. While still primitive as far as it's graphics and mechanics, TFC can still definetly provide a fun and fullfilling experience. It has a rather significant lack in servers, but when there is a populated server, the battle can get intense and fun. I recommend this game for both people looking for a classic goldie to toy around with, and for people who are curious to see the father of TF2 by themselves.			"

												Team Fortress Classic has to be one of the best Multiplayer games I have ever played. When I first played Team Fortress Classic and hopped into a server, I fell in love with it. It`s a very fast paced, fun, and addicting multiplayer teambased shooter. Unlike Team Fortress 2, Team Fortress Classic has a lot more maps to choose from, better gameplay elements to it, a much more friendly playerbase who welcomes new players with open arms, and best of all...you actaully work as a team!So, for anyone looking for a fun multiplayer shooter in the good `ol GoldSRC engine or just looking for a new game to get into, then TFC is right up your alley!

												In my personal opinion this is much more fun than TF2, just because I love old games because even though I'm relatively young (16) I'm still old enough to have nostalgia and old memories of playing all these great old games at LAN parties with my friends where we'd take all our custom gaming desktops to one person's house and chill out with some soda and pizza.10/10If you're an old school gamer from earlier generations, you'll love it. If you're too young to have fond memories like the ones I've described above, then please realize that you're not human, never talk to me again, and go back to playing Call of Duty and having intercourse with ""hacker's"" mothers.

												As a TF2 player, I can tell you that TFC is far from it, but at the same time as close to Tf2 as twins. Something that makes it different is that it definitely requires a lot of skill, I mean a lot. You also need to remember to pick up on what you need to do and what exactly is going on. Unlike TF2, the information isn't always right up in your face. You almost always have to have a strategy otherwise you'll be dead really quickly. Oh yeah, and grenades.There are a lot of elements of this game that tells you that this is, without a doubt, the father of TF2. Something most notable and most obvious is how fast paced they both are. Seriously, first 2 minutes of any game from both of these titles has more action then a James Bond movie on steroids most the time. Another thing I'd like to point out is that over the years, the classes still have almost the exact same elements and still have the same purpose (With probably the exception of pyro, but that's debatable.) It's suprising to see that even after all that's been added to TF2 and how much you may think that it's not close to it's orgin, but really, Everything you had from the first is pretty much right there (Other than 'nades XD).I seriously recomend this game and I aplaud the community that supports it. Even though it's old, it's probably one of the best games you could find on steam. It deserves a lot more attention. And in my opinion, It's certainly worth $4.99.			"

												Game: Team Fortress classicPrice: 9.99(I got it in a Half-life bundle while the bundle was on sale for 7.TFC(Team fortress classic) was a great game that started a sensation! TFC is a CTF/TDMish FPS game. It is a RedVBlue and has the amazing classes(such as Scout,Spy,HWGuy). Built on Half-life assets, TFC is a very good game. Now I will say that the HL2 Deathmtach is slightly better imo. Ok let's look at some pros and cons.Pros:MultiplayerNot dead     -NOT DEAD.AddictingThe start of a sensationChallengingCons:Slightly chaotic, but it's fineThere is no scoping. BUT THAT CAN BE A PRO SO YOU CAN DO SOME GUD OL' 360 NOSCOPE.(Well there is scoping if you are sniper)OutdatedThe cons aren't even a bother to the game! The game is great! When i got the Half-life bundle i told myself, ""I will not play it. I'm not a fan of team fortress."" Well i decided to give it a go anyway and I don't regret installing it. Now for the ratings.Gameplay: 9.5/10Music/sounds: 8/10 -No music that i know of, but the sounds are fineCommunity: 9/10 -Pretty good community that I know ofReplayability: 9.5/10 Overall rating: 9/10    <----Amazing rating right there boi.

Its a classic. The Team Fortress classic.As seen in the catchup in Team Fortress 2, it takes place in 1933 in a Black Mesa like environment. If I should have to place it in a timeline, TFC takes place in Black Mesa before the incident happened. Summary:There are two teams: RED and BLUE with each team consisting of 9 (sometimes 10) classes:Classes- Scout- Soldier- Pyro- Demolution Man- Heavy Weapons Guy- Engineer- Combat Medic- Sniper- Spy- CivillianThere are also plenty of different Gamemodes (based on CTF):Gamemodes - Capture the Flag - Reverse Capture the Flag - Attack Defend Capture the Flag - Territorial Control Capture the Flag - Football Capture the FlagSadly, not many players are playing TFC at all.. there are just like two servers permanently active.. one server only playing 2Fort, and one with the standerd map rotation.I really recommend that game. It makes fun and I really enjoy it. Its a bit harder to play than TF2, and without hats, but if you really want to feel the Team Fortress feeling, try this one here out you'll be suprised of how good this game still is these days.Its really worth its like 10 bucks here on steam.If I should give it a rarting, I would give it a 9/10. Its not perfect, but it still stands out of most of the shooters these days.			"

												This game is a very good representation of the original FPS games out there. First, this game was a Quake mod and then developed to it's own game, leaving us Team Fortress Classic. This game has all the thrill of games like Deathmatch Classic, Counter Strike, and Quake. The diversity of the classes is what makes this game the most fun. Instead of having to worry about overpowered weapons, this game is completely equal because everyone has the stock weapons, period. I purchased this game to see what came before the game, Team Fortress 2, in which I play frequently. This game is an all-around classic and is one of the best FPS games i've played, dispite it's age. Pretty much as long as you are into First Person Shooters or games like that, you'll enjoy this one. On the downside, Valve doesn't actually have official servers like they do in Counter Strike: Global Offensive or Team Fortress 2, and are all Third Party Community Servers, but as long as you find a good server, that's all that matters. If you are apprehensive of purchasing this because of the graphics, don't be. It's like that because it's old, and remember that the gameplay makes up for it. I promise you, as long as you keep playing and don't give up you'll like it. It may take you a few hours to get as good as you are at other FPS games, because at the beginning, you're not going to be so hot. One thing for TF2 players, there isn't hats or any way to waste your money. So just remember that one purchase is it. Anyway, as long as you are open minded to trying this game out, you should enjoy this game very much.			"

												the classic fortress shooter. Team Fortress Classic is a class- and team-based multiplayer online first-person shooter video game developed by Valve and published by Sierra Studios. A port of the Team Fortress mod for Quake/QuakeWorld, Team Fortress Classic was originally released for Windows on April 1, 1999 as a mod for Half-Life and based on the Half-Life Engine (Gold Source Engine). A standalone version was later released on January 16, 2003. The development of Team Fortress Classic was led by John Cook and Robin Walker, two of the three designers from Team Fortress.The game itself involves a number of teams, each with access to ten classes, competing in a variety of modes such as Capture the Flag, Control Point, and Escort. In June 2000, the game underwent a significant upgrade, adding new player character models and game modes. As of 2003, the game was one of the ten most played Half-Life mods according to GameSpy. Today, as with its predecessor, Quake Team Fortress, it is not very active, and as such, there are few servers with humans on them, and bots prosper in the majority of servers. Your server browser can pick up at most 100 or more servers. "

												Team Fortress Classic is Valve’s second game in their “Classic” series, this one is a remake of the unofficial online shooter built off of Quake and QuakeWorld.The game was a really good idea and it all comes together pretty well, all of the classes are refined to feel more unique and are redesigned to look more like distinguished characters rather than a bunch of Quake Rangers with different suits.Team Fortress never had any maps, so they followed what Counter-Strike did and remade 3 popular custom maps that the community previously made as followed: 2 Fortresses, Canalzone, and the Rock. And they’ve all been completely remade to be more modern and they look great.Same follows with the modes, all the new and official modes are based from the unofficial modes such as Dustbowl and Crossover.There isn’t much more to say other than the fact that the whole game just feels like a huge tribute to Quake and it’s fans that contributed to Team Fortress and helped shape what it is known as today, then turned it into a very well-polished stand-alone shooter.The game is $4.99 and it’s a must-have for anybody who played and enjoyed the original, but I don’t recommend it if you don’t even have a clue what Quake is to begin with.

												Team Fortress Classic is a FPS developed and released by Valve Corporation in 1999. It is the sequel to the popular Quake mod, Team Fortress, now remade with the Half-Life engine. And it is the prequel to our favorite Party Simulator, Team Fortress 2. Matches in Team Fortress Classic pit two teams against each other, with each team member having access to nine distinct classes. Competition takes place in a variety of scenarios, usually capture the flag, VIP protection, or territorial control. Since its release, the game has undergone significant upgrades to player models and game modes.I'll just say it right now guys, this game is GREAT. The classes, the graphics (Aged rather well, considering it was 99), the fast action and variety of weapons etc. I think it's actually near perfect.....Gameplay-wise.What really brings the game down to me is the fact that now it's almost empty. If you want proof, open up Counter Strike 1.6 and take a look at the servers. Then, open up TFC and take a look at the servers. Sad, sad indeed. And the only servers with actual people are full of people that are probably going to kick your♥♥♥♥♥big time, no mercy will be shown, so you have 3 choices: Get good, get good or GIT GUD, these guys can't even be considered simple veterans, these guys probably know the game better than the creators themselves. The game is really different from TF2 so don't think it's all going to be sunshine and rainbows, the gameplay is faster, no hats, no other weapons and the game doesn't get all the updates and attention TF2 receives every day. You know what this means? Almost no people in the servers and unbalanced gameplay at some points because of no patches (Grenades, Bhopping and MEDIC, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT MEDIC). However, if you want to play a solid FPS, that, in my personal opinion, would be way better than Counter Strike 1.6 (Yes, I f.u.c.king said that.) if it only had more people. PLAY THIS, it's an absolute must for any FPS fan and an overlooked, underrated gem nowadays.9/10			"

Although it's not as popular as current games and most servers are practically nonexistent, you'll find some really cool servers. If you've played Team Fortress 2, some of the maps are the same just with lower graphics and a completely different look.Valve, you certainly did really well with this game when it first came out. Good job!One of the best 90s games you can still buy. :)			"

												Team Fortress Classic is a complete joy. At first it's a hard game to jump into and can be quite annoying from time to time. There are many things that make this game what it is.First off, this game set the standard for what every class-based shooter should be. From the fast-running scout to the hefty Heavy Weapons Guy, this game introduces most-needed diversity in what any game should have to keep it running, and to keep players playing. Sometimes, however, it just doesn't seem like the classes are doing what they should. On maps like 2fort (CTF) or Dustbowl (TC), the Medics are the ones that are the guys pushing the flag by using their frag and concussion grenades to propel themselves towards the capture point, rendering the Scout useless and completely diverts the MEDIC'S role away from what it seems.The game play of this game will keep you sitting at your desk for hours on hours. The on-going struggle to carry a piece of cloth on a pole to an enemy base will be as if you're running with a piece of pie dangling in front of you -- Long and annoying at first, but rewarding in the end. The stalemates of the grenade tosses at the beginning of matches can be aggravating, but you'll feel like a secret agent slipping through as a spy.Overall, this game is absolutely marvelous, and will live on forever. This game is worth the five bucks, it's tons of fun, and it will keep you entertained for years to come.			"

												Is this game bad? No. This game is obviously a good little shooter that was once THE king of online gaming before the mod known as Counter-Strike came along and it was replaced by the admittedly better Team Fortress 2. But why did I not recommend it? Because fifteen years ago this game was FULL of players well into the 2000s. Now only a special few still play the game. It's a shame because its actually quite a nice little gem to have in your inventory and show off to your friends.Pros:- A good selection of weapons that you wouldn't find in Team Fortress 2 (Pyro has a fire nuke!)- Pure nostalgia entering servers that are 10 years old and still have Scatman music playing in the background.- One shot snipers.- Much harder to play and understand. Very rewarding.Cons:- Unfortunately those same weapons I mentioned before do barely any damage. (Pyros Flamethrower does 3dmg!)- Serious balance issues (Pyro is the worst class in the game)- GRENADES. THEY SHOULDN'T EXIST IN A GAME LIKE THIS.- Hardly anyone plays anymore.Overall you should spend that five bucks if you truly want to see what this game is about. Otherwise I would be recommending Team Fortress 2 or any of the other First Person Shooters.Also to any Aussie players, there is one local server but it has a password on it. Thus you may need to use the US servers.			"

												Might not be as played as it was 10 years ago, but still has populated servers and a great community left. As for the gameplay itself, its gamemodes and classes become really hard to master, specially considering the game runs on the GoldSRC engine, but still really fun to play for hours.Only bad thing about the game that I've seen so far is empty servers and nade spamming. Oh, if you're new to the game, prepare to get rekt thousands of times by all sorts of nades!EDIT: You can also play with your head upside down. 10/10			"

												Hello Fellow Operatives,Team Fortress Classic is an alright game. I find it interesting how a serious game like this became what we know as Team Fortress 2, but it's interesting to see the original. Honestly, the two are almost nothing alike. The classes in this game don't really have any particular differences other than a few weapons, health and armor, but that's just about it. Team Fortress 2 offers a much bigger variety, especially in servers. It's a good game, but it's basically another Half-Life Deathmatch: Source but with classes and different weapons. I like how all of the classes are there that are there in Team Fortress 2, I find it interesting how the game developed to give us the game so man people love now. It's definitely a good game, but it's definitely outdated. It's nothing like Team Fortress 2 really, so if you were looking at this because of that, I suggest that you move along. It is definitely worth the money if you know for sure what the game is like prior to buying, though!-Kyle James			"

												An incredibly great prequel to an incredibly great game.I can say that this game is like the parent of TF2 who lacks certain features but is still awesome.TFC is quite different from TF2 as it seems like originally they went for a more futuristic side of things. TF2 is set in the 1950s and this game seems like extremely later in a world where almost everyone uses a shotgun and it's like a cheesy action movie.I know I sound strange, but let me rephrase:TFC's maps and stuff all seem to have a futuristic feel to them, with the announcer being a robot instead of a power-hungry lady and airlock doors instead of... y'know, less spacey hazardy airlock doors.As I said, this game is an amazing prequel to TF2 and it may have less OPness in all the classes, but it still lives up to its series' expectations.THE ENEMY FLAG HAS BEEN TAKEN			"

												This game was obviously a new type of game on the game industry, since it was far diferent from the other games. It had 9 classes, totally diferent from each other. The game is great but VALVe slowly lost interest in updating the game regularly, due to the development of Half-Life 2. I think the game is not worth the buy today, but it was worth the buy before TF2's realease. I only think you should buy the game today if:- You computer doesn't match the minimum requirements for TF2.- If you really love Team Fortress Gameplay- If you prefer getting a old game, and not buy a better computer.Overall the game is good, but today, it's not worth to buy.

												Played it many years ago with friends and recently tried it again. Nostalgia is strong in this game. I would probably compare Team Fortress Classic to as much great game as Team Fortress 2 were before hats and all stuff. There is just one thing different: Classic one stayed as great and fun game. There is only one problem, as probably in every old multiplayer game: players. No, TF Classic isn't empty, there are still people to play with together. The problem is, there are rarely new faces and only pro people are left. Sure, looking at reviews somebody is playing it and doesn't have 1k+ hours in it, but most of those people are probably similar to me: played it years ago, want to check how it is and compare it to TF2. Still, there are so many interesting mods and maps for this, that even playing some of them alone and/or with bots would be fun.Maybe it's not free like TF2, but it's worth checking out. In bundles with other Valve games you can grab it for really low prices (and at sales the price is REALLY low) so even if you won't spend many hours on it, you won't regret checking it out.			"

Team Fortress Classic is class-based multiplayer FPS developed as a mod for the original Half-Life. There are ten classes to choose from, each of them with varying strengths, weaknesses and abilities, Although one of them is literally useless and only appears in one game mode as a target. There is a heavy emphasis on teamwork between players of different classes requiring a well-balanced offence and defence. The game modes can revolve around capturing the flag, territory captures, or protecting a VIP. Typically, players have the choice of two teams (Red and Blue) with a maximum of 32 players in a server .Team Fortress Classic is much like Team Fortress 2 , and it still has hundreds of servers running so you won't find it difficult to find yourself servers to play .

It's community is small but loving and you can just join a normal server and have fun for a few hours. The classes are the same as in its sequel but have differences to them. Although the gameplay is fairly simple the more complicated aspects of the game are hidden from the player, if you want to, ask a more experienced player about tips and tricks. I thought I should add I bought this game as part of the Half-life: Anthology bundle during the summer sales, so i did not buy it for the sake of owning it.			"

Huge learning curve and always many skills to master, yet fun and easy to play around. TF2 is subpar due to lack of concing and other things that makes this game unique. Despite its age, it's still fun to pub in the handful of servers left, and there are a few serious gamers lingering that can bring it back like in the old days.			"

												I've played this game for thousands of hours, since 2005. It's a very fast paced game, if you want it to be. There are many different classes which you can learn to adapt to your gaming style. The easiest class to start is a sniper. The skill is to learn to use any class in any situation. The community used to be top notch. Nowadays there are less and less people playing. TFC needs new blood. There are many different maps and modes, like CTF, CP. There are also many fun maps, where you f.e. can climb, explore, and solve mysteries. In short, TFC is a simple yet complicated game. If you like a challenge, pick it up.			"

												I know what your proberly thinking. This game is old, bad and deserves to rot but thats wrong. Many people play Team Fortress two now but Team Fortress Classic has a lot of different, better features like, TFC has grenades. TFC is a more realistic game. You'll notice how realistic it is once you play. Well, at least it's more realistic than TF2. XD TFC is not buggy, theres still websites to get all the custom content you want :) Have fun.			"

												This game is actually pretty freakin' awesome. I doesn't have the charm or massive fanbase/fandom like it's sequel, Team Fortress 2, but it does offer changes to the rather straight-forward-stragizing needed in TF2. The graphics, based on the time it was produced, are actually incredible, and the game play is fast, solid, fun, and challenging. I'd say if you want to bring a whole new twist to Team Fortress without using mods or different game mode servers, you should try this game out. Seriously. It's amazing.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is the predecessor of the Free to Play game we all know and love, Team Fortress 2. It is a team-based FPS very much like TF2. It was originally a mod based on the 1996 game Quake and was eventually adopted by Valve to be it's own game in 1999. Hell, this game is as old as I am. Runnin on the Source engine, this game is one of, if not, the best game Valve has ever made. It's gameplay of having classes is what makes it stand out from the rest of the FPS games we all see nowadays. It has changed the gaming world and still is to this day with TF2. There are games out there like Battleborn and Overwatch that take on the class-based approach to FPS's, but none of them can compare to Team Fortress. If you're a die-hard Valve fan such as myself, then you NEED to buy yourself a copy of this staple in FPS gaming history!			"

												While it may not be as alove as Team Fortress 2, Team Fortress Classic, or TFC for short, cleary remains unique and fun. Compared to TF2, TFC has gamemodes that won't be present in TF2 (such as escort, reverse capture the flag), awesome maps (such as rock2 and hunted, very well made maps that were not included in TF2, unforunately) and the 10th class, the civilian.Sure now you may be wondering ""Why should I buy an old almost dead game when his brother is free and alive?"". By playing it, not only you may keep the game alive for a while longer, but also may find a great game for your free time and maybe even making more people look with interest at it.I love TF2, I came to TFC from TF2, but honestly I got more used to TFC and it would be such a shame if you wouldn't give this game a chance. There are also various fun-adventure servers, which you may like, but overall this game was a masterpiece in his time and it would be such a shame to die now.			"

												This is the first Team Fortress game to become official and as a commercial product. It's not bad, but it's fundamentally different from the hat simulator that was spawned from it. The game revolves around a more serious military type concept. It uses the Half Life engine, the first one's! But among many online shooters it isn't much too different these days, so you could actually forget about it unless you're big into shooters and such, yet it might be worth a few matches if you get it extra cheap...

												Back in '99, we did not have cable internet yet, the only way for me to go online was to go to the library. At one point, I just connected my computer to the phone line and played some games online like Unreal Tournament and Half Life. Afterwards I read something in a magazine about this Team Fortress mod, so I downloaded and installed it. It was great fun, untill my parents received the phone bill at the end of the month..When I did get cable internet, later that year, I spend quite some time playing Team Fortress. A first person shooter in which every one has his own role/skills, which was never been done before. Obviously, there are not that many players in TFclassic anymore. It's still a fun game but with the dated graphics and TF2 being free2play, there is no reason to go back to TFclassic but for nostalgia sake. I still recommend this game for what it used to be but be sure you got some friends to play with.  "

												I enjoyed TF2, but TFC is the ultimate brother here. TFC follows the same rules as before, 9 classes, two teams, hundreds of maps, and a lot of killing. TF2 I never liked due to the serious unbalancing of the game, and yes TFC is a tad unbalanced too, but TF2 took it too far. That being said, It's nice to play TFC because I feel as if newcomers have a slighter chance of getting kills, BUT, if you are a newcomer, YOU WILL BE CRUSHED because this game is a tad dead meaning many experienced players do play this. As far as I know, there are about only 5 dedicated servers left for REAL players only, no bots. Drippy's 2fort is one of them that always seem populated, but I hope you don't mind playing 2fort for awhile since that seems to be the only popular real server left.The graphics are from Half Life 1, sooo you should get an idea of what it looks like. As for sound, nothing really, just explosions, guns being shot off, turrents, doors opening, grunts from jumping, ETC.The gameplay in this does require a bit more skill so mastering it is really hard. Snipers will pick you off instantly, Soldiers will destroy you, ETC. Haha, the gameplay is quite fun though, but remember, each class isn't for everybody, so you may need to experiment some if you wanna figure out what's best for you. My favorite is the Scout and Engineer. My only complaint in this game...are the grenades. As much as I love TFC, the grenades are absolutely overpowered and spammed to hell. The thing about grenades are that their blast radius is HUGE and people spam them everywhere. In 2fort, I have been killed too much by opening a door and having a grenade thrown at me and having me killed. Grenade spamfest is almost the name of the game, but once you get used to it, this game is downright fun and awesome.Sure, this game is sadly dying, but there are still some servers left for real players, there is a server that hosts Dustbowl 24/7 for real players too and it's the second most popular server so if you get bored of 2fort from Drippy's, there is always that server. So help us TFC lovers bring this classic back to life by buying it. It's only $5.00, and it will offer you hours of fun on end. Many sleepless night I've had on TFC, trust me. I have almost 50 hours in this game and I know that I will still keep playing more in the future. So buy TFC today! You have nothing to lose other than your social life.			"

												Team fortress classic is a mod for Half-life and like you already know, it is also a prequel of team fortress 2. Tfc stands for Team fortress classic. It came out in 1999 after the year when Half-life was made. It is the same thing as Tf2 (Team fortress 2) but the Handgun (Glock) was not on Tfc (Team fortress classic). After so many years past, the makers of Tfc made tf2. Like I said, But you already know what Tf2 is! Because I said it or you played it. Team fortress classic is kind of better then team fortress 2.

I didn't get a chance to play it when it was popular. I'd kill to see TFC in it's prime.In conclusion, if you like TF2, you'll probably hate it, but if you don't compare it to TF2, it's loads of fun.			"

												This is going to require alot of patients but if you can learn the massive difficulty curve than it is actually pretty fun, too bad most of the players today are expirienced and will defiently stomp you out if you don't know what your doing. Sometimes there are barely any servers up and frankly sometimes the community can be real salty when asking them on what your doing wrong and how to improve, simply out of them only wanting to play with people who know exactly how to do everything. To put it simply it's dead, has an unfriendly community, dated and the scout is useless.			"

												This is going to require alot of patients but if you can learn the massive difficulty curve than it is actually pretty fun, too bad most of the players today are expirienced and will defiently stomp you out if you don't know what your doing. Sometimes there are barely any servers up and frankly sometimes the community can be real salty when asking them on what your doing wrong and how to improve, simply out of them only wanting to play with people who know exactly how to do everything. To put it simply it's dead, has an unfriendly community, dated and the scout is useless.			"

												It may not have aged all that well, but when you can find a good server, TFC is one of the most fun FPS games out there. If you're a TF2 fan, some of the differences are going to confuse you at first, but you'll get used to them overtime. I'd recommend getting it during the next Steam Sale as the servers are almost always empty.			"

												I had this game on disc for friggin' ages and never played it until like 2 days ago when, after a recent long stint of playing OG Day of Defeat, I came to the conclusion that new games suck ballz and gold src era games are the best thing ever, so I went ahead and just bought it on Steam. Lemme' tell ya, Team Fortress Classic is the goldenest of gold src games. It turns out that TFC is the most engaging game I've played for quite a while, moreso than Tom Clancy's Wildlands or Witcher 3.There aren't many servers, but holy ♥♥♥♥ just download foxbot and it's just as good.  It's five dollars, that's less than a greasy cheeseburger from Mcdonalds. Hop on it, yo.			"

I have no idea how I used to play with 320ms AOL free trial dialup discs one after another, but through a dozen autoexec.cfg options I sure did. I mildly suggest playing it today, if only because TF2 ended up being so drastically different an experience.			"

												Team. Fortress. Classic. One of the oldest games on the Steam store, and the first Team Fortress that Valve produced and published. So is it any good? YES. I mean, the game is pretty hard, but that doesn't stop it from being FUN. As with TF2, the game has nine classes (Scout can't double-jump though ;-;) and objectives for you to accomplish (No Payload, though, only Ctf and control points). All in all, a great game.9/10			"

												This game isnt dead whatsoever. You'll see at least 2 full servers per day. This game IS NOT like TF2, I repeat, NOT LIKE TF2. The only similarites between the two TF games are the classes and maps. Nothing else.Grenades are very important on the battlefield.This is a great game if you want to see TFC and enjoy the thrilling expirience.In TF2, Spy isn't a relatively hard class to master , but in TFC, it is quite the opposite. No cloak, no instant disguise. However, It is rewarding seeing enemies splatter ang gib upon a backstab. Instead of a revolver, Spy gets a weak nailgun, a super shotgun, and a tranq pistol.Other classes follow suit.There's no fancy hats, different loadouts, or anything. Just plain default.So, if that seems good for you, get TFC. If not, you can stick to Hat Simulator. ( still pretty fun )			"

												Team Fortress Classic is the 1st game in the Team Fortress Series. From a player transitioning from TF2 to TFC it was hard. There are a lot of good players who have been playing this game for years. It took me a while to get use to the controls and everything. But once you get over that steep learning curve, the game will open up to you. You will start appreciating it and understand why a lot of fans say that this game is better than TF2.Gameplay: 7/10			"

												Team Fortress Classic was the game that introduced me to true teamplay and organized gaming. It was the first game I played where the best player on the server could have a 5-50 score and still be the guy winning the game.Despite a number of design flaws the game somehow manages to work and provide a highly competitive experience. You pick one of the 9 classes and work together through varying CTF style maps to beat another equal team. The classes don't all work like you would think though, however many years of competitive play have managed to fit most of them into suitable roles, or marked as being completely useless. Medics don't heal but cap points and heavies are completely useless.Despite all of this it's still a game I cherish. Today there might not be any people left playing but once upon a time this was the premier game for skill and teamwork.			"

												Note: I put more hours into this on another account that I owned.If I had to choose between Team Fortress Classic and Team Fortress 2, I would go with Team Fortress Classic. Although I wasn't too big on it at first, I eventually began to prefer Classic over TF2. In fact, I think that it's actually more worth it to pay the $4.99 you need to buy this game than to freely download TF2. Yes, it lacks TF2's interesting characters, but it packs a punch with its gameplay that is even more challenging than TF2, not to mention that it's also more balanced. Only real problem with the game is that it lacks a lot of online players, and the servers that are still up aren't always the greatest. Still, TFC is worth the $4.99 you spend on it.			"

												This game is a little bit better than the Second Team Fortress. This game has only stock weapons, so there really is not 'best' weapon or anything like that. Also, the classes in this game acually have uses for their roles. This isn't the best game in the world really, but it is a great pass-the-time game. So, if you want to play a good game, just play Team Fortress Classic.			"

												Hi before I played tf I played  tf2.  when I was getting into half life stuff i wanted the game. I thought if i spent 5$ more i could get half life anthology and I could try out tf. I thought tf was going to be just ok. Oh how I was wrong!!!I actually think tf is better than tf2! this is a under shadowed game that I hightly recommed. so what are you whating for?go play some tf1!                                                        This game is a:              8\10                rating			"

												This game is HIGHLY overlooked by its free to play sequel, Team Fortress 2. It is a little hard to find a lot of people to play the game with, but when you though, this game can be really fun! This game is a charming little shooter, and is quite straight to the point. Each character is set up to be balanced with their own unique abilities. There is no unfare/overpowered/exploited characters, it is completely balanced, and is not about the stats. This is a game that I can simply pick up and play a round or two. I love this games and I think more people should try it. The graphics may be a little outdated, but the gameplay is just as good as a modern game.  If you like a good first person shooter without screaming 12 year olds and fair gameplay, then I recommend this hidden gem to you!			"

												This game isn't the original Team Fortress, but it isn't tf2. It's a weird mix of old quake-style games and newer games like, well, tf2. It's hard to get used to since the graphics are a bit disorienting, but after you get used to it it's not bad. It doesn't really make sense that this costs money though, considering tf2 is free. I would only reccomend it to tf2 fans who want something familiar, yet different.Also, lots of people are saying there aren't many people still playing, but I've had no real trouble with that. It's something to keep in mind though.			"

												- Sniper has a sniper rifle that doesn't even have a scope- Spy has an smg and a shotgun- As the spy you can't even see half of the knife- All classes pretty much look the same- No hats, other buyable weapons, ducks, killstreaks, crates, and other stuff-The civilianI wonder how all that sh*t works.

												Amazing game,worth the price.Get it while its on sale.Oh and if you are coming to TFC from TF2 keep in mind that :Prepare for lots of grenade spam.Nobody plays pyro because he sucks.Scout isnt made for combat.Soldier,Demo,Heavy and Sniper are pretty much the same.Spy doesnt have cloak,instead he has feign death.Engineer can be an offensive powerhouse because of the EMP nades.Oh and dispensers do not provide health.There's no hats.And Medic can spread AIDS to everyone.Yes,EVERYONE.

												Lag? Not a problem. You and your enemies have higher health than your modern day twitch shooter. Also the netcode is amazing! You would probably have a smooth gameplay if you entered a lobby with 150+ ping anyways, so don't let your ping scare you. You will engage in actual gun battles, not a ""who saw who first."" Don't like being a slayer? no problem! you can sometimes run past enemeis throwing yourself at the objective with almost no penalty. You can use mic or text chat. There are a lot of buttons, but don't let this overwelm you! You mostly will just jump, shoot and throw a grenade. Pure FPS fun without all of the b.s. Highly reccomend it to anyone in the NTSC/EU regions (US/Canada/Mexico/UK etc. and my game time lol this is from steam using this steam account. I've been playing it since 2002 off and on (casually).			"

												Okay... Listen up maggots!Today we're going into Team Fortress Classic! Many of you here today have spent some time in Team Fortress 2. Well, I want you to forget most of what you learned. Team Fortress 2 will seem like a teaparty compared to the brutal war that awaits you in Classic. You are all equally vulnerable the second you step onto that field of war. There are many features that you may have gotten used to in Team Fortress 2. But I ask you, what makes a game? A staggering amount of useless hats, unusual weapons, and silly taunts? Hell no! Now I can't promise enjoyment from all of you. Perhaps a few of you Next-gen wussies will dismiss this as nostalgic garbage. But I assure you, the ones that make it through, you will enjoy every cent spent on this game.			"

												TFC is madness in a can, sometimes you just need to pop the lid. No matter what class you play, when you get to the frontline tactics often go right out the window when you're trying to kill the guy next to you that seems to be singlehandedly beating your team back. There's often not time to think, you purely react, and subconsciously improve your skill in the traits of your class. The veterans whizz about the map rocket-jumping with incredible accuracy of direction as snipers pick them out of the sky with their patiently charged up shots. Grenades expertly fused and thrown while on the run, and detonation packs blow up with split second perfect timing as gates open. I'm always in awe of the sharpened skills displayed by a flag holder blasting himself through the map, right onto the capture point. This is old, but gameplay is better than graphics. All I can ask is that people still play it, and that it runs in widescreen on Win7. Yes, yes, and yes!			"

												This game is so great. I know you TF2 fans are going to get mad at me. But I personally find this game better than TF2. I think TFC community is a whole lot better and friendly compared to TF2. I also love the fact that on TFC. You focus on team working. That's right they're are no hats, no microtransaction crap... I know this game takes awhile to get used to. But, Its worth it in the end. Plus there are no taunt distractions (I'm talking about you conga taunt). None of that. And I like the mods people do and people still play this game. :) Plus I think this game requires more skill which I think why TF2 fans are scared of it. If you compare this to TF2. TF2 is just an easy game and really no skill involved compared to TFC. Anyways, if your angry about TF2. I'd recommand those people to play this game instead its tons of fun! :) By the way.... WHO CARES IF THE GRAPHICS ARE OUTDATED TF2 FANS!!!			"

												Valve rather blatantly ripped off the fan-made mod Fortress Forever with this game, but that's okay, because they did a great job. The move away from the clunky Source engine makes all the crazy movement tricks much smoother to pull off, and the general feel of the game is improved, especially when you take into account the vastly reduced loading times and system requirements. There is also more character in this installment, which has bloodier gibs, more distinctive maps, and a generally fresh feeling, which Fortress Forever can only hint at. Frankly, TFC makes Fortress Forever feel like a cheap knockoff itself.			"

												TFC is sort of a mixed game, it hasn't aged too well, weapons are creative with a mixed execution, graphics are well 90s graphics, controls are okay, well unfortunately thats all i have to say about this game, its a 6/10 game, should you play it? I guess it depends if you think you can handle a game that hasn't aged well.			"

												a good game to see and experiment with. Buggy although strangly amusing and succsesfully modded servers only make it better. For those who think the game is a big bucket of ballsup banonza you are indeed not completly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, for you see you have your opinions and we (TFC) players have ours. Only deleting the game of the face of the earth would offend, upset and bore us but it's under our control if we let them convert us. People saying it's had it's run doesn't mean we can't stop playing. people who say 'forget the past and embrace the future' are only giving advice (unless there forcing you to) either way, it's your choice. i like to chose to remember the past and embrace the future AT THE SAME TIME! people also complain about realism: like the nail guns, super nail guns, rail guns and silenced tranquileser pistols all firing incredibly slow moving nails, that is just merely one of the aspects of the game, and it's you'r opinion if you don't like it. So the game is good, buggy, unrielistick, old game still having it's run (although now its a mere crawl) a lovely unbalenced bundleof fun.although not having a back strory that could of been an unintensional aspect of the game. for me, i made my own little story:in the future black mesa is a mess! the army has been partaily disabled by gordan freeman and both sides are still stuggling to kill one another. after the death of the vortugonts (<--incorect i know) leader black mesa no longer has to worry aboutthe alians and tries to rebuild, the army realise letting black mesa rebuild and continue research on dangerouse things would be bad and could end up destroying everything but they cannot fight withou men! and black mesa neads to beprotected... so they hire mercenaries to fight there battles. black mesa sometimes attacking or the army attacking. both teams of mercenaries made there own flag black messa was rebuilding so the mercenaries chose a building. the army however was trying to destroy and kill all black mesa mercenaries and personel to stop forward production. this continued to the day the combine invaded, hunting the vortugaunts and there once evil leader. finding out about his death they had nothing better to do other than invade and loot everything so the army was then faced with another problem and with only 9 merceneries and about a 6th of whats left of them they where killed in & hours giving black mesa the time to hide itslelf in another location, changing there name eg. mack blesa and rebuilding leaving there old facility to self destruct, thus gordan freeman was somened upon the time of need. please tell me this is not a bad game now that it has aback story. and if it already has a back story please tell me so i know if i embaressed myself talking about something i don't know about.

												This is a very fun first-person-shooter. This comes from a person who mainly likes half-realistic games like Counter-Strike. The graphics are of course dated 1999, includes whacky physics and animations, also voice chat will make your character's mouth move. Sounds are mostly recycled from Half-Life, aswell as the robotic announcer. Gameplay is a ton of fun, not too realistic, you have your 9 classes all with different roles, a handful of different game modes and maps. There aren't many active servers with players, so you'll play against third-party bots most of the time, but you would get your a** kicked if there were some TFC Veterans in here still. This game also screams teamwork, not like teamwork in Call of Duty, but also not like teamwork in Left 4 Dead. TL;DR, Little multi-player-only, semi-futuristic, first-person-shooter that is not too active, but even 15+ years after date, is still fun to play.			"

												While TF2 is a great game, thoguh I find that TFC can be just as fun, as long as you dont mind there not being any hats and having only stock weapons. But for an FPS it does somewhat stand against the test of time, though i feel it may very well fade away in the future. For now, i have to say that this game is great buy, especially if you get it in the Half-Life 1 Anthology pack. So if i were to give this game a rating (this goes for the pack also) I would give it my 7/10, well maybe 8/10.			"

												Hello everybody,this review contains very stong facts and quotes I have gathered from Twitter,please listen quietly and hold in your tears,Team Fortress Classic,there are 9 classes to play as,but there are only 4 building an engineer can build,9-4=5,there are 5 letters in VALVE,VALVE made TFC,dosen't seem susptious that TFC rhymes with KFC?I though so,KFC sell chicken,TFC does not,McDonald's sells nuggets,nuggets has 7 letters,McDonald's has 9 letters,9x7=63,63 is one less than 64,64,Nintendo,Nintendo made the Nintendo 64,Nintendo has 8 letters,VALVE has 5,8+5=13,13 is 3 more than 10,the 10/10/10 happened in 2010,2010 is when VALVE updated TF2,but what does updating TF2 have anything to do with TFC?Nothing,I just remembered it,now here is the importaint part!TFC has 3 letters,TF2 has 2 letters,3+2=5,VALVE has 5 letters,5-5=0,zero looks like an o,an o is a letter,do you know what else has o in it?Thats right,Letter Soup,there are 26 letters in the alphabet,10-26=16,there are people that are 16 years old,16 is 10 more than 6,6 is double 3,there are 3 sides on a triangle,the Illuminati has 3 sides so,Team Fortress Classic is Illuminati Confirmed.

												Abandon (almost) everything you know about Team Fortress 2, because this remake of the original mod is more to Quake (the game the original Team Fortress mod was based apon) than it's financial titan of a sequel (prequel?).This game is fast paced and has grenades. What more is there to know? Well, for one thing, it is the ghetto of multiplayer FPS'. Meaning, functions such as objective mechanics and pre-round/round time are map-based, and time is not shown on the HUD, it's generally shown through a server-side command. Other than that, it's quite fun, if not unfogiving, but what fun is there in a game if it offers you little challenge and doesn't punish you for not meeting said challenge?I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fast-paced team-centric gameplay, unfortunately it's not exactally bursting with players every day. Most servers are full of bots, and the one that don't have mods that, while not always detering from the gameplay, tend to not retain the original gameplay fully.Needs Steam Trading Cards. That would attract new players. Or not. Never know.			"

												This is an unadulterated old school multiplayer team shooter that relies heavily on skill, especially jumping mechanics. It'll also probably cause your external genitalia to withdraw into your body if you've not familiar with it because the population playing today has a wildly high level of ability compared to any potential new player. Therefore my recommedations are as follows: don't be a noob, take some Viagra, and play this today.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is a revision of the original mod for Quake made in Half-life and was a great game to play for the wait of TF2. This game is recommended for any TF fan or someone who owns Half-life and does not have Quake. The only downside is that the game does not live up todays standards, but any retro gamer (like me) should atleast give it a go. 6/10 78%			"

												Its a good game for it's time, however it doesnt hold up too well today still a fun multiplayer shooter with variety in the classes. It is VERY clunky compared to it's sequel tf2 but it has it's own visual style and charm. You may have some trouble getting into a server with ACCTUAL PEOPLE! (On multiple occasions I spawned into an empy server with just me after minuites of loading). But when you do get into a real game you're in for a treat. If you can find it for £3 (Or whatever currency you have), or less you've found a bargain that'll lasy you many hours!(PS Y U NO HAVE HATS?!)			"

												It's a solid team-based Half-Life mod. I have played it for hundreds of hours and it's still a fun game. The classes have very clear-cut purposes and roles, e.g. Scout has almost no weapons while being the best flag capturer of the game and a soldier can nail you to a wall with rockets if you get too close to it and sniper is the only class that can do anything to a long range targets due to the default weapon being a shotgun. Even if you die, you are back in action in a second. The gameplay is very simple with no gimmicks or obscure gameplay mechanics as it is basically a re-skinned and modified Half-Life DM, making it very newbie friendly and not frustrating to start. The only not self-evident things in the game are the demolition charge of demoman to blow up unmarked targets and the building mechanics of engineer.			"

												If you play Team Fortress 2, it's definately a step back. However if you are like me and you don't have a good gaming PC, this game is perfect if you like Team Fortress 2. The grapics are lower quality, but they take up less space and are more friendly to those that are still using DSL. If you like shooters and have a terrible computer and internet connection, this may be the perfect game for you. If you are able to play Team Fortress 2, I reccomend staying away from this game since it costs money and Team Fortress 2 is free.			"

Team Fortress Classic Reviewby KTMboyz""Let me explain...""Okay!  Yes, I don't recommend the game, why?  Well, that's what I'm going to talk about.  Can I start by pointing out that the game is dead!  You will be lucky enough to find a match with 1 to 5 people on it.  ""But, that's just because its old!  Surely it was a popular and fun game at the time?"" I hear you say.  Well, in a way.  Team Fortress Classic was overshadowed by the monster hit:  Counter-Strike.  If you compare the two, Team Fortress Classic is a mess...  Unlike its sequel, the characters are not memorable, the weapons sound terrible in my opinion and so on...  When I do find a game, its actually pretty fun...  Sometimes...?  I don't know, this is my opinion and I personally feel like the game is not very polished and seems unfinished.  I will point out I haven't even played for two hours XD, so my opinion might change.  Pick it up if you liked the game or have lots of memories from before.  If your some TF2/CoD kid looking for another game, well, probably not...  Sorry.8.5/10 "

Surely it was a popular and fun game at the time?"" I hear you say.  Well, in a way.  Team Fortress Classic was overshadowed by the monster hit:  Counter-Strike.  If you compare the two, Team Fortress Classic is a mess...  Unlike its sequel, the characters are not memorable, the weapons sound terrible in my opinion and so on...  When I do find a game, its actually pretty fun...  Sometimes...?  I don't know, this is my opinion and I personally feel like the game is not very polished and seems unfinished.  I will point out I haven't even played for two hours XD, so my opinion might change.  Pick it up if you liked the game or have lots of memories from before.  If your some TF2/CoD kid looking for another game, well, probably not...  Sorry.8.5/10 "

												Grenade Spam everywhere, unbalanced classes, nearly dead community. 10/10On a more serious note I don't hate TFC, as I think it is a good founding base for what would become TF2. However what kills this game of a recommendation from me is the nearly dead community. At most there is 20 to 30 players spread across different servers, and most of the time there is only 15 or so players on different servers. I dislike other things though like the grenade spam, the annoying medic poison (which is pretty op) and the classes having weaknesses that outweigh the pros of the class. Same thing with other classes having to many pros and not enough cons. Like some the weapons feel like you are hitting your enemy's with rubber bullets. But you know what for what it is, it certainly isn't bad. But when TF2 is vastly superior and the community is nearly dead, it's a hard sell.			"

												It's not worth a buy.  It really isn't good.  Less than 20 people play it at a time spread across about 3 or so servers.  Each one takes a few minutes to download the maps just to play on them, and even then, it's disappointing.  :(  You are much better off playing Team Fortress 2.			"

												The review is to say if I recommend you buy this or not so in that case I don't recommend you get this.There are reviews that say it's a great game, still fun to play, I can't really say how great a game it is since none of these people actually play this, they are probably playing the always updated FREE new version TF2.It's fair enough to say an outdated game is great and still fun but the servers are always empty unless you want to play with the stupidest bots, you shouldn't really get this if your thinking about it.

												Team Fortress Classic is a really good game I gotta admit I hop on it every so often but I cannot recommend it. Why? Because it's so difficult to understand. There is no feedback and its so hard to tell whats going on in matches because its so fast paced. Its hard to explain but if you try it yourself you will know exactly what I mean. Experienced players get a huge advantage over everyone especially with grenades in the game. The learning curve is so steep that it's not even a curve... It's a wall... However if you're good at games like quake or half-life then I defilently recommend this!!!			"

												So, Team Fortress.  Seems like an awesome game, right?  Well, tell me how it plays because it is not supported on Win7, 8, or 10.  I just get a black screen and that's it.  You'd think that they would patch the game if they are currently selling it.  I mean, it is a game MADE by Steam.  0/10.  Yes it is for free now, but I actually paid for the game a few years ago.  Didn't work then, doesn't work now.			"

												If you are more familiar with TF2 like me... okay, if you started with TF2 like me then you'd have to be curious about Team Fortress Classic and well... it's just not worth it. It just doesn't hold up today, not for people like me.I probably haven't played it for long enough of course, but do I have to? It's more fast paced sure, but more complicated. Over-complicated, even. It's unbalanced and the GoldSrc engine itself just has weird depth perception... Oh yeah, and nobody plays it anymore. I mean, there are barely any servers with human beings on it for me.Yes, I know there are still people that like TFC, people that have been raised on TFC the same way I and many others were raised on TF2. And if you're one of them, good for you! That's fine with me. But I just don't like it myself. I'm going to stick with TF2. It's still much better balanced, more simple and it has hundreds of servers that people still play on today.If you're curious to see what TFC looks like, then I won't stop you from getting it yourself. Just don't say I didn't warn you.			"

												This game may have been good when it came out, but now it's dead. Firstly there is a better-looking more dynamic and more entertaining sequel which is free. If for some reason you want to play the maps from this game, just play one that has been ported into TF2. If you want to play the classes in their original unbalanced state, just play Fortress Forever, which is free. My friend and I tried playing this game, and there's about 5 people left who play it. They don't even play the actual game- just weird obstacle courses which don't function properly. You can do that on Roblox. Roblox is free. My point is, don't buy this game.			"

												I really wanted to like it, but it's just too archaic and weirdly designed. Some examples:-Some options, like cursors, have to be changed out of game. I don't like the default cursor, and I don't want to jump through hoops to replace it. I understand that that's on me, but it still annoys me.-Infenction.-Why have friendly fire as an option when the game includes a class that can disguise as a teammate? I've only been able to get matches on servers that have it, and that annoys me. The lighting also makes it really hard to differentiate enemies from allies, leading to more frustration.Other:-Not a ton of players, unfortunately. There's plently, but not as many as I'd like.-Some classes are just plain bad, and not worth playing from my point of view.The Good:-Weapon variety. There's a lot of cool weapons.-General things, like engine and map design.-Not as commercialized as the Hat Game, and the weapons are slightly more balanced as a result.The game is quite fun, but I now know why it evolved the way it did. If you can get it in a pack with other games, it's worth it. Even at full price, I'd recommend it; just be prepared for a rough game that might annoy you if you're used to the super-polished TF2.All of this is my opinion, and some of it might be completely wrong. This is just my perspective. As a scrub/derty casul, I'd just prefer playing the more polished game.			"

												Hear me out i feel if you've never played TF2 you could get used to this game, but if you have played TF2 then you will not enjoy this. I noticed alot of servers werent even full and the ones that were are laggy, not bad laggy but when your fighting its a huge streak the will just freeze everything. I sort of enjoyed this game it is very much like TF2 but different, ALSO if you have played TF2 your skills will not transfer you will be like the normal bad player in TF2. Over all i give this game for people who havent played tf2 a 8/10 but for the ones who have a 5/10. I dont recomend buying this game but if you put alot of time and effort you will master Team Fortress Classic.			"

												This is great nostalgic pack for Team Fortress series. But there is a huge problem in this game and that's playability which causes me to not recommend it.When paying REAL money for the game, you'd expect yourself to be able to actually play the game. I bought this, didn't find any servers and after few hours, I found one where I had like 300 ms ping and getting constant lag spikes and sometimes even disconnects due to the server being located in someone's home PC in Alaska or something. I'm not sure have others came across this problem but from my experience, it feels ridiculous that you pay for a game that you can't even play.Making this game free-to-play would make me recommend it. It's an awesome game but what's the point buying an awesome game if you can't even play it?Sorry, dislike, I have to.			"

												While I haven't gotten too much into the game, I dont think I will be getting far. Yes, this is probably a good game and I'm just bad at it. I will say this though; if you have experience in the sequel to this game, Team Fortress 2, then don't bother buying this. There are so many things different in this than TF2, so nothing applies from that game except for the classes. Again, this isn't a bad game, its just that anyone who stuck around before TF2 has become too good at this game, and anyone going into it from TF2 will get a very bad experience.So if you have not played TF2 before,try it out and see how it goes.But if you HAVE played TF2 before, save your money for some keys.

												Wow. Just wow. While this game is a ""milestone of fps"", this game has aged badly. The controls are just bad, some class feel waaaay more usefull as others (I'm looking at you, Demoman and Scout.) And just everything is bland. Besides a couple of levels, there was nothing that made this game any different from other fpses. No crazy customazation or weapons, just nothing. To top it all off, the servers for this game are just DESERTED. With luck, the most you'll find is 5 people. Overall, I can see why this game is considered a classic, but it's doing a really bad job of showing me. All I can say is skip TF and go directly to 2. It's unique, it's funny, and did I mention it's free? I'm sorry TF, but I think it's time to be put down.Pros: I can see innovatation for it's time.. +Cons: ..But it's no longer 1999. And it's aged badly. -          Generic. -          Some classes are useful, and then some are just downright bad. -          No good stages.OVERALL SCORE: 3/10.RECOMMEND: No. Just get TF2.			"

												7.5/10***Yes, this is a good game however it hurts my heart to make it not recommended. The gameplay, mechanics, physics, and everything about this bundle of joy is amazing, and very enjoyable. Although I have not recommended this game, I still give it a strong 7.5/10. The reason I cannot recommend this is because of the more recent creation of Team Fortress 2, the Team Fortess Classic community is dying out. It's difficult to find a password-free, public server with a decent amount of players on it. If you do see a server with 'players', there's a possibility that the 'players' are bots, therefore abysmal at the game. On the rare occasion, you might find a server that actually has players on it. This is ALSO a problem. The likeliness is high that the players on the server are very good Team Fortress Classic players, and have years of experience. As a latecomer, it is very difficult to become even decent at the game because of the simple fact you get completely anialated by all of the other players. One thing I must note is that, if you are a good, or even the best Team Fortress 2 player in the world, don't get this game with high-expectations. The combat style is very different, and very fast-paced. Even with years of experience in Team Fortress 2 it takes much time and dedication to get good at this game, and be able to have fair fights with other players. Another thing which is enjoyable is that despite the fact some players are very good, all of the loadouts for each class are the same, therefore every player in theory should have an equal chance, however this obviously varies on the fact some players are extremely good, like I previously mentioned.NOTE: The reason I have low playtime on this game is because I had it and used to play it before steam began to count playtime. Even before steam existed. I would take a rough estimate and say that I have between 150-200 hours of playtime in this game total.			"

I had a positive bias before I even played it.I tried many times to get into this game, and every time I gave up.The problem with this game isn't that it's old, it's a combination of little things that make it a chore to play.You can't tell when you hit someone.You can't tell if you killed someone or if someone else did.The grenades have such horrible physics you might as well just be throwing a laggy pillow.You also can't tell when a grenade hits someone.The classes are horribly imbalanced and bland, pyro's MAIN weapon has almost no hit registration and is given a rocket launcher to compensate.The spy is nearly useless since you need to open a menu and USE YOUR MOUSE to disguise.Nearly all the classes have some kind of shotgun.The scout's nailgun never hits.The demoman's detpack is useless except in extreme circumstances.The pipe bombs have the same fluffy pillow technology as the grenades.You can't tell any class apart from each other.Everyone sounds the same.There's no personality, it's a bland brown shooter.The skill levels between players differ so greatly that trying to start out is nearly impossible because you die every 2 seconds.Bunnyhopping.I can see why this game would have been great 15 years ago, but now so many games outclass it there's no point in playing it. If you want a fast paced shooter that has fixed almost all of these issues, play the sequel Team Fortress 2. It's free.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is a well balanced multiplayer class based first person shooter. The difficulty curve is quite easy for beginners and any newbies can pick up and play this game, one that has a great community and helpful veterans. Clearly the only choice in online multiplayer for this generation.			"

												Well. This game is old, and it kinda shows. I wasn't around in the time it was released, but TFC was probably great back then, just like Half-Life deathmatch was. But was is the key word here, it really hasn't aged well. On modern computers it's unstable and glitchy. I found myself invincible at times, constantly at 1 HP at others, walking backwards through walls. The community with it isn't great either. They're all just judgemental, calling new or unexperienced players ""♥♥♥♥♥♥s"". Hating on the superior (but faithful) sequel, TF2, for it's expansive cosmetic item service and it's popularity. I understand that back in the day many people loved this, but it can't keep up with, well, TF2. I don't reccomend this to anyone other than the purpose of nostalgia. And yeah, that's a fine reason to like or buy a game, I rebought Sonic Adventure, twice. But I don't think that one's aged well either.			"

												As much as I would love to enjoy this game, I find a few things wrong with it:1. Although I think many of you will disagree, it is very repetitive. Why? Because it is not getting any updates. If you do not like repetitiveness, just play team fortress 2.2. I feel like it's missing a lot of color and textures. I mean, compared to the other half-life 1 games, I feel like this is just missing that.and 3. (This goes along with repetitiveness) You are only stuck with certain weapons. Unlike Team Fortress 2, where you can change weapons from classes, and half life, where you can have multiple weapons at at time. I just feel like this is something wrong with this game as wellI feel like I'm going to get alot of hate for this review, but this is my opinion.			"

												Maybe cool to look back on if you like TF2 and to see how far its gone from Quake to this, to Fortress Forever, To TF2. While it is pretty disappointing in todays standards, it is a pretty fun game, but is NOTHING like TF2. Apart from ''The Classic'' Sniper Rifle XD. It is a flagship game which is rather interesting and fun, but doesn't really hold up well today. If you're buying it looking for a similar to TF2 Experience, I would NOT recommend this. Have fun :) "

												I tried this game because I thought it would be like TF2, but with grenades and other cool stuff.After playing this game, I can say that I want Valve to add an update to TF2 that brings various grenades as secondry weapons, (like the snipers Jarate) Some weapons from TFC that got removed from TF2, (Like the nailgun for a scout primary)Some existing weapons to have reskins, (Classic rocket launcher?) and remake the excort mode.The reason why I want to see this stuff in TF2? Its because I would like to experience these things in a way I can actually understand. TFC did nothing to help me. The game was confusing, nothing worked as I expected, and as the song dosn't go...""Anything TFC can do, TF2 can do better... TF2 can do anything better then you.""Its a shame really... I wanted to experiance what TFC had that TF2 couldn't, but the fact there was no way for me to learn how to play (and the fact that theres an infinitely better game for free) Makes me say, don't waste your money. I might need more experiance at playing to enjoy it, but that is experiance im not willing to earn.			"

												I personally can't find much to say about the game, since there are never any active servers to play on. It's not that TFC is a bad game, it's just that it's very old and doesn't attract as big of a player base as it did all those years ago. It's a well-made game and the class roles are unique. If you can find a server to play on or are willing to set up a LAN party with friends, then I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun with this game. Otherwise, you're better off going with another class-based shooter from a more recent era, such as the fantastic sequel, Team Fortress 2.			"

												TF2 isn't much of a ""game"" anymore, but more of a conga sim where you get banned for not being ""friendly,"" so I eventually picked this thing up hoping for TF2 without the roblox community.What I got wasn't what I was expecting, but great nonetheless.  TFC is a quake-style shooter, nothing to it.  Low skill floor, high skill ceiling.  You may have a bit of trouble at first but as soon as you get a good understanding of bunnyhopping and the occasional grenade jump, you're ready to go.Perhaps it doesn't have a lot of players, but you know what?  No big deal.  This game's so much fun, I don't mind only seven servers.  As long as you avoid playing Drippy's 2fort, this game is just great all around, from its leftover quake mechanics to its completely different weapons and style.  Its gamemodes are also a lot of fun-- a Dustbowl where you carry YOUR OWN flag to each point, the insta-capping 5 point Warpath, the civilian escort mission Hunted, and the base assault mission Ravelin.With many more crazy game mechanics, such as engie's building detonation and the demoman's Detpack that can both be a timebomb and a secret path opener, this game is a must-have for someone looking for a good semi-teambaesd multiplayer deathmatch that focuses on objectives rather than KDR.Either join an existing server or make your own using Half-Life's dedicated server tool and make a group for this game, it's up to you.Speaking of Half-Life, did you know once you buy this game you can find all the HL1 soundtrack in the files?  Well, now you do.  Now get fragging!Shameless group promotion:If you're really having trouble finding players for this game, not to worry!  I've started a Steam group called R3VIVE Gaming, and we're entirely dedicated to playing HL1/GoldSrc games every Friday and Saturday night, occasionally being TFC... now at 165 members and counting!http://steamcommunity.com/groups/r3vivegamingCheck us out some time if you're looking for some TFC players, and you can use our Community Game Scheduling forum section to schedule your own matches with members.

												Just an overall great game, the graphics are phenomenal and the gameplay is incredible. I'm never bored and it is always jam packed with action and adventure. Each class is funner than the last and this the maps have never been better. The gameplay is absolutely amazing with the npc's always giving you a challenge and the graphics have never been better. It's like call of duty, But Better! And I didn't think that was possible. This game is just outstanding and quite frankly one of the best games I have ever played.Lol jk this game sucks my fat♥♥♥♥♥♥br>0/5			"

												Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this game, it's just difficult to recommend.Team Fortress Classic is a frantic, but durable shooter. It requires a lot more movement and percision when compared to it's successor, TF2. The problem is, it's a bit too unbalanced in difficulty. Defending teams have a bit too much of an advantage, and the maps don't neccessarily suffice for both teams either. One side always has an advantage, and it doesn't help when teams are unbalanced due to the lack of players.The good thing is, combat still holds up today. New players will be familiar with the weapons, as most of them are similiar in control to their TF2 variants. If one is proficient at TF2, then the Classic classes shouldn't require too much struggle to master. Classic is definitely satisfying and exhilirating, especially when you assign the controls to your preferences. Aside from combat, not much else holds up honestly in Team Fortress Classic. It's fun, there's no doubt, but there's nothing here begging for a purchase. It doesn't hold up like Half-Life does, and it doesn't really hold the strong community needed to support dedicated play. Servers are generally sporadic, and the FoxBot mods only give you so much of an experience.The Verdict:Team Fortress Classic holds up well in gameplay, but the declining amount of players have diminished so much of the possibilities within the game. Many modes and mods have become obsolete, with only a few such as ""Capture the Flag"" surviving.Honestly, only buy Team Fortress Classic if you are a big fan of early 3D shooters like Quake or Doom. If you enjoy those games, Classic will be right up your ally. Just beware of an abundance of vacant servers.(EDIT: 3 thumbs down? C'mon people, don't be so biased. I was honest and said the game was good, but after being so outdated it's only accessible to certain audiences.)			"

												I honestly don't think this game is even worth the $5.00 that it is. There is such little content to go along with the the fact that pretty much nobody plays it anymore. There are also some critical balance issues with some aspects of the game that are either horribly underpowred and horribly overpowered. One prime example of this is the GRENADES, please tell me why every class is allowed to use them. The grenade system is just broken in my opinion because of how spammable they are. I can see why they devs dropped this in TF2. Now I know I haven't played this game for very long AT ALL. But I can already see that it has some major issues that simply make it not worth the $5 it is.			"

												My review for TF2 can be seen here:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056186683/recommended/440This game isn't worth 0.99 let alont 3.99. I hope you don't have a pair of rose colored earbuds to go with those rose tinted goggles because if you do then I hate having to be the one to break this to you. The original Team Fortress sucked! Street Fighter 1 anyone? Oh yeah no one has played it either or ever should for that matter. Wow that was harsh. While not as bad as Street Fighter 1 it's hard to say it's worth playing (Especially in 2016) and to be honest I can't even say that I can see what could have made it a good game to begin with. You may say that it's inovative as it was a teamwork focused hero shooter way before Team Fortress 2 made it cool but even if the original did it first it also did it worst. I recall playing this more than a decade ago when it was bundled with Half-Life and a retail version of Counter Strike. Two out of those three games were awesome. Guess which one wasn't? The gunplay is awful, the maps are bad, the balance is nonexistant and the graphics even for it's time are just awful with no appeal what so ever unless you like the color brown and generic Quake wannabes. It has aged terribly and it about as much fun as playing Miscreated or Street Fighter 1. Stay away and play Team Fortress 2 instead.			"

												It's hard to believe TF2 came from this, but amazing all this same. That aside, this game is a class based multiplayer FPS with outdated graphics. There is little point to saying much about this as everything good to come from this has been upgraded and made free in the sequel; unless you specifically love this game for some reason, like a love for the graphic style or some other reason maybe.2/15 ""Just get TF2 for free""			"

												TFC is not like it's illustrious sequel TF2 in many  ways.The  menus can  be difficult to use.  A example of  this problem is when you change classes it can  sometimes tab out. This might be  due to settings on my computer so I am not saying it is a problem with  the  game.The sniper in TFC  can be difficult to play as the cross hair is tiny.Rocket jumping in TFC  is almost impossible as you will die from  the damage.Spy is basically broken in TFC  the slow menus  and the  speed of  the  game don't  work  well.Overall I  would not  recommend this game to  play, rather collect it for your steam library.I'm  a  big  fan  of  TF2  and  to find  out  how  it began was actually kinda funny.

There was a couple from Texas who was planning a weekend trip across the Mexican border for a shopping spree. At the last minute, their baby-sitter canceled, so they had to bring along their two year old son with them. They had been across the border for an hour when the boy got free and ran around the corner. The mother tried to find him, but he was missing. The mother found a police officer who told her to go to the gate and wait. Not really understanding the instructions, she did as she was told.About 45 minutes later, a Mexican man approached the border, carrying the boy. The mother ran to him, grateful that he had been found. When the man realized it was the boy's mother, he dropped him and ran. The police were waiting for him. The boy was dead, and in the 45 minutes he was missing, he had been cut open, all of his organs removed, and stuffed with bags of cocaine. The man was going to carry him across the border as if he were asleep. "

												I dont see the point in this game anymore...dont get me wrong i love it just for the fact that it spawned a sequel (even though its Hat Simulator 2 now) but i just dont see what the point of playing it is. the classes dont feel that much different, the engie didnt make sense to me, the spies disguise takes what felt like 10 minutes to actually disguise...If your one of those broken-brained people who likes CoD, or Counter Strike then by all means go ahead, just saying the 2nd is way better in many ways than the graphics.Peace			"

												Is it worth it? Maybe. Team Fortress 2 is better, free,more items and not dead. But TFC is different. Don't expect to buy this game and play in many servers, it's dead. Some classes are ueless. Scouts useless. Pyro is broken. and B-hoping is annyoing. But it's fun if you just want to play a game casualy. and the grenades suck. Game looks good for Gold Source. But killing people takes to long, but other people can kill you people in easy. and the pub server sucks. To much spam! and the community is terible. Only buy if you are ready to play with few people, and don't get mad quickly!			"

												The game would be fun if it had training or at least told you the basics, but it doesn't. Since its just like TF2, but with a little bit more features (sentries explode and hurt nearby people when they run out of health, grenades, other stuff) its better to get TF2, in my opinion. I might pick it back up if it actually gets updated with training or a way to find out more information for the game. (Yes, I know there is guides and stuff like that, but I would like to know the game by playing its training mode, not by searching it up.)			"

												The best FPS ever created.  This was my first online gaming experience and still ranks as the best.  Quality gameplay and solidity that is lacking in today's modern FPS games.  This was one of the first games to incorporate a multi-class system (besides the original Quake version of course).  There are no hats, unlockable items, powerups, killstreaks, or other gimmicks included to compensate for lack of gameplay quality.  A true gem.  I have had more fun with this game than anything I ever played.  To most people TFC would be considered a dinosaur of a game in 2011 (graphics and engine wise) many of the servers are now desolate or filled with bots.  But if you are a lover of old school shooters or want to feel some serious gaming nostalgia from the 90's I highly suggest this game, worth the $5 price it costs.			"

												TF2's unbelieveable younger brother, Team Fortress is just too unworthy to anyone that has been spoiled with TF2's superior graphics, enhanced differences to classes, different weapons, and, probably the biggest and best gimmick of all, free.  However, as this is the game that spawned the worlds best f2p, this game deserves some good feedback.  Since it has lower graphics, everything loads faster, and it gave me nostalgia like no other!  I recommend this for anybody who has a terrible computer, or that wants a standard old-school shooter.			"

												Team Fortress Classic, Yes I played TF2 Before  this one, I picked it up to enjoy the original experience. Its tough its a tough game to get kills on. Heaps of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns like the Nail gun which is so useless it cannot kill. If you wanna dominate you gotta go heavy. You'll be dying heaps as scout,spy, pyro who's flame thrower is useless you'll be using the fire rocket launcher most the time. Every class has grenades and a special grenade. Engineer's sentry gun is awesome probs one of the better classes. IDK how to be good at it, im better at tf2. I'd recommend you pick it up if you're a true fan of TF2 and classic valve games.8/10-Hard but fun!			"

												Ah Team Fortress Classic a good old FPS. The game is basicly like TF2 but with no hats or additonal content. the game is pretty good overall. Though the only problem I have run into is the balancing of the servers, long story short there is none which in my opinion is if your going to take a mod for Half Life 1 and make it a stand  alone game INPROVE ON IT! Now its not that I don't like this game, I do like the wide varitey of people still playing it even though the game came out in 1999. Team Fortress 2 is a superior game but TFC is were it all begun. So the only way I recommend this game is if you liked TF2 or if you want a nostagia trip. So my final verdict would be a 4/10 slightly below average.			"

												I played it for about an hour and have NO PLANS OF STOPPING. Jesus, no wonder this game was so popular. I'm a huge TF2 fan and wanted to see what precreded it and if it was as good....well I'm happy to say my expectations were blown out of the water. As it stands, I current like this much more than TF2 for many reasons. The gameplay is like TF2 before it was bogged down with tons of unbalanced weapons and other additions that, while some were very well thought out, generally throw the gameplay into whack.In short, 10/10. I love this game. My only complain is the lack of a bots only practice mode but eh, it's hardly even an issue.			"

												I would recommend this game if it is still alive. seriously just to show you how much this game is dead:there 1000 server i would say that there liek 10 that have players (usually just one guy in there for no reason) and plus there is almost no way to create bot without entering something into the console			"

												If you want to play TF2, but don't have enough disc space for it's insane size, don't worry! TFC is for you! Although gameplay is somewhat different, you still get the great team play vibe. Overall a very fun and fast-paced game.			"

												This game is very fun and can catch you off guard with something random and make you eather rage or just laugh. Some parts of the game can be broken like the elevator on both bases on 2fort, but meh the game was made in 1999 so can't blame them. The game has one thing that made a laugh at the begging, In 2fort (It's like the olny map I play) you can pee  in urinal... BEAT THAT CALL OF DUTY!			"

												Take a trip down to where TF all started! I have soo many hours on this game mostly before steam was a thing. most times during the Day in CA time you will find Multiple Full servers. At night however there are very little playing. Besides that there are soo many rediculous things in this game that make it fun, Like grenade jumping, bhopping, demo spam, you know all of what you love about tf2 just in a more frustrating manner. However I am yet to find a more satisfying sniper experience.			"

												No hats and big hitboxes for kids.  Deal with it. Gameplay > graphics.  However, I'd go to TF2 anyday over playing at f ucking Drippy's 2fort, which is nothing but a sterilised, b astardised TFC with nothing but noobs who get pwned by people who use advanced movement.  If you really want to play TFC, don't go to Drippy's or anywhere else that disallows bhop/strafe movement.  Other than that, TFC is great, but not better than Quake Team Fortress.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is a hectic fast paced battle arena, this game is a great cheap alternate to quake. Although if you do have the budget I would reccomend getting quake.Pros:-Everyone is P2P-Runs great on crappy computers-Great for couch co-opCons:-Not many players-Grenades are constantly spammed-No customizationIn conclusion, if you're looking for a fast-paced FPS game that you can enjoy with you friends I would highly reccomend Team Fortress Classic.

												Back in 2006 I began playing TFC  until TF2 game out then everyone started to migrate. In my opinion,  TFC had the best player base than TF2, people were more friendly, willing to teach instead of shooting you dead in your tracks as in TF2. TFC was also more of a skill learning for some servers for the concussion granade which is not available in TF2, those were the great days, don't get me wrong TF2 is a great upgrade, I just find TFC had a bit more of a friendlier player base when it was a thing.

												Even though this game is quite old, it is still a legendary game loved by many FPS fans. I personally find this Team Fortress instalment one of the best, including Team Fortress 2. However, the burning question is this game worth it? Well, let's put it like this; if you are into fast-paced FPS games like Fortress Forever, sure! However, before you play this game, I would recomend trying out Fortress Forever before trying Classic out. If you like the feel of Fortress Forever, you'll like Team Fortress Classic. It's a bit more difficult to figure out at first than TF2, but you'll eventualy get used to it. Overall, this is the best FPS out there.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is not at all what I was expecting when I launched it for the first time. I went in assuming I was going to be playing an old school downgrade of Team Fortress 2. I was wrong, TFC is in its own rights a completely different game at first glance. The story, the graphics, and even the controls feel different, but if you play it long enough you will come to find that the game is Team Fortress at its core. The game itself has all the Team Fortress 2 ""DNA"" in there you just dont quite see it at first. If you play a while you will not only feel the Team Fortress-ness in the game (its the original Team Fortress so obviously) But you will get to see where the masterpiece that is Team Fortress 2 comes from, you get to see its ""roots"" so to speak. That in and of itself should be reason enough to play, but If I have not convinced you yet here is another reason, the best reason to play as a matter of fact. Team Fortress Classic is fun!			"

												Team Fortress Classic is an interesting game. It has some of the same elements as its predacessor yet it is very different at the same time. Like for example how the capture point is on the balcony of the base in 2fort instead of in the basement, and the Medic doesnt have a Medigun that can heal at a distance. Like most GoldSource Engine multiplayer games, there isnt a TON of people playing, but there is still enough people playing to get the full experience. I reccomend getting this on sale, just to try it.			"

												Ok, first, for those who compares to TF2 : CUT THE CRAP. Seriously dudes, of course it's not the same game at all, this one is from 99. Do you even remember how video games were in 99 ? TFC was a ♥♥♥♥ing revolution still active today with 100+ servers. It deserves respect, at least. Then, we can talk about the ♥♥♥♥ing veterans of TFC who still play today, after like 10 years, grenade spamming... The type of guy who annoys you to death because he kills you EVERY TIME calling you noob. Well, i'm this guy, and yeah, totally : you're a giant noob and it's fun to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off. We don't really need new players and it's always funny to see your Ragequit. If you have the good attitude, asking how basically grenades works and stuff, people will help you indeed, but 99,9% of time, people thought they will rek everyone ingame with their awesome skills and get frustrated. That's life, get over it. Now, I understand that TF2 originally people will not love this game, but still : don't criticize such a piece of art.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is a fast class-based FPS. Despite some slight class balance issues the mechanics are extremely solid and the game itself is incredibly fun. It is old with clunky graphics yet has aged incredibly well with a variety of game modes and a huge amount of player created content.The biggest downside to the title is the lack of players, but due to its popularity in the past there are still a number of servers and a small yet dedicated community. This unfortunately does limit you to a fairly small selection of maps that are being actively played.If you can spare the money, I would not hesitate to give this game a try. It still has some life to it and I readily list it as one of my favourite FPS games of all time.			"

												This game is average good, not as good as counter strike or day of defeat. But its good when you are in the mood of playing. Servers are dead, but not entirely. Maybe like 2-3 servers still up and running and has people. This game is about objectives such as sending your flag into enemy base or capture the flag. Just remember that everyone has alot of HP (like how it is with half-life basically, but can take more explosives, ALOT).Update: So after playing this a while now there are some things I'm going to say, but nonetheless I still recommend it because there were actually fun moments when playing this even though despite the servers are pretty much dead but not entirely (as said above), because there are some flaws that can and will make the game boring unless you are interested in this kind of stuff (to me, it doesnt as I just want a regular competitive match). So here are the pros and cons I've seen throughout playing this.Pros:There are moments in some servers where Team Based are really Team Based, where you work together with your team whether to get the objective in the enemy base, or grab the objective from the enemy base to your base.Mods as usual has some fun stuff, I had a blast playing them and it has its moments when that server has people and sometimes its dead. But when theres people, theres the fun. Preferably the mod maps were alot of fun.Now for cons, and those tend to happen fairly often. I wouldnt say TFC is the worst because otherwise I wouldnt be playing it and would have given a negative review otherwise.Cons:Most of the classes are useless in some servers. Mainly due to some classes overusing special grenades that gives them a super boost (such as medic and scout), depending on the servers you play, if you are playing defense you will run into them VERY often, wondering why isnt offense taking care of them. Especially when multiple people comes in.Bhopping, lets just say I have a love-hate relationship with Bhopping. Times it was fun, times it gets annoying. In this game, depending on servers once again, its annoying. Mainly on flag captures, as people say it takes ""Skill"". Yeah, thats true. But you know what it can also do? Scare away players, and kill the server. Making it dead (and its not the kind of where the server crashes, its the kind of where you'll end up either playing alone or 2v2, maybe less). Considering the majority of servers are already dead. Unless you love Bhopping, or just want to get into it to make the game balanced. Go for it. To me, its what makes it boring. But nonetheless I still come back and play it.I cant really say what needs to be fixed considering this is a very old game. But if you love Bhopping, you are welcome here. If you are not, just hope you get good teams or for the very least are good enough to hunt down these bhoppers. Just be aware of overused grenades and use classes that can help tip the balance for the team. There are teams like that, so if its a balanced match, you'll have a fun time.			"

												17 years later and I'm still playing this, so I doubt I'll ever stop. I was in the clan that had baconbowl_r's creator in it, so it's always nice to get that map randomly. Out of practice with concjumps but decent enough to get to the opposite fort on 2forts.Graphics are totally outdated but it gives my GPU a break at max FPS. Import your own sprays; lots of possiblities there. Got my mouse sensitivity turned all the way up, still has some of the best FPS movement and aiming today. More balanced than the Quakeworld mod but you can be a one-person army here unlike TF2.Much more fun to find a server with actual players. Especially on co-op maps where there's one person with a clue trying to help everyone else.			"

We didn't have any fancy medi-beam guns, just our AIDs box, and we liked it!  We all had a crowbar, and we liked it!  We all had grenades, and we liked it!TF2 is fine and all, but it's growing too fast in too little a time span.  TF/C is the grand-daddy of them all and is still best if you ask me.			"

												TF2's unbelieveable younger brother, Team Fortress is just too unworthy to anyone that has been spoiled with TF2's superior graphics, enhanced differences to classes, different weapons, and, probably the biggest and best gimmick of all, free.  However, as this is the game that spawned the worlds best f2p, this game deserves some good feedback.  Since it has lower graphics, everything loads faster, and it gave me nostalgia like no other!  I recommend this for anybody who has a terrible computer, or that wants a standard old-school shooter.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is class-based team multiplayer game, centered around 9 classes and capping flags. While it was released at first as free official mod for HL1, it's now being sold serapately on Steam. And it got a very tough rival, Team Fortress 2, that is completely free.I can say that game community is not dead yet and at certain hours you can encounter a server with some good 10-18 players game going. So, can still purchase. But there are times when servers are empty too, yes.Now, how does it compare to it's more popular TF2 brother? Well, it's much more centered on capping the flag, even Dustbowl map is centered around bringing map to the end. And the point where you cap the flag (it has team symbol on floor) is actually a different place from where flags are actually placed, mroe upfront, cutting long walks through your own base when you are bringing enemy team flag. It has mode where you have to bring Citizen class player to the end safe, but I don't see it being played nowadays at all. It's not as polished as TF2, like you can't always clearly tell color of the player when he stands in shadow. Almost all melee weapons are useless by comparison. And the game is spammy. (Almost) every class got explosive grenades (poor poor single entrance chokepoint in Dustbowl part 3)! Once you press grenade button you have around 5 seconds before it explodes, and you can just hold it for a while so you can time it to explode right when it's thrown at enemy. And I tell you, explosive grenades are powerful, making most fights last only 5 seconds, whetever it's soldier versus sniper or what not. And spammable. Get ready to be seeing those explosion sprites through which you can't see at all, while hearing more random explosion sounds somewhere else all the time.And then there are medics bunnyhopping their butts into your base, destroying every sentry and then grenade-jump out to cap the flag. And you can't stop them.Well, what I can say about gameplay in short is that is more fast-paced and rewards old-school skills (like bunny-hoping) for pro players, but it's not as balanced as TF2, neither it's as smooth. Just chaos and people bunnyhopping. As for detail classes info:Scout - The fastest class, yet the puniest. Not only his health is low, but with single-shotgun and nailgun his damage is non-existent, very unlike Scout in TF2. For grenades he got no explosives, just spikes that he can leave around self (never seen it being used good) to slow down enemies and Conc-grenade, that allows him not only to confuses enemy (their view would start to tilt around) but also allows to do grenade-jump with no harm for player. He would have been most perfect for capping flags. IF forget about Medic, who is about as mobile as Scout AND packs more health and firepower!Soldier - Strong class with supershotgun and rocket launcher, which is the best when shot at ground. Has few excplosive grenades. Good at defense and attack. Not many differences from TF2 counterpart.Pyro - A victim of being overnerfed, when compared to Quake TF. This one isn't exactly fast and got two weapons that can set enemy on fire (and normal shotgun) - flamethrower, close-range weapon, that does pathetic damage and cannon that shoots fire rockets that are much slower than Soldier ones and not as strong. Afterburn, while theorically can stack up, is not something to be proud of - it only does 8HP damage for whole duration that it lasts. Never seen anybody die from this. Got explosive grenades, one of them is fire related. Just use Soldier.Demolition Man - Defensive explosive class. Has grenade launcher that shoots nades that explodes on click (no, they don't stick), has grenade launcher with grenades that behave like your everyday nades and got shotgun. Explosive grenades - check. Mostly there to camp near flag/corridor and blow his silly nades in case of bunny. Not as allmighty as in TF2. Also got detpacks, timed HUGE explosive, which he can set up from the game menu (""shift"" by default). Not much good for combat, but he got ""one pony trick"" - you can use it to blow some special walls in some maps.Heavy Weapons Guy - Got shotguns and minigun. Deadly, strong. Not much different from his strong brother from TF2, only this one ALSO packs explosive grenades. Good joy.Engineer - Area denial class. Nope, kidding, his sentries last only one push at most. He packs supershotgun and some laster-pistol thing that goes through bodies and he got explosive grenades. Good thing he can build sentry, dispenser and teleporters using game menu interface, which wastes metal, that every other player also carries by default. So if you are playing another class and see friendly engy - ""discard ammo"" from menu. No worries, it only discards ammo your class doesn't uses at all.His teleporters aren't nothing bad, though they don't seem to make a big deal in this TF. Neither does Dispenser, which while useful and give away ammo and armor (but not health!), don't make much impact and don't give you enough metal to use it effectively like in TF2. Though they make good explosive mines, when you manually destruct them... And then there is Sentry, which defends area with dual miniguns. Yet it's only good for killing rushers, it gets destroyed very quickly, as unlike TF2 you can't really tank and keep it running. Hell, it barely stops Medics assault. So rebuild, rebuild, rebuild and hope to survive, being less improtant than in TF2.Medic - Oh, sorry, it's COMBAT medic. Not the TF2-style healer, no, he is the perfect assault and flag capping class, who outdoes scout! He is fast, passing and strafecircling enemies. He isn't weak. He has supershotgun to deal huge damage and supernailgun that is ideal to quickly destroy sentry guns. He got a conc-grenade to confuse enemies and to allow self to grenade-jump, also gaining extreme speed and bunnyhopping not worse than scout. AND he got normal explosive grenade too. And has passive health regeneration.Oh, and he is medic. He got medkit which he can attempt to apply on teammates that run around, healing them. But it's not comfortable and at best used only when not busy doing his combat thing. Oh, and you can apply it to enemy, infecting them with poison. That, unlike afterburn, does more damage, never ends and can even spread. Do share. Puts Pyro to even bigger shame.Sniper - Got sniper-rilfe, automated mode of sniper rifle and nailgun. Does his usual sniping thing, though some may be uncomfortable with headshot hitbox. Spends his time moving around freely and gibbing enemy players once charged enough. In case of emergency can use auto-sniper rifle to quickly waste his ammo doing high accurate hitscan damage. Oh, and he got freaking explosive grenade. Not a puppy, as you can see.Spy - Light class that tries to outwit enemy team with usage of clunky game menu. He got supershotgun (wow!), nailgun, some pistol thing that shoots single nail that slows down target (theorically good against those medics if forget just how slow that projectile is!) and knife with which you can backstab. All of them break disguise. Also has explosive grenade and some funky area ""drunkening"" grenade, none of which break your disguise.And yes, like a proper spy, he got few tricks with usage of awkward in-game menu. First, he can disguise as any class on any team (by the way, friendly will see you as that class and you may end up being blown around map). Unlike TF2, you will notice that it takes really long time to disguise, but unlike TF2 it's harder to tell away disguised spy as you can't pass through friendlies either. So, worth it. Instead of having ability to cloak, spy has ability to feign death at his wish. He can be still killed and your model will turn where you are looking, but otherwise most player don't spycheck corpses either and can pass through you. Not bad. Just have to maneuver yourself though explosive-spammed envirmoments of the game.			"

Truly there may be some downsides and even some possibility of not even being able to get on the top 5 but still gives a true 9 class, teamwork background.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is not at all what I was expecting when I launched it for the first time. I went in assuming I was going to be playing an old school downgrade of Team Fortress 2. I was wrong, TFC is in its own rights a completely different game at first glance. The story, the graphics, and even the controls feel different, but if you play it long enough you will come to find that the game is Team Fortress at its core. The game itself has all the Team Fortress 2 ""DNA"" in there you just dont quite see it at first. If you play a while you will not only feel the Team Fortress-ness in the game (its the original Team Fortress so obviously) But you will get to see where the masterpiece that is Team Fortress 2 comes from, you get to see its ""roots"" so to speak. That in and of itself should be reason enough to play, but If I have not convinced you yet here is another reason, the best reason to play as a matter of fact. Team Fortress Classic is fun!			"

												I'm im-between on this game its not bad but some of the weapon and class balancing is bad like the fact that the rocket launcher does enough damage to nearly kill a scout and the grenades are nice but they are annoying because im playing i kill someone and i die because of there grenade and some grenades are just WAY to powerful if i was to rate this i would say 3/5 has issues but it is somewhat enjoyable play this if you like fps'.

												I played it for about an hour and have NO PLANS OF STOPPING. Jesus, no wonder this game was so popular. I'm a huge TF2 fan and wanted to see what precreded it and if it was as good....well I'm happy to say my expectations were blown out of the water. As it stands, I current like this much more than TF2 for many reasons. The gameplay is like TF2 before it was bogged down with tons of unbalanced weapons and other additions that, while some were very well thought out, generally throw the gameplay into whack.In short, 10/10. I love this game. My only complain is the lack of a bots only practice mode but eh, it's hardly even an issue.			"

												I spent countless hours playing this when I was small. It's fun, but it's not as fun as I remembered it could be. All I remember about this game is griefing my team by stealing the enemy's keycard in Rock2 (the one with the gas chamber) and bringing it back to my team's gas chamber, where the card was useless (you had to steal their card and take it to their gas chamber). Hours upon hours of ""u ♥♥♥♥ing noob ur so stupid"" and general expletivery ensued, usually ending when the enemy team burst into my team's gas chamber to kill me. But yeah. I think there are still people playing this game, which is more than I can say for Red Orchestra.			"

												Team Fortress Classic is an interesting game. It has some of the same elements as its predacessor yet it is very different at the same time. Like for example how the capture point is on the balcony of the base in 2fort instead of in the basement, and the Medic doesnt have a Medigun that can heal at a distance. Like most GoldSource Engine multiplayer games, there isnt a TON of people playing, but there is still enough people playing to get the full experience. I reccomend getting this on sale, just to try it.			"

												Can this be considered a mod of a mod?  I dunno.  There was team fortress for quake.  Hl1 is based off the q2 engine.  And this is the team fortress mod for hl1.  This predates tf2 by quite a few years.  Came out in the late 90's.  Back before Steam.  During WON.  You know what that is if you've played.  Great game.  Many things to master.  Fantastic maps.  VERY high replayability.  A game that never gets old.  Been going strong for 12+ years.  The community has shrunk alot.  A lot of servers have bots.  But still a few good servers with old pros and grizzled veterans.  Dustbowl still extremely popular.  Much better than tf2.  $5.  Buy it and help support a dying breed.			"

If Bunny hop is onMedic: If he isn't racing to capture the flag, he's healing/ infecting youSniper: Total try hard, Sits around all day taking pot shots at other snipers, or passing players trying to complete objectives, does not play any other class and is often with another sniper on the same team, no different compared to the TF2 snipers.Civilian: Helplessly getting killed while running from the enemy team.Notes: You can smell my salt on the sniper part.Get the game if you want something you can play for a bit at almost any location with decent internet.

												It's a good game however Team Fortress 2 as most people will agree is so much better and is also free. But if you don't like Team Fortress 2 I reccomend you trying this out as it's much more like the other First person shooters.			"

												After valve's... arguably most bugged and broken update from tf2 i took a break from it and started playing this old gem.I tried it a few times before 'meet your match' and i thought it was a fun gimmicky original that was ok at best.I was wrong.Playing this game for longer makes you realise how tf2 became what it is today and suprisingly tfc can stand on its own.While tf2 has its own in depth strategy so does tfc in a lot of ways. Medic is more combat focused an genrally more fun to play for me, soldier is as great as always, and spy is, well.... staisfying.'BUT QUARTERMASTER YOU MISSED THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE OF THIS GAME'Yeah, the game is dead. Not being mean or anything but its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ true as many servers are empty or full of bots. Fortunately the community that is still beating is an amazing one.Theyre less toxic since this game is the meaning of casual,so much so I could say i would rather play 2fort in tfc than tf2.Anyhow if you're a bit bored of tf2 but wanna try something incredibly similar (cos this agme first duh)Give tfc a shotTrust me its worth it.(Also i dont think ive found a single russian on a game so far so take advantage of this while you can) "

												17 years later and I'm still playing this, so I doubt I'll ever stop. I was in the clan that had baconbowl_r's creator in it, so it's always nice to get that map randomly. Out of practice with concjumps but decent enough to get to the opposite fort on 2forts.Graphics are totally outdated but it gives my GPU a break at max FPS. Import your own sprays; lots of possiblities there. Got my mouse sensitivity turned all the way up, still has some of the best FPS movement and aiming today. More balanced than the Quakeworld mod but you can be a one-person army here unlike TF2.Much more fun to find a server with actual players. Especially on co-op maps where there's one person with a clue trying to help everyone else.			"

												Ah Team Fortress Classic a good old FPS. The game is basicly like TF2 but with no hats or additonal content. the game is pretty good overall. Though the only problem I have run into is the balancing of the servers, long story short there is none which in my opinion is if your going to take a mod for Half Life 1 and make it a stand  alone game INPROVE ON IT! Now its not that I don't like this game, I do like the wide varitey of people still playing it even though the game came out in 1999. Team Fortress 2 is a superior game but TFC is were it all begun. So the only way I recommend this game is if you liked TF2 or if you want a nostagia trip. So my final verdict would be a 4/10 slightly below average.			"

All I remember about this game is griefing my team by stealing the enemy's keycard in Rock2 (the one with the gas chamber) and bringing it back to my team's gas chamber, where the card was useless (you had to steal their card and take it to their gas chamber). Hours upon hours of ""u ♥♥♥♥ing noob ur so stupid"" and general expletivery ensued, usually ending when the enemy team burst into my team's gas chamber to kill me. But yeah. I think there are still people playing this game, which is more than I can say for Red Orchestra.			"

												Team Fortresss Classic is a first-person shooter based on the famous QuakeWorld mod of the same name. Team Fortress Classic pits you against Red, Blue, Green and Yellow teams in different maps to capture their points or flags, capturing the final point wins the game.When this mod started out in Quake World, an online hub for playing Quake and other mods, Team Fortress Classic was taken in by VALVE who hired Robin 'Bro' Walker, Ian 'Scuba' Caughley and John 'Jojie' Cook (the guys who also do TF2!), Diaman Scott (who did the demo, i believe its on Youtube) and developed what is essentially one of the best mods of all time.Team Fortess Classic is fantastic not because it has hats. Actually this was before even hats existed, before it was even F2P. Hell, there was no custom weapons and only stock! But the fun from this game is astoudingly high, due its varied weapon system, greandes (Oh yes, lots of them).			"

												I played this game since it first came out in 1999, but only started to play it via steam recently. It is one of the best team based multiplayer games, so if you are one of those players that enjoyed PC games throughout the 90s, then you have to get this game.The only cons about this game are:1. Only about 1-2 regular servers left that run the original TFC that is not moded and bugged, lagged out to hell. (1 in US, 1 in Europe, all other servers are always empty). 2. The other 2-3 servers that still are available are moded, they run like crap, make lag in-game.3. In the regular servers where the original game still plays normal, you got a few, not many, but a few people that use hacks. This will make playing certain classes very frustrating. There are really only a few, but the problem is, once they log on, they just don't leave, so you end up quitting the game yourself.If you are ok with what I wrote above, then get this game. I love this game until the 2-3 same hackers show up.			"

												If u have a windows 7 pc labtop dont get it1!! It wont luach it will it just will show the main menu screnn for a second then the game screen goes all black and when u press the windows key it will start saying something about hl1 has stopped working, trying to figure a way to slove the problem              then after its done it will shut the game down so no matter wat if u click cancel or wait it will shut the game off so if u wait for some response u wasted ur time!!! Why i recomend this game is becuase i looked at gameplay it lookes cool and fun for a old school game and also i hate it becuase it wont luanch up for me and windows 7 labtop pcs...how i know it wont work on other windows 7 labtop pcs is becuase i was talking to one of my friends on steam and they had the same problem on their other computer!!! Valve make this game to be able to play for windows 7 labtop pcs..if u dont i want my god d*nm money back...but wait u cant have refunds on steam!!! Wat bullsh*t!			"

												This game is absolutely amazing i just recently picked it up and it is well worth the price this shows that you dont need hats and other stuff like in tf2 , i mean this game is really good i love the gameplay and everything about it. For some people it will turn them off cause of the graphics but who cares just give it a shot and see how amazing this game really is!			"

												The game feels really nice, I got it a while back when I was unable to play team fortress 2 as my PC wasn't strong enough.  The game is like a mix of half life deathmatch, and counterstrike, doesn't feel too much like team fortress.  Loved this game for a long time!			"

												I sort of perfer this over TF2. This one requires more skill and isn't riddled with extra purchases. What you see is what you get!			"

												Its actually a really cool game. It has many interesting  gameplay mechanics that arent in tf2.  One of my favorite features in this game is that a spy can play dead. This makes for many new crazy scenarios. So if you like tf2 you would love to see its ancestor. It explains why a lot of the cool features made it to tf2. So buy it			"

												Even though this game is quite old, it is still a legendary game loved by many FPS fans. I personally find this Team Fortress instalment one of the best, including Team Fortress 2. However, the burning question is this game worth it? Well, let's put it like this; if you are into fast-paced FPS games like Fortress Forever, sure! However, before you play this game, I would recomend trying out Fortress Forever before trying Classic out. If you like the feel of Fortress Forever, you'll like Team Fortress Classic. It's a bit more difficult to figure out at first than TF2, but you'll eventualy get used to it. Overall, this is the best FPS out there.			"

												May say I played this very little but I did play it a little before on a friends steam account before I really had steam myself. I liked it a lot better than TF2, it's not free to play cancer and it's not cartoony as ♥♥♥♥. Also has less meme cancer in it. Over all a more solid game. Feels like CS but slightly better.			"

												Still fun to play and it runs on every laptop I have, even one from  '07. It still is a well balanced game with defense and offence sided levels, like older games used to have. I wish I could play it with a 360 controller like I can with CSS but I can live with using a mouse.			"

												I loved Team Fortress Two when I was REALLY little. But, after a few minutes of playing the game, even back then, I realized that the community is cancerous, and all have Type 1 ""Leafy Syndrome"".This game I did not play much at all, but I got to play the classic version of a game I used to play, and I felt like that was enough for me.

												This game is still fun to play even though I feel has been overshadowed by its sequel. This gameplay though is still very fun and controls very well. This you like TF2, then you'll probably like this game. Its graphics are pretty similar if not exactly like Half Life and Counter Strike. It still thought has that competitive charm that later gave birth to TF2.			"

												Hands down the best online team-based game I have ever played and it goes so much further than just a capture the flag HL mod. The creativity that has been expressed within the TFC community over the years is vast and impressive. Some of my richest memories playing any game period comes from TFC during its peak of activity. Such a tragedy that a majority of the community just disappeared in the face of ever-increasing technology. Sad. Will always love TFC. <3			"
