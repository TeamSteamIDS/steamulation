												Apart from this being a boring game with controls so bad that it causes dizziness, I don't recommend this game because of the behaviour of the developers themselves.Because of its low User Score on Metacritic (4.7 out of 10), the devs made an official announcement where they asked gamers to spam-vote perfect 10s in order to manipulate the result, while at the same time calling those who gave them low reviews ""morons"" and ""trolls"", among other insults. When I and a few others remarked on how unprofessional that was, we had our comments and posts deleted, as well as our names included in a very public ""Hall of Shame"" (which was also deleted a few days later) where the developers attempted to ridicule and humiliate us as ""trolls"".When almost no one posted any favourable user reviews on Metacritic, they asked Steam to remove their Metacritic score from the game's store page, as it gave them bad publicity (and that's why it's no longer here), but not before one of the developers (called Alexander ""motorsep"" Zubov) posted a fake review, giving his own game a 9 out of 10.Companies that behave in such anti-consumer ways don't deserve any business.

												It's nice, now and then, to high-five top-down shooters with an old-school spirit, especially ones that promise 'hordes of smart enemies', 'destructible worlds', and the under-rated added bonus of 'ground-shaking explosions'.The bizarrely named Kot In Action Creative Artel evidently believes that Steel Storm shouldn't merely ape the endlessly scrolling Xevious style, and instead puts a more exploratory, objective-based spin on the shooting.What follows is somewhat less thrilling, sadly. After bursting through the traps all guns blazing with its explosive scenery and intricate art style, the game quickly settles into a numbing monotony where the incessant rattle of gunfire begins to bore through your skull.Apart from having to destroy anything in range, level objectives tend to have you moving backwards and forwards between two places, disabling force-fields and accessing new areas to take down specific installations.But the one-note nature of the single-player quickly proves to be the game's undoing. One level blurs into the next and the repetition grinds you down. Additional weapons and new enemies help, but it's not enough to save a game that lacks a creative spark and the necessary variety to spur you on. Overall 4/10.			"

												The ideas of a bullet-hell shmup with none of the polished audio, visual, or gameplay elements. Acceleration on your vehicle gives you a sluggish, floaty, imprecise feeling when you try to dodge bullets and stuff. Worst part about it is it gave me motion sickness because of how the camera is always moving based on where you are facing, but also because of the acceleration component of the turning and moving. The gameplay/level design is very old school and simple and consists of completing a certain number of objectives per map. A lot of times you'll be shooting at enemies offscreen or they'll be shooting at you, which is stupid and not fun.			"

July 18, 2015I genuinely forgot about Steel Storm until the trading card update. The 90 minutes I played some years ago wasn't impressive. And coming back to it today, the game is shockingly familiar. The single-player campaign is the same, no improvements or changes stuck out.Unfortunately, that campaign is pretty boring. I played a few more missions this time, but according to the only Steam guide on the game, I've seen almost every enemy except the final boss in just a few missions. The levels are bland, focused heavily on backtracking and trap sections. The AI is nothing impressive, even for 2011 standards, with most enemies being simple to fight. The only challenge of the game is the approach of traps and spawns. Even though these traps quickly become predictable, you can still be quickly overwhelmed as enemies spawn in all directions. Basic enemies can be threatening, and I've lost 100% of my health to a salvo of rockets I couldn't avoid. Due to this, the best approach is to exploit corners and weapons so enemies can't get a clear shot. Going toe-to-toe with hitscan enemies is a fight you can't win, so the strongest approach is to kill them blindly.Pretty simply, the game is very underwhelming. It feels mediocre for a shooter, especially at the price point. Maybe multiplayer is better, but the community is not very active. Steel Storm doesn't really do anything special or noteworthy, and really isn't a game worth remembering.			"

												Steel Storm: Retribution is a good indie attempt at the shoot’em up genre, but if this came out as an AAA title, it will instantly fail. In terms of graphics, this game is average at best, the lighting is very low-key. I would say it is about the same as Zombie Driver in terms of graphics. The level design, although very nicely colored, is extremely repetitive. The layout is different yes, but the core mechanics of beating the map is the same. On the other hand, the weaponry in this game is fantastic, it’s a shame the devs implemented them completely wrong. Instead of making special weapons into an upgrade system, they made it based off of cool down. As a result, they immediately killed off any chance of re-playability for the game. On the bright side the enemy mechs are nicely done, they look fantastic and the bosses do offer much difficulty and requires mad kiting skills to kill. Overall an okay game to play with some friends for about 15 minutes before boredom kicks in.			"

												At its core, Steel Storm: Burning Retribution is a truly fun and exciting shooter game. It has you fighting off waves of enemy tanks while trying to meet various map objectives (sometimes through up-sized levels). The game features 19 levels in the main campaign; an additional 8 level user generated campaign plus an additional 6 maps for skirmish play rounds up the collection. Multiplayer is a doozy with Deathmatch and CTF. Their latest add-on: a free MOBA style game currently in its alpha development stage known as AMMO - Armored Modernized Mobile Operations is great fun to play. So, if you like a ""free-range"" style shooter that has you exploring huge maps, then this game is for you!			"

												Honestly not sure about this one. The multiplayer has been nothing but laggy, I don't feel like I'm rewarded at all for deathmatch, thereby making it pointless to play [and it doesn't help that people use cheap tactics like spawn camping], and it's kind of unremarkable. It doesn't help that when leaving the game, it berates you like you're some sort of video game invalid by telling you, ""Sorry there was no Easy Mode for you."" You know what, Steel Storm? If you'd made the game properly, then I'd probably not be quitting so often. I'm just glad I got it for free with the Humble Bundle.			"

												Steel Storm is a retro styled shoot'em up with good controls and reasonable AI that actively tries to avoid your fire.  It's fast and fun with a need for good reflexes.The addition of a level and full map design tool is also a boon though there are only a few extra campigns out there.  Which do vary in quailty but also offer a good challenge for when you've finished the official campaign.If you prefer a different challenge then you can also change the view to more like quake and games of that ilk.  This change of view angle makes the 360 field of attack much harder to cover.  Often the tactic you have used to survive in the more top down view will not save you here.The visual effects and sound effects suit the game perfectly as does the music for the most part.  As with anything however music is down to personal taste and you can always turn it off and play your own if your hardware can handle it.I've played this on both aging AMD units and state of the art Intel gaming rigs and it played perfectly on all.  For those who have discovered issues there are work arounds which I've also used successfully on some rigs.  Find these on the forums.Now I'm not going to indicate that the game is perfect.  It does for sure have its flaws.  While it does have plenty of different weapons to sate most play styles the number of types of enemy is limited.1x Fast and light tank that can zap you and disable all but your starting loadout.  The handicap is temporary of course.1x Light tank that fires a single plama shot in each volley.1x Medium tank that fires 4 shots in a volley, as the class implies has more hit points than the light variant.2x Heavy tanks - one with a plasma turret and minigun turrets and the other with three rapid fire heavy plasma turrets.4x Types of fixed turrets, plasma, laser, missile, repair.2x big bads, a carrier and a super heavy tank.The AI also has a few other problems that occur when there are player friendly or other players in a game.  Often the AI has problems locking on to a target and will constantly change target while never firing a shot.  On occation in multiplayer mobs will spawn and not attack making them easy pickings.   Thankfully a recent patch looks to have reduced these annoyances to virtually zero.As for DLC, the extra weapons are a nice touch but too few.  The second DLC is a better addition with a whole new campaign with some new game twists which I'll not spoil if you've not tried it.  Overall I found the game to be enjoyable if not a touch repetitive.  If you don't like shoot em' ups this game is not going to change your mind about them.  If you do then give this little overlooked gem a blast.			"

First Impression ReviewI idle in most games for the trading cards. It's just a fact. I've started trying to play the games for a bit to get some first impressions, and thus started my ""First Impression Review"" - just a quick look at the first hour/few hours of a game. If you're looking for something more in-depth, look elsewhere.In short, this a 3D top-down shooter with maps - typically urban environments with grid-like streets - and objectives for each level/map. As far as arcade action goes, it is pretty entertaining. You have your infinte-fire machine gun, and then gain the ability to add other secondary weapons as you progress - such as rockets or a beam. Mission objectives vary from map-to-map/mission-to-mission - generally destroying certain targets (such as boss enemies or crates), clearing the stage of enemies, or simply reaching the exit. The latter generally requires deactiving force fields by roaming the streets looking for red lights to run over. There are items to find on the map to increase your score, and of course you're free to kill as many enemies as you like, even if that isn't the objective. You'll probably find yourself doing so anyway, given their aggressiveness. The controls are pretty tight, and aiming feels very natural. I do wish the player's ship was a bit more agile, making it easier to dodge bullets. All in all, it seems like a good distraction, but more structured than other twin-stick shooters like Beat Hazard. I don't know how long it would take to wear out its welcome, but given the amount of weapon upgrades, and the ability to easily play in short 15-30 minute bursts, I'd give it at least 4-5 hours.I received this game as part of a bundle, and wouldn't recommend it at full price. However, my short time spent with it gave me a positive impression. It's hard to put a dollar-per-hour or dollar-per-unit of entertainment number on any game, as the first would be misleading, and the second... is very difficult to measure and describe.Based on the price I paid, I would recommend this game at $2.00 or less.

												This game has been in development for many years and boy, does it show (in a good way!). It SHINES with polish and the excellence and bug-free experience ANY game can have with sufficient, dedicated development time constructively spent by active developers on working out the kinks, improving and optimizing the graphics, ramping up the coolness factor of the bullet streams, increasing the enemies' intelligence and their pathfinding and tactics, increasing the detail of the textures and improving the lighting and gameplay and......well, Steel Storm: Burning Retribution (SSBR) has been through the equivalent of many ""early access"" development cycles without having used early access time.I believe I first downloaded it on Sourceforge long ago when it was available for Linux and Windows. I think.Back to the point: SSBR is a polished, satisfying game. You might find yourself spending more time playing SSBR than you anticipate!And that's just the single-player part. I haven't even delved into the multiplayer portion of the game with its collection of multiplayer variants (Edit: I have learned from ONE WHO KNOWS that the number of gamers playing SSBR in multiplayer mode is not as large as might be desired—for some reason—and more development time has been spent on making SSBR friendly to single players as a result). SSBR is like a third-person Unreal Tournament or Quake with modern graphics and mechs and hovertanks instead of humanoids. And limited, rather than infinite, respawns. And double kills, triple kills, quadruple kills, etc. And a LOT of weapons.The View From Above Provides A Great Starting Point:SSBR is, by default, played while viewing your HoverTank from a top-down, third-person perspective. There's an automap in the corner and a larger toggleable map, but don't give up on it if that's not your cup of tea: the main camera can be positioned anywhere you want near your character (unless the camera options have been altered; I remember on an old build using a primary camera a little above and behind my vehicle with other buttons bound to cameras looking in forward/back/left/right/etc. directions from the POV of my vehicle. I remember lots of clipping errors in that build from many years ago, which was probably using a different engine.) When I played it today (the day I wrote the rough draft of this review, 2015-07-07), I noticed no clipping errors at all. Two camera options are available to choose as defaults, but individual features (e.g. speed of camera movement, camera response delay following your having turned or moved your vehicle, angle of camera relative to ground, angle relative to the vehicle, angle relative to a fixed base, etc.)) within those options can be changed, etc.I don't know if the multiple access-anytime camera angles are possible in the current build, but it would not surprise me. If you like games with lots of options to play with, SSBR can probably help to satisfy you.If you like playing HoverTank DM/CTF/etc. or the much larger than I remember single-player tutorial and campaign(s), this game is different enough and contains enough similar and different features that it's an enjoyable experience.By default, SSBR's controls are mapped to keyboard, joystick, X360pad, and mouse.

												Howdy all! So I've played through about 1/2 the campaign now and I must say I've enjoyed it quite a bit.  There is enough weapon variety to keep you trying different combos until you find a combo of weapons you like.  You can carry 1 main weapon, 2 secondary weapons (switchable with the shift key) and one defensive weapon (spacebar).The game is pretty tough and I'm only playing it on the default difficulty.   I've been playing keyboard and mouse and they feel fairly responsive.Overall it's a fairly fun shooter and anticipate finishing the game.			"

Over-all I would rate this game for a generous 7/10.			"

												Got this game from a mystery deal pack on GreenManGames. A few things about the game so far. It is fun. At least for me, I enjoy top down dual joystick shooters like this. That said, it is also a little bit basic, at least from the 30 mintues or so that I have played it so far. The other games I got in the pack are BLOPS 1&2, which were a surprise to say the least. The value was definitely there for me, since I got a total of around 60 dollars worth of games for 6 dollars. I can't imagine that that would be the norm, however, for 5 decent games it's not bad at all.			"

												Controls are weird and floaty but tolerable.  Combat is fun, definitely the strongest point of the game, but there isn't nearly enough of it.  Most of the time you wander around levels looking for keys and switches wondering why there's nothing to shoot at.  Enemy shots are often the same color as the ground, so it's hard to see them coming at you.  Don't bother.			"

												This game is both solid as can be and at the same time unpolished. The gameplay is great but in these days of so-called ""AAA"" titles people turn their nose up at the aesthetics. I think this is why metacritic gave it a low score. But in any case the game deserves some respect due to a few things that in a very noble move, it did not advertise as a feature.One of these things is the fact that it uses netradiant and the darkplaces engine (themselves a fork of GtkRadiant and the Quake engine). Both of these are free software and licensed as such. The source code and what modifications were made to the editor and engine respectively are included on zip files with the distribution.To my knowledge this is one of the few games on Steam that have free code and moreover ship that free code along with the install. It is very humble about this fact, and I am guessing I am one of the few people aware of this as it requires looking in the install directory.In other words, this video game is a massive open source/free software and classic-game-nostalgia love-fest.

												This game isn't awful, it just isn't fun and probably wont hold your attention for long.Steel Storm looks really nice, I like the isometric view and the map is well implemented. The gameplay is fun in theory, you zoom around and shoot stuff, there are powerups and varied enemies to keep things more interesting. The controls are what really kill this game, they are incredibly floaty and you'll eat a lot of bullets because of it. The sound is also bad, bad music, jarring sound effects. What really pushed me to write this review was the passive aggressive message on the quit screen: 'sorry there is no easy mode.' Are you kidding me? If the♥♥♥♥♥♥controls were addressed this could be a fun game but now its just an ok game in an overpopulated genre. "

I do like the arcade-y feel of the game, but there are others out there that replicate that feel so much better.

												WARNING: For skilled people who aren't made out of brittle glass. Gameplay is actually quite smooth if you are running a decent system, and runs well on all three of the major OS players. Although you can change your POV, Top-down play is what this game is built around. Fast and agile, it gives a challenge, but doesn't hold you back from being quick and bold in your maneuvers. Varied weapons, and most peripherial scenery is breakable. If you are a fan of Top-down, and are not a mediocre gamer at best, you will likely enjoy this very much.			"

I hope the Linux support comes for that too.- had a minor issue with framerate dropping to 6fps on one occassion.

												I had a good time playing this game.   Its a top down shooter, but you control it a bit like Smash TV or Alien Swarm.  Very basic gameplay, pick up upgrades, kill things, and press switches/pick up items.  I did enjoy some of the levels and design and others were boring.  Don't bother playing the first episode, just jump into the 2nd Episode of the game.  The first is like a small, dumbed down, version of Episode 2.  It feels fun when your destroying mutiple enemies at a time, but it also feels lame when they make a dozen things spawn all around you when you in a room you've already cleared out.   A worthy pick up if you are into this sort of casual action, fly/shooter kind of game.  Graphics are nice for indie game.			"

												I'm surprised. This game is pretty good! It's a top-down shooter with gameplay like a simplified version of Descent. You kill robots, collect keys and weapon upgrades, and then get to the exit. I can't comment on the multiplayer but the single player is pretty fun.			"

												The campaign of this game is easy. I have to remember this is an arcade like game so campaign has no story. Just shutting down forcefields. The co op part is when u can play with up to 8 people I think. Basically your just playing campaign, with other people. numbers of players are very low. Only 10 online I saw. It was probably 0 before the humble indie bundle 3. Then we got the typical multiplayer which no one is playing. Capture the flag and team deathmatch. I guess that should be the most fun part of the game. So I don't know, its $5. I guess its a game to kill time.			"

												Steel Storm: Burning Retribution is a top down shooter with objectives and fun arcade action. (The first person screenshots are from a cheat or something I can't remember). The steel storm games are an episodic series. There are only two of them soo far and this one includes both. The first one isn't nearly as good as the second but they are both still a romping good time! This game also has a co-op mode so you can go through the story with buddies. It is also controller enabled which is nice! I recomend this game, especially at its price point. ~PR0XIDIAN			"

												Steel Storm: Burning Retribution is a top down action shooter with old school spirit. It marks the return of top-down shooters with new twists. The game has score oriented competitive gameplay, and is designed for people who like fast paced action, hordes of smart enemies, destructible worlds and ground shaking explosions. The events take place in an alternative universe where you control an advanced hovertank, packed with the most advanced and sophisticated weapons. Your task is simple, but nevertheless not trivial. In the fight against extraterrestrial invaders, you must prevail!			"

												The game is a reminder of those xbox 2 D made like the cartoons on saturday morning cartoon. The overall feel reminds me of the kinder /gentler arcade days of long gone where the game you played let you feel the motion of the seat under. And the controls were shaped like a pilots yoke , to help ease your wrist with all the frantic twist and turns in driving. Well, Im glad that someone finally came out with something more interactive using only a mouse and a few keys, and this could be one of the last ones Ive played that enables both(top down and Front View ; please see other indep. titles like Iron Grip Warlord.Theres about a handful of 'game types' to play , most being the coop , however, the one on one with someone else brings back memories of flag stealing in unreal tournament(with only a vehicle hovercraft thats used). The other good thing about it is the a.i. , which is pretty crafty and uses moves similar to others playing with you; though if youre a veteran and you like this type of game then you may have to go solo on most missions.

												I'm going to come right out and say it.  This game has a bad wrap on Metacritic.  The controls are NOT terrible as mentioned simply turn up the sensitivity on your mouse and use the wsad keys and it is easy as pie to control.  The game play reminds me alot of a modern day River Raid tied in with Alien Storm and it's ilk.  Quick to pick up, easy to play, difficult to master, the game has an interesting play style that is quite addicting.  The story line is rather lame and transparent but the game itself is well worth the $1.24 I paid for it on sale.  I actually will be purchasing the 4 pack to give away to friends! Fun little title.

												A semi-decent top-down shooter with a scifi theme featuring stuff like:- permanently losing your weapons when you die- enemies appearing and/or force fields activating behind you so you can't retreat- respawning at the beginning of the map upon dyingThe first episode was actually fairly playable, if a bit repetitive. But the second one really packs 'em aforementioned features! At that point I was too annoyed to even try the multiplayer OR the map editor.A nice, traditional game ruined by so little. A shame, really.UPDATE: Actually, it's an ok game. It's nothing special in any regard but it's not Bad Rats either.			"

												A good solid top down shooter. It's kinda hard, especially at the beginning when if you die you lose the good weapons you've picked up. If you like gams where you press 'A' to win, then you probably won't like this.There is an option to play on easy. Which is still a challange.It's the kinda of game you can play for 15 minutes a day and then get on with your life. A little lunch time buzz to save having to listen to Dave boring everyone with stories about  paper.I woudln't recomment you dedicate you life to this game; just play one or two levels per day.Tip : When you find the big laser, don't lose it! Always keep it. Vrrooooshhhh = x5 bonus kill.There is a story, but it's a shooter so don't expect to be gripped. Go here. Go there. Shoot things. A bit like almost all games - but it doesn't hiide it.7/10 : It's a game. Shoot things. If your a bit feeble of mind/body you probably won't like it. "

												Aside from having the most generic title in gaming, Steel Storm also has a generic description: sci-fi shoot-em-up with loads of guns.This is a top-down shooter (though there is an option for close camera third person, but its obviously not meant to be played that way) that takes place in 3D levels.  Ammo is limitless, guns are plentiful and varied, and there is little story to speak of, aside from the short briefings at the beginning of each mission that tell you what to do, and sometimes, where to go, in the expansive levels.   The main gist of it is: infiltrate enemy bases and blow up everything.The 3D effects are neat, but they can be jarring at times.  Sometimes enemies or even your own ship can get hidden behind a towering structure, but rotating the camera might reveal it.  In a game so dependent upon positioning and reflexes, managing this can get tiring.The levels are varied and interesting.  You’ll explore frozen planets, underground mines, and sky fortresses.  Some of the levels can be quite easy to get lost in, and it is easy to miss an important switch or key and have to backtrack.  Taking the player out of the action for such a mundane reason is a big problem.  The map provided is not very helpful, as it is full of icons that mean nothing to you, and aren’t explained in the legend.Yet I still had a good time with this game.  The cel-shaded graphics are cool to look at and the guns are satisfying to use.  The enemies can be overwhelming, but with smart tactics and judicious application of rockets and plasma beams, they all explode eventually.  The few boss fights in the main campaign are loads of fun.  Repairs and shields can be obtained from crates lying around the battlefield, but it can be a little annoying to have to break open three hundred or so per level to find the few that contain what you’re looking for.  A more consistent labeling or telegraphing what is inside would have been welcome.This game is a great diversion for a few hours, an easy way to shoot bad guys and feel almost invincible, at least until they swarm you and remind you that you didn’t search enough crates for shields.There is a DLC campaign called “Forgotten Prison” but I didn’t feel the need to play it.  Steel Storm: Burning Retribution is a fine game in its own right, though it isn’t without its flaws.			"

												What a bad game. It functions decently compared to all those early access craps that don't work at all but god, two levels and I was feeling sick to my stomack due to the horrible control and the map turning around you instead of your vehicle turning.

												The gameplay itself is reasonably satisfying. The guns feel nice to use, and the explosions are juicy. What more do you want from a spaceship shooter game? Let me tell you what: a good camera.I cannot exactly point my finger at what the problem is, but the camera in this game gave me the worst motion sickness I ever had. In one session I played for about 3 hours and ignored the merry-go-round in my head, because otherwise the game was fun. When I went to bed the whole room was spinning around me, and on the next morning I still felt dizzy. Even thinking about it now makes my head spin.The developers need to do some research on how to implement cameras in games.To scratch your space-shooty-rocket-laser-explosion-itch I recommend that you play any of these games instead, as they have a fixed camera: Reassembly, Space Pirates and Zombies, Ring Runner.

												A semi-decent top-down shooter with a scifi theme featuring stuff like:- permanently losing your weapons when you die- enemies appearing and/or force fields activating behind you so you can't retreat- respawning at the beginning of the map upon dyingThe first episode was actually fairly playable, if a bit repetitive. But the second one really packs 'em aforementioned features! At that point I was too annoyed to even try the multiplayer OR the map editor.A nice, traditional game ruined by so little. A shame, really.UPDATE: Actually, it's an ok game. It's nothing special in any regard but it's not Bad Rats either.			"

												Really fun game I picked up as part of the bundle stars bundle, which had a load of games for £1.28.  Quite satisfied with this game to be honest. A great little blaster and music is quite good too.			"

												Boring gameplay, and a camera that feels almost deliberately evil.			"

												the game has very good game mechanics but has also a lot of flaws in level design. enemies appear from nowhere and you'll take a lot of damage before you can realize what happened. also difficulty is an issue. the other main flaw is related to ""progression"", meaning that there's none of it: you're not able to upgrade your ship, you can just pick up weapons during the level, but as for the difficulty issue you'll probably drop it shortly after beacuse of your death leading to levels that are all very similar one to another.I can't recomend this			"

												It feels like someone invented the time machine, transported id Software team from 1992 to present day, gave them modern technology, and then they made this game.All elements are there, like back in the day. It counts your score, died enemies don't disappear, there's a lives system, but this time a meaningful one - it allows you to respawn without losing progress unlike useless thing inferior to quickload we had before. And I even became interested in this game after playing shareware Episode 1!AI is challenging. Enemies are able to predict where you're moving and shoot there, giving sense of accomplishment when you manage to overcome a hard battle.The game is powered by DarkPlaces engine which is based on id technology, and it shows. Level editor gives you a set of primitives you can cut, shape and bend plus set of texture atlases instead of several pre-made models like engines do today. Thanks to it, levels are as interesting and imaginative as in other idTech-powered masterpieces such as Quake3, Quake4, Doom3, Prey.And a feel of playing something of id Software quality wouldn't be there without modding tools, which are well designed. There's a NetRadiant editor to make new locations, and SandStorm editor to make missions. SandStorm is a wonderful idea: it allows you to place enemies, objects, triggers etc. in a separate file and test your mission instantly without waiting for a lengthy lightmap compilation. This approach also opens the door towards having multiple missions taking place on the same map to fully utilize its potential.Excellent usage of the engine and classic design which make it feel like playing an old-school id Software release are an amazing accomplishment for a small indie team. If you're looking for a game that can make you relive the feelings from the 90s, you've just found it.			"
