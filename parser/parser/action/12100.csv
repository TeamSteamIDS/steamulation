												In 2001, I was a junior in high school, and as one, was completely blown away by GTA III. The music, the size of the game, the overall gloomy rainy atmosphere - it was right up my alley. And now, 15 years later, I look back and realized that nothing has changed and that this game still remains one of my favorites. I think it's safe to say that it influenced my life quite a lot - I learned to drive while playing it; I was learning English at the time and the game helped a lot; my music tastes were influenced by the radio stations. And when I was feeling blue, like I did a lot when in high school, I could escape in this approximation of the reality across the ocean. Sure, these days with newer games like GTA IV and V, the graphics are better, the plot is more twisted, guns are more abundant and the music is newer/different. I do like the newer games as well, so can't say they are worse than GTA III. But this one is the one that started the 3D Grand Theft Auto Experience, just like Black Sabbath started heavy metal. So, I'm not sure that what I wrote here qualifies as a review, because I like everything, but here it is.			"

												This game opened so many doors, so many eyes.  I think players new to the GTA franchise would probably be better served with one of the newer titles, but for someone like me who played this game when it first came out, and plenty more after that, this game is a well-remembered old friend.  I have been known to sit in an idle vehicle in some quiet corner of the city, just listening to the talk radio station in the rain.  Memorable characters and challenging quests with dated graphics, but still enjoyable and most certainly recommended.			"

												One of the first PC/Console cross platform games that I can remember and I'll be honest... it was great to finally getting around to actually playing it.I never had a PS2 as a child, or an amazing PC to play and experience GTA III when it was first released over 10 years ago. Instead like the pauper child I was, I had to go around a friend's house and 'play' the game. You might be surprised to find out that when I say 'Play' I actually mean mess about, such as the innocence of youth. So visiting the game 10 years later, as an older, wiser, sillier man with the hindsight of GTA IV's version of Liberty City has been a great experience. There's actually a really good story within GTA III, something that I never appreciated or cared for back when playing at a friend's house (all I wanted to do was steal cars and shoot people). The story that is complimented well by some pretty fun missions and voice acting with one voice stealing the show - there aren't many games out there with Japanese American Accents with a strong double lisp. In general GTA III has aged well, which I don't always find from those first wave of 3D games ~2000ish. The soundtrack has held up well, and it's nice to visit the early days of Lazlow on Chatterbox, and I'm sure some of the stations have even been remastered .Graphically the game looks pretty solid even if I did have a few issues, but I think that was more my fault than the games (I had installed the Xbox Mod). There is a generally known 'issue' with the Steam gtaIII.exe file which can be resolved with an easy to install TXD file on the official forums and Steam forums (it'll fix the dark coloured cars).The one criticism I might have would be an improvement to the camera controls, but I can forgive the lack of control (and the frustration that can sometimes be caused). This issue really comes to head during the gun battles, which at times can be awkward to aim due to a general lack of free aim mode.GTA III might not be as vast or as epic as GTA V, but it captures the reality and craziness that I suspect GTA IV was attempting to offer. The blend of comedy within the serious tones and themes works well, most of which coming across in the now trademark radio stations, but also within Liberty City.There are a ton of easy to miss signs and shops that hold double meaning and spoof popular icons and culture (most of which still relevant today). So while there aren't any real random encounters in GTA III, it's still worthwhile exploring Liberty City as the Sandbox Nature can still reward you with a few laughs due to ad-lib citizen remarks, billboards, shops, and funky AI.In short...GTA III is a blast from the past that's still well worth checking out, especially if it's cheap during on the Steam Sales. As long as you realise this game is over 10 years old, and can appreciate the early attempts of a sandbox game I think you'll enjoy it. If nothing else it's nice to see the genesis of what we know as modern GTA.Check the Steam Forums/Rockstar Forums for the fix for the Steam version before you play, and enjoy.			"

												Another game that I am a more than a decade late playing...Grand Theft Auto 3 was released in mid 2002; and is actually the fifth game in the GTA series, however this game was the one which changed the franchise into the series we know today. The game is set in the fictional city of Liberty City, which is actually loosely based on New York City. You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly.  This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine. In GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.The graphics are dated but it is over ten years old, what were you expecting? You can get graphically enhancing community made mods to increase the fidelity a bit too. I personally really like these dated looking graphics.GTA III will challenge you at points; more so that you will probably end up dying quite a bit. Some missions require a lot of shooting and evading police, while others involve a little bit of parkour and trying not to just kill yourself in a stupid manner. The re-spawn system is very good in GTA though; you loose all your weapons as well as having to pay a fee for the hospital having to patch you up. As you can see, I have over a hundred hours in GTA III, this is through having multiple playthroughs, as well as completing the game 100% on a number of occasions; however this past week I did a full playthrough of the story and a couple of the side activities and this took me almost twelve hours to complete. There is a ton more content to play in that playthrough too, so you can easily get about fifteen plus hours out of one playthrough of GTA III if you desire. Oddly enough I had no real game breaking technical issues with GTA III, the only one I did find is it is not recommended to play this game with more than one monitor activated at a time, as your mouse will sometimes wander out of the game window and you will end up minimizing your game all the time. To be honest though; just the one issue on a ten year old game is pretty good going if you ask me. In conclusion, GTA III is a land mark in gaming history; it is the game which revolutionized the GTA series, sparked media controversy, and most of all, gave us one of the best games in history. Most will have already completed this game; however if you haven't - I strongly advise you dust your copy off and give it a weekend of your time to play. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Only recommended when on sale3) Recommended4) Highly recommended5) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It's still sit in that territory of old games where you instantly die from falling in water you werent any where near and those kinds of bugs. I suggest installing RealGTA if you're going to play this. It's helps immensely graphically speaking.			"

												It's an old game, and you can see that on both graphic and gameplay sides.But yeah, this is the first 3D GTA game! And my first 3D GTA too.It's kind of GTA2, but in 3D, it's enjoyable for what it is but it's not aged so well and this can lead to some frustration. However is still totally playable and it's surely a classic. Worth checking if you want to learn a bit of open-world history, but I still prefer GTA2.			"

												Classic game. Love it or hate it, this changed gaming. So nice i can still enjoy this title, my very old PS2 is on life support. lol. I have a 360 controller, and just like the store page says, it's not fully supported. You can't turn around! The left analog stick works fine, but the right one which is used to turn, doesn't. So the partial control support is pretty useless because it's unplayable without the ability to turn. But there is an easy fix located in the ""Guides"" section on steam.

												GTA III, a game created by Rockstar North (Edinburgh, Scotland), which was released in October 2001 for the PS2, and later ported to PC in May 2002.Now, i am sure that everybody are familiar with concept of GTA games, so i will cut to the chase.It was the first game in the series to use a 3D engine. The game itself was based in a fictional place called Liberty City, which supposedly resembles New York. Thanks to the engine, the city is dynamic, having a 24 hour day cycle and weather changes.StoryDuring the game you will be playing as Claude, a mute protagonist. You get betrayed during a bank robbery by your girlfriend, which ends up with you getting caught by the cops. You escape and you seek out revenge.At first you will be working for the Mafia, helping them out with a rival family and the Triads. Then, after them betraying you, you start working for the Yakuza (Japanese). Eventually, you do get revenge on your girlfriend, who is a member of the Colombian Cartel. But to do that, you trigger a war between the Yakuza and Cartel.By the end of the game, 5 out of 7 gangs total, will be hostile towards you - attacking you on sight. This can become extremely annoying, considering that some gangs have shotguns which can blow up your car in 2 shots. For comparison, by the end of the game in GTA Vice City, you had only 1 gang that would be hostile towards you, and while in GTA San Andreas, you could completely wipe off all other gangs.I also feel that Rockstar didn't care much about the story, cause in this game your protagonist pretty much backstubs everyone to get his revenge, which is why so many gangs will be against you.Comparison to other GTAsUnlike other GTAs, majority of the game involves using cars: chasing someone. make someone's car burn by ramming it. racing. racing while passing through checkpoints under a time limit. trying to get to a destination under a time limit. trying not to damage the car while under a time limit. racing with a boat. find ""insert car"" and bring it to the garage. get to a destination while being chased by cops/gangs.In all honesty, there been like ~ 5 missions that involve genuine shootouts, and i sort of understand why. All GTA 3 era games were harsh, but the thing that set GTA 3 apart from the others, was that you weren't able to crouch. In other GTA's starting with Vice City, you could crouch behind any cover. Most objects would fully cover your buddy when crouched, and when you start shooting, your character will rise a bit above his cover.The other thing that this game is missing, is a map. Only the minimap is present, but you can never view the whole map. The city is broken down into 3 islands, and each time you reach a new one, the game will show you the icons for Pay'n'Spray, Ammunation, but only for the first few missions, then they are gone. So if you are gonna play it, you better memorize the necessary locations.Also, you can't shoot tires or break windows of a car. You can't even damage a car with a baseball bat. These features started appearing in Vice City.ContentIt is fairly low on content compared to other GTAs.Amount of cars[gta.wikia.com] 4 sport cars. 4 ""2 door"" cars. 4 ""4 door"" cars. 3 jeeps. the rest are taxis, ambulances, police cars etc, or generic vans.There are no motorcycles or fly-able vehicles.Amounts of songs in the radio - 8 radio channels, each having about 6 songs on average. Compared to say Vice City, which would have 15 songs per channel, that's pretty low. Also, majority of the music isn't very popular. In fact, if you start searching for most of them, you will only see them under GTA 3 logos. Not that they were bad or anything, but clearly it shows that they had budget problems.Also, unlike other GTAs, there is only 1 weapon per tier.PC PortThe PC port itself is quite bad. Mouse issues. FPS limited to 30 fps.I suggest using SilentPatch. It fixes most of these issues, but unfortunately, if you die or get caught by the police, the game will crush. I hope you all do remember that during the GTA 3 era, we didn't have quick saves and only way to save was to go to the hideout.Do i recommend it?Well, if you are interested in the story, then you may buy it, cause all GTA 3 era games are connected. Chronologically, plot wise, the games are set this way:1986 - Vice City1992 - San Andreas2001 - GTA IIIOr in case you wanted to see how much the series has evolved (like me), then you can get it as well. This game has quite an impressive lift bridge.Or maybe you would prefer to play it in top down view? This is the last GTA that allowed you to set your camera view to top down.			"

												The very first time GTA went 3rd person and it was AWESOME.The game is a legend. For the first time you can do everything a GTA had to offer while living it inside the game and not above it.The main character was not voiced yet at that time, but the game is still awesome, with a crazy story twist of events and weird-funny characters.Although roaming sandbox games existed before this title, this one certaily was the very best 3rd person full 3D graphics sandbox game at the time.I was glad to had the chance to play this from start to end and if you ever get the chance to start a GTA marathon, you won't be any disappointed!Totally recommended!

												For those in trouble in getting the game running  (like me and others)  :**no menu visible**no 16/9 full screen mode**low resolutions**car can not drive backwardsIt took me some time in browsing forums, but it comes to this in a nutshell.Salvation is found in these two mods :1) SilentPatchIII 1.1 Build 52) SP DDraw for GTA III/VC Build 4 -->unpack and install them in your steam folder 'GTA3' and game will run like a charm on windows 10.Bravo to the modders,  bad points for Rock Star.And last but not least, this setting is also required in the menu :Options - Display - Frame limiter - 'on'When it is set on  'off', the car physics are weird, even some cars can not drive backwards.You are ready to step into vintage gaming and playing the game that is the founding 3D-father toall later sequels of GTA and games like Mafia, Just Cause, Saint Rows, Saboteur (not on steam) and yes, even assassin's creed.

												This game isn't so bad and many core gamers find this game awesome as you can do almost anything to commit crimes, but watch out for Police and your heat level. As most of the players know the GTA series, the only thing with GTA3 is the crude ""PS2-like"" GFX, as it was originally released for PS2 in 2001 but the disappointing part for the PS2 version is the lack of compatibility for the later revision model of the PS3 and PS4. The Steam version however may contain some GFX colour errors when you play in-game like the vehicles with a distinctive yellow glow; plus your saves from the PC Retail Version - that if you choose to transfer into the Steam Version may corrupt it.Overall this game is enjoyable, and it's generally for over 18s only, plus it does contain some racist stunts and footage: like the Italian Mafia going into Mob Wars with the Chinese Triads. And if you proceed after going into Mob Wars with the Triads and siding with the Diablos, then your chances of survival in the city will be reduced, due to the mobsters trying to take revenge against YOU! So, if you do want to make a 100% complete stats, then I recommend you stay away from other jobs except Luigi's. Because those Taxi/Police and Fire Engine jobs will be impossible if the mobsters start severely opposing you. And don't fail and save when you play on those ""Kill Frenzy/Ramage"" missions as those are a 1-way ticket.Speaking of 1-way tickets: If you approach near Mission ""Bomb Da Base - Act II"", then be aware of Luigi's, Joey's and Toni's jobs, because if you not finished them all, you will never get the 100% completion. Same goes when you reach Staunton Island if you not finished the Jobs from Kenji when you get Donald Love's Jobs. And when you get a Mission from Shoreside Vale, except the PayPhone from Southside Hoods, DON'T buy anymore weapons. Trust me you need the cash for the final showdown.Now I believe this game appears to be the only game in the GTA 3D series onwards that don't reduce your Criminal Rating stats, so you can cause some cheating mayhem as you want. But don't use them for the newer versions of GTA as those Stats will be ruined.One final thing, you can download some fixes like the Long Distance enhancement and some of Silent's DirectDraw fixes for this game. Try it! It should be safe:http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=686http://apg-clan.org/vbdownloads.php?do=download&downloadid=779 "

												Grand Theft Auto III is one of the most revolutionary games ever made, it changed the video game landscape forever, so let's get into it.We play as Claude, a young bank robber who is trying to make it in Liberty City. After a bank heist his girlfriend Catalina shoots Claude and leaves him for dead. After a prison break Claude escapes and so begins his quest for revenge towards Catalina.The gameplay is pretty identical to every other GTA game, but I'll explain if you want to know. The game is a sandbox title where you are free to explore at your own pace, you can travel by foot, by car or by boat. No air travel just yet. It's fun driving around and seeing the sights in Liberty City.The gameplay is very stiff for this title. The driving is very hard to control and requires a lot of time getting used to it, but once you're used to it, it's not big of a problem. The game also has a mission structure and every mission requires to do a lot of different stuff, ranging from racing, to hitman missions and a lot more stuff. A lot of the missions can be fun, but a lot of them are incredibly difficult and here is the biggest problem with the game.Now don't get me wrong, when a game is challenging that is not bad, but when it's so hard it's next to the point of being unfair is not good. GTA Vice City and San Andreas has a good mixture of difficulty where the missions where possible no matter what. GTA 3 however is incredibly difficult due to the very confusing objective placements and really punishing missions where a few good placed shots could blow up your car.The soundtrack is also really lackluster. Every radio station only has 4 songs each ( at least from what I remember). But a lot of the songs are good, so I won't go too harsh on it.The story is really great, while not the best thing of all time, it helps to push you to the conclusion and it really satisfies you after the end credits start rolling.While playing, I had zero issues with the game. No crashes, no game breaking bugs. Apart from minor AI glitches, I had no problems.The game took me 13 hours to finish, after you're done, you also have races and packages you can collect all over Liberty City.Overall GTA 3 is a good game, but it has not aged well since 2001. It's a revolutionary game and I won't deny the impact it had on the world of gaming, but I highly suggest players to buy either Vice City or San Andreas.Final Rating:6/10 - Worth Purchasing on SaleIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Every legend begins somewhere, and Grand Theft Auto III is the game that laid the foundation not only for the entire GTA series as we know it today, but in many ways for the entire open-world sandbox structure of games that continue to enjoy popularity.  It's been said that this game pales in comparison to the games that would come later in the 'GTA III trilogy', namely Vice City and San Andreas.  While it's true that those games further refined and expanded upon the GTA experience in important ways, the essential building blocks for those changes were created here in GTA III.I've trumped up the historical importance of the game a bit but the question remains as to whether the gameplay in GTA III has held up, especially in relation to the later iterations in the series.  Thankfully I can answer that with a resounding, ""Yes!""  So let's talk about some of the things that make this game tick.  First and foremost, we have the story.  In GTA III Rockstar was pinning down some of the aspects that would come to be regarded as the Rockstar style of storytelling.  The story here is basically a love letter to latter day crimeland movies like Goodfellas, Heat, Donnie Brasco, Reservoir Dogs, and the like.  In this capacity all the requisite pieces are in play, including the Italian mafia, Japanese yakuza, Chinese triads, as well a healthy assortment of street level thugs.  You are a mute protagonist (who we would later know as Claude thanks to GTA: San Andreas), making a name for himself on the back of jobs from all these various criminal factions.  Naturally there are betrayals, double-crosses, hits and feints between all of these organizations, and Rockstar handles its authorial pen deftly enough to keep the story moving at a good pace.  The whole story has the tone and feel of a pulp crime movie you might see as part of a matinee crime movie marathon; nothing of great substance, but a whole lot of fun nevertheless.In GTA III we also see the beginnings of Rockstar's tendency to include well-known actors performing voice work in their games.  Here we have Michael Madsen, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Rappaport, Debi Mazar, Kyle MacLachlan, and gangster movie legend Frank Vincent all playing supporting roles in the game.  The caliber of voice acting in this game really does some great things for the conveyance of the story.  In the hands of lesser actors, certain aspects of this story might have come off as laughably cringe-worthy.  As it is we are treated to voice work performed by old pros, particularly where crime drama is concerned.Here we are also treated to the first GTA game to include an absolutely killer soundtrack complete with genre specific radio stations, distinct DJs for each radio station, and some great licensed music.  It had been quite a few years since I played this game, and these tunes (as well as spoken dialog) really filled me with a sense of nostalgia.  In truth it's the radio stations that give this game its comedic timing and fantastically dark sense of humor.  As an added bonus, the PC port of this game allows you create a custom playlist of mp3s which can be imported into the game.  I really had a great time importing my own tunes into the game.  Once you do so, the 'MP3 Player' becomes selectable in any vehicle just like a normal radio station which plays your tracks on random repeat.  Let me tell you that you haven't lived until you've gone on a drive-by rampage with Electric Wizard's Funeralopolis blaring from the sound system of your Patriot.  >=DThe gameplay mechanics are admittedly somewhat long in the tooth at this point, but even still they are pretty darned enjoyable.  The drifty, somewhat floaty driving mechanics that are a hallmark of 3D GTA games make their debut here.  At first the driving might seem a slightly off, being that I don't know of any other driving game that handles quite like the GTA games.  The handling is a bit loose, but once you get that part dialed in it's a real blast.  Of course the looseness of vehicle handling depends a lot on what vehicle you're in at any given time.  It does need to be said that there are no motorcycles in GTA III, which for me is perhaps one aspect of the later games that I missed the most here.  There are also no helicopters, and only one (notoriously difficult to control) aircraft.  That said, the variety of vehicles available here is suited well to the game, and I feel that the slightly limited selection of vehicles can be forgiven being that we are talking about the first GTAs first foray into full 3D.This was my first play though of the Steam PC port of GTA III, and I will say that I found some relatively minor issues with the port.  First and foremost, the aiming mechanics were … problematic for me in this version.  In the 'Classic Control' scheme, the relatively responsive nature of the auto-targeting feature found in the console version of the game just doesn't carry over very well in the PC version.  It fails to reliably switch between targets, and in many cases it fails to find any targets at all (despite the fact that said targets are in the process of filling you with lead).  Furthermore, when you're using the Classic Control scheme the right thumb stick puts you in first person look perspective rather than adjusting the 3rd person camera as one might expect.  Others may have had a slightly different experience with Classic Mode controls, but for me the combination of the above factors made this option a non-starter.  The 'Standard Control' scheme makes some marked improvements to the above, but in this case you're stuck strictly with free aiming.  I tend to prefer keyboard & mouse controls for games that require free aiming, and indeed given that strafing features prominently into the Standard Control scheme in GTA III, one might assume that KB+M is what the developers had in mind here … except that KB+M makes driving nearly impossible (although not entirely impossible as I do know at least one person that beat this game entirely with KB+M).  Using the Standard Control scheme, I ultimately ended up ruling in favor of using a controller to better facilitate driving, although I did find a helpful mod that made this option a bit more feasible.  The GInput mod allows you to fully utilize an Xinput device in GTA III which makes using a controller in the game a bit more palatable, and has the added benefit of additional customizable settings.  It even swaps out correct button icons for onscreen prompts.  So there's that.On my (Nvidia-based) gaming rig there were also a couple of graphical glitches present in this port.  Most noticeably I encountered the 'dark vehicles' glitch, in which all the vehicles appear to have a much darker tint than they should.  For this issue I applied a second light weight user-made patch to the game which resolved the issue promptly.  If you find yourself with the same problem, this fix is probably worth your time as well.At the end of the day, the question is whether or not this game is still worth your time.  Given the popularity (and occasional notoriety) enjoyed by the GTA series, you probably already know whether the source material is your cup of tea.  Dark comedy, violence, and debauchery abound!  If you're already a fan of the series, or if you're looking to get into the 3D era of GTA games at the ground floor, I would say that this game still holds a lot of enjoyment even today.  It had been a number of years since I last played this game and I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected I would especially given the historical perspective of subsequent GTA games.  This old jalopy has still got some life in 'er yet!			"

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is the landmark game that made the jump shift to 3D back in 2001. Before that, previous GTA games where in 2D top down perspective.As the series progressed, none could have achieved without the stepping stone of this game. Even thou the controls are very clunky, story is very plain, and outdated gameplay compared to the recent entries.Still a very great game to this day!7/10.			"

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is well regarded as a pioneer in the third person sandbox game genre. It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it. The core foundation that GTA3 rests it's hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.GTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. There's a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasn't a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it. This is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. It's a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started. And to remind myself that Rockstar set the bar pretty high from the start and just kept going from there.			"

												After playing all the other GTA games in the series, I never really got too far into the game back on the PS2, so I recently bought it again on here to complete it.The game's performance is perfect and the visuals despite being dated are still very nice to look at, especially when you download the Widescreen Mod, so I have been playing this in 1080p like a remaster. I also would reccomend the GInput mod, as it gives you 100% Xbox 360 controller functionality, and has made the game just as playable as the later games in the series. I would like to point out I am playing on Windows 10, without a hitch.Overall I recommend this game as the story is great and it is definitely worth another play just for it.			"

												Windows 10 (and judging from forum posts, 7 and 8.1 also) users:Be aware that this game is old and will probably not run on your PC. Mine worked fine for a day, now it crashes immediately when I try to start it. Same for VC, by the way. To give you an overview of what I tried:- compatibility modes- running as admin- deleting gta.set- adding the game to DEP- Silentpatch- download ddraw.dll- deleting savegames- copying savegames to different User Files directory - reinstallingSooo... Be careful what you buy. I usually buy old games from a different platform that actually patches them to run on modern systems *shrug* sort of expected this here too.---If you got an old PC I 100% recommend this game. Played it as a kid and loved it, still do today. Kind of disappointed I can't continue playing :(			"

												GTA 3 - the cornerstone of the whole modern richness of open-world games, a must-to-play even still, after 14 years after release. You may ask, why it is still a must-play, when we have so many fine games of the same genre, with GTA V in the first place?As usual, the point is in the impact this game made on the whole gaming world and all around it.For example, when Ubisoft desired to make its own ""ala GTA"" product, they look namely on the GTA III as the base model. You can see the similarity with your own eyes: in the map, in the cars. Almost senseless vigilante Aiden Pierce is also not a big step from GTA3 protagonist Claude, even if he talks more, his behavior and usual activities are just about the same (except of ha-king, of course).Seriously, this game is not a history, it is fine to go even today. Camera and controls may be a bit tricky for start, but when you succeed with it - you'll get a nice trip into underground world, one of the best interpretations in the whole criminal stories cluster. It is just as playable now as any of GTA ""clones"", like Sleeping dogs, Watch dogs et cetera... but it is original.Well, for me this is one of those unforgettable things I'll carry in my life, with all tips, shortcuts and armor locations, which I remember, while not touching it for more than 10 years. But it is not about nostalgia. It is just a really strong stuff. Maybe not the best in line, maybe dated... But still pure and stout. Good taste. Solid 7.5 mark in my book, without any rebate for former experience.			"

												Set in 2001 in a fictionalised version of New York, known as Liberty City. The protagonist of GTA III is Claude, who is mute. Rockstar Games said, ""His last name may or may not be Speed,"" as a reference to the protagonist of GTA 2, who was named Claude Speed.Grand Theft Auto III was the first game in the series to utilise the 3D Graphics and use the 3rd Person Perspective. It was also the first game in the series to have an indepth story. This is the game that made GTA popular and even more controversial than it already was resulting in censored versions being released in certain countries. If it wasn't for this game's success, Grand Theft Auto wouldn't be where it is at right now.Have put numerous hours into the PS2 and iOS/Android versions			"

												I could write just one word here and call it a day: REVOLUTIONARY.This game had mediocre graphics, iffy physics, uninspired storyline and it ran badly even on some powerful PCs. It was undeniably rushed, with a plethora of bugs popping up left and right. They didn't even bother to put a roof on most of the buildings, assuming no one will see it (they were wrong)... These are actual complaints frequently repeated back in the day.And yet, this game has redefined the term ""sandbox"" into what we know it as today. It didn't excel at any aspect... but it just made a darn good use of all what it had. It really felt like the most complete and realistic simulation of a gangster yet. Wreaking havoc has never been so satisfying before.At the time, the possibilities appeared endless. The city seemed huge beyond imagination, I could spend hours just driving around listening to the radio. There's nothing you couldn't do - you could have multiple apartments, save cars in a garage, fly a plane, drive a boat, annihilate surroundings with a tank, work as a cab driver, paramedic, firefighter or even a cop (!). Not to mention the map was filled up to the brim with collectibles and other minor secrets.Many people despised the dull and grim looks of the Liberty City. To me, it is fitting. Unlike many of the sequels, in this entry the city is dark and often shrouded in fog. This really makes for an distinctive atmosphere.Even though the graphics as a whole failed to impress, there were so many little quirks it really caught your attention. You could rip out car panels. Doors could open on impact (which would then flap around as you drove in the corners), and the protagonist would attempt to close them. Cars could spawn in several variants, for example as a cabriolet or hardtop. You could dismember pedestrians - a feature that was removed from the subsequent games. There were leaves and old newspapers floating around. Rockstar has also implemented a day and night cycle and various weather conditions, making the virtual world ever so immersive.The soundtrack is superb, it's definitely one of the things that made GTAIII so special. I love the fact that the radio stations were composed mostly from music produced specifically for this game. It's really a shame that Rockstar has dropped this approach in the newer games (aside from Liberty City Stories, which also featured a truly unique and memorable soundtrack).As with any GTA, this game doesn't take itself very seriously. The humour is spot on. I especially love the chat radio stations, they always end up talking about such nonsense crap it keeps me in stitches.If I had to pick one thing about this game that has aged the worst, it'd definitely be the plot and missions. The main storyline is just a typical ""betrayed man who seeks revenge"" scenario with little to no unexpected plottwists. The missions mostly revolve around transporting the item/person, collecting items, killing someone, driving from point A to point B... This was perfectly acceptable at the time, but now it feels barren. Even the big finale doesn't really stand out from the rest.Also, the main protagonist is completely silent. While I like that it makes him much more intriguing and mysterious (and some say this makes him easier to relate to), I really do feel like this was a wasted opportunity. Take a look at the sequels - characters like Tommy Vercetti, Carl Johnson, etc. are unforgettable. Claude just isn't.Any way you look at it, it's a classic, a truly groundbreaking title. For me, this is by far the most nostalgic entry in the series. No other game made a bigger impression on me and none ever will. To be honest though, Vice City improved on pretty much every aspect and if you've never played III before, I doubt you'd enjoy it today. But if you can stomach it not being as good as Vice City, it's definitely recommended.			"

												I remember playing GTA 2 on my Playstation and thinking: ""If only this game was in 3D, it would be perfect"". Soon enough Rockstar North (then known as DMA Design) delivered. It was truly revolutional, one that put open world genre to the map. Interesting dialogs and story that was inspired by many gangster movies and characters voiced by actors such as Joe Pantoliano and Michael Madsen surely left an impact in the gaming industry.Game was phenomenal when I played it for the first time, and didn't lose its charm when replaying it many years later. You can blindly follow missions and slowly unravel story or you can choose to do one of many side activities that are present. Driving taxi, chasing criminals in police car, save wounded as paramedic or putting out fires are all an option. If you feel like discovering every corner of the Liberty City (loosely based on New York City) - there are 100 hidden packages to find. Want to unleash some anger - find rampage tokens and try to kill certain number of people for a given time. You like cars and driving - you can search the city for a rare models and big payoff in the end when you collect all of them. While doing that you won't be bored, radio stations with 3.5 hours of material are there to make sure of that. Choosing between big music hits and talk radio stations will often be a hard decision. Dark humor is omnipresent and is surely one of the series trademarks.City is pretty small compared to ones in future instalments, but at the time it was more than enough. There is no map (except mini-map) and learning shortest route to some locations will be a must for certain missions. I always liked this aspect; no pausing all the time and carefully planning every turn. You play as silent protagonist and throughout game will encounter Italian Mafia, Yakuza and Colombian Cartel. Add to the mix corrupt police detective and weird multi-billionaire businessman and you have a full package. GTA 3 deservedly received many game of the year awards and started a trend which its sequels will continue.			"

												Personally, i think that GTA III is the weakest in the 3D universe, but it's still an awesome game. It only falls behind because the other GTA's improved on this one, but being the first 3D GTA, it was very impressive at the time and still today. The story is simple, being a mute guy that mostly just takes jobs from other Liberty City residents. Gameplay wise, the on-foot and shooting sections are a bit clunky, but it seems that Rockstar Games was aware of that, and most of the time you'll be driving, with simple but responsive gameplay. And the missions feel surprisingly varied, and aren't too hard with some exceptions. The music is good, but the soundtrack is a bit short. And of course, free roaming is as good as ever, especially while driving a tank! In the end, if this was the only GTA out there, it would stand the test of time for me, but the others put this on a bit on the shadows. But definitely a classic, especially because it's one of the roots for all sandbox games today.Note: Even if you don't like mods, there's 3 that i would probably recommend.1 - SilentPatch, an unofficial patch that fixes many bugs and issues.2 - Widescreen fix, for adjusting the image correctly for your widescreen.3 - GInput, if you want to play with a controller.

												Just finished the game for the first time in years. I've always played it on my PS2 when I was a kid, but never had the chance to actually beat it.GTA III is a fantastic game. It's one of the fathers of 3D open-world gaming. You can see elements of this game in current generation open world games, like GTA V or Watch Dogs 2. It plays a big role in videogame history, for sure.It has some limitations, but I think that's exactly what makes this game special and different from the other titles. For example, GTA III lacks a map - yeah, you just can't pause and open the map so you can mark and travel wherever you want to go. In order to go to an Ammu-Nation store, for example, you need to know your way to the store before going there, without the help of a map or a blip. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes, but I actually think that's lovely. In the last missions of the game you probably already know Liberty City better than your own real city and that is pretty much fantastic. The game lacks many basic functions that were later introduced in GTA San Andreas and other titles, but this doesn't turn the game into a bad game. Not even close. Its limitations create a unique and pretty nostalgic feeling.Also, it is locked on something like 25FPS. And no, you can't unlock it to 60FPS without breaking the whole game while doing it. If you disable the built-in frame limiter, the game simply goes nuts. Physics, cars, AI, pretty much everything breaks up. There's a simple and functional workaround for that, I'm writing it on the next part - so let's talk about its flaws.The PC version have some flaws when played out-of-the-box. Wide-screen resolutions are stretched 4:3 and man, it looks like ♥♥♥. You need to patch it with a fan-made fix in order to play it in real 16:9 Widescreen, then it gets lovely.Also, PC textures are not very good. They're pretty much the same as the PS2 version and they're kinda ugly IMO. But there are patches fixing that without transforming or changing the game experience. The original XBox version of the game had way better lighting effects, textures and pretty much everything enhanced. There's a fan made patch that inserts these XBox upgraded assets into the game, too, so you can play the DEFINITIVE version of the game without modding it and changing the experience as a whole. It stays original and as a bonus, way more beautiful.Also, this mod also fixes the stupid framerate lock. It upgrades the 20FPS slow ♥♥♥ experience to a very smooth, beautiful 35FPS one. Yeah, I know you must be laughing at me right now, but trust me. I mean, please, trust me. This game is absolutely fantastic at a locked 35FPS, man. I really couldn't believe I was playing something so smooth at that framerate. Really, frame-pacing is ROCK SOLID and the smoothness is great. You can check how to enhance your game experience with this game on PCGamingWiki. They have a very good article just about these patches and fixes.To end this long, tiring review, I must repeat that GTA III is a AWESOME game. It's legendary and every videogame fan should play it because it plays a gigantic role in videogame history.It may not be as good as San Andreas or the modern ones like IV (which is the best, IMO), but it still packs a lot of nostalgia and a great experience. I truly recommend everyone to play it, because it is simple, PLAIN AWESOME.7/10, legendary game. I felt like I was in 2002 again.			"

												It certainly hasn't aged all that gracefully, but damn if it hasn't left a still noticable impact on the gaming landscape as we know it. There's a lot that can be said about Grand Theft Auto III, from the initial media perception to how it shaped free roam and open world. But at this point why bother when I can ask the simple question; Is it a good game? Well sort of, as mentioned prior GTA III hasn't aged that well, although still tolerable it lacks many refinements brought by later franchise entries and you'd likely not play it as much as you would years ago upon release as more enjoyable games exist. However this is not to say the campaign itself isn't worth playing, it may not be as well written as the likes of IV or even VC but it has it's own charm ignoring obvious clichés and maybe you'll get something out of seeing how far GTA has come.

												Normal GTA gameplay, and still remarkably fun to return to. Shooting feels solid, and satisfying to use, and the keyboard controls work well, although drive-by shootings are very difficult to perform, requiring you to drive using WASD, look out the side of your car with E or Q and press the left mouse button to shoot, while trying not to crash. But since you can get round most of the occasions where you may need to drive-by by running over people, it isn't an overwhelming problem.Those used to the new GTA's may be upset with the lack of the ever fun motorbikes and aircraft in the game (the one plane, a Dodo, is almost impossible to get into sustained flight, which it isn't intended to do). But it makes up for this with a good story, a  great New York-style world made of three island, and a enjoyable selection of cars, vans, lorries, supercars and a tank.All in all, GTA III is worth a revisit, if only for a while and for it's story.

												I bought this along with GTA Vice City, San Andreas, GTA 4, and the DLC that comes with 4 for $15.After being super excited that this deal was real, I quickly purchased it. Then read the reviews, and got nervous.. A lot of people are having issues running it on Windows 10. I'm using Windows 10.. BUT, Before I even started the game I went to the program folder (steam/steamapps/common/GTA3), and right clicked the application, and clicked the compatibility tab, and had it run as Windows XP SP3.It works fine, and I've had fun playing it again. Can't wait to play the whole story, it's been so long!Must buy for anyone who shared awesome memories, and loved playing this!The only thing I have seen act weird was the menu. Sometimes the menu selections disappear. I just quit the game and tried again. Once I had to just blindly guess navigating through the menu. Small price to pay for someone like me, but I know some of ya'll dislike anything that isn't perfect.			"

Basic Information:
Genre: Action
Developer: Rockstar Games 
Publisher: Rockstar Games 
Release Date: 21 May, 2002
Story:
The game is set in the fictional city of Liberty City, which is actually loosely based on New York City. You play the role of a bank robber named Claude, and you become entrapped in a world of gangsters and corruption very quickly. This was the first GTA game to change from the topdown view of the previous titles and move to a third person view - which combined the a new third-person and driving experience in a new game engine. 

In GTA III we have the main story line, in which you can pick and choose which missions to complete for certain characters. Many of the missions are not mandatoy to move the story forward however. You can carry out smaller side activities such as being a taxi for the night, or hijacking an ambulance resucing people and dropping them off at the hospital.
Design & Graphics:
Graphics in GTA3. The characters look fantastic, the cars are all well modeled and break apart extremely nicely, and overall, the texture quality is quite nice.
Controls:
Normal GTA gameplay, and still remarkably fun to return to. Shooting feels solid, and satisfying to use, and the keyboard controls work well, although drive-by shootings are very difficult to perform, requiring you to drive using WASD, look out the side of your car with E or Q and press the left mouse button to shoot.
Audio/Music:
Grand Theft Auto III features about three-and-a-half hours of in-game radio material. As if the music itself weren't incredible, the voice acting is superb, and represents some of the best quality sound.
Pros
 Amazing story. Awesome voice acting Great graphics. Cool in-game cheats. Cons Would have been awesome if it had a multiplayer. More weapons.  Planes that you could fly.  Score Rating  7.5/10 "

												Grand Theft Auto III is my favorite game of all time. It is so fun without mods, the story is amazing and the characters are great too. You are in Liberty City (Based on New York) and you work for many gangs and even the police. You start off getting betrayed by Catalina (ex-girlfriend),  and are left for dead. You and some others are in a police convoy and soon are stopped. You are stopped by a gang (the gang your ex-girlfriend is apart of) and they take an old man who comes into play later.When they were going towards the cop car, they dropped a bomb on the bridge. You and a man named 8ball take down the police and soon the explosion happens. You are left with a car and you drive to a safehouse. You change clothes and go to a man named Luigi. Luigi is a pimp and ask you to do very simple task. The first is to pick up a girl named Misty. You bring her back and you are then asked to kill a man with a bat, take his car and give it to Luigi. Then you do some simple driving task and kill some pimps. You meet Joey and you do task against the Forelli's. You also help out a man named Toni, steal a van and do a bank robbery. Tony makes you help him with his beef with the Triads. The triads start to attack on sight now and you do your best to destroy there busniess and kill important people in their gang. You soon meet the Don. Salvatore asked you to do some task with his wife Maria. She grows a liking to Claude. Salavatore has you destroy some Colombians (Catalinas Gang). You also kill a snitch who feeds them information and soon Maria tells Salvatore about an affair of her and Claude. They try to kill you but you escape on a boat into the second part of the game. You now work for the Yakuza. They ask you to deal with the mafia by killing people out to kill Claude and murder Salvatore. Soon you get to meet Ray, a cop, who also introduces you to Donald Love. Ray ask you to murder his ex-partner and to help out Phil Cassidy (a character in Vice City and Vice City Stories). Ray at some point leaves Liberty City and leaves you weapons and a bullet-proof Patriot. You are introduced to Donald by Ray. Donald Love has you murder Kenji (Asukas Brother) to help prices in real estate. He also has you do task to get a package and help the Old man that was taken in the beginning of the game. At some point Donald leaves with no notice.  During one of Donalds missions you encounter Catalina. She is with Miguel (part of the beginning heist) and she betrays him, soon Asuka intergrates him thinking he killed her brother. Asuka gives Claude missions to try and destroy the Cartel. On the last mission Asuka gives you she ask you to destory a plane and when you go back, you find her dead and a note that ask you ti bring a ransom to get back Maria. You bring the ransom and they try to kill you. You shoot down a chopper and save Maria after killing the Cartel members. The game is now finished. Mods can make this game live longer like updating graphics, adding more missions and whole new storylines.			"

												Recommended - with caveats.Controls: A major hurdle.  For a while I was prepared to give in and call the system broken.  After working through it, I eventually began to find a work around.  I spent most of the game using a 360 controller because, as the title implies, much of the game is spent inside vehicles and the mouse/keyboard vehicle control is dire.  However the combat controls are much easier with mouse/keyboard, where you have the option to point directly at a target and move the camera at will.  When using a controller, one has to rely on the faulty targetting system which will rarely aim at who you wanted it to and is in general quite clunky.  I could also find no option to turn off inverted y-axis aiming for the controller.  The upshot of all this was that if I was using a first-person weapon, I would have to grab the mouse to aim, and if a particularly challenging foot-based mission cropped up, I would have to change the control scheme entirely.  Workable, but flawed.Gameplay:  I thought this game was exceptionally well structured but first I should add that this is not a good sandbox by modern standards.  It was probably the archetype for the modern sandbox 'genre' but things have moved on a lot since then.  GTA III is just not able to compete with more recent games in terms of scale, scope or variety.  This does not mean however that the game cannot be enjoyed on its own terms.  One specific example from my experience was my initial frustration with the lack of any kind of overworld map - something that would be unthinkable in any modern-day open world game - but this merely led to me developing a more thorough knowledge of the city streets than possibly any other game I've played.  The areas are large enough to become immersed in, but never so large that you feel lost or overwhelmed and each street almost feels like it has its own unique personality of sorts, which aids navigability and adds to the charm of the experience.  If it had not been for the quality of the gameplay, I would not have had the patience to stick with the controls that I described in the previous paragraph.Story:  Behind a minimalistic mission-based story progression, there is actually quite an intriguing plot going on in the background.  Nothing particularly special, but more than I was expecting.  On a side note, I'm not sure if our protagonist is a soulless mercenary or just a bit dim, but either way he seems more than happy to go along with whatever maniacal schemes his employers hatch for him.Graphics:  This is not a pretty game.  I don't believe this to be particularly pertinent, but it's worth pointing out.  The best that can be said for them is that they are functional and I was able to tell what everything was.Sound:  Very good.  There is no background music in the game besides the intro and credits sequences, but the soundtrack to the game is provided by radio stations which can be accessed while in a vehicle.  These cater to a diverse selection of musical tastes, and most players will find at least two favourites which they will keep coming back to.  The scripts for the DJs has also been artfully written and it's clear a lot of effort went into creating a cohesive aural environment that acts as a reflection of the city you drive in.  This applies tenfold to the talk radio station, Chatterbox, which bears several repeat listenings.  The sound effects are also of top quality and you can get a feel of the car you have just entered merely by the sound of its engine revving. Overall, I do recommend this game to anyone with the patience to work around a poor control scheme and somewhat archaic design to see the unpolished gem that lies beneath them.  I do not think it still deserves the piles of praise that were heaped upon it on its initial release, but equally it is impossible to deny its merits, and the irrepressible charisma with which it flaunts them.

Love the fact that Rockstar did not take out the cheats because there is only two cheats that I care about: pedestrian have weapons and pedestrians attack each other.

												GRAND THEFT AUTO IIIThose who know what Grand Theft Auto, you can not tell about all the virtues of the new game. Perhaps You are faced with one of the first parts of the GTA. Even if not experienced, then now must face, because, finally, came the long-awaited third part. All series game wonderful total violence and aggression. In the new part, gamers are given complete freedom of action. Now you can smash, crush, kill, use any means at hand. The city is teeming with police cars, crime bosses.You are a young offender, he found himself on the streets of liberty city. Yesterday You threw a friend. Anger boils inside, nobody wants to believe more. And then fate sends familiarity with well-known criminal authority, which sells explosives and engaged in other dark deeds. But, having worked with him a couple of dirty operations, you understand what it takes to start a business, and that working for a boss, it is hardly possible to achieve something in this life. After some deliberation You decide to go the private swimming, that is, to begin to do business on their own. In this way You will not be deprived by treachery, meanness, greed, and other human ""virtues"". But you chose this world this way, but because – ""I want to live – learn to spin"". The more that power is more than enough.Liberty city is a huge computer world. They can just enjoy wandering the streets and riding in cars – simply living in this world. And, of course, a lot of kinds of quests and missions will diversify the already entertaining life. I would like to give advice – do not use the descriptions and passages of play – the only way You will get the greatest pleasure from the gameplay. But if you get stuck at some point – you should refer to the passage, because banging my head against the wall is rarely interesting.			"

												The game that started the phenomenon. There's a lot of fun to be had tearing through the city on  your own personal crime wave. Offensive, yes, but the game doesn't take itself seriously. It's fun precisely because you do stuff you would never do in real life. Arcade action. While fun, the game doesn't hold up well against modern open-world games. Some missions can be difficult, so be prepared to try and fail multiple times. Difficulty isn't a problem, though. I like a challenge. Poor controls on the PC, limited camera control, lack of in-game map, and overall fragility of your character/vehicles cause a lot of frustration. Half the time I feel like I'm fighting the game itself, rather than overcoming a challenge. The costs of failure is high, and you are more likely to just reload a previous save, meaning you'll need to visit your safe house to save between every mission. I may eventually finish this game, but I have to take it in doses. I'm hoping Vice City and San Andreas are less frustrating.About controls... I like to use keyboard/mouse on foot and an XBox 360 controller while driving. The game does support controllers, but it doesn't recognize all of the buttons. If you want to use a controller, save yourself some grief and spend an extra $10 on XPadder. It's still not great, but at least you'll be able to use all buttons. You'll need them.			"

												The game that started it all! Humour is absent in this one and our protagonist does not say a word. I believe GTA became really good only from Vice City, still, if you'd like to see the first TPS version you can pick this one up if discounted. It certainly looks dated and a lot of features were missing (e.g. shooting out vehicle tires) that later on made the gameplay really good, still, it is a classic and there's nothing wrong with looking at where GTA came from.Even today it is nice to see that 10 years ago someone could make a game with a huge city full of side missions to complete. I suggest that those of you who love the GTA franchise pick this one up if discounted and spend at least two weekends to see where the series came from. And yes, I know this is out on smartphones along with Vice City, but I'd stick to the good-old keyboard and mouse combo instead of tapping a small screen.			"

												What a big difference to GTA2. I missed a great intro movie but the new 3 dimensional world was just too great to be sad. The point of view of GTA2 is not playable because of bold black borders around the cars, but really soon I didn't missed the old charm.I played many great mods to keep the fun right after finishing the game at 100%.

												I am very biased and nostalgic about this game because i grew up with it. I bought it on steam just so i own another version of the game and to speedrun through it for the 100th time.Putting my biased opinion aside this game is nowhere near as good as vice city and san andreas. The story is not as good, the characters are not as memorable or interesting and the missions themselves are more varied and offer a lot more then gta 3.Vice city and san andreas are easily 10/10 games to me, even though i want to i can't logically give gta 3 a 10 because there is no denying that the others are better. Its also a very short game if you are just focusing on the missions there isn't much to do outside of missions anyway. It will obviously take you longer to beat on your first playthrough the later missions can be very frustrating and difficult to new players. 9/10 (Amazing)			"

Short version: 82%GTAIII offered excellent open world game play and map design with a plethora of interesting characters and a compelling story mode set in the underworld of an alternative New York. Too bad it didn’t age nearly as well as the next two games.Long version:When it came out, GTAIII was heralded as the first great step to a brand new era of Grand Theft Auto games. In retrospect, it is more of a mixture of new elements that later defined the series, and old ones left from the first three games. The location (Liberty City, an alternative New York), many characters, and things like the top-down driving camera, car crusher, bomb shop are all relics of the past, all forgotten in later instalments.They fit nicely alongside the new additions though, like third-person gameplay, the cinematic mission briefings, the new car physics, and the weapon handling system. These all made GTAIII not only accessible to a wider audience, but did so without dumbing down the game too much for the plebs.Exploration and running amok randomly were always part of GTA, and GTAIII is no exception. The return of the rampage challenges and the collectibles also support the free roam aspect, but the real strength lies in the missions. The loose collection of jobs is replaced by a massive storyline about a mute small-time gangster who has to work his way up in organised crime to take revenge on the woman who shot him in the back.The plot is grim, but the execution isn’t so. The series always had a hefty dose of dark humour and liked to satirise the consumer-oriented society. This is even more apparent here, where human lives have no meaning, and you may cause mayhem for the silliest of reasons.The gameplay and controls by today’s standards sadly lack a lot, and the engine isn’t really suited for post Windows XP systems. But if you ever want some GTA nostalgia, this is the best place to start.			"

												Good! Ran on Win7 Ultimate x64 SP1 fine. Though, if you have a multi-monitor setup like I do, you might run into a mouse problem where if you scroll to far to either the right or left or top or bottom, depending on your setup, your cursor will fly out of the game window and onto the desktop(on one of your other monitors) and then when you click the mouse button, the game minimizes which is annoying. Yes so it would appear that the game doesn't lock mouse cursor to the primary monitor or whichever monitor you're using to run the game in, in full-screen. To fix this, you can either disable all but the monitor you're using to play this in, in full-screen or use some sort of third-party patch/software that locks your mouse to a particular monitor until your game closes or whenever. Also there's a glitch if you set your fps cap to more than 30(and 30 is game default), you might instantly die whilst sprinting from a high surface to a lower ground surface. I was playing this with a 60 fps cap and was doing fine, except those rare instant death glitch. Any higher and the game gets pretty glitchy....so it would appear that the game was designed to be played at 30fps? idk. "

												The granddaddy of them all. I played this game back on the PS2, and repurchased the game for Steam so I could have it in perpetuity. All modern sandbox games owe everything to this series, and this game in particular.In case you've never been exposed to a sandbox game before, you effectively are dropped into a city which ""lives"" - you can go around to various contacts looking for missions to accomplish (usually involving driving and shooting), explore the city looking for sights and items to collect, or even accomplish random missions like running a taxi or putting out fires with a fire engine. This game marks what was effectively the first time this sort of freedom was in a 3D game.The game's story puts a low-down person fresh out of going to jail into a criminal underworld where he slowly climbs his way to the top to get revenge. I've played through this game multiple times and while it's ultimately the least of the trilogy, it is the giant whose shoulders the other two stands upon.I have not yet dabbled in the mod scene for this game, but searching around seems to imply there's a fairly healthy number of them to pick from, so if that's your thing, it's worth a look. At any rate, this is a classic which should be a part of anyone's collection. Very, very highly recommended.			"

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is the first game in the series to be in 3D. It's a fantastic jump too. Being the first open world 3D GTA it has it's fantastic but not a perfect game. The City is Liberty City (Same City as GTA IV but more more different)  and is parody of New York, you play and Claude Speed (Who has no voice) after being betrayed by your now ex girlfriend and being put in prison you escape after your police van is attacked and now you're on a revenge trip. The City is large for being the first 3D GTA game and not as alive as Vice City (Vice City only came out not even a year after GTA 3). The Radio is decent having Push it to the Limit otherwise there is only a few recognizeable songs. The Story isn't too great. Your character doesn't talk all he does is go to a person and get a job and then execute it. Not much more than that just rinse and repeat. The jobs range from Assassinations to picking up hookers and driving them to the local Police Ball. The Combat is something I want to touch on too. Not too great. The camera can be wonky at times and the shooting seems clunky (Much more improved in Vice City). There is side content to do. Like Taxi driving and Vigilante Missions though both aren't too interesting but at least they are there for people who like to do that kind of stuff. The Driving is practally the same throughout all the 3D GTA's so theres not much to say except the driving is good but not like a racer and it feels arcadey but fun (Considering it lasted 3 games each being a little more refinded). All in all GTA 3 is still a fantastic experience. Does it still hold up today? Not really depending on your playstyle and if you can deal with not too refined game mechanics and bugs and werid controls. 7.3/10.			"

												While the idea of open world games have been around since the creation of the ultima series, NONE have brought it into the third dimension as effectively as GTA3 has.  When this game came out, there was NOTHING like it at the time, leading to the very birth of the open world genre. On top of being a footnote in gaming history for its stylish, gritty comic book world, you're always being challenged with a wide array of missions that sprouts lots of variety on your way to the top of the criminal hiarchy. In addition to the missions, there's also great incentive to explore every nook and cranny of Liberty City; it's blooming with tons of secret collectables and missions for you to discover where you'd least expect them !All said and done, while some fans consider the sequels to be more polished games, there's no denying that GTA3 wrote the book on how open world games should be made. Liberty City may not be quite as big as other landmarks this day and age, but it's ALWAYS alive, there's never a moment when there's nothing happening, and that's very important to take into consideration when you're designing an open world. Nobody wants massive enviornments with nothing to do in it.Therefore, for all its merits and how well it holds up today, I can't reccomend GTA3 enough to anyone that's interested in not only seeing where it all began, but how much it managed to get right even when people didn't even know what genre to classify this gem under !

												The first thing you should know about GTA III is that it didn't age as well as other games, the later games are more polished (duh) gameplay and storywise.However as someone who hasen't played this game way back when, it's still really good. The Silent Patch for GTA III is needed to run on windows 10 to prevent alot of crashing, it also fixes many bugs and includes features originally not in the PC version. Native Widescreen support is poor, and skews your crosshair, but the widesreen patch fixes these issues. Remember to leave the frame limiter ON, it caps your game at 30 fps but its needed to not break the physics and prevent other bugs. Disable Trails if the ""motionblur"" is too much for you as well. The combat system is alright, armor, cover, and shooting first is a MUST to win firefights as the game gets pretty difficult, especially if you screw up. Remember to save often as well. However it's the atmosphere that really caputred me, from the inhouse-music on the radio stations taht are surprisingly good, to driving around Liberty City, getting shot at by gangs that have a pricetag on your head. Its a city torn apart by crime(one mission has the city in a blown-out turf war by two gangs), but that won't stop you from getting revenge.The story isn't as complex and well thoughtout as other games, but  the setup is really awesome, and there are great moments through out the story. You are a criminal named Claude (last name may or may not be Speed) who was just betrayed by your girlfriend, and left for dead during a bank robbery. When you were being transferd to prison, the prison van was intervented by the Columbian Cartel, who then blew up the bridge you were on after kidnapping a certain inmate who is important later in the story. There were only two survivors of the explosion, you and a fellow inmate nicknamed 8-Ball. You become hired muscle for almost all the gangs in Liberty City, you rob, kill, and run what were supposed to be simple errands gone horribly, horribly wrong to get revenge on your ex. The story is surpisingly intresting if not more basic than say GTA IV or V.Definatly worth a sale purchese, if not the full $10TLDR: Game is good, but not as polished as GTA V. Get The Silent Patch and Widescreen Patch for ALL 3D ERA GTA Games to prevent crashing and improve conmpatibility.			"

												[PROS]Ah where do i begin.. i first played this game when i was 10 or 11 cant really remember and oh boy did i have ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun with this game. GTA 3 at its time was a masterpiece that barely any other game can come close to and raised the standard for the future Grand Theft Autos. The story was quite interesting and i wont spoil anything but in this game you are going to experience rollercoaster of emotions and explore all gangs in liberty city and get to know their plans etc.. The music is exquisite ranging from 80s,Reggae,Techno and even ♥♥♥♥ing Classical music.. yes you can listen to Beethoven while you drive over helpless civilians. This game has alot of cultural refrences and easter eggs you can discover scattered throughout the Liberty City. All in all you get quite a good package here and to consider what sort of crap we are getting today this is pure GOLD.[CONS]However i was quite dissapointed that our main character was bland as ♥♥♥♥... he cannot speak and most of the time he nods like a little baby.Most of the cars are unstable as ♥♥♥♥ and little oversteer will result in you being on a roof and resulting in a big boom.NO ♥♥♥♥ING IN GAME MAP???? ...Had to use google pictures :(..A blast from the past 10/10 would play again.

												It's a good game. I really had a hard time doing some of the missions.The traffic and PED is tricky but working better as Vice City.I managed to complete the game in 16 hours and had a great time. The game had me both laughing and mad at times.It's a good, old school GTA game.It's just difficult that the pay'n spray icons are not displayed on the map.Nor are the ammu-nation locations or any locations of interest. Except for the missions.There is no map button, no way to see the map. Sometimes the game asks you to go to a certain location and you have no idea where that place might be.There is an annoying bridge sound you hear from afar when the bridge opens, pretty annoying.Pretty good game if you ask me. Worth the 10 bucks.			"

												""no more ultra-violence in video games""ESRB came into every single home like a plaque, then rockstar took on the media with two of the most controversial video games to this day, that was manhunt and Grand theft auto three. GTA 3 is based on the work of R* and turned heads in so many crowds, it had such success that the media tried shutting down violence in the video game industry, unfortunetly Rockstar made one of the most successful games that forged a generation of veteran gamers, GTA 3 hold's a special place in my memories, where you can hijack the banshee from across 8 Ball's garage, put a series of gamebreaking cheats to turn this sandbox into the most exciting game for it's time.the GTA veterans will appreciate the trilogy over the recent installment of GTAV which was also a outstanding piece of work by R* games. 10/10			"

												Grand Theft Auto III is the game that changed the gaming world for the better. It was a step in the right direction, this is the first full 3-D 3rd person grand theft auto game, that's right kids, this is the grand daddy of 3-D games!The game takes place in the dark Liberty City, you play as Claude, a mute,but badass, person out for revenge after you were dumped by your girlfriend and shot in the middle of a bank robbery by her.Now claude should do what the Aggalah ft. Sean Price song said: Keep Rising to the Top.The vehicles are great, each handles uniquely, An SUV may be brawny but slow and understeer like hell (or flip over like a landstalker) while a sports car may grip the road and move like a small rat but will easily get damaged. Rockstar games has put a lot of effort into this title. The game lacks features like bikes etc.. but vice city fills that need.The game's story is great, voice acting is good, gameplay is excellent. Soundtrack is top-notch, you'll find Scarface music, Pop and Rock music or 2000s Rap music.I recommend this game even today, it supports X360 controllers with a small mod. 10/10 would recommend!

												Great for a first GTA game in 3D. It was like GTA1 coming to life in 3D, it was excellent and never been done before. I think that's what made it so great.The engine was pretty terrible by the way; it used a filter that would require too much power. Thankfully it could be turned off, but it was still heavy on the CPU usage. Still, if you're looking for the best GTA game, try Vice City or GTA4 first.[Rating: 88/100]			"

The game has aged quite a bit in the graphics department , but it's still fun. If you plan on using a controller with this game, get ready to fight with the camera. The Music in this game is excellent, I find myself listening to these songs even after so many years. When installing the Steam port, I had a lot of problem with textures, but a simple patch fixed all that. I can't say Grand Theft Auto III is the best choice for someone looking for a first time GTA game. It's aged and story is really short. I would say pick up Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, or Grand Theft Auto IV for a first time GTA player. It's still a good game even so. 4/5 - Wonderful			"

												Grand Theft Auto is the definitive answer to all the critics of violence in video games. It simply smashes all those statements allowing you to kill anyone you see, destroy everything and have a good time too. It raised a lot of controversy that did nothing but help the sales, my guess is that it's the best card Rockstar has under their sleeve (and don't forget Jack Thompson). The series have seen a new life within 3D graphics, making Rockstar Games, become superstars. These days it's easy to see the faults of the game, but it's a very nice nostalgic feeling of returning to this world of crime and violence... Ah good days.			"

But still this game has its own taste. If you don't mind old graphics and pretty high difficulty you can get dozens of fun here. Apart from that, there's also few negative moments. Ok, you can not swim. Ok, there's only cars and not a damn bike. But the absence of a map is driving my f*cking crazy at the beginning. There's really big city (ok, not so big comparing to the next chapters), so give me a normal map and not a mocking circle in the corner.			"

And that Claude Speed as a mute, makes him by far the best GTA protagonist of the entire Grand Theft Auto Franchise.. Since nothing is better than a mute human (lol).

Combat system is pretty much terrible, but that is weighted up by the story (all though not as deep as the other games in the 3D-GTA-series) and the amount and hours of fun you will experience in this game. This game drives you to explore the environment (all though not as much as VC and SA), but it is, in my opinion, way more fun than, for example, GTA IV, which was an epic fail.

												Grand Theft Auto III is literally a landmark and pinnacle achievement in game development.Having only briefly played the first GTA back in the late 90's on a friend's Playstation (I had,well, still have, an N64. Works fine too.) I didn't know what the craze was all about when this masterpiece was originally released in 2001. I watched another friend play it for days on his PS2 while his great dane stared at me. The only thing I gathered was the silent protagonist could go on shooting sprees and kill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. I hadn't paid much attention to the story. But having finally laid my hands on the PC copy (on Steam of course, only thing I laid my hands on were a 360 controller) I grasped the unique and ubiquitious narrative with excitement. Of course I knew the sandbox formula in the GTA universe. I'd played through GTA IV several times in 2008 and even beat Liberty City Stories on the PSP! (I'd also played GTA: San Andreas prior to this, just a few months ago). So I knew what to expect. I knew the characters, I knew the story, mostly, and knew the gameplay. It might be 2014, but the 3D graphics are still interesting, the camera work that was chosen; cinematic and professional, the dialogue; true to the gangs' styles. What really makes the game is the satirical take on violent societies as well as the strangeness authenticity to cities such as NY or LA.Not the greatest game storywise, but still enjoyable when you consider that Claude, although emotionless and silent, is the most badass protagonist.9.5/10			"

												Okay gameplay (something between VC and SA), pretty nice graphics, but thats all. Story line for this game is -1/10, literally there is no story line. Random and nonsense movies before missions, main character who dont say a word in whole game and context... Yes, context is missing here totally. Just awfull comparing to San Andreas or Vice City. And music in all radio stations just wasnt for me, used my own playlist from PC what isnt good thing for game IMO. And yes, I know, this game is more like old GTA's - just for missions, but still I cant handle missing story line here. Just for missions and default GTA stuff this game will be ok i guess.			"

												Freedom is the name of this game, featuring a downtown playscape so massively intricate that players can literally do whatever they want, whenever they want. From the music on the radio to the individual sub-missions that make up a large part of the game, GTA3 pulls it off with amazing ease.A fantastically designed and fun game that’s one of the most absorbing, entertaining titles released in a while. It gets better and better with every single day, as you continue discovering new little features here and there.It's funny, well built and almost flawless in terms of game-destroying problems.An amazingly huge, free-roaming, entertaining game that will last you for ages and is a must-have for everyone old enough to own it.

												It's definitely made its mark on the gaming industry, and despite being vastly inferior to its successors, I'd still say give this one a try.Personally, I experienced some glitches, such as garbled splash screens, emergency vehicles appearing black, and splash screens not fading fully during gameplay, however I've heard this is a Windows 10 issue lol.

												This is an pretty decent game. The story and missions are fun and take some time to finish, and it forces the player to explore parts of the city to finish missions and find weapons. There were some difficult missions that frustrated me because either they weren't clear enough with the instructions or the timer was too short and it rushed the missions for me so I needed to find a walkthrough to finish. The cars in this game flips over really easily and you can't flip them upright no matter how hard you try so that might ruin some gameplay and missions for you especially if gangs and police are chasing you and ram your car over. With a silent protagonist and not alot to offer after finishing the main missions it's not worth coming back to. I never felt immersed like I did in San Andreas or GTA 5, the soundtrack wasn't that great but it did bring nostalgic memories back. I would recommend this game if it's on sale or if you're looking to play it again for nostalgic reasons.			"

												I have a long history with this game. I would get home from school when I was 5 and ask my mother and father to play it. I played this game all the time. I have been playing this game for almost 12 years now, so this game is mostly nostalgia for me. The game is very basic in gameplay. The story is good, the characters are good. Only bad thing about this game, is it is very basic, but it was the first 3D GTA game to come out in 2001. Vice City, in my opinion, is better, but this game is more of a childhood game for me, more than Vice City.			"

												Don't get me wrong, GTA III is an awesome game - arguably one of the very best GTA games ever made (the story is a helluva lot better than GTA V), but this Steam version is garbage. The game was made for Windows 95 and in typical Rockstar fashion, they continue to sell it unpatched despite it not running properly, or even at all, on modern systems. Even in compatibility mode, you're lucky if you can get it to work without crashing or freezing on every loading screen (which means every few minutes if you do the missions). Intro videos won't even play at all, because they're in a resolution too low to be supported by modern graphics cards and monitors.If you run Windows XP, you may be able to run this game, but otherwise I'd recommend to not bother wasting your money. Otherwise, GTA III is a great game. It was the first GTA game to depart from the top-down view and try for a more indepth story. It's of course old and looks old now, but it set a new standard in its day and was one of the very first open world games. Just don't support greedy developers who continue selling old games without bothering making sure they even work on current hardware (hell, they can't even be bothered to support GTA V, so not really a surprise).

												Played it for the first time ever, so it's a fresh look without nostalgia.Gameplay is solid, it's fun to drive around, sadly the world is small and dead and there's not much to do aside from the missions.Radio is horrible, with only one good music station (Flashback), two stations that have a couple good songs (Lips and Head) and an amazing Chatterbox with Lazlow. When I got tired from music I listened to him non stop. All other stations are worthless.Some characters have broken motivation for their actions. Plot is semi-non existent. It's told in little bits, just so that we can get the picture, but it fails at being a mosaic that we put together and ends up distant from the player. And the ending is anti-climactic.In the end it's not enough. Playtime is decent, it took me 18 hours to complete, with exploration, side missions and package retrieving. But the plot could've used some more depth. Characters could've been drawn out better. They appear and dissapear and slip out of the mind.It is a good game, but perhaps the worst GTA I've played.

												It may be old, but it's a GTA, and in fact it's THE Grand Theft Auto that marked a milestone in the gaming industry and the very first title in the franchise to be in 3D. It's simply one of those classics you should play at least once. Maybe it's just nostalgia talking, but the game is still enjoyable after all its years. I recommend installing the Xbox graphics mod though, so it all looks a little nicer. Amazing soundtrack as always, not very complicated missions (yet fun to play through), great humour (the radios get me everytime) and the very first appearance of Catalina!

												The true father of modern GTA games and probably the prime catalyst for modern open-world sandbox games in general. You know what to expect with a Grand Theft Auto game, a mediocre story, fun but sometimes infuriating missions and lots and lots of messing around. The real joy here is just hopping in a car (or boat, if you can stand the wonky controls), putting on your favorite channel and just cruising. This version is the excellant PC conversion done in 2002 with a great control layout and runs perfectly on my Win7 64bit OS.			"

												The very first GTA game i played back in the day. Blew my mind that a game existed like this as early as 2001; the amount of attention to detail whether it be cars, npcs, or the fact that its a very open world amazed me. For anyone that hasn't played it yet, i highly recommend you do.Story: You play as Claude, a mute protagonist of the game. The story of GTA 3 tends to branch itself out with the various interesting characters you meet. I didnt really pay attention to the story too much until GTA IV but i can tell you that 3 does deliver some interesting story telling.Gameplay: The gameplay is in Thirdperson, but you can switch to first person while using certain weapons. You are able to run, sprint, jump and crouch. There are many cars to drive as well as boats and flyable vehicles.Music/SFX/Voiceacting: The music to GTA 3 is usually heard via the radio, Rockstar knows how to pick out good songs; its on par with the music selection for Tony Hawk Pro Skater games. The sound effects are also really well made. The voiceacting is pretty good for its time as well.			"

												It may be old, but it's a GTA, and in fact it's THE Grand Theft Auto that marked a milestone in the gaming industry and the very first title in the franchise to be in 3D. It's simply one of those classics you should play at least once. Maybe it's just nostalgia talking, but the game is still enjoyable after all its years. I recommend installing the Xbox graphics mod though, so it all looks a little nicer. Amazing soundtrack as always, not very complicated missions (yet fun to play through), great humour (the radios get me everytime) and the very first appearance of Catalina! Loved it!Definitely get it and play this piece of gaming history. Oh, and just try to keep it brief when talking to Claude, unless you w...*bang*			"

												This game is really fun and nostaligic to play, The soundtrack is great,  The story is fun and its just fun to drive around with Flashback FM blasting while running over pedestrians and cops coming after you. The game runs fine for me on both Windows 7, and Windows 10 without issues. Also, The game is not limited to 30 FPS like the Framerate police said, I guess they do not know what the frame limiter option is... 10/10 GET THIS OR VICE CITY			"

												This is a truly amazing game we have here. It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character (Claude Speed) and his friend (8-Ball) who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and A-I may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on: progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. I'd suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that aren't 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but you'll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices (these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded). I'd heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isn't consistantly behind the player. This version however has many pros, such as extra items on the map, customizeable skins, mods and many more things. Overall this game is worth the purchase.			"

												This is the game, this is where it all started. In 2001 Rockstar games released this title and made history and pretty much everyone has played this game and knows what's it about, but the question is - while being a ground breaking title more than 10 years ago, is it worth playing now and how it has aged ? So game looks pretty good, for the time and even now-days  the graphics feels tolerable. It features day & night cycles and dynamic weather. Environment is pretty huge and worth exploring, you'll find some hidden weapons, side missions etc.Voice acting is done pretty well, however recordings them selves are at pretty low quality, game has several radio stations with different styles of music and tracks, however I disliked pretty much every soundtrack, but maybe thats just me and for the time that music was actually pretty cool.Story is really generic, with you leveling up and making name for yourself in underground crime scene. Game had descent number and variety of missions, starting with some more simple and ending with some quite creative goals for the time, sometimes even involving whole map. It took me about 13 hours to complete the story and do about 40-60% of side stuff.One aspect where game have aged terribly is the game play it self. Car handling is good, but physics sometimes are just awkward and bizarre and sometimes slightest hit can make your car flip and spin like in first flat out game. Gun controls also are pretty weird, were you have to often aim at where bullets are going not where crosshair is pointed. Missions themselves are quite challenging and more than often i found myself replaying same missions more than 3 times in row. At the end i would recommend this game if you somehow missed this title, to see where sandbox genre has started. If you want to go and get some nostalgic feel than it's a mixed bag, with some things cool and fun to play while others just being aged and a bit frustrating. I guess at the time game was mind blowing and had earned a lot of 10/10s, but today for me game feel's like solid 7.0. Thanks for reading.			"

												The game that invented sandbox gaming, and a powerful gaming series! Admittedly not very well done on the PC (very buggy, practically unplayable) but was AMAZING on the PS2. The game is visibly outdated by today's standards, but put yourself in the mindset of this games release day, and you will enjoy imminsely. For best effect, make sure vertical sync and frame lmiters are ON. If they are ON, you will see all cars as black due to a bug. But if they are OFF, especially on higher end PCs, the game will play in fast forward, and virtually every tiny little thing will take health from you (falling off the curb, etc). But aside from the cars looking weird, the game plays fine. Enjoy a classic!			"

												This was the first GTA I ever played. It was part of what got me into gaming. So much fun can be had just rolling around in a car listening to the radio (great soundtracks!) and just generally adding to the game's debauchery. Then there's the missions, which can be both difficult and fun (and strange!). This was /*the*/ game growing up, and it's held up well to the test of time. I recommend this game for anyone looking for an open world sand box game to just generally have fun with music for hours on end. It's worth every penny.			"

												Ah, Grand Theft Auto III. Where do I begin? Hello again friends! Like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, I have been playing Grand Theft Auto III since its release date back in 2001. When this game was first released it was revolutionary! The first 3D Grand Theft Auto! Amazing, truly amazing. The storyline is excellent (♥♥♥♥ YOU, CATALINA!) and the soundtrack is actually not that bad (listen to Rise, MSX, Flashback FM, Head Radio and last but not least Double Cleff FM). The only downfall to this game was not including the beautiful and talented Misty into more missions. What a shame. Anyways, if you are sitting here reading this review contemplating whether or not to buy Grand Theft Auto III I say buy it RIGHT NOW. It is a classic. Also like Vice City, this game was made when Rockstar actually cared about gameplay more than appearance. So if that doesn't make you want to buy this game I don't know what will. Once again friends, I thank you for taking the time from your busy schedules and I sincerely hope that I have influenced your opinion on Grand Theft Auto III and your choice on games.Yours in gaming,Dubgame.

												Grand Theft Auto III is the game that led the ""open world adventure"" video game era. Grand Theft Auto is personally my favorite video game series, and Rockstar hasn't given me a reason for it not to be. The game is usually $5 on big sales, and I picked it up during the Winter 2013 Sale. The missions are challenging, and there are tons of them. Side quests, main missions, sensitive controls and physics. Try ramming a car into a streetlight, or a try pushing a car with a fire truck for a while. This game promises hours of fun and goofiness, while at the same time coming off as serious and meaningful. Enjoy the game, 10/10.			"

												Pros: Holds up really well. The city feels real, alive, with different sections inhabited by different groups/gangs(Chinatown, the Mafia's turf, etc.). All of the radio channels are worth listening through. Sharp satire, much of which remains applicable. Cars, boats and a plane to use. A ton of stuff to do, keeping you playing long after you've completed the storyline. Cool story, with twists and backstabbings - a proper big city crime story. Great mission design.Cons: Shooting is pretty bad(they did realize, and put more emphasis on car-missions, thankfully). The early-ish 3D graphics have really aged. Barely a personality to the protagonist.My recommendation: a must for any fan of open-world gaming.			"

The acting in this game set the standard for many Rockstar games to come, as if Max Payne wasn't good enough!

												If you play this game as it was meant to be played - as a mission-based game, with the possibility of diversion - it's the best GTA by far, and one of the best games ever made.The cars are unstable and break apart quickly, and walking is not a viable option for more than a block, meaning that you will have to keep commiting crimes and attracting police attention. This ensures that the pacing will never bog down. The high difficulty of the latter missions is completely necessary to the game, as it brings out the greatest strengths of the open world genre - the player will often HAVE to get creative and find an alternative way to solve a mission, because the ""standard"" way is either too hard or outright impossible. Couple this with a ton of potential for utter chaos to occur, due to rather chaotic, ""loose"" mechanics, and you have possibly the greatest use of the free-roaming model ever.An utterly brilliant game. It's not perfect - it could be larger, the story could be a bit more complex, and the shooting could be a little better, but don't get Vice City or San Andreas over this. They're good, but this is, even after all these years, still the best free-roaming action game that we have.			"

												If the video games of the 1980's are remembered for Super Mario Bros and the 90's are remembered for Mortal Kombat and (sadly) Superman 64, the early 2000's will be remembered for Grand Theft Auto III. It introduced a truly non-linear concept onto gaming and emphasized choice and freedom over everything at the time. While it is mostly known for its violence and the fact you could have terribly animated car sex with a hooker, do not forget its godfather inspired storyline and quite frankly hilarious dialog. Nothing is more hilarious than hearing a police helicoptor pilot exclaim he's going to kill you when the co-pilot is going ""YOU CANT SAY THAT, ITS NOT IN THE BOOK!"". The controls are sluggish by todays standard and if you're wanting the definative GTA game on this engine it is San Andreas you should be looking at, but lets not forget the game that started all.Saints row is still a better game than GTAIV however, deal with it.

Grand Theft Auto 3 was developed and published by Rockstar and Take-Two Interactive.Grand Theft Auto 3 is revolutionary for bringing about the realization of a 3D open world game in the bustling mimicry of New York known as Liberty City. The possibilities in Grand Theft Auto 3 are truly up to you. Jack cars, drive off cliffs, start a massacre, jump off buildings and bridges, hook up with P rostitutes, work for crime syndicates...the least of what is possible in this game and it's sequels is entirely up to the persons choice, a relic of freedom in gaming.

												Grand Theft Auto III is the game that led the ""open world adventure"" video game era. Grand Theft Auto is personally my favorite video game series, and Rockstar hasn't given me a reason for it not to be. The game is usually $5 on big sales, and I picked it up during the Winter 2013 Sale. The missions are challenging, and there are tons of them. Side quests, main missions, sensitive controls and physics. Try ramming a car into a streetlight, or a try pushing a car with a fire truck for a while. This game promises hours of fun and goofiness, while at the same time coming off as serious and meaningful. Enjoy the game, 10/10.			"

												Pros: Holds up really well. The city feels real, alive, with different sections inhabited by different groups/gangs(Chinatown, the Mafia's turf, etc.). All of the radio channels are worth listening through. Sharp satire, much of which remains applicable. Cars, boats and a plane to use. A ton of stuff to do, keeping you playing long after you've completed the storyline. Cool story, with twists and backstabbings - a proper big city crime story. Great mission design.Cons: Shooting is pretty bad(they did realize, and put more emphasis on car-missions, thankfully). The early-ish 3D graphics have really aged. Barely a personality to the protagonist.My recommendation: a must for any fan of open-world gaming.			"

												This is not as good as vice city or san andreas but it is the first one of the 3d universe and it inspired all open world games we have today.It has missions that can be really hard, gun play is also hard and iritating because you have no autoaim like console versions.so you better need to have a good mouse and some good aim to hit ennemies from long distances because you are dead in a second if people are shooting at you.Also i need to note something bad and that is......AI... The ai in this game is the most iritating and one of the only bad things about it.especially car ai, people drive like ♥♥♥♥ in this game and they keep crashing into you.			"

												GTA III is back when Grand Theft Auto was still kind of brutal.  The dark atmosphere and the fact that the game is always during the nighttime is really unhelpful and just doesn't feel like it fits the ridiculous pretentions the GTA games in the past and in the future embodied.  GTA IV is certainly an improvement on the idea, but GTA III has enough good ideas that I can let it get away with it.  Everything is really dynamic, cars don't spin out like there's grease on the wheels, although there is a blighting lack of bikes, the narrative is solid and even though the BJ Blascowitz lookalike doesn't talk and therefore has no personality, there's nothing objectivly bad with it.  It's a fine and fair reminder of where all this began.			"

												I chose to play this to go back to the start of the most recent installments of the franchise. I've played later titles such as San Andreas (which are i think overall better games) but having said that this is still good value for money if you don't already own it. The gameplay, graphics, size of the open world etc are of course more basic than later versions and there's the incredibly annoying downside of the character not being able to swim. Overall though there's still nothing quite as much fun as setting a gangster on fire while he's trying to kill you or doing an insane 400ft jump off a cliff. There's a reason this game got so much attention when it was released			"

												This is the game that started it all - the craze of third person, open world sandbox games. GTA III has a immersive story that you follow, and along the way, wreak havok on Liberty City to your heart's content. With a varied range of weapons and vehicles, achieve your goals in any way you feel like it, or just explore what Liberty City has to offer. Time has not been so kind to the graphics of GTA III, and animations are a bit wonky and broken, but that doesn't detract from the fun that will be had during the whole game. On top of all this as well the game features fleshed out characters and stories than few games had achieved at the time, and a very memorable soundtrack.Replayability, unfortunately, is one of GTA III's shortcomings as there's not much to engage in after the main story has been passed, save for rather bland side missions, and blowing up Liberty City for the 100th time, there's not much after to look forward to. 8.6/10			"

												The game that invented sandbox gaming, and a powerful gaming series! Admittedly not very well done on the PC (very buggy, practically unplayable) but was AMAZING on the PS2. The game is visibly outdated by today's standards, but put yourself in the mindset of this games release day, and you will enjoy imminsely. For best effect, make sure vertical sync and frame lmiters are ON. If they are ON, you will see all cars as black due to a bug. But if they are OFF, especially on higher end PCs, the game will play in fast forward, and virtually every tiny little thing will take health from you (falling off the curb, etc). But aside from the cars looking weird, the game plays fine. Enjoy a classic!			"

												This is a truly amazing game we have here. It may be a little dated and all but there are mods for that. This game has a great introduction introducing the main character (Claude Speed) and his friend (8-Ball) who comes into the story again much later. You start doing minor jobs as a driver for a pimp/club owner. Then you do jobs for the mafia from heisting a bank truck, to delivering a corpse to cover up a murder. Again the graphics and A-I may be a little dated but the initial freedom does certainly put a smile on your face. The game has two paths you can go on: progress through the story, or just explore. To start you probably want to explore to get used to it. I'd suggest stealing a taxi and doing the taxi oddjob, which after you complete 100 fares you unlock a special taxt called the Borgnine. The police chases are endless fun as they are in any GTA game. I grew up on this game so it may warp my vision of its age a bit with nostalgia but still it is a great game. It does lack in several elements that are key in GTA games today, such as the lack of a full map and not being able to rotate the camera around your vehicle in angles that aren't 90 degrees, and the aiming is a little off but you'll get used to it. There also other versions such as the PS2 version, Xbox, and mobile Android and iOS devices (these versions do not support cheats but are easily modded). I'd heavily suggest that you play the PS2 version first to get a feel for what your getting into. The main differences between the PC and the PS2 are that PS2 has an auto targeting system and the camera isn't consistantly behind the player. This version however has many pros, such as extra items on the map, customizeable skins, mods and many more things. Overall this game is worth the purchase.			"

												If you've got a low-end PC and some time to kill, you could do a lot worse than this.  It's a very good port and actually features some improvements over its console counterparts (FPS style aiming ftw).  It's always nice to give respect to the classics, and this is definitely one that gets sweeter with age.  There's something timeless about the rythm and cadence of exploring and completing missions in a game like this.  Something that the newer games have sadly lacked.  If you've got the inclination, get back to your roots sometime with this classic.  You'll probably have more fun than you think.			"

												A classic like no other. The story is silly - why they decided for a silent protagonist is beyond me, but the missions past the initial tutorials are generally good and fun (and lucky don't bring ""morality"" or ""film-like plots"" into it much). Very tough end game and not a great deal to do outside of missions but there is a lot of gameplay, and in spite of dated graphics it holds up remarkably well, with just about every modern GTA's gameplay mechanics in plain sight - something to mull over when contemplating any future ones since most of it has been done before.

												Ah, GTA III.It took me a while to ""discover"" this game. Sure I had seen it at the store and had even picked up the game to look at the artwork and screenshots but for some reason I never bought it. That is until a co-worker of mine, at the time, did a story on violence in video games. I worked at a TV News station at the time and the story was definately NOT pro game or pro GTA. After watching someone bring in their PS2 and played a bit so they could record some footage I was hooked and went and bought the game.GTA III is a sandbox game and very non-linear. Actually if you want to visit the rest of the areas in the game you do have to complete the threshold of missions to unlock those parts of the game but you can take your time and do other things in the mean time.Today the graphics look a bit dated but back in it's day the game was pretty cutting edge.  The controls were pretty easy to pick up though aiming the weapons needed some help. Driving the cars (which is the gist of the game) is straight forward too and all the cars have different capabilities. A sports car drives like a sports car while a truck drives like a truck.The game has plenty of controversies to be sure. One of them is the ability to pick up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to ""heal"" you.  After you are done with your tryst you can, though are not required to, kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get your money back. Critics lambast the game for the ability to do this but realistically the game presents you with a moral choice and it's up to you to do, or not do, bad things in the game.I do enjoy this game though it's harder for me to play it now then it was over 10 years ago. I tend to be the player who only wants to unlock stuff to explore and when I do I get bored with the missions.  I guess in reality, I never did finish the game. I unlocked the last island and did a number of quests but I spent most of my time driving around in cool sports cars and exploring the game world.This was a defining game and because of that it should be checked out. I have fond memories of my time spent in Liberty City.			"

												It's a great and original concept, even though it has some downsides such as crashing opening video screens, terrible menu glitches in which it's invisible, poor FPS settings. For the actual game I think it's very repetitive, but what most people like about it is that it's an open world. Gameplay, graphics and the characters are neat and I love how the protagonist is silent. Joystick support is terrible, it does not feature auto aim nor does the joysticks work properly. Orginality and an open world environment is what makes this boat sail. I thought the story was fairly alright. imdbScore: 7.5/10			"

												The grand daddy of sandbox fps/driving games! for many of us it was our first GTA and it definitely was my first taste of the GTA universe! I had this game on the ps2 10 years ago when I was 11 and it one of my favorite games at the time next to Jak & Daxter and all the other goodies... GTA III holds a special place in my heart since it was just so much fun to cause mayhem in the city and when I found out about the cheat codes my replay value of this game rose near 10x! it was just so great trying to get the wanted level as high as possible and drving a tank around running over everyone heheh! :) I don't think I ever beat it but I might try to beat this steam version since I no longer have my ps2 version... anywho for those who never played it (and really whoever hasn't get out from under that rock!) or for those that have it's just a great game to have in your steam library and to play every once in a while listening to the great soundtrack and destroying everyone and everything! :D			"

												Ah, GTA III.It took me a while to ""discover"" this game. Sure I had seen it at the store and had even picked up the game to look at the artwork and screenshots but for some reason I never bought it. That is until a co-worker of mine, at the time, did a story on violence in video games. I worked at a TV News station at the time and the story was definately NOT pro game or pro GTA. After watching someone bring in their PS2 and played a bit so they could record some footage I was hooked and went and bought the game.GTA III is a sandbox game and very non-linear. Actually if you want to visit the rest of the areas in the game you do have to complete the threshold of missions to unlock those parts of the game but you can take your time and do other things in the mean time.Today the graphics look a bit dated but back in it's day the game was pretty cutting edge.  The controls were pretty easy to pick up though aiming the weapons needed some help. Driving the cars (which is the gist of the game) is straight forward too and all the cars have different capabilities. A sports car drives like a sports car while a truck drives like a truck.The game has plenty of controversies to be sure. One of them is the ability to pick up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to ""heal"" you.  After you are done with your tryst you can, though are not required to, kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get your money back. Critics lambast the game for the ability to do this but realistically the game presents you with a moral choice and it's up to you to do, or not do, bad things in the game.I do enjoy this game though it's harder for me to play it now then it was over 10 years ago. I tend to be the player who only wants to unlock stuff to explore and when I do I get bored with the missions.  I guess in reality, I never did finish the game. I unlocked the last island and did a number of quests but I spent most of my time driving around in cool sports cars and exploring the game world.This was a defining game and because of that it should be checked out. I have fond memories of my time spent in Liberty City.			"

												This game came out in 2001. By those standards, this game was golden. A full 3D city to drive around, shoot, and get into trouble. Set the standard for modern sandbox games. By today's standard it doesn't fare so well. Besides the main missions there isn't much to do, and it has very limited graphics for today. It also has issues with modern systems. Widescreen does not work so you'll need to turn that off to achieve 16:9 resolutions properly. I recommend it because this is a gem of video game history. I personally enjoy playing old games, but it requires a lot of patience. 9/10			"

												I was suprised I was able to purchase this game at all from the shelves. I will not mention the city it was purchased from but lets just say they would ban the future installments of the series.I had to wait years before I could play the game however since I tried to play this on my first PC which only had a 16mb graphic card.I was still in elementary when I was in possession of the game.As a kid I had enjoyed rampaging about in the previous intallments of the GTA series, most notably GTA2 when visiting friends or at family functions away from my parents prying eyes.I began to do the same with GTA3 senslessly going around committing a rampage. Then I started to delve into the story and it was then my appreciation for the series grew. As much the story was simple and some characters were bland, there were those characters which grew on you.The satire within the game makes it all more enjoyable. Compared with future installments it felt as if GTA3 had only begun dabbling into some of the satire whereas the others ambitiously plunged further.			"

I first played this on the Playstation 2 big change into the new 3D engine at the time. For the playstation 2 this was a big leap forward with plenty to explore, rich characters, fun weapons & making the star signs go up being in a mad city police chase. Other GTA titles have done well but never matched this titles story & urban city feel, Certainly one of the greatest games in history.			"

If you are looking for one of the classiest open-world games the world has ever seen until 2001 then this is the perfect starting point, I personally guarantee you, actually the entire world guarantees you, try it, ask anybody :)Pros:- made by Rockstar Games- leaves nostalgic footprint- you can mod the heck out of this game, literally edit/create the entire game [into a new game if you so desire] (you should know this by now)- it is long; a lot of missions and things to be done- 10/10 replayabilityCons:- it is old (but that doesn't matter)Score: 9.9/10Conclusion: Its a must!!!

												Just beat the game for the first time, ironically the only 3D GTA game left for me to finish, but there's a first for everything, right?GTA III gave me a hard time sometimes, but in a good way. It's got a nice difficulty level to it which is never unfair to beat, but usually challenging. Storyline is alright, good enough for a 2001 third-person shooter. Gameplay works like a charm. It's running extremely stable on Windows 10, have not experienced a single game crash in 20 hours of playing - very nice! Final mission: rather simple, but satisfying enough, surely. Works for me.What I didn't like is the fact that GTA III does not have a complete built-in map, only the minimap on the radar, and how the game expects you to know your environment better than you usually would, such as having to find out where the tunnel from Staunton Island to Shoreside Vale is to be found - very tricky when having to escort a police officer in merely three minutes. But that's just that. Small things to criticize, nothing that would ruin a very, very neat game like GTA III for me personally. CAN recommend - especially if you're into rather simple gameplay, and like a good challenge.			"

												One of the greatest games ever made and a title which broke boundaries on the open world genre. GTA III made Rockstar Games a household name and this belongs in anyone's library. Whether you're playing it for the very first time, or revisting after playing on PS2/Xbox, you will have a hell of a time. Quite simply, Grand Theft Auto 3 defined a generation. It doesn't even matter that the protagonist Claude Speed is mute, the gameplay will keep you entertained for hours on end. The graphics are dated by today's standards true, but I personally don't think they detract from the overall experience. Mods can help with that.You have many story missions to complete, side missions and other odd jobs and collectibles so replay value wise, you are roughly looking at 20 hours+ so what are you waiting for? Download this gem and see what all the fuss is about! Rise FM - The best in-game radio station! (Oh, and going on a six star wanted level with a tank still holds up to this day)			"

												I grew up playing GTA3 when it came out on PS2.  Back then, it was awesome.Now, not so much.  Many cars have high centers of gravity such that they easily roll over when making turns, the surfaces result in your car crashing from the slightest of bumps, and cars are very fragile such that they blow up relatively easily not to mention they catch on fire and explode if they're rolled over which can kill you very easily, especially if a gang is shooting you and the police decide to shoot at you because you ran over a gang member. The compass doesn't show points of interest outside of mission origins such that you have to pause the game and refer to an online map to catch your bearings if you want to find health, armor, gun shops, pay and sprays, or safehouses.  The targeting system the PS2 version came with is broken since you either use standard controls which don't target or classic controls which do but don't allow your mouse to freely aim.  A lot of the missions are ridiculous as well in that they're timed while you have to weave through congested traffic and the computer gets insane handling.  Lastly, many players complain of launching bugs.  I had a few myself, but thankfully got around them.  The menu button labels start transparent and gradually fade into appearance.  The game itself will freeze you computer in the intro screens unless you launch in compatibility mode as an administrator.  The game also defaults to poor resolutions that many players are unable to play without.15 years ago, this game was the bomb.  Now, it just has a lot of flaws that aren't worth dealing with.			"

												WAY TOO LONG, DIDN'T READ: It can be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to get running well, some mods are basically a must, story is 'meh' Driving is good, the rest of the gameplay like shooting is okay, has a fair amount of stuff to keep you busy, radio and soundtrack are still very good, is an important game to go back and play if you haven't just bear in mind it's seriously old now and does have some f*****g stupid problems which will annoy at times.""Liberty City, USA.The worst place in america.""Yes, I will be recommending this game but please note the recommendation comes with some pretty hefty caveats, that is for as good as I believe this game still is, there is also some seriously flawed and outdated design and game mechanic aspects to it.Firstly it's basically required in my eyes to mod the game before playing, that is to get a vastly improved experience over say, the PS2 original at least which was the only way I'd ever played it for 10+ years prior, although I'm talking simple ""bring it up a bit more to modern standards"" mods, not game changing/breaking over the top s**t, the ""Silent patch"" and the XBOX version-PC conversion are probably the best two to go with.Although getting the game running properly at all with or without mods can be a bit of a bear, it took me literally an entire day to get it good 'n' proper with the mods.   :L The joys of running 14 year old software on modern OS's and whatnot.BUT if you manage to wrestle with all that and get it going it's still (mostly) worth playing.The story is preeety meh and basic, but then it's gonna be with a lead character who's seen so much ♥♥♥♥ that he's sworn to silence. ""Claude, baby, we're all in this together, we gotta be strong, tell each other what's wrong, you gotta open up budyy, YOU CAN'T JUST BUTTON IT UP CLAUDE!"" ahem, excuse me, moving on.So yeah, cut scenes, story and acting not exactly riveting but remember that this is a game from just after the turn of the century and should be given at least some slack for it.Gameplay however (again mostly) still stands up, well enough to still enjoy it anyway, driving is actually really well balanced and it's rather fun to blast around the city with the ""handbrake, just f*****g handbrake everything"" handling, only problem is the vehicles are very weak indeed and are guaranteed to spontaneously combust after just a few shunts and even fewer gun shots, like seriously few gun shots, like literally 2 shotgun hits and BOOM! Instant explosion and wasted, not great.Movement and shooting are generally acceptable, just so long as you're quite slow, careful and don't let enimies get behind you cos if you do then the outdated, awkwardness of the controls will rear it's ugly head...badly, as long as you keep on top of them you'll be fine little jimmy.Mission variety and general 'stuff' to do are pretty good actually, (yet again especially for a 15 year old game, back in 2001 it felt like you could do almost anything!) they managed to incorporate some reasonably interesting scenarios despite the extremely limited ways to interact with the world, then there's a number of side attractions, apart from the now GTA staple of simply running/driving around tearing everyone and everything 'a new one' there's a few races, GTA 1 esque phonebooth missions, police car, ambulance, fire engine and taxi challenges, a couple of off road driving challenges, hidden packages to find, (which actually have a useful reward) garages for collecting rare vehicles, stunt jumps, rampages, RC destruction and probably something else I've forgotten about, now that I think about it there's probably more 'side' content than main story content, a trend which would DEFINITELY continue as the series progressed.Now here comes some issues, ya know little things like LARGE PORTIONS OF THE MAP BECOMING STRICTLY OUT OF BOUNDS AREAS!! Thanks to the idiotic choice of giving all the gang members which you've upset, which is most of them by the later stages of the game by the way, some of the most powerful weapons in the game and terminator like scanning systems to pick you out and blow you to pieces in 2.5 seconds despite you zooming by at 110mph in a banshee.And then there's the four, five and six star wanted levels, it's...indescribable at times, it can truly feel like a glitch sometimes, it's just so much no, that's all that needs to be said on that matter.   >:(On a more positive note however, even when you're getting your ♥♥♥♥ ripped open at least you get to listen to the still great, eclectic mix of music, talkshows and adverts on the radio, GTA always nails the time period it's going for and III is no exception, it's basically become a time capsule to the late 90's/early 00's and it's still awesome, social commentary 'n all.Finally, I just think this is an important game to play, like games such as Super Mario Bros. and DOOM before it, it was a cultural and sales phenomenom and spawned countless 'clones' as everyone tried to jump on the bandwagon but at least in terms of impact and popularity no one ever really came close.

So, I recommend to launch in compatibility mode with Windows 98, as administrator and run at 640x480. I'm aware that is awful to run this game like that, but perhaps you will not be able to even launch it if you don't.It would be great if Rockstar could release like a HD patch supporting better resolutions, though.But, please, don't let that little problem convince you to not buying it.

												GTA III is a great game. It's a big step up from the predecessive Grand Theft Auto games, and it's very enjoyable. It offers a wide array of activities, and is generally just a very fun game; gives a very nostalgic feeling too.Definitely buy it. "

												We go back to 2001-2002 when Rockstar Games finally figured out how to transform Grand Theft Auto from 2D to 3D.There isn't really much to say other than you're name is Claude, you have no voice.. and you're in Liberty City. The only problem i have with this is the horrible draw distance/close pop-in (even when the draw distance is set to maximum) and because of something within a file all the car colours are very very dark.I say buy it, and with the Steam Summer Sale.. Buy it now in the bundle along with Grand Theft Auto: Vice City and Grand Theft Auto: SanAndreas			"

												Firstly, it's Grand Theft Auto. Any title is awesome (besides GTA IV's PC port, but that's on a performance's POV) and GTA III is the first of three games that are set on III's universe, therefore Rockstar names it the GTA III trilogy. I mainly played the game again for nostalgia (remember, it's from 2002, I know right, time goes by so fast) and for the fact that I hadn't truly completed the game in the past. Setting that aside, GTA III's story is not original but it's only a pretense for the crazy missions you will be doing. You will always have some people (you get to work with the mafia, yakuza, etc) your character goes to, to receive a mission, then on and on until you complete all of them. Voice acting is pretty impressive considering the game's age, and there many bugs that irritated me (coming down the stairs and getting launched into the air...) but nonetheless it was a great experience. I don't know if I should really recommend GTA III because you will probably just be playing GTA V.

												Open-world classic that inspired dozens of clones and made Rockstar one of the most successful developers of all time.However, the PC port of this game was poor on release and it's aged like milk. I've made a list of problems and solutions I had while getting it running:Game launch crashesI had a lot of trouble getting this game to launch in Win10. I had to use both SilentPatch and the DDraw patch  found here[www.gtagarage.com] to get past the Unhandled Exception c0000005 error and crash after the intro movie. EDIT: These patches also fix a bug where menu text is either invisible or very faded.Physics tied to FPSThis is one of those old games where physics are tied to framerate. If you turn off the 30FPS limiter, car friction, jumping and running up stairs are totally broken. This is one of those things where someone at Rockstar could fix it in an afternoon but it's still broken after all these years. As far as I know, there's no mod or patch to fix this. You can limit the game to 60 with a graphics driver tool but the physics problems are still there.Broken HUDThe HUD doesn't scale well for widescreen. There's a ""widescreen"" option in the graphics menu but it doesn't work. You need to use a community fix  found here[thirteenag.github.io] to get the game to look as expected at resolutions like 1080p (or anything bigger than 1024x768).Dark CarsThe Steam version of the game has a bug where lighting doesn't affect cars if you're running it on a modern version of Windows. The SilentPatch I linked earlier fixes this bug, but the widescreen patch I linked breaks it again. The best way to fix this bug is adding  this mod[gtaforums.com].Controller inputGTA3 has decent support for DirectInput controls and that's good enough for me. There's plenty of people with Xinput controllers though. San Andreas recently got a patch to support them but GTA3 hasn't had that patch yet despite using the same engine.  Here[www.gtagarage.com] is a mod that adds support along with the correct HUD buttons.Y-axis sensitivity bugIf you change mouse sensitivity in game (which everyone would, since it's designed for monitors with like 8 DPI), it only changes the X sensitivity while leaving the Y axis to go wild.  Here[github.com] is a patch to fix that bug.Restore PS2 enhancementsThis one isn't a big issue (I don't use it) but this game was designed to take advantage of the PS2's hardware with stuff like real-time car reflections. They couldn't be bothered to port any of these enhancements to the PC version but there is a mod that restores PS2-like graphics to the game  here.[gtaforums.com] (Read the instructions though!)100% completion checklistIf you're a completionist, the in-game stats aren't useful at all. A member of the community made a 100% checklist that hooks the game (download here[www.dropbox.com]) and tells you what you still need to do if you're trying to complete the game 100%.No in-game mapAnother not-huge issue but something to keep in mind before playing. As  Rockstar support[support.rockstargames.com] points out, their huge game with 3 different islands has no in-game map, so you either have to memorise where everything is or follow their suggestion and print out a map like it's 1999. Intro skippingJust a final tip to top everything off, once you've got the game running you can delete the ""movies"" directory from the install folder and it'll no longer play the intro movies. A little nugget that will save you a few seconds after spending 20 minutes or more getting the game running.I do love this game but I can't honestly recommend GTA3 to anyone until they fix some of these issues.

												This game is the real start to the modern day GTA franchise. Remastered from its birds eye view version, this game was a unique for its time. The controls are a bit finicky as the camera is automatic and makes it difficult to drive, however, after a few hours you do get used to it. A tip to people who want to use gamepads, you may wish to assign your buttons before you start playing as the controller support is very limited. the story is like any other GTA game, going to blips and talking to different mob bosses till you reach that final enemy. This game is particularly interesting after you play San Andreas as there a  lot of tie-ins with that  story. This games story is particularly short compared to other GTA games taking about 8-12 hours to complete for the average player. I would recommend this game for people who want to have the full franchise experience.6/10			"

												Recurring graphics glitch. A semi-opaque image of the menu persists in gameplay when reloading a saved game. Requires a hard reboot to fix. Difficult/impossible to change controller key bindings (some commands are not bound by default and the game would not let me assign them to a button). Refund requested after an hour of gameplay.

												The first GTA game made in 3D and it's living up to its name.This is the game that made every other GTA games what they are today.You play as Claude who got betrayed and shot by his girlfriend after a heist. Wounded but not dead, you find yourself arrested and transported to prison but you evade from your transport when the colombian cartel makes an attack on the patrol you are stuck into to help another prisonner to escape. You use this opportunity to beat a police officer, remove your handcuffs and evade from your transportation truck. You learn about 8-Ball and he helps you with his contacts.Roaming around Liberty City to do missions for the Mafia, the Yakuza and some independent names, you are thrown around to do the dirty jobs like the handyman you are.The map is huge and the game looks good when you think about the games that came out around the same years.It's in the veine of the GoldSrc Engine, Unreal Engine, id Tech 3 but with a big map made with free-roaming in mind. Driver 2 would be a better comparison. Restating that GTA3 was the first attempt from Rockstar to make a 3D game, They didn't miss their shot. There's a lot of things to do.The missions are non-linear, you always have the choice between a mission giver or another, there's the phone boot side-quests, you can do Taxi, Ambulance and Police missions when you get the specific car and you can always free-roam in Liberty City causing carnage for fun and giggles.The sound effects are great, you always feel like you're in a real city with the car sounds and pedestrians talking.A gunshot disturbs the peace of the moment when everyone start screaming and running.The game is immersive, you feel like you're there, walking/running around in Liberty City.There's enough weapons to have fun the entire game. There's not three different sets like in San Andreas but the game isn't that long either. Everything is well balanced for its size and for it's date of creation.The physic in the game is alright, not perfect but very good for what it needed to be.The driving physic is sometimes weird, you feel like in a pinball machine when you start hitting everything around but otherwise, handbrakes, quick turns and donuts can be done easily. Depending on the car you have, controlling it is never that much of a pain unless it's a really bad car which was obviously a choice from the devs. Bad cars roll badly.The shooting mecanics are archaic to say the least, it's kinda hard hard to deal with when you are in a fire fight, mostly when you are surrounded. The game was made to be unforgivable in some ways.When you try to play wisely, you get into cover and you try to step a little bit outside of your cover in a way that the AI doesn't really see you and then you shoot. ... or you try to stay in front of the enemies, hoping that you will kill everyone before you die. Good luck if they have decent weaponry. It's not impossible and it's still a lot of fun.You can only shoot and walk with the UZI or pistol, every big weapons are used as if you were a turret which is kind of annoying sometimes but the bullet effects are eye candy though. It's always fun to make your own justice anyway. I don't have a lot of negative to say about this game.Most negative points would come from a comparison with the futur games which wouldn't be fair at all.Every futur installments added stuff to what GTA3 was. GTA3 doesn't lack stuff, it's just the next games that are even better than what was this awesome game.There's obviously some glitches and bugs since it's a first attempt at a 3D game but nothing gamebreaking.A problem I had was that the game version I have was censored for whatever reason.I'm not from a country renowned to ban such games and I bought the game in the official Rockstar Pack with every other GTA games directly on Steam. The problem is well known though so yeah, there's not a lot of things more to say about his.To end this straight : GTA3 is a classic, it's a game that you must own if you understand what gaming is all about and if it's your kind of game to start with. Give it a try with an open mind! Feel the year 2001.			"

As soon I booted it up again after 14 years I still get the nostalgic feeling when I hear the intro. It's just one of those games I would put so many hours into and still wouldn't get bored of it. It's definitely a must buy if you have never played GTA III before. Same goes for Vice City and San Andreas. Those three are forever the greatest of all time.			"

The problem is well known though so yeah, there's not a lot of things more to say about his.To end this straight : GTA3 is a classic, it's a game that you must own if you understand what gaming is all about and if it's your kind of game to start with. Give it a try with an open mind! Feel the year 2001.			"

												This game is the real start to the modern day GTA franchise. Remastered from its birds eye view version, this game was a unique for its time. The controls are a bit finicky as the camera is automatic and makes it difficult to drive, however, after a few hours you do get used to it. A tip to people who want to use gamepads, you may wish to assign your buttons before you start playing as the controller support is very limited. the story is like any other GTA game, going to blips and talking to different mob bosses till you reach that final enemy. This game is particularly interesting after you play San Andreas as there a  lot of tie-ins with that  story. This games story is particularly short compared to other GTA games taking about 8-12 hours to complete for the average player. I would recommend this game for people who want to have the full franchise experience.6/10			"

												This game is a great way to see GTA's beginnings.  It's a classic and reallly feels like it.  If you're coming from future GTA games like I am, you'll see how still-playable the game is.  It might look older, but gameplay wise and atmosphere wise its the same.  I recommend you listen to the chatterbox radio station for some laughs, it really adds a layer of quality to the game.In my older review i downvoted the game because it felt unplayable to me.  i've now figured out that you can lock on while shooting in these older GTA games, which I didn't know.  The standard PC control layout isn't very good, I highly recommend you install this directinput mod so you can use an Xbox or Playstation controller:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=24272 As well as this game fix to make the  game less buggy:http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=25368Both of these mods are free and easy to install, and will make your experience SO much better.If you're using a 360 controller like I am, RB is to lock on.  I'm sure you can lock on with pc controls in classic mode too, but I haven't tried that.  Happy Gaming!Old Review: It's really interesting to see how the 3-D open world GTA experience first started out.  However, the gameplay is extremely flawed and somehow manages to be harder than Dark Souls.  The controls are terrible and guns just dont work.  Watch this one on YouTube unless you're here for nostalgic reasons, or you'll just end up giving yourself a headache.			"

												GTA 3 is a classic and I would love to recommed this game, but there is one problem, you might have a hard time getting the game to work on a modern PC. I get it, the game is old, but if Rockstar wants to take my money for the old game, then they should at least patch it to work on modern pc's. If you turn frame rate limit off, most likely you will run into problems. If you have transparency problems, download the file below and copy the content into your GTA III directory. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1IQhcL6aChua2U0dXZZb2lmOE0/view "

												Grand Theft Auto III has truly changed the video game insdustry.  It was first release in 2001 on the Sony Playstation 2 console. I still have my original PS2 copy and still play on both PC and PS2 from time to time. One of the best games ever made. GTA3 came out and set a new standard in gaming. Most games afterwards have used many aspects from this game to help created better games from that moment on.  This game was the first of its kind, 3rd person free roam 3D game, walk or run anywhere, using cars to drive anywhere you wanted, and the choice to complete missions or not. No rules, except police try to stop you if you start to be destructive and violent.  GTA3 really does deserve the ""Test of Time"" award. All real gamers own or have played this game before and know exactly what I'm talking about.  If you have never played this game, then you better get on it.			"

This is the game that MADE Grand Theft Auto for what it is now.

Amazing gameplay, graphics, storyline, freedom, EVERYTHING!

Love this game, played it on the PSX when it came out. It changed how we look at ""realistic shooting games"" since no other game could compare to it.
Nothing like killing innocent bystanders to try to get to 5 stars and survive. Wow that kinda sounded bad (don't get triggered liberal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)... it's just a game.

GTAIII is a great game that started a lot of what GTA is now, amazing.

												I have to say GTA 3 is an amazing open world game despite a ton of glitches and bugs. The game is not very storydriven as many other games. Instead it's more focused on the adventure and action in the state of Libety City. You play as Claude, a man shot and left for dead by your girlfriend after a bank heist. You try to crawl back from the bottom of the criminal food chain in redemption for your girlfriend as you end up in a mafia war against the triads. The mafia then betrays you and are forced to go into hiding. There are some flaws with the game such as the El Burro racing mission. El Burro tells you he as a job oppurtunity for you and says you are getting alot of street cred. So then out of nowhere he says you have to race. No explanation, just race. And the whole race is just lag and frusration. Don't believe me, just try the game for yourself. Overall, the game is hella fun and deserves an 8/10!			"

												Mob bosses need favors, crooked cops need help, the street gangs want you dead; so to compensate you'll have to rob, steal, and kill in order to stay alive, while using your resources to track down the woman who betrayed you and earn your rightful revenge. But that's all in a day's work in Rockstar Games' ambitious PS2 sequel, Grand Theft Auto III. Developed by DMA Design, GTA3 is the first installment of the series to utilize a fully three-dimensional living city with open environments and non-linear gameplay. Additional features include a cast of hundreds of different characters, more than 50 types of vehicles, three hours of professionally recorded music, and a huge array of deadly street weapons.			"

												Just bought this game a couple days ago, after what I've seen, here's what I have to say,PROS:-Nice graphics that still hold up today in my eyes-Nice radio stations with good music-The immersion is fantastic, Liberty City feels alive, it really does feel like a smaller version of NYC-The driving engine is rad, it feels nice with each car having its own feel and weight to it-Fantastic characters, they all feel like real people, none of them are stereotypicalCONS:-No motorcycles (but this doesn't really matter because this was the first 3D GTA game)-Our main character Claude does not say a single word, this leaves SO much room for character development, not even in GTA SA does Claude say word (but it does tell us he owned a service station in San Fierro and he used to live in San Andreas and ran away to Liberty City wiht Catalina)-The car's damage, it seems like they can be up in flames within seconds-getting out of a vehicle on it's side, sometimes i am still stuck in the vehicle (vans and trucks), the vehicle sets ablaze and Claude is stuck -If you buy this on steam you will see that all the cars are dark, I had to download a different .exe filethat's about it though a part from some annoyances I love the game! 7.5/10			"

What I liked about the game	I have always enjoyed the concept of grand theft auto; driving around exploring the city, doing sub-missions, and doing main missions whenever you want to.	Some unforgettable missions.   	A story of revenge and making name for yourself, still worth playing for that.  	Top-notch voice acting and cut-scenes.	DISMEMBERMENT! You name it legs, arms and heads go flying. What I disliked or was disappointed with	Nothing really to spend your money on; except for weapons and there aren't that many weapons. There's no condos, no businesses and you can't change clothes. It's kind of pointless doing the sub-missions because you are mostly getting money from them and there's nothing to spend the money on and you get plenty of money from the main missions. There's no increase in health or armour, you can't become fireproof, and the taxi missions just get boring after a while, although I still recommend you do the import/export sub-mission.   	Every gang in the city is trying to kill you. Nearly every street you drive down, there's always someone shooting at you, no rest for the wicked. 	It's hard to see the details on the car because all the cars have a dark metallic colour.  	Protagonist isn't voice acted.	All of the missions take place outside; there are no missions which involve going inside. The only two places in the game were you can go inside of are Ammu-nation and your safe house garage.	The radio stations were meh. Flashback FM was probably my favourite.   Conclusion Still worth playing for the main missions; like I said top-notch voice acting and cut -scenes. A bit plain, but it was the first full 3d GTA; no more bird's eye view. 88/100 "

												You run over pedestrians accidentally long enough, you start doing it on purpose.Liberty City. The city where the entire population doesn't knows how to swim, the police force specializes in aerial stunts. and going around stopped vehicles is unheard of. You play as Claude, the mute who might as well be blind. Claude has relationship issues, his girlfriend unexpectedly broke up with him, and Claude is doing what he can to get over it. STORY & ATMOSPHERE:The story isn't something too spectacular. You are a criminal rising up through the ranks, and as your rise up you unveil enemies and get into a bigger mess. However, one thing to mention is the superb voice acting. The voice acting fits the atmosphere of the game very well, even on the radio.. The city feels like a cheap filthy restaurant filled with rodents. Everyone is on their own, or against you. Rats everywhere. Also, the radio stations have a diverse and interesting soundtrack. Varying with Reggae, DnB, 80s' classics, Opera, eccentric hipster Rock, and many more. Not to forget the humerous talk show hosted by the beloved Lazlow. However, radio stations get repititive after a while.GAMEPLAY:Hit detection is nearly non-existent and cars are very fragile, but the difficulty is great.The game can get very frustrating at times because of this. There is a considerable arsenal of weapons, from explosives to fire to bullets. But I found myself resorting to mostly sniping from afar (for the AI can't sense others' casualties), and running down enemies (as you are safe as long you're inside a vehicle). And thatis because most of the guns have terrible hit detection, deeming you almost  a sitting duck with heavy weapons, and a waddling penguin with light weapons. Vehicles get damaged so easily, bursting in flames and switching vehicles during a mission becomes a standard. The combination of being shot at and rammed into does not make it any better.  The difficulity rises as you progress, and so does the harshness of cops as you gain a wanted level. I'd say the difficulty is quite balanced for what it is.For its time, this game was a masterpiece. It opened doors for many developers to go through, and Influenced many of the open-world games today. It has its issues, but I cannot deny how this game changed the gaming industry, and how it was truly genre-defining. If you are looking for a crime-based open-world classic game, try this. Just bear through the flaws.			"

												I love the GTA series. From classics like Vice City and San Andreas to the famous GTA 5. I have no lesser respect for this game. However, if you are using Windows 10, please DO NOT buy this edition of GTA III. I was with the knowledge that Windows 10 was very identical to Windows 7, including compatibility proven by various games and software that was claimed broken in Windows 8. Despite this convenience, GTA III, forgiven by the fact this game is over a decade old, does not work with Windows 10.Encountered problems (that I do not consider just a bug):-Cutscenes freeze and can cause the game to crash-Entities appear in the wrong place (glitched) in cutscenes-Controls frequently become unresponsive or get stuck (I have sticky keys disabled)-Main menu text can become invisible until Steam overlay is viewed (possibly just a Steam overlay bug)-Possibly other bugs that I have not yet encountered, and do not wish to on the risk of not qualifying for a refundI do not know if any of the above is encountered with Windows 8, but I have played a standalone copy of GTA III on Windows 7 and can confirm that it works fine. If you think that this review is misleading, please let me know and I will delete any genuine bugs listed and so on.			"

												A good game first released ♥♥♥♥ing 14 years ago, as the first 3D one from the series.I'm the ""100% completion kind of guy"", and that's how I went on GTA III. Although this journey took a lot of effort, I had enough fun doing this. It gets pretty infuriating sometimes, like the Paramedic mission, but accomplishing nonsense and mafia style missions is what makes this and other GTA series titles so fun.Things that weren't so funny: getting the collectibles takes a lot of effort, and you can't do this without looking on a map/reading a walktrough. There's no clue (and I think it will be like this on any GTA title) ingame of where said collectibles are. If you wouldn't use a map, you would have to just guess where the hell 100 hidden packages are. As a counterpoint to this negative point, collectibles aren't obligatory, but they make up the trouble you had collecting them by giving you a lot of weapons in your hideout, which makes having weapons easy. The main character doesn't speak; you will get a hell out of money as you play the game, and you don't have anything to do with it. At the advanced stages of the game, even if you didn't collect the hidden packages to have weapons on your hideout, you'll have enough money to buy as many weapons as you want, paint as many cars as you want, and that's it! Nothing else to spend your abundant money.WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS? DO WE REALLY SHOOT MARIA AT THE END? IS SHE DEAD? A doubt that we'll have beyond the eternity. I don't know if I didn't actually realize how to aim properly, but from my experience, aiming at this game is frustrating.The pros are all the good points of any GTA title: open world;  killing people on the street;  mafia missions;  it's easy to drive cars; badass story; unique car jumps! Oh, the car jumps and stunts! GANGS!Although being old and the effort it takes, I had enough fun, so I recommend this game! See you on the streets of Liberty City!			"

The difficulity rises as you progress, and so does the harshness of cops as you gain a wanted level. I'd say the difficulty is quite balanced for what it is.For its time, this game was a masterpiece. It opened doors for many developers to go through, and Influenced many of the open-world games today. It has its issues, but I cannot deny how this game changed the gaming industry, and how it was truly genre-defining. If you are looking for a crime-based open-world classic game, try this. Just bear through the flaws.			"

												I love the GTA series. From classics like Vice City and San Andreas to the famous GTA 5. I have no lesser respect for this game. However, if you are using Windows 10, please DO NOT buy this edition of GTA III. I was with the knowledge that Windows 10 was very identical to Windows 7, including compatibility proven by various games and software that was claimed broken in Windows 8. Despite this convenience, GTA III, forgiven by the fact this game is over a decade old, does not work with Windows 10.Encountered problems (that I do not consider just a bug):-Cutscenes freeze and can cause the game to crash-Entities appear in the wrong place (glitched) in cutscenes-Controls frequently become unresponsive or get stuck (I have sticky keys disabled)-Main menu text can become invisible until Steam overlay is viewed (possibly just a Steam overlay bug)-Possibly other bugs that I have not yet encountered, and do not wish to on the risk of not qualifying for a refundI do not know if any of the above is encountered with Windows 8, but I have played a standalone copy of GTA III on Windows 7 and can confirm that it works fine. If you think that this review is misleading, please let me know and I will delete any genuine bugs listed and so on.			"

												I fell in love with this game when I was in grammar school. Nothing more then just going around and killing people and causing all sorts of mayhem. Me and my friends use to just go around causing all hell and laughing about it. I still have my original copy for the ps2 along with all the others that ill never get rid of because its a classic. Its always fun to come back to this game and beating it has become so easy. I'm glad to now have a digital copy and i can play it at any time i decide to. This game is a true meaning of what GTA is suppose to be and will forever be one of my favorites :)			"

												I played the first two games when they came out. The second was pretty much identical to the first except for the ""loyalty"" system and has been largely forgotten but never mind. They were fun games, and whilst they weren't the first to let you be the bad guy, it was somewhat satisfying the way the city seemed to work around you to clear up your mess and try to restore the status quo. Unfortunately however I never actually finished either of them because there didn't seem to be much progression. Yes, you'd get a new map to play on every now and then, and some of the missions could be done in different orders, but there wasn't much personality. The missions were just a means to an end - namely collecting enough cash to move on to the next level.Ultimately I think they could have been largely forgotten in years to come, save for the ""controversy"" aspect.Then this gem came along. Rather than just moving the same games into a 3D environment, the game has been designed entirely from scratch. It might as well have been called something different for all the similarity it has to it's predecessors. Not only do we have full voice acting by many household names which flesh out the characters and add that much needed personality, but the city itself feels far more alive and real than ever before.Corners are no longer all at 90 degrees, there are literally hundreds of bonuses, secrets and extra missions you can do on the side whenever you want, you can backtrack at any point to visit previous areas of the game and see what's changed (although be careful of straying into the wrong neighbourhood if you've been upsetting people), full radio stations with a good selection of licensed music (and the ability to play your own MP3s on the PC version - nice touch), fully working public transit systems and a fascinating storyline of betrayal, loyalty and trust make this something that has to be played by everybody, no matter what your view on the violence aspect. Come on. Even if you don't want to complete the missions themselves you can spend hours just riding a taxi around town. Yes, this game even managed to make ""Crazy Taxi"" almost entirely redundant.Whilst many people could argue (and with good cause) that the later games in the series such as Vice City and 4 are better in nearly every way, for me this will always be my favourite simply because it was such a welcome surprise - were it not for 3 then GTA wouldn't be the multi-million dollar franchise it is today.

There's no real variety to the way in which missions can be approached--you have to try and die and restart multiple times to discover the way in which the game wants you to complete a mission.The mechanics are still relatively smooth and work well, save for some weapon gripes such as the grenades which can't be aimed accurately and only thrown blindly. The graphics and sound are dated but not terrible and the game's gritty atmosphere holds up.Certainly no longer as amazing as it once was, but it's a decent game.			"

												A good game first released ♥♥♥♥ing 14 years ago, as the first 3D one from the series.I'm the ""100% completion kind of guy"", and that's how I went on GTA III. Although this journey took a lot of effort, I had enough fun doing this. It gets pretty infuriating sometimes, like the Paramedic mission, but accomplishing nonsense and mafia style missions is what makes this and other GTA series titles so fun.Things that weren't so funny: getting the collectibles takes a lot of effort, and you can't do this without looking on a map/reading a walktrough. There's no clue (and I think it will be like this on any GTA title) ingame of where said collectibles are. If you wouldn't use a map, you would have to just guess where the hell 100 hidden packages are. As a counterpoint to this negative point, collectibles aren't obligatory, but they make up the trouble you had collecting them by giving you a lot of weapons in your hideout, which makes having weapons easy. The main character doesn't speak; you will get a hell out of money as you play the game, and you don't have anything to do with it. At the advanced stages of the game, even if you didn't collect the hidden packages to have weapons on your hideout, you'll have enough money to buy as many weapons as you want, paint as many cars as you want, and that's it! Nothing else to spend your abundant money.WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS? DO WE REALLY SHOOT MARIA AT THE END? IS SHE DEAD? A doubt that we'll have beyond the eternity. I don't know if I didn't actually realize how to aim properly, but from my experience, aiming at this game is frustrating.The pros are all the good points of any GTA title: open world;  killing people on the street;  mafia missions;  it's easy to drive cars; badass story; unique car jumps! Oh, the car jumps and stunts! GANGS!Although being old and the effort it takes, I had enough fun, so I recommend this game! See you on the streets of Liberty City!			"

												The game that shaped open-world games and gave us a standard for future upcoming third person games.GameplayConsidering this game was their first 3D game, the controls are good. I mean it is smooth and responsive. Incredible how well it actually holds up. From a modern pespective the game is limited in terms of objectives. There is not a whole lot of things to do and the missions can be very frustrating at times because of the lack of checkpoints. The structure of missions is dated too. In retrospect the map is still feels big and it is quite impressive for its time. The characters lack personality, but for their first 3D game, it's not bad.GraphicsThe colors are very depressing to be honest. A lot of grey, and black and white. I only remember the game for its rain. It has aged pretty well and still perfectly playable. There is also a lot a texture popping, which was very common for its time. Despite all my complains the graphics is still amazing.SoundQuite amazing for it's time. The voice actors are very good. The most memomable thing must be the radio stations. You listen to them all the time. There is a lot of variation from DnB, opera, 80's music, raggae and hip hop. The songs are so good you can listen to them multiple times. The real charm is coming from the radio station hosts.VerdictI love to go back to GTA III now and then. It holds a lot of nostalgia value for me. Unfortunately, it never got its claws on me. It did in the later games. It is mostly the dull colors and forgettable story that holds me back. I still think GTA 3 is fun, if you can take your mind back to 2001.			"

												Unplayable. Past versions of this game may have worked good on consoles, But this pc version has many faults.- Menu screens can dissappear so u dont know what your doing on menu- Mouse doesnt recognise games screen edge on dual monitors so when you turn mouse in game you end up seeing the mouse appear on 2nd monitor, and when u click (such as to fire gun) you end up clicking the other monitor and minimising game.You would think ROCKSTAR would have patched these two main issues. But 15 years and nothings been done, and the forums are filled with post about these two issues. If you own it try get a refund from steam, they shouldnt be allowed to sell faulty products.Definitely makes me not want to pay $80 for GTA V if they cant even release patches for minor issues in their well known game franchise.

												This game brings back some good memories from playing it with a friend,the city is called Liberty City,a parody of New York City,the city is a darker one,also the protagonist is a cool one even he is mute and never talks,also we can see him in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas in 2 missions.His name is only called in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas,Claude,also dont confuse him with Claude Speed,the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto 2,in which these 2 games are in different universe.The missions are very cool to do,also this game have something that other Grand Theft Auto games dont have,GORE,yup you heard,when you shoot someone with a M16 in leg or hand that part of his body is dissapear,note this only is in PC version i believe,also on Steam version is a bug that color of all vehicles are darker but this can be fixed i believe.Also the worst part for Grand Theft Auto 100% achievers like me is when you complete the game 100% you dont have anything in your advantage like 200 health instead of 100 like in Grand Theft Auto vice City.Just play this game,is fun.Final note:9/10			"

												Grand Theft Auto III:Positives:+ The game's storyline is quite good, it follows the main character Claude as he works for the Mafia, Yakuza and other parties throughout Liberty City, while simulataneously seeking revenge against his ex-girlfriend for backstabbing him during a robbery.+ You feel a connection to all the central characters in the game and they're very intriguing.+ As with every Grand Theft Auto game, you have the ability to cause complete mayhem, using flamethrowers, rocket launchers, grenades, military grade assault rifles, pistols, shotguns and more. Great weapon choices.+ Side missions available and hidden packages/frenzy tasks to complete. Extra content there.+ Graphics are dated but for the time period (2001) they were amazing. This won't impact on your fun.+ Nice music on radio stations, adds to the enjoyment.Negatives:- Short game, takes around 20 hours to finish, side missions included. I'll admit i've finished the game multiple times in the past, so this could vary if you're new. But generally, it's short.Overall Score: 8/10Grand Theft Auto: III is a classic game which launched the GTA series into fully 3D environments, Memorable and fun.			"

												I finally got myself down to play this in 2011, believe it or not, and to my surprise it was still a blast. I consider this a RPG game, because you basically level up and do a lot of mini mission along the main one in an open world. This adds a classic flavor to any game.GTAIII is inferior in size to Vice City and San Andreas, but still a great game.			"

												First off, I have no nostalgia for GTA: I've only even beaten GTA 5 and didn't even play GTA 4 until 2013. But I do know the significance of this game which is why I gave it a go.Short version: I love it on the PS2!Kinda long version:I couldn't play this game as it is on Steam. The control schemes are too wonky and rebinding them is way more difficult than it should be. I'm not completely new to PC gaming but I've only really been at it for a year or two, so maybe it's my own shortcomings. That said, the console version is way more managable as far as controls and movement, so much so that I stopped noticing how aged the game looks. If you're trying III, Vice City & San Andreas for the first time, I'd recommond a console version first. They're a pioneer of open-world sandbox games as we know them and there's a ton of great little details in every game. But if you're like me and grew up with a controller instead of a computer, this is one of those game where it makes a huge difference.			"

												Grand Theft Auto 3 is well regarded as a pioneer in the third person sandbox game genre. It can be compared to other genre defining games like Wolfenstein 3D and Dune 2 before it. The core foundation that GTA3 rests it's hat on is simplicity. It has a very simple premise, after being betrayed during a robbery you set out for revenge in Liberty City. The story is full of mostly entertaining characters and mostly fun missions. That simplicity works double for the gameplay.GTA3 introduced and perfected a gameplay loop that the franchise has still kept for the most part. There's a set of story missions you undergo inorder to unlock further parts of the game and see what happens next in the story. Alternatively you can ignore the story and explore the city at your leasure. While doing sidequests like driving a taxi cab or looking for hidden collectables. This core gameplay loop of missions, sidequests, collectables with a freely explorable open world wasn't a common thing at the time, and it blew people away with how impressive the whole experience was. At the same time though because there have been so many games based off it, it occasionally feels like it lacks an identity compared to the glut of sandbox games that came after it. This is fundamentally the base game that all future sandbox games jumped off from. It's a game I like to go back to every so often to remind myself where it all started. And to remind myself that Rockstar set the bar pretty high from the start and just kept going from there. "

Now the game is playable. I hope that helps any Windows 10 users out there.Rockstars should consider uploading a remastered steam version for GTA classics that support Windows 10, widescreen monitors, and xbox controllers.

												Classic? Yes. But that is all it offers: Nostalgia. For those that are wishing to experience the first game of the 3D universe for the first time, I personally won't recommend it. It has aged badly and honestly, only those that have played it during its earlier days may enjoy it. Dated mechanics, repetitive and occasionally frustrating missions really made the game much more tedious than fun. The god-awful soundtrack doesn't do any justice either.Nutshell: If you are eager to go through the history of the grand theft auto franchise, go for it. Its not a bad game. But comparing to its sequels, it doesn't really hold up and its certainly because of its age.			"

												The game that started it all. If you're a huge GTA fan like me, you want this game just to add it to your collection. But, it is the worst of all the 3D GTA games, smallest map, worst control and camera, and shortest sound track with not too many catchy songs, except flashback. I recommend this game if you love GTA and modding the game out and just having fun as if it were new, but to a new demographic I would not recommend it, get GTA SA the best one of the 3rd gen 3D Gta games.

												The game that started it all. If you're a huge GTA fan like me, you want this game just to add it to your collection. But, it is the worst of all the 3D GTA games, smallest map, worst control and camera, and shortest sound track with not too many catchy songs, except flashback. I recommend this game if you love GTA and modding the game out and just having fun as if it were new, but to a new demographic I would not recommend it, get GTA SA the best one of the 3rd gen 3D Gta games.

												GTA III is a great game for it's time. I highly encourage you to purchase this game to relive the memories of classic GTA, however, this is the WRONG platform to do so on. The PC version of GTA III is a broken console port teaming with compatibility issues. There is no stability in the frame-rate due to the designers screwing up and making the game render all geometry reguardless of weather it's visable or not. Grab a copy for the ps2/xbox so you'll actually be able to enjoy playing this game.			"

And if you're running Windows 10 like I am? HA! Good luck...cause you're gonna need it. I got this game to run better by setting up a PS2 emulator for my PC and playing it that way.

Keep in mind that I have a windows 8 computer that can run 90% of my games at max settings with my Radeon R9 270X but it's just a case of a really bad PC port from Rockstar Studios.

												Something really hard about this game is: progress.When a game like this brings so much money to a company like Rockstar, you can't imagine how many improvements they've done during around 20 years.I always wanted to finish the first 3D GTA of the franchise (the prevous in 2D even if they are old are excellent).My first ""fix"" was Vice City. Good in every ways, it reminds me many great moments related to an amazing atmosphere/story, awesome soundtrack.But frankly when you return to this one, it's horrible.So many things are difficult to tolerate, like the lack of map to find important locations (many times i've been searching for hospital in vain... and it's an exemple), horrible physics where you can fail a job because you car turned upside-down due to a carton box. Missions without appropriate briefing (Exemple: the Mafia asks you to kills some Triad Warlords and at the end you have to find a fish van... the problem you have 2 or 3 types of fish vans...).Or, something weird, when you go to Liberty City down town (well in fact you stay there around 2/3 of the game), you see some Triad gangs in cleaner suits shooting at you on sight even if you drive a Firefighter truck... as if you wrote MAFIA THUG on your face/ vehicle.So even if some games on Steam are very old, i still buy them to remember their uniq aspects they represented in their time.Like the first Quake games wich are still very cool and keep entertaining even today, or reworked oldies such as Strifer: Veteran edition, and many others.To Conclude :Maybe i will finish GTA III when they will do some kind of ""polishing"" on it.But frankly my First GTA experience in 3D was and will stay: GTA Vice City.Beautifull, Fun, Cool and just unforgettable.And the funny thing that nobody says about GTA III is that the hero never talks....Contrary to Tommy Versetti  in Vice City, who is one of the best characters the franchise has.Like so many like Ken Rosenberg, Tommy's lawyer who appears in San-Andreas with Kent Paul.Even the soundtrack is boring, like Razlow on GTA III who works in a debate radio and in Vice City he is a crazy 80's Rock radio presenter !Nostalgia can be painfull some times and GTA III is painfull...go play Vice City instead !N.B: My play time doesn't show my experience because i played offline for quite a long time.And i think i will review Vice City after that.

Featuring incredibly poor camera controls for both vehicles and on foot, terrible shooting controls, wonky combat, lack of checkpoints or even a basic mission restart, GTA 3 should serve only as a reminder of GTA's roots or a reminder that we've come a long way since then.

BEWARE, INCOMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS 8/8.1Grand Theft Auto III quickly became the best selling video game of 2001, drawing not only praise for its story and 3D gameplay, but also criticism for its violent and sexual themes.Unfortunately, the game is unlikely to run on any modern computers, even after applying the following fixes:1. Delete .set file from GTA3 User Files.2. Turn off Data Execution Prevention for both gta3.exe and testapp.exe.3. Run gta3.exe and testapp.exe in compatibility mode.4. Run gta3.exe and testapp.exe as administrator directly from game files.However, if you still need your GTA fix, Grand Theft Auto V should do the trick.			"

												All negative reviews for GTA III PC will get downvoted to hell by cowardly nostalgia kiddies, regardless of how well written they are, so I'm not even going to bother.The PC port of GTA III was really borked. The cars are all black, random crashes will occur, no dual analog joystick support (i.e. Xbox 360 gamepad), the sound crackles a lot. Anyone who writes a positive review for the PC port of GTA III on Steam has never actually played the game for more than 5 seconds. History keeps on repeating itself, GTA III was a bad PC port, just like GTA IV was, and GTA V probably will be.Reviews which are nothing but praise and nostalgia-gasming are NOT helpful! Reviews which explains in detail any potential problems with a game ARE!EDIT: Oops! I forgot to mention something quite important for some PC gamers: You apparently need to run this at 30 FPS or you'll get physics glitches. How lovely!			"

												Despite my low play time reported on steam for this game, I have played this game for many hours on both the PlayStation 2 and the PC as well. Don't Bother with this one. Beyond it being the first fully 3D Grand Theft Auto game, and one of the first games to do 3D open worlds well (being a massive improvement over Driver and Driver 2 before it), there's very little here that was not either also done or done better in GTA Vice City and/or San Andreas. Beyond the main story (and the payphone side missions), the only things left to do is collect hidden packages, cause general mayhem and do the police, firefighter, and taxi side missions.Contrast this with GTA Vice city where you have all of that with better and more weapons, better and more cars, better gang distribution (seriously, after a certain point in GTA 3’s story, one area of the map becomes impossible to drive through without a tank, as gang members who wield shotguns in that area will shoot at you and will blow up your car immediately upon entering their territory), better and less linear after killing Diaz story line missions, MUCH better music (Beyond the station with the Scarface OST and the Rap Station I distinctly remember the music in GTA 3 being pretty awful) and a more interesting city with better aesthetics. All of this remains true for San Andreas, which managed to improve it beyond what even Vice City improved upon, making it that much more significantly better than GTA 3. For the most part, the liberty city of GTA 3 was depressing to look at, with a lot of grey in the colour palette, whereas for both of its successors, this was significantly improved. What I will say in GTA 3's favour is that its simplicity makes it good for a mobile game, compared with the more complex controls of Vice City and (especially) San Andreas.Overall, don't buy this, at least not on PC, and instead buy GTA San Andreas or Vice City. Unless you're replaying it for nostalgia purposes or on your phone/tablet, there's nothing here that hasn't been done better in other 3D open world games since. If you REALLY want to play in the Liberty City of GTA 3 on PC, search for mods to add Liberty City into either GTA San Andreas or Vice City, you will get the city of GTA 3 with the improvements of VC or SA.

Rebinding some of the keys does help, but it's still really hard to handle.

												Aging is rough on open world games and I look back on this having had no childhood experience with it. Without the benefit of nostalgia and from a modern day viewpoint, I can't recommend getting this game. The story and dialogue is good and the concepts it introduced were truly revolutionary but if you're like me and want to play the classics, maybe start with something a bit newer. And I don't want to criticize the game for technical limitations but it seems this is where some of the difficulty like no mission restarts, crashes, and only being able to save in one place come from.Oh yeah and it says gamepad support but you'll actually need to go install a few input mods to get the game to recognize a gamepad correctly.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 3 thousand26four, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very large sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												While innovative at the time of release, GTA III hasn't aged well. The lack of verticality, the lack of different vehicles, the limited arsenal, and the subpar controls make this a hard game to recommend especially if you've played the far superior sequel, Vice City. If you've never played a GTA, this is good place to start. If you're used to the more modern titles, skip this one.			"

												This game blew me away back when it was new, only because it was 3D. It was cool seeing the world in a new 3D perspective rather than a top-down 2D view. But my recent playthrough of this game made me realize that this game suffers from quite a few problems that makes the game almost unplayable past the 2nd half. The first thing you will notice is that you do not have a map. You actually have to look up a map on the internet if you need it. All you have to help you navigate is your minimap. Which would be fine, but nothing useful is marked on it (Like the gunstore and pay n spray). So with no overhead map, or markers on your minimap (Your safehouse and missions are marked). Navigating the city can be difficult, especially to new players. There is no GPS or anything else to help you here. All you can do is memorize your way around the old fashioned way.Another issue is the AI. The enemy AI in this game is very unfair, especially on the later missions. You can be driving around minding your own business or on a mission. Then enemy gangs instantly open fire on you regardless of what car you're driving or if you're on a mission. How do they know where I am at all times and what car I'm in? I just stole a new car and they instantly know its me. They don't even have to be facing you, you just see their arms lock onto you and start shooting. That means your car will always take damage even if you don't crash into things. (They start to carry more heavy weaponary later game, so expect some cheap deaths while driving)Let's talk about the vehicles. They don't feel like metal cars, they feel like some paper mache creation my little brother made in 3rd grade. The cars are not durable. The cars in GTA and GTAII felt more solid than this. If you can't keep yourself on the road and not hit traffic (And not get shot at all the time) then you are going to have a huge problem keeping your vehicle, especially if it's a sports car. They handle okay for the most part, although some of the vehicles feel like you're driving on ice.The weapons in this game are cool, but there's 1 gun in particular that made me almost throw my controller through my wall. It's the Carbine Rifle (M16) While this gun is probably the best in the game, it will be your death on the 2nd half of the game. Remember the unfair AI? Well, imagine several of them gunning down your little paper mache car with M16's while you're trying to beat a mission. It's a nightmare. The M16 shoots very fast. I was able to blow up a fully repaired sports car with only 16 bullets from the 60 round magazine. You can also be killed by about half a clip of ammo from it with full armor and health. Sometimes you can't even react fast enough. You just drop dead and have to reload your save. There's a reason why they changed this gun in the later games, because it's unbalanced and broken.The missions can be very difficult at times. Especially the later ones. Most of the missions have either a time limit or a waypoint you have to travel to. SInce you have no map, it's hard to plot the best route to save time. Often times, you'll turn down a wrong turn or a alley with no exit costing you precious time. This game is not generous on mission time either. You can't mess around. You have to be quick to do what it wants. The missions on the first half of the game are not bad. A couple might be a little hard, but for the most part it's okay. But as soon as you start to work for Donald Love, that's when the ♥♥♥♥ starts to hit the fan.... And it stinks. I think his missions were the hardest in the game. His and Asuka's. *Shudders*The soundtrack is also unimpressive. GTA is known for having pretty good soundtracks. When I first played this game, I didn't even know that the songs ingame were actually real. I thought they were just made for the game, if that can tell you anything. I think the metascore of 93/100 (Higher than GTA IV which got a score of 90) is a little too generous. I'd give it a 6/10.If you're new to GTA and wanna start with the older ones, I do not recommend you start with this one. I recommend you start with either Vice City, or San Andreas. Both are excellent games. (And guess what! The main character actually talks in those games. Wow!)Although if you do actually decide to play this one, don't be afraid of using the cheat codes for those unfair later missions. Flip those unfair AI the bird with a rocket launcher. ┌∩┐(◣_◢)┌∩┐			"

												A solid start to an amazing franchise. However, this game does not hold up too well in 2014. Easily the shortest GTA game clocking in at 14 hrs with full mission completion. While it may have been revolutionary in 2001, it pales it comparison to later titles in the series. The characters can be best described as one note and underwritten. Claude is easily the least compelling protagonist not just in the GTA franchise, but in gaming in general. Having him silently take orders and essentially betraying anyone and everyone, the story leaves off with most gangs in Liberty City hating you. Rather than rise to the top of the criminal pyramid, Claude elects instead to kill and betray anyone at the slightest suggestion. The controls for driving and shooting are solid, especially on PC. However, any mission involving AI can become frustrating very quickly. Some missions feel completely unrealistic and contrived, with fail states that can only be described as nonsensical. Most of this game's length can be accounted for by repeatedly failing some of the tougher missions. In almost all the firefights, the enemies simply camp around a corner and wait for their cheap shot. Death can come from myriad unfair game mechanics and can lead to some genuine frustration that is not to be found in later titles. If you are interested in the GTA franchise, this is not the place to start. I would recommend Vice City, San Andreas, or GTA IV. These games boast far better AI as well as much MUCH better stories and characters.7/10			"

												As someone who started from GTA San Andreas, going back to GTA 3 is almost impossible and generally not worth it. There is no map function, you cannot bail out of cars, instant drowning, no icons for ammunation and the spray and pray (fortunately the map is small enough that I can generally remember where they are), and just a general lack of features on top of the outdated graphics. Graphics aside, the core of GTA is in the game, but it's difficult to enjoy when I'm constantly trying to do something available in newer releases.			"

												[DID NOT FINISH]I do not feel that this game stands up today especially not next to the sequels that have come from the franchise. The engine, gameplay, graphics, sound, story, AI and dialogues are all sub-par. The game does have good world and level design in all fairness but that doesn't make up for everything else that has been highly improved in later games. This game is still fun but not more so than later games and I don't recommend people buying it.7/15 - ""Later sequels are better""			"

												I must emphasise that this review of Grand Theft Auto III is from a 2014 perspective, and it should be noted that my opinion in 2001 was remarkably different. If I consider how I felt when I first picked up the game when it was released, it was a total breath of fresh air to the gaming market and redefined the much taken for granted ‘sandbox’ genre. Graphically impressive with a fluid control system, the gaming world seemed huge with endless activities to do and a thrilling narrative populated by great characters. Although some of these aspects still remain true, I would honestly suggest remaining with fond memories of this game as opposed to trying to relive its glory, as out of the three PS2 GTA games (III, Vice City and SA) it has aged extremely badly (by far the worst) and is only just about playable.The main issues are the controls and the targeting system. Much like other gamers, I am accustomed to using a controller for the GTA series. Although it can be difficult, it is possible to get your PS3/Xbox controller to work in sync with this game, however the thought of having to map the controls or download specific programmes yourself may put gamers off from the offset. If you get past this hurdle, you’ll notice that targeting in the game is extremely difficult. There is not an ‘auto-lock’ target option, which is highly inconvenient and makes missions that involved killing enemies who can target you very easily frustrating. Aiming with rifles is obviously manual, but to point a tiny aim reticule using the right analogue stick/mouse at a cartel enemy gunning you down from 5 yards is nearly impossible, meaning that you have to take out most enemies from range using the sniper rifle or grenades/rocket launcher. When the action is so fast paced and often in close proximity to the protagonist, it’s very easy to fail a mission because you couldn’t kill an enemy at point blank range.Although it is not apparent at first, the lack of a map is also a frustration. You do have a mini-map, but if you want a more global view of where you need to be, or where the closest ammunition store is, it really is a case of drive around and hope. During several missions, the enemy/location markers span all three islands and it can be confusing where to go, or at least, where the quickest route is (as many missions are timed), if you cannot get a global map view. If this happens during several missions, you will quickly get fed up with the experience and quit prematurely. The graphics are still acceptable, especially since we consider that this game was released over a decade ago. The main aspect of the game that is never lost is the humour and pop culture satire, which may make the game playing in itself. The radio stations in particular are still hilarious to listen to, Chatterbox and the commercials specifically. If you can get the game cheap enough on a sale, perhaps just reliving some of Lazlo’s best lines would be enough to justify the purchase. The gaming world compared with any game in the last five years is tiny. It should be noted however that I thought this was a huge game in scope when it was released, however the whole main storyline can be completed relatively swiftly, barring any mission fails based on the bad targeting/map system. The three main islands can be driven across in the matter of minutes, yet on a positive note the vehicles still seem varied enough to make the process fresh and enjoyable. However, it does of course seem limited in comparison to its sequels. Furthermore, vechiles that we may consider certainties in Vice City and SA such as bikes, flyable planes (the Dodo does not count) and fast boats are void here, and the lack of a mission ‘replay’ option that was so well received in later instalments is obviously non-existent in GTA III.It is very difficult to click the ‘do not recommend’ option for this game as it offers so many good memories combined with great humour, however it is better to remember this game how it was. Other than for a quick nostalgia trip, the gameplay missions are tiresome since they have been done and done better since the newer instalments of GTA, so many of them have been done a hundred times before. That, combined with difficult controls and no larger map, means that this game has sadly not stood the test of time. It is important to remember of course that GTA III redefined these sorts of missions and gameplay style and should be celebrated as a landmark game, however I’m not sure if playing this game start to finish will give gamers much joy.Thanks for reading this review and all comments are welcome.

												Dont get me wrong, its a great game, but if you have finished it and have great memories(like i did) about it, dont pick it up again, it ruins it. Character is the most silent(for a month not a single word in game time) and cold grand theft auto lead ever(In gta 1, 2 and london they talked rubbish). Music and sounds are good(except police sirens and bridge bell those were anoying ), the map of liberty city is quite good, it feels empty a bit, but hey game came out in early 2000s, Missions are quite fustrating at some times, especially when cops are brought into them, They are very aggresive and after one star they never fade away, so allways remeber where paint shops and police stars are my one chase went for a hour or so because i did not find any of those. Pack your self allways with bodyarmor and try jumping around against those cartel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. And whats all the shooting when i stroll around the city feels like everyone hates me. Play it when you havent and are a big fan of gta, stay away if you have.			"

												Oh Grand Theft Auto III, I really have mixed opinions about this port.While it shows the glory of the transition of GTA to a 3D universe, that doesn´t mean it controls very well.While I´ve seen other reviews talking about resolution problems and the menu just not appearing (porblems that I didn´t had), I had to say that the problem are the controls. The aiming is horrible if you play with a mouse, and the classic aiming is just a piece of ♥♥♥♥. If you REALLY want to experience this game in all it´s glory, try getting the PS2 version. This port needs so much updates and patches that I don´t see coming anytime soon...6/10			"

												While it does have its moments, overall it's fairly uninteresing. The different factions shooting and sometimes insta-killing you makes the exploration of the city more frustrating than fun. Plus it's not like there's much to explore in this somewhat empty city. Aside from the generally mediocre story missions there's just not a lot to do in this game.5/10			"

												While the game itself is great, a lot of the missions require precise rapid shooting, and so you need a controller.  However after getting a controller, the setup is really bad and takes hours to map the right buttons to the right directions.  Example, you can't turn and move forward.  Turning the camera is separate from turning the person.  This means in a fight, you are locked into one view of the action and then you have to aim from that view while the target can move all around you.  You end up shooting at stuff that is behind you.  Frustrating, because it is a really fun game.			"

												While I never got around to totally playing this one entirely... I did watch my brother play it everyday and played it a few times.

												I was a big fan of the original top-down Grand Theft Auto games.  I was totally psyched when GTA III came out.  A 3-d Grand Theft Auto game?  This is going to be great!Then I got it.  What a laggy, poorly-coded pile of excrement.  This thing allegedly had Playstation code in it.  I'm talking about the PC version.  Absolutely unplayable on computers of the day.  I was a huge Grand Theft Auto fan but after this debacle, I completely got off the series.  Over ten years later, on a modern computer, the game doesn't lag.  Much.  Maybe in another decade computers will be developed that will be able to run this poorly-coded garbage.  It's otherwise a fun game at times.Pwninator score: 3/10			"

												The missions and characters are fun.However, the game suffers from bad design, in that most of the sencond half missions are made on a ""try again"" basis. You woon't be able to complete them on the first try, because the game designers made damn sure of that. So between every mission, you have to go back home to save the game, then drive to whomever is giving you the mission. Cutscene (skippable, small mercies) for the mission, then drive to the mission, and fail. Try again.So yeah, you will get many hours out of the game, most of them driving to and from the actual action, and trying the same missions over and over again.Sure, some elements are fun, but I don't see why it is such a highly rated game. Saints' Row II was much, much better.			"

												This is a bad game. It aged very poorly. The camera is terrible, the controls are terrible, the auto-aiming system is astoundingly terrible, and so on. These are all massive flaws that existed at the time, but which people ignored because the game was innovative. The difficulty is ridiculous at times, mostly due to the bad mechanics. It took me ages to complete one early mission where I had to stop a car and kill the two guys in it. I'd stop them, try to get my gun to lock on, fail, and get stunlocked to death by a shotgun. When you're running in one direction, the camera follows you. You also can't change the camera direction while moving. This means that if an enemy is chasing you and need to kill them, you have to completely stop, turn your camera, and hope you're able to target them with the horrible targeting system before they kill you. Spoiler: you won't be able to. You'll die.If you played this 15 years ago, congrats! You were able to play through a horrible game because you didn't know any better. Now you have wonderful nostalgia and can view the game through the rose-tinted lenses of nostalgia.If you've never played this game, don't start now. It sucks. It sucks really, really hard. Play Sleeping Dogs or GTA V or any other more modern, better refined sandbox game instead. This one belongs in the past.			"

												This game is Legendary for me and is the first game i can recall playing when i was just a little kid and what i attibute to getting me into gaming as a whole. I still remember what i did when i first played it so long ago. I found a shotgun, shot a cop, and stole a blue station wagon in the red light district. GTA 3 was a major step for games as a whole and practically pioneered the Sandbox genre and laid the framework for what it is today. Graphically this game obviously does not look the best but it by no means looks the worst when you consider this game is almost 16 years old i would say its graphics have held very well given how ancient this game is and as a plus this game also supports native 1080p resolution.  Even though the graphics are impressive for the age the main selling point nowadays would come from having the chance to experience one of the most revolutionary games ever developed and even today GTA 3's storyline and exploration of Liberty City still provide a fun and compelling experience that is worthy of your time.

												A classic. I remember staying up late at night playing this on a rented PS2. It changed the world of gaming forever with its approach. The world is big (not as big as new GTA versions but it was at the time), the options are seamingly endless, the sand in the sandbox is deep (again not as much as new GTA games but was very much so for the time).The fact that the character you play speaks no words is in itself, a very interesting dynamic to the game. It makes you more aware of the other characters, the missions, the world; everything is embellished with great detail because of your silence. You carry out bloodthirsty murders, arsons, and robberies with cold indifference to your actions. It's kind of chilling to think about.The violence of the game was disturbing to lots of people and it is pretty bloody. The concept of a free-range murderer is kind of frightening, but the game is very much a game so there is nothing to worry about. Have fun blowing cars up. It's just a game.The story is very obviously borrowed from gangster movies like The Godfather and Goodfellas and such. This is a bonus though, as everything seems very familiar to you, like you are already a made man.Excellent game, and playable all the way through.10/10			"

												GTA 3, when released in 2001, changed the entire gaming landscape. Around 1999, shortly after the release of the top-down GTA 2, Rockstar decided to cash into the trend of 3D gaming, and started development of GTA 3. What was once a cheesy, cartooney 3D city evolved into the living monolith the 3D Rendition of Liberty Ciy was. Taking place in 2001, while robbing a bank, an unnamed thug (known as Fido in game) is fatally shot by his girlfriend, Catalina. This man goes through various friends, enemies and betrayals to get to his goal of killing his girlfriend at a dam in a dramatic final mission. Liberty City is a giant. Consisting of three large islands and a huge green inaccessable countryside, Liberty City is stunning visually. The game has a decent array of weapons, with some of these weapons being an overpowered shotgun and Carbine Rifle, a sniper rifle, an undersized AK-47 and a well rounded Micro Uzi. With these weapons come mechanics. Though GTA 3 has generally solid mechanics, it does have setbacks, like inaccurate auto targeting (Classic Control Method) and the inability to crouch. Driving mechanics are quite good, with a big heavy army truck being hard to spin out following a fender crash, and a Viper based sports car spinning two 360s as the result of such collision. GTA 3's radio selection, while not nearly as good as the one in Vice City, is still decent. I was often listening to Head Radio, Double Clef, K-Jah or Flashback FM. If you loathe the entire game's soundtrack, this PC version supports custom radio stations, which can be accomplished by dragging your mp3s in the folder of the same name in the game directory. Additional PC features include choosable skins for the player, and full aiming with any weapon, something the PS2 version of the game did not support. There is alot more content and easter eggs in this amazing game that will keep you busy. Though you will find more fun in Vice City, that is not putting down GTA 3 at all. Even if you do get bored of the main game, the PC versions of both games support major mods, like the RealGTA mod for GTA III. No matter which way, GTA 3 is worth the wait and the money.			"

												Okay, here's what I'm going to say right now. This game is great and all, but I'm going to have to say that San Andreas was probably much better than this. The confusion begins when the first mob hates you and then, literally, every mob hates you. You can't complete the game or leave your PC without getting shot. You can't drive more than five minutes without getting shot. You can't even get on or off the subway without getting headshot oh so suddenly.I understand… you make everyone hate you, but if it means it breaks the enjoyment of the game, then I guess I'm sticking to GTA:SA, GTAIV, or even GTAV.

												This was the game that introduced me to console gaming way back in highschool. Game is still extremely fun and very immersive even 10+ years later. Graphics are obviously very dated and there are still a few bugs around. Missions are still a blast, as is exploring and running over hookers (they literally make squish noises xD). The radio stations are worth a listen to, especially for nostalgia's sake. Overall, even as dated as it is, its still an amazing game. Well worth your money, as long as the graphics dont scare you away.			"

												I actually didn't start playing this game until after I found out about Vice City but I instantly was a huge fan of the game and its story. It was a bit frustrating back in the day, as there was a problem where if you ran into the Mafia they could one shot you with shotguns and blow your car up. Beyond that hiccup its definitely fun even today to play through. They definitely don't make story lines like this anymore!			"

												It’s aged horribly, if you are looking to get into GTA start with Vice city then work your way up. Both Vice City and S.A have solid gameplay and story that hold up to this day, this game however does not. Every single critique of this game I have is fixed in Vice City. The story is weak, it’s a revenge tale and yet the main character Claude shows no emotions nor speaks throughout the entire game. You feel empty at the end because it never seemed as if Claude ever cares about anything. You betray characters at a dime for no reason. There is no map, and the mini-map doesn’t tell you where the pay and spray and ammunition are so you have to literally learn the streets. You have hundreds of thousands of dollars to spend on nothing (except guns but good luck finding the ammunation). There are only 3 hideouts and they all look like ♥♥♥♥, for a millionaire Claude sleeps on the floor on the concrete. Every single gang in the game except one is out to kill you and have laser sharp aim. The camera is terrible and will get you killed. The crosshair is not correctly calibrated, bullets go outside of the circle and to the right in the exact same position always, so it is not a glitch but poor programing. The music is terrible, and theirs only about 3 1/2 hours of radio for a 20 hour game. A single station will only have about 20 minutes or about 5 songs each game so it gets extremely repetitive. The map is sectioned off by three bridges, each island is incredibly small. The reason why this is a problem is that there is no map and the game will have missions where you have to travel across islands against the clock. Since there is no map you will fail missions simply because you can’t find the bridge. Cars die in 5-8 hits. The best way to restore your health is to kill yourself because hookers take too long and finding health power-ups is at best random since there is no map and they are not labeled on the minimap. There is armor in the game but I never in 17 hours found it, not once! The handling of the cars is awful and will get you killed since cars can only take 6-8 hits. I played it to see the story and in all honesty it wasn’t worth it. Stick to Vice City, and SA, they are much better games by far. For 3.50 I feel robbed, maybye 0.99, MAYBYE.			"

												I don't really know what to say about this game. I mean, I didn't get the chance of playing it on its release, I've skipped straight to Vice City. Either way, some years later the curiosity about this title started to grow on me so eventually I decided to give it a chance. The first thing that I noticed is that the navigational resources that we have avaiable nowadays can really make everything much easier. In that game you can't really get to rely so much on that so you gotta pay attention to the map to realize where you are, where you're heading to, what's the best way to get there etc. The graphics are quite outdated but that's not much of a problem if you're more concerned with the entertainment value instead of the looks. The story is quite simple: You start from the bottom and every mission you complete makes you climb another step of the ladder, allowing you to meet some people with influence, unlocking stuff etc. There're some radio stations available but the songs get old really quick, trust me. Besides, there're some missions where you need to race against the clock that are simply unforgiving. In other words, it's the kind of game that was made specifically for Duke Nukem (yeah, because he got balls of steel). Overall, if you don't have much patience I recommend you to stay away from this game. Now, if you're up to a good challenge, then definitely go for it.			"

												It is hard to put into words the influence of ""Grand Theft Auto III."" I could go on about the innovations of the game and whatnot, but what I am especially in awe of is how well the game has aged. It was refreshing and bold in 2001, and it still has that impeccable charm that has graced very few games over the decades. It is still so much fun to speed away in a stolen police car, or take out a gang leader, or kill the snitch who's telling a rival your boss's secrets, or escort a hooker from point A to point B. Despite the somewhat dated graphics, the gameplay is rich and thorough as Liberty City is a place that feels real; a moving, breathing city.The first mission of the game is called ""Give Me Liberty."" Little did any of us know just how much liberty we would have in ""Grand Theft Auto III.""			"

IntroGTA III is third installment and the first 3D title of the GTA series. This title is revolutionary in many ways, but most importantly as pioneer of OPEN WORLD and SANDBOX gaming. Although open world games existed before GTA III, this game put the feature right near the top of the list from where it went on to become the most dominating characteristic found in almost all of today’s top of the range games. In this game you play the role of a wronged criminal on his quest for revenge. Betrayed by your own (very hot) girlfriend, you find yourself right at the bottom of the pile, from where you must rise up through the ranks… by doing petty crimes and driving around mob bosses in the beginning, but assassinations, heists, auto theft, racing, and every type of criminal activities you can imagine as you progress along the game. The setting is Liberty City, loosely based on New York City. You can drive cars or boats. You can roam around freely. Some parts of the city will unlock based on your progress through the story-line. Missions are given out by characters strewn around the city. Apart from missions, there are plenty of side-missions which will net you lot of money as well as excellent perks that are very useful for the story missions. If you are fan of open world, sandbox style gameplay, and do not mind challenges, you aboslutely must play this.ReviewGameplay – Gameplay is not GTA III’s forte. Very quirky and sensitive. Too many “insta-fails”. Too many missions are based on the “learn through failure” policy which I do not like. While some such missions have to inevitably exist, a good game design should have enough missions following the policy of “planning ahead through clues” as well. That goes on to give better immersion and realism. Then there is the annoying aspect of hostile territory which makes sense during the main story-line, but after the completion it should not persist, or else what is the point of completion. And this  aspect is an immense barrier towards the 100% score due to its interference with the paramedic mission, which in itself is an extremely unrealistic mission. But then again on the brighter side, the open-ended nature of the gameplay is commendable. Wide variety of options available to complete the missions with lot of room for out-of-the-box thinking. Considering everything, I would give 50-50 rating. TIP: If you complete the various types of side-missions, then some of the most difficult missions will not appear as impossible they can otherwise seem, in fact some of them will become a walk in the park. TIP2: In some missions you will have to think out-of-the-box and not try too hard.Graphics – Revolutionary 3D graphics for 2001. Human figures look a bit weird, but the cars, buildings, city architecture, etc. are very nicely done for its time.Performance – Good grade toaster can effortlessly run it. Modern systems might cause some trouble like stuttering or freezing.Entertainment – One of the most entertaining games you will ever play. Set the tone for GTA to become entertainment king of gaming. Whacky humor, crazy events, ridiculous ways to complete missions, a nice plot, colorful characters, pretty much everything you can want from a game.Plot – Very entertaining plot.Replay value – Quite high. The game being extremely difficult and at the same time very large, replaying can give you lot of fresh enjoyment and satisfaction which you might not be able to derive on your very first play-through.Immersion – It can’t be called immersive in its truest sense as it is not a real RPG, and nor can you customize your character in any way. Nevertheless there still is a sense of immersion quite deep due to the sandbox gameplay and the setting of a modern metropolis.Overall a superb game with the dated graphics being its only drawback. Mods are available to improve on that account. Although caution should be exercised about using mods in case you want to hit the 100% completion mark. Mods and cheats are known to be interfering with that.Reposted from my site Rex Aurelius[rexaurelius.wordpress.com] "

												this game is actually pretty fun for being over 10 years old, besides the fact that you cant swim and theres no map at all. If you like shooting anything in your path and stealing cars while running from the cops at the same time than this game is for you! GTA 3 also contains a storyline too which is a plus because the missions bring a challenge to the game that the previous games didnt actually bring. If you like GTA 4 or any other GTAs then get this game even though its really old!			"

												Oh my childhood...This was one of the few games that really defined my early PC gamer years. I was around 10 when I started to play this masterpiece and I still cannot get bored with it. Nad I didn't become a psychopath eventually.I just bought it on Steam, but earlier I spend tons of hours driving arund in Liberty City, shooting and hitting innocents fighting the police, using one of the hilarious cheats I still know after a decade. Back then I loved the story as well, know know it's a bit lame, but who cares? Maffia, triads, yakuza, Jamaicans, the Cartell and everyone betraying everyone... I loved it. This is still my favourite GTA and I can only recommend it to everyone.			"

												it should be ""grand theft shoes"" cause your on foot after half way through the missions  Gangs will kill you dead for driving and  will make you pay for trying missions anything bad that can happen will happen. eg step into a icecream van 2 shot gun shots  or 2 seconds later your on fire mission failed. no way of telling other than by memory where the gang turf is. let alone there is no in game map. thats dosnt bother me tho i wish i could see gang turf so as to avoid on mission.   Ill still play through it but with a general overtone of anger and hatered with a dash of saddness. and thats why i wouldnt recomend to anyone who hadnt played it before as an individual game.  if you played it when it was the best game of its type avalable you probably will  awnser the call of nostalgia and i would recomend it to you.  just dont do what i did and expect an easy stroll through this game you will be let down.

												The progenitor of sandbox action games, Grand Theft Auto 3 combines good missions, good driving, decent combat, and an incredibly fun world to explore.Mechanics:Grand Theft Auto 3 is defined by its open world, which allows the player to drive around and have fun without many boundaries. You have to complete some of the storyline missions in order to unlock more of the world, but the game reaches a point where many players find the freedom of emergent gameplay more enticing than continuing the story.The gameplay itself has two principle modes: driving and running.Most of the game is spent in a car, so it's a good thing that the driving mechanics work great. It's fun to just cruise around Liberty City looking for things to do while listening to the radio. You have a measure of combat capability in your car, but they can't withstand enough damage to make it viable for intense fights. There are also boats, which drive decently but worse than cars, and one plan that was put in as a joke and isn't really flyable.Running around on foot is the lesser used of the two, and the less fun, but it's the only way to really handle combat and is thus required for many missions. You have a bottomless-backpack of weapons, ranging from simple (like a baseball bat) to military surplus (like a rocket launcher). Combat is way too fast and completely lacking in strategy - you often have to lure the AI into kill zones or you'll just get mowed down. The fighting also lacks any weight or impact, which makes it feel super video-gamey and artificial. Most of the game is easy enough that this doesn't matter, but the later missions ramp up the difficulty so much that the poor combat system can becomes frustrating rather than fun.Since driving is so much more fun than just running around, a big part of the gameplay is your ability to carjack. Stealing people's cars is a staple mechanic of GTA3, and you often need to acquire cars quickly in order to be doing what you need to do, or stealing specific cars to complete a mission.The fact that storyline missions require you to get on foot for combat is a major weakness of the game, because pretty much everything works better when you can drive. But...and this is a *big* but...the ability to seamlessly transfer between driving and running on foot during gameplay was unheard of before GTA3. There were similar driving games, such as the successful Driver series, but absolutely nothing that allowed you to get out of your car to gun people down or steal another one. Even though it's mechanically weak, the sheer novelty of it blew people away at the time of release.The game is crammed full of other interesting mechanics as well - hidden collectibles, various minigames, unlockable cars, driving challenges, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that heal you via sex, random interactions that you can witness between AI characters (such as muggings or arrests), and an endurance system that allows you to sprint further the more you run. The standout mechanic, however, is the wanted star system. You can get from 1 to 6 ""wanted stars"" based on crimes you commit, with police response ramping up to match. 1 star has local police cruisers, 2 stars has coordinated police cruisers and boats, 3 stars has roadblocks and a SWAT helicopter, 4 stars has SWAT teams hunting you in armored vans. At 5 stars, the game radically changes as the FBI takes over, replacing normal police units and clearing the streets of civilians as they begin a manhunt of you, including a second helicopter. At 6 stars, the city is completely evacuated and the National Guard is called in, complete with tanks.It's a common pastime of players to just go on a major crime spree and see how long they can survive before the government inevitably brings them down, trying to beat their ""personal best"" 6-star survival time.Level Design:Remarkably well done. Liberty City is a satirical version of New York City and is divided into three suburbs.  Only one of these is accessible at the beginning of the game, which allows the player to familiarize themselves with the gameplay in a fairly small section of the world, learning the ropes without getting lost. Eventually, the other two sections are unlocked in order, giving the player complete and utter freedom to go wherever the hell they want.  Liberty City is a fantastically well designed map, with each section of the city having a different, interesting style, while also being easy to learn and navigate. As for the storyline missions, they're strongest in the early game. The Italian Mafia missions in particular. This is vital, because these missions are absolutely required in order to unlock the free-roam aspects of the game, so they need to be the best. The missions begin to slowly taper downward during the Yakuza section, with the Cartel often being frustrating and annoying and quite painful to finish.The reason behind this downward interest curve is simple - the early Mafia missions have a fun combination of driving and simple combat. The Yakuza missions are harder and more complex, but retain this interesting combination. The Cartel missions, however, throw you into massively more difficult combat scenarios, when the combat system is the weakest part of the game...not the thing you want to lean on for an exciting finale. They were clearly made to be difficult to beat, rather than interesting to experience.I think this would bother people more if the game wasn't such an incredible sandbox experience, but the reality is that most players never even bother to do the Cartel missions. The open world of Liberty City is just way too much fun to play around in, and it's most likely going to sink its teeth in harder than the story is. Personally, I like to finish the story, but I realize that I am in the minority here.Narrative:Claude, the mysteriously silent anti-hero, is betrayed by his girlfriend and accomplice, Catalina. She turns on him in the middle of a bank robbery and leaves him to be arrested. However, he is soon freed by a lucky break and winds up in a safe house, finding work for the Leone Mafia crime family. His work as a driver and strongman for the Mafia eventually gain him the affections of a trophy wife, sets him up to work with the Yakuza, and leads him into conflict with Catalina and her Columbian Cartel, who are pushing a dangerous new drug onto the streets.The game primarily serves as a parody of crime fiction, but also as a far-reaching satire of modern society. It does have its own plot, sure - the overarching story involving Catalina and her dangerous new street drug and her history with Claude and his romance with a trophy wife and a lot of double crossing. It's decent. But Claude isn't much of a character at all and his arc is pretty forgettable.Where the story shines is in all the little moments. All the other characters and their interesting scenes. All the funny dialogue. All the radio shows and commmercials and billboards that make Liberty City feel like a living, breathing world...and remind you just how ridiculous our own world is.The gem among these is Chatterbox FM, which is the single greatest radio talk show in the history of radio talk shows. Just listening to it is the best story in the entire game. Hell, Chatterbox FM alone has better writing than many entire games do.Aesthetics:Graphics were really good for the time, but the draw distance is terrible. Sounds effects are awesome. Design of the cars is good. Voice acting is stellar.However, the soundtrack reigns supreme. The radio stations make this game worth playing all by themselves. I'm a Chatterbox FM fellow myself, but GTA3 has something for everyone.Overall Rating: 5/5 "

												Good way to start off the GTA series from the beginning of the 3D games.Be sure to install silent patch to get rid of bugs, also a con is that you need to set FPS with RTSS to be able to play properly above 30FPS, and then still you better drive cars with frame limiter on.But overall it's really worth the price.

												Grand Theft Auto III is a fantastic game, the gameplay, while somewhat stiff, is still pretty fun (especially with cheats), but the story is basic: you're a criminal out for revenge on a former partner that screwed you over. Despite how generic the story might seem, it's still fun to play through, even after all these years. And the soundtrack is pretty small, especially compared to later installments in the GTA series, but you can play your own music in-game, which negates the whole ""there's barely a soundtrack"" problem.The side missions (Paramedic, Firefighter, etc.) are much easier than they are in later games, but are still challenging due to the aforementioned stiff gameplay, but I think you can learn to live with it, especially since the rewards for completing them are so good (with the exception of the taxi mission). The collectables, which are a staple of the GTA series, return in the form of Rampages, Hidden Packages, and Stunt Jumps. If I remember correctly, those are the only three, but they are still satisfying/rewarding to complete. Also, this is the only GTA game with detachable limbs (i.e. limbs can be shot off), which is pretty funny with the crude graphics.At the time of this review, GTA III is 9.99 USD. It's definetely worth a shot, considering it's low price (which gets even lower during sales). I give it a solid 7.5/10.			"

												It's a fun look at the game I played years ago but it doesn't really hold up. The shooting controls are really bad. Thankfully most of the missions are ""Drive this here, get this, and deliver it back"". When you get arrested you lost all of your weapons along with some money so you're better off reloading your last save. This means you'll be driving home to save after most missions just in case. I would've stopped playing it a few missions in but I found some cheats that took the edge off. While in the game type ""gunsgunsguns"" to get all of the weapons. Have fun.			"

												Played this a hella ton on the Playstation when I was younger with a few friends. Now a days I prefer GTA:SA over this. Not to say this a bad game. I love this game, but nothing in this pulled me in anymore. Get San Andreas instead. You'll prefer it alot more. "

												I like this game because of gameplay, atmosphere and another GTA's stuff, but...Protagonist is Яetarded,So mush money for small period of time for ... nothing,No map. It's REALLY sad,Repetitive missions.It's progressive game for past, but not best of the series.			"

												a good game from back in the days in my opinion this is where grand theft auto really starting taking off. Game brings back memories and if you like the gta series i give this classic a try youll laugh at the dumb stuff the random npcs say lol. Story mode feel short but i still like it.			"

												Here is what you have to do in order to play the game without black cars bug, invisible menu and unadustable resolution1. Download this Gta 3.exe file from this link {LINK REMOVED}http://www.mediafire.com/download/dyf2fqcdg4eanct/gta3exe.rar2. Copy the exe file into your Gta 3 folder and replace the other in the folder.3. Right click on the Gta 3.exe and go to properities and check ""run as an administrator""4. Start the game and change the laungauge to english and the resolution of your choice5. Enjoy the damn game I hope this worked and thank you from Nedim			"
