												I am a full time soldier in the Canadian Army. I love my job, I work with some terrific people, get to do some really cool things and there really is no life like it. The military is also what helped bring me out of side scrollers and into the world of 3D gaming that we play in today, As a teenager I was raised by military parents, and retired military Grandparents. I watched movies about The Great War, World War II, Vietnam, went to the War Museum in Ottawa, Ontario and listened to my Dad as he told me about my Great Grandfather and his role in Vimy Ridge.It only made sense that, eventually I’d find myself purchasing a copy of Gearbox’s Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30, when I bought my first Xbox. I’d played other World War shooters on the Playstation and PC prior to this, but it never really stuck. While it was cool to play as an Allied soldier working undercover for the OSS, I was never convinced it was a very good representation of the life of a soldier.Brothers in Arms had me from the start. When I first popped in the disk and heard the Brothers in Arms theme, the music just hit me right to my core. The beautiful, sad but powerful marching music in the menus made me pause and sit for a few minutes to just soak it in, and I realized right then that I was going to be in for a journey that I’d never been in before.However, I’m going to skip forward a few years. See after being in the military for a few years, I found myself coming back to Brothers in Arms. This time when I started the game, the haunting words of Sergeant Matt Baker struck me and really made me feel and understand why this game had me from the start. I find that most military shooters are just “bang bang explosion, pow pow Nazi!” Brothers in Arms makes you feel the soldiers pain, joy and regrets as they evolve from gung-ho soldiers at the start of D-Day to their final showdown at Hill 30.As Soldiers in the field, every decision made can have horrible consequences. Many of us have lost friends, have our loved ones leave us to come home to empty houses and many of us have even lost limbs or the ability to have a good nights sleep, all in the name of our flag and freedom. Most of us do not regret these decisions as we recognize that they must be done in order for others to enjoy the freedoms and rights that we have. The life of the soldier is almost never glamorous. It’s a job and we do the very best we can with whatever scenario that is given to us. This is shown in Brothers in Arms several times over the course of the series. One character at one point in the game loses his mind over the grief of losing two squadmates under his command. Another character finds himself running into a burning building to rescue a soldier who himself was trying to rescue an innocent. Characters are killed, others hurt to the point of having to be sent home, and yet the rest soldier on. They do what needs to be done and that makes this game very special.The words that open the first game in the Brothers in Arms series still give me pause whenever I hear them. They are the words of a man who has lost his friends and lost his sense of youth and vigor to get the job done. Matthew Baker is tired of this damn war and everything that led to where he is and just wants it to be over. Read these words and imagine you’d been in hell for over a week, each day feeling longer than the last.“My dad said something to me after the divorce. He said that every soldier has two families, those you raise and those you raise Hell with. I’ve spent eight days here, eight days commanding a squad I wasn’t ready to lead, eight days watching my men – my family – kill and be killed. Eight days wishing it would stop.”From there you open up to a Brutal shootout with Matt’s squad pinned down by enemy fire and tanks. The screams of squad mates calling for support on the radio with no reply. The shouts of the company First Sergeant barely keeping the fear out of his voice as he tried to keep his men calm and focused. The disbelief of a soldier as he tries to rouse his fire team partner who has suddenly dropped dead. Finally, mercifully a tank shell explodes near you and everything gets hazy. The last thing you see before everything goes black is a soldier – having finally snapped from the pressure – expose himself to enemy fire, calling for death, and taking a blast from a tank as a result. It’s a very shocking and sudden introduction to a game that introduces you to amazing characters. Then one by one they are taken away from you as you begin to feel like they are holding your sanity together while you fight your way through hell.Camaraderie is a big thing in military life. The constant razzing of your buddies, supporting them when they are down and picking on them when they goof up. There are several moments like this in the Brothers in Arms series that really cement that feeling of camaraderie for the player. In the first game, two of the most memorable characters are some guys named Allan and Garnet, who met up in boot camp and became inseparable. The chatter that they have between (and sometimes during) missions is some of the best dialogue I’ve heard in a military shooter, and it would be a great loss to lose these guys in a firefight. In particular there’s an awesome argument between them and another soldier about Batman VS Superman that cemented their awesomeness in my mind forever.Of course I’m getting away from myself with comparing my life to that of characters in what is still in the end just a videogame. In my opinion it’s a damn good one too. One which spawned two other games that were great as well. Aside from authenticity, one of the big things that I really enjoyed about these games was the challenge and the tactical gameplay. Your squadmates were very smart and did their best to keep you alive, they followed direction but also knew better than to let you get them killed by ordering them to do something silly like attack a tank head on. The enemy functioned the same way making strategy key to victory. You had to be very careful with this as well because your men and you were very vulnerable. In Brothers in Arms, one very well placed shot could kill you in an instant, there are no magic health packs or regenerating health and running out in the open was suicidal. This made it the first shooter I ever played where making use of cover not only made sense, but was essential to survival.Brothers in Arms has been without a new entry for some time now, with Brothers in Arms: Hell’s Highway hitting stores in 2008 and ending in a bit of a cliffhanger. Gearbox Software announced a spinoff called Furious Four a while ago which was supposed to make the series similar to Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds. This enraged a rather large number of BIA fans though and Gearbox ended up removing it from the Brothers in Arms name. A couple years ago Gearbox’s Randy Pitchford told IGN that another authentic Brothers in Arms game was on it’s way but that the wait could be up to five years. However, my hopes are high that we will see something in the near future , as I personally think that Brothers in Arms is the best shooter series I’ve ever played and I am looking forward to seeing what’s next for these characters.

												I am SO glad to see you guys! - Jospeh Hartsock, Brothers In Arms Road To Hill 30THE GOODAuthentic environments range from visually stunning (In the sense of scope) to downright ugly. Some of the character animations are a bit awkward, and one particular glitch sent a German rifleman across the map where he promptly caught himself on barbed wire and ruined the mood. The textures could be worse, but that's like saying that Duke Nukem Flopped could've been more hyped. For 2005, graphically speaking, it's mediocre. Not great, not terrible, not a benchmark for games and not something you'll want to recycle for toilet paper. While being failry realistic, it suffers from having people die very quickly, which can be frustrating when you need that person for a particular job, as shown perfectly by Objective XYZ. The multiplayer has two players who each command two teams to try and eliminate the other team. While not a straight up shooter, it would be nice to see some other objectives rather than just kill everyone else. This is BiA, not Quake.THE GREATThe story is fantastic. Not Half Life fantastic mind you, you do not have a wide range of ways to be attached to the game. Be that as it is, BiA is still worth playing just for it's story. Gritty, depressing and a bit too real at times, BiA is not for children, those with a weak stomach or those who get attached to characters quickly. The gameplay is solid and fair, giving you advantages when you constantly fail, but also giving you the choice wheather or not you take that extra. You will get attached to characters, some quicker than others, and if they die in combat, or via scripted event, it can be a real pain, due to the fact that you cannot save whenever you want. This can be good though, it pushes the story along and makes character deaths even more shocking than in games such as Halo: Combat Evolved.THE UGLYMost players will die a few times during this game, myself included. The introduction of a few characters can feel a bit strange when they either die or are never mentioned again during later missions. One death in particular was shocking, although it did seem a bit pointless, as I had been involved in the game quite a bit and hadn't gotten a grasp on who he was or why he was there. The following mission had you sniping from a tower while you sent your soldiers to work down below, but this personally felt like it wanted to be an RTS for a mission. For half the mission, either the enemy soldiers are too far away or the bloody tanks get in the way which make it feel less team oriented, and more like a straight up FPS while still keeping the same mechanics, which means that getting killed instantly by a tank shell is not impossible. Thankfully it only lasted one mission and was not seen again.THE VERDICTThis is the best game in the series so far. Earned in Blood shows a different perspective, which is fine, but storywise the third game Hell's Highway has an intro cutscene which basically sums up Road to Hill 30 and Earned in Blood, which may make you wonder why you bought RtH30 and EiB, but you bought them because you are a good boy and played the first ones because they were better games.SIMILAR GAMES-Earned in Blood, Hell's Highway to a lesser extent-Star Wars Republic CommandoFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview "

												The first game in the Brothers in Arms series, (Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30, Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood, Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway, and eventually Brothers in Arms 4: The-game-gearbox-studios-will-make-when-they-get-off-their-lazy-asses-and-realise-that-their-fanbase-has-wanted-this-game-for-a-very-long-time), Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is effectively HBO's Band of Brothers the video game. If you have ever wanted a serious WWII game that tells a touching and thought-provoking story, this is it. Don't be fooled by the game's age, it's gameplay is engaging and challenging, and the story is, in my opinion, the best story ever told through the medium of video games - REALLY. If you have never played it, or the other titles, you won't understand the perfection of the story-telling that goes on in this series. To top it all off, the game is based upon real events, people, and actions, and so feels very realistic. Overall, this and the others in the series, are incredibly immersive video games, with an important, exciting, touching, gritty, at times humerous, and bleak story around the horrors experienced by the 101st Airborne 502PIR during WWII. 10/10 would rank 10/10.

												Here's my review on ""Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30"".As far as I know this is the first game of the series. You play as Sgt. Matt Baker, a troubled soldier that was never ready to lead men in combat. But as this was forced upon him on the night of 6th of June 1944 on D-Day. Throughout the game, you'll lead your men (everywhere from one man up to 3 men and a tank or 6-7 men) and defeat the German Warmachine in Normandy before you'll face the ultimate test of Hill 30.I first played this game way back when it was on PS2 and one of the best shooters I had ever played. Now you kinda ought to have prior experience with this game in order to really enjoy it. Because, face it, the graphics are somewhat hard to look at with modern technology available.The idea behind the game is rather simple: you're usually given 1 or 2 teams. You use them to overcome what the german forces might throw at you, that being normal infantry, AT-guns and MG's, mortars or tanks. It's all first person, except a tactical map you can check every now and then.You use f.ex the fireteam to pin the enemy down and then flank with your assault team. (and yes, this game has a rather well done ""suppressive fire""-system, which has come to be something BiA is known for.) It sounds very simple, but sometimes it can be a little tricky.It has very outdated graphics, decent voiceacting (a little better in later games), very good soundeffects, excellent story/plot, but a little repetetive gameplay. Controlls are good.So:Graphics: 6/10 It's old, so give it some slackSounds: 8/10 Sometimes the voiceacting and dialogue are a little awkwardGameplay: 7/10 A little repetetive, but challenging and brings a new factor to FPS' that's very rare. Try to suppress the NPC's in the campain on BF4 f.ex...Controlls: 8/10 They're good enough. Twerk it to make it 100% the way you want it.All in all: 7/10This game feels very good to me, but I can not be objective about it. Might be a challenge to stick to it if you haven't played it before.Sincerely yoursPorta			"

												Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is a great game.  I bought this on disk originally and played it into the dirt.  I saw it on a steam sale and thought I might give it another go.  I literally ran though this one since I remembered the fights and it still took me 9 hours to complete it.  If you have a WWII D-Day fantasy this is definitely a game you will  enjoy.  You get to lead a squad of men through the first 9 days or so of the D-Day invasion.  If you like paint ball or doing headshots while upside down this isn't a game you will enjoy.  If you like dramatic ""roleplay"" type warrior stuff then do yourself a favor and pick up this title.  This game is enjoyable as a SINGLE PLAYER GAME only.I ran it on Windows 7 64 bit maxed out just fine on a 4 year old PC.  The story, the gameplay and the characters are all top notch.  The graphics are great too for an older title.  I just wish they put this much love into the newer games.			"

												I've played these games since the start of me playing video games, Road to Hill 30 was one of the very first games I ever got for a PC. I then played Earned in Blood on PS2, and Hell Highway on PS3. And I was blown away every time and still am.These games are what military shooters should be. It basically Band Of Brothers, the video game. Brothers in arms is one of the only games to actually get me to shed a tear. The story is great and very historically accurate and realistic, as with the gameplay. The music is amazing, the voice acting is fantastic, the graphics are great. But the main focus here is the experience and the story. The story of these games in my opinion is bar-none. No other military shooter has had a story like these games. And its the only non-horror military shooter that can be scary at times.10/10 Extremely Recommended			"

												Brothers In Arms: Road to Hill 30 is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Troy Baker. I mean Sargeant Matt Baker, a paratrooper part of the 101st Airborne, 502 Regiment, 2nd Battalion, fox company, 3rd platoon. Uh... I think there's one more.3rd Squad? Yeah, 3rd Squad. Baker is part of the airborne invasion of Normandy the night before D-Day, and much like the second episode of Band of Brothers, things go titsup real quick and Baker and his squad are forced to jump out of their planes early. When Baker lands, he is without weapon and must find his squad, and achieve their objective before the ground invasion begins. Oh yeah, and they're fighting the German army. I should probably mention that. What comes after this is a journey of a man through one of the most respectful and serious video game interpretations of WW2 since the original Call of Duty. Yeah, remember when COD was about the men who fought and died during the most bloody conflict in human history? Yeah, me neither, 2003 was a haze. Brothers in Arms: Street to mountain 20 is one of those games that came out in that weird period of 2005 when developers really just wanted to release games that were actually good. This was up there with Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory as one of the games I was really excited to get my hands on when I was the tender age of 38. Only back then I was playing it on an original Xbox and on a big fat TV that made shooting anything a journey. BIA is a first person squad based shooter where you take command of anywhere from 1 to 9 men over the course of 8 days. From Utah Beach to Carentan, shooting at as many people as possible along the way. The game is fairly simple, you shoot with the left mouse click, aim down your sights by clicking down the mouse wheel, and command your squad with the right mouse. Your men are split between two teams, fire team, and assault team, and you switch between them with the shift key. It's a fairly easy system to get use to, and the enemy comes with a circular meter that shows you just how willing they are to get shot in the face. With the fire team you suppress your enemy while the assault team scurries around them and shoots them in the side. With this, it becomes a puzzle as you circumvent the battlefield and attempt to find the best way to flank your target. For a game as old as it is, BIA has some pretty impressive stuff to it. Every member in your squad has a different face, and you can tell them apart just by looking at them. Like, dang, that's kind of crazy when you think about it, especially in an era of military shooters where everyone is practically a clone. Not only that, but they all have their own personalities and voice actors, it really sets them apart from generic mooks and ends up with you caring for them more than you realized as the game goes on.Can you believe this is a Gearbox game?  I know, weird. I do have, ONE, major gripe with the game. Near the end of the game, there's a mission called ""Pushing into Carentan"" that feels like it was made by a single intern on his lunch break. Its here where you meet the SS panzer Division and all of their rootin tootin quick drawing glory. They're not only hard to sneak up on even when suppressed but they are pack enough of a punch to launch your heart out the back of your body Bruce Lee style. Not only that but most of the mission is in very close quarters, so a good chunk of the time may end with your squad getting wasted before they can get proper cover. Not only that, but I had to push Sargeant. Hassay around because his feet got caught on the side walk at the end of the mission and I couldn't complete it until he glitched out and bounced over the curb. Its a remarkable blemish on an otherwise solid game. Should you play Brothers in Arms: Hitler vs Uncle Sam fist fight? Its honestly a lot shorter than I remember it being, as I managed to finish it in a single sitting once I booted it up. It runs fine on modern systems, and I didn't really had to tinker with anything. The graphics are a bit dated but still nice enough that you can recognize your squadmates by facial features alone, and the voice acting is pretty solid for the most part. There was a part on the last mission where Mac's voice actor just flat out changed, like it was a different guy just kind of reading the lines, I'm not kidding, look it up, its hilarious. But other than that, it was still a fun little late night romp through 1940's France. Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 gets 8 Michael Kamen's trumpet scores out of 10. I'm pretty sure I was living in Argentina after World War 2, can't seem to remember why, though.The curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation "

												I learned more about D-Day from the extras menu then I have ever learned from High School History Class.But honestly, this game is a sublime gem for a history nut like me.Going back to 2005, I picked it up on the old Xbox and got my♥♥♥♥♥kicked on the first few levels. It was unlike any WW2 shooter at the time and even now it's something of a special snowflake amongst a horde of FPS's on steam. Seeing it on sale I decided to pick it up again, this being the THIRD time I have purchased Brothers In Arms in some manner (got a beat-up CD-box set from amazon. I think the guy who sold it to me sat on it).So how does Brothers in Arms stand out from the crowd, especially from a time when we were once tired of WW2 shooters?Deploying tactical charges and employing cunning tactics are your only surefire way to make it to the end of the level with yourself and your men intact. Everything from rifle sway, debris and the unforgiving difficulty keep you from reliving memories from Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor and force you to focus and pin enemies down with relentless fire.This method of gameplay has been a turnoff for some, as it is very hard to actually get through some skirmishes, but I find it fascinating. I can't recall many games utilizing supression fire to achieve victory over an enemy, who come at you in increasingly large numbers. Through this method of gameplay I've found it to be oddly satisfying to land a kill-shot on a Jerry and send his body ragdolling across the pavement. Landing that final blow is far more rewarding then in most games, where the enemy stands out in the open doing little in terms of self preservation.Of course, another major selling-point for BIA is the story. Unlike MoH or CoD, the fighting is a lot more personal and evocative. the main character, Sgt Matt Baker, is fleshed out, poetic, caring and loyal. Not to mention the characters of your friends and squad-mates are equally endering. Going back, I was astonished by how much character was present in this game compared to games at the time and even today. None of these soldiers are cigar-chomping, hardened veterans. They are optimistic young men, brash yet friendly, stressed yet humorous. They feel like genuine human beings, a refreshing take on Soldiers compared to the nihilistic shouting and brooding from many Modern-Military shooters of today. Sgt Matt Baker and friends see through the patriotism and have first-hand experiences of the horrors of war, yet they strive forward with wit, humor and optimism to reach the end of the day.However, even at the time, BIA falters on the graphical front. Many textures are muddy and blurry, especially up-close. The levels are rather drab as well. Even at the time they weren't exactly eye-candy. However, they serve the gameplay well, and some special effects such as dirt clogging your vision and muzzle-flashes help reel you into the atmosphere.Speaking of which, much of the game is played against a silent soundtrack with nothing but machine-gun beats, wind and bullet-impacts riddling your ears. The sound design is top-notch for a game like BIA and creates a fantastic atmosphere against the set-pieces of D-Day and skirmishes that followed.With all that being said, I can't exactly say I can recommend BIA to everyone. Those looking for a challenge might be pleased but a few may be turned off by the cumbersome controls and lack of modern FPS features like sprinting, prone positions or cover-vaulting. For someone like me, who is a bit of a history nut, I was ecstatic to play this once more on steam and experience the story again.If this game is right up your alley and are itching to get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked by rifle-totting krauts, then look no further then Brothers in Arms and it's fantastic sequel!

												2005, The year when the game did first released. I was around 8th grade back then and befriend with a boy who did really into ""WWII"" history.  One evening after I did a bit of bartering for the copy of Call of Duty 2 from him, I came back home pop that sucker in my DVD drive ..........and this game was risen up instead........ Well to cut it short, I still pressed on the installation and playing it........................................ This game introduce me to a new kind of genre of shooting back then, Instead of running wild alone in stalingrad I was instead play as a dogface on the very first D-Day and boy..... I'm so glad.Pro +Superb music score+Superb storyline (well, considering it ran on the very accurate history so far)+Superb Audio, I do felt immerse to the battle field because of that.+Innovative commanding squad system (back then in a least)+Superb voice acting and the character. (Damn it Risner!!)Con- AI AI AI AI!!!!!-For it try to be realistic, especially on gunplay, Never I did cursed and scream like a retard just for shooting an enemy....Why?..... I can't hit♥♥♥♥♥♥at all with a god damn rifle.  The gun with hipfire never going to hit a target ... so forget CoD tactic like pray and spray.... And also even with iron sight the percent still only around 70% since your ironsight never steady at all.- Sometime the route and map really did it cheap, Cheap enough to kill the illusion of the comand you could done on battlefield.  By far... I'm still recommended this game. It was one of the pinnacle of FPS history and also a WWII game by far.  "

												%100 recommended!One of the best WW II story lines and one of the most tactical games i ever played, but notice you should play this game in the correct order:1st Road to hill 302nd Earned in blood3rd Hells highwayOtherwise you will not understand anything about this game's story line. and please if you are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ COD kis do not touch this game, it is a mix of RTS and FPS which means you are not here to RUN and GUN, i read the negative reviews it makes me laugh what negative points people are pointing at. you have to play as a real soldier here this game can actually teach you how to battle with a squad even in reality, part of squad has to surpress the enemy and keep the enemy busy in cover while the flanking team has to find a way to flank from behind, this game has too much cover so you are not supposed to kill your enemies with shooting at them either be part of surpressing team or flanking team. yes this is a game which came in 2005 on that time we had REAL video games not CoD clones with run and gun to attract kids!

You’ll care about your squad a lot and almost feel loss when someone gets killed. I wish they would make an HD remake of this game.			"

												+ iconic tactical shooter+ you get attached to the characters and the story+ weapons diversity. Can use German guns.+ you feel responsible of your squad+ general ambience, soldiers swearing, bullets flying, visual effects- AI- challenging for neophytes - old but not obsolete - redundant - save system The Brothers in Arms series is a pure tactical shooter and characters oriented game. You play as a US squad leader during WWII and your goal is to passby enemies lines while keep your men alive. Charge heads in and your entire squad will perish. Outflank the enemy and you will win. The game is actually entirely centred around flanking tactic. Advance, get cover, suppress the enemy with nourished fire, flank, finish the job. Do it again and again. This concept although redundant never goes out of fashion. The game will offer formidable and exiting challenges making it harder to flank enemies. Concerning the difficulty the game can be almost impossible to complete in higher difficulty, and is challenging enough in normal difficulty level.What I really like about this game is the tactics, the different weapons available, and the story line.However the game is old and the AI is not faultless. Enemies sometime go banzai and end up dead or sometime your own units take the most suicidal path to reach their destination so make sure to guide them well. In higher the difficulty level the game can be also extremely frustrating. Furthermore the accuracy of the weapons seems to have been reduced ostensibly to make the skirmishes last longer. Finally the saves system is just horrendous, it comes under auto an auto save system in which you cannot manually saves your game during the mission. If you die you must restart from the last auto save which can be really annoying during tough missions. "

												Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 is an WW2 , FPS and Tactical shooter , and a great combonation. This game stands out from other tactical games , most of them you are given a straticic veiw of the map and you command various different units to take out enemy units. But in this game you jump into the role of squad leader of a paratrooper regiment taking part in the 1944 DDay operation , and the aftermath to take Normandy. Instead of the stratigic overveiw , your in First person , commanding your men realisticly throughout the battlefeild , trying to keep your units alive and yourself. Not only is the there out of this world gameplay style different from normal tactical games , There is an actul story line , where each unit has a name , a backstory and a personality and when certain characters die in the story , you might atuly feel upset over what just happend. Also the story line is presented in a unique way which was pulled off with pure class , The protagonist of the story (Sgt.MattBaker) narates and tells backtories and stories of characters inbetween missions , and how he feels about them , and this can change throughout the story. Overall i think this game has a Brillaint and unique gameplay style , using to concept of miilitristic , tactical shooter , with a story plot we actuly care about , unlike most shooters we shove the storyline in the corner and rush through the game then complain the game was too short. This game changes that. Also i think this game is the thinking man's shooter , where he must plan his aproach through the harsh battefeilds then watch as his plan is executed and see if it works or doesn't. Only one complaint can be made about this game , that is the artificial Intelligance can somtimes (not always) be worse that a goldfish. Overall i think this is an exelent game. 9/10			"

												great game, the missions are good length and have nice amount of challenge with many a realisim and intensity,  although quite linear with little variety in gameplay, almost always supress and flank. but for a game from 2005 i am very pleased. the mechanics work well with the cover based shooting, squad control works suprisingly well with minimal frustration but the story is nothing special, the weapons are, well very nice (don't know much about real firearms myself) and there are some suprisingly emotinal moments between charecters. although with not alot of charecter development during the game i didn't experience much impact from the events that take place. the main charecter, baker does show change throughout the game as you progress. 9/10 final comment? -enemy AI could be better they are a bit stupid and: DO BUY THIS GAME			"

												Thanks to the sale, I was able to buy and play this again for old-times sake. This was one of the first WW2 shooters I've ever played, alongside Medal of Honor. The tactics and the use of your team to complete objectives is what today's generation of shooters needs and not just rush killing, like CoD. The graphics may not be the best, but the mechanics make the game so realistic; for example, the suppression and flanking.  You can also command tanks ;)  "

OverviewThe first of an absolutley amazing series, following newly promoted Sgt. Matt Baker as he fights his way across Normandy, from the near the beaches to right into Carentan. StoryRoad to Hill 30 follows Sgt. Matthew Baker, the ""shy and poetic young man"" who doesn't want to lead his 'Baker's Dozen' across the French countryside. The story is told from Baker's perspective as he progresses through living hell in France, watching his friends die all around him with nothing he can do about it. Unlike most games, it really focuses on how much hell war is and how much it effected those who were/are encapsulated by it's claws. It is told in a believable manor and is quite powerful and emotional at times. The story follows the real campaign during the second world war very closely and a lot if not all of the major battles fought, acutally did happen. There are also some realistic minor details such as SPOILER:(George Risner's tank when he dies. It has the same number on it and it was left in an area exactly the same as a photo taken of a broken down tank during the fight in Normandy) It's stuff like that I love in games.GameplayThe main tactics of this game are the Four F's (Find, Fix, Flank and Finish.) You can order your men to move with you, move to a certain location, suppress the enemy or charge the enemy. The enemies have suppression indicators on top of their heads, red meaning unsuppressed and grey meaning suppressed and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ themselves. This simple idea works fluidly and 99% of the time is not a nuisance to deal with during tense firefights. These orders are carried out by the two squads you have under your command, (not all the time, especially towards the beginning, you only have a few men) the Fire team, and the Assualt team. The 'ideal' way the game encourages you to defeat enemies is with the Four F's and the 2 squads:1. Put your Fire team in sensible cover and have them suppress the enemy.2. Take you Assault team and flank the enemies.3. When you are at the enemies' exposed flank, kill them then regroup and move on to the next group of enemies.Unfortunately, a lot of the time it isn't that simple. Your weapon sway is crazy so you won't be able to go rambo all the time, thus encouraging the utilization of your squad/s. Although the core gameplay is very good, the AI occassionally lets itself down with decisions such as choosing air particles rather than a barricade for cover against an MG42, or some squad members become rebellious and no longer respond to orders for a period of time. Other than that, the gameplay is engaging, fun and challenging at times.Graphics, Animations and SoundAlthough the graphics and animations are not fantastic in this game, the sound is very good and has the right balance between chaotic war and bursted eardrums. The soundtrack in all of the Brothers in Arms games including this one are fantastic and add fuel to the burning pyre of emotion in the credits and cutscenes. It's so well done that I feel like crying even as I adjust the resolutions and anti-aliasing settings. Graphics and animations are not this game's strong point but that should not be a problem as long as you're not one of those people who only plays games for the realistic visuals and not the great gameplay and story.Map DesignRoad to Hill 30 does a good job in general when it comes to map design although it is quite linear (hard not to be in this type of game) and the areas become quite repetative after long play sessions (the game is so good that I usually play most of the game in one sitting) Nearly all of the game is in similar looking French countryside. It's not that big of a deal really and is fixed decently in the next title in the series. (Earned in Blood).ExtrasThe game has various unlockables that you get for completing missions on certain difficulty levels. (The higher the difficulty, the more extras you get). Some of the extras available are pictures, documents (some de-classified), more detail/story to characters and even cheats such as infinite ammo etc. The extra difficulty is well worth the reward in my opinion.VerdictBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is a fantastic game with solid functions and precise gameplay that puts you on the edge of your seat for hours. Although it may not be the best game in terms of graphics, animations and silly AI, it more than makes up for itself with it's gritty story that had me riveted throughout the whole playthrough. If you want a realistic WW2 shooter that shows the real gore and terror of war, this game is for you!			"

												Not your typical FPS, involves a bit of strategy and thought as to how you tackle certain situations. The story in this game is fantastic; it deals with war the way a soldier would see it - you watch comrades you know by name, voice, personality, looks, everything; people you recognise - die. It's unpleasant, usually unexpected and brutal - then you're thrown straight back into the action after experiencing a lot of emotions, so if you get into the story, you may not think so straight when the combat starts. Would definitely recommend playing on Hardened/the equivalent of or Authentic if/when you unlock it to get a virtual experience of the war.A nice inclusion in the game also are the extras you earn when you complete missions on different difficulties: some include genuine photographs of the war and the places you fight in the game, others have descriptions (both audio and script) of weapons and vehicles, and some others also have copies of documents of the D-Day landings (stategies and maps mostly if I remember correctly). I believe there's an unlock that includes General Eisenhower's D-Day speech as well.Overall, a game to buy if you're fond of FPS's but want to try something that changes the format a little, and if you're studying for a history test on WW2.

												This is one of the best squad based first person shooters I have ever played.  I played this game many years ago when it first came out and it still hits all the right places.  The soundtrack is beautiful, listening to it might remind you of the soundtrack to Saving Private Ryan or the Band of Brothers series.  You get a real sense of the harrowing bravery of the men who fought in WW2.  I'm pretty sure all the characters in your squad are fictitous but they fleshed them out so well I felt they could almost be passed off as real people.  In normal difficulty levels I can't tell you how many times I reloaded a checkpoint because I'll be damned if I lose Hartsock or Corrion!I haven't played the multiplayer, but I can say I was incredibly satisfied with the single player campaign. In terms of action it can ease you into it, throw you into a frantic fray of issuing orders to your squads in order to outmaneuver the Nazis, and there are times when you just♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants going up against a field of 88s or panzer tanks with nothing but your squads (hopefully they're alive), your rifles and your wits.  The level of difficulty that you play the game also unlocks some pretty cool ""making of"" stills and audio, not only do they provide some great insight to how the game was made (and how they replicated major battlefields down to the closest details of it's time.  They also unlock After Action Reports (used to figure out gameplay) and various bios (weapons, notable people you encounter, units) in the game.  The premise to the game mechanics is taking full advantage of the 4 ""F""s (Find, Fix, Flank, Finish).  You're squad is pretty damn smart, they'll run and shoot, find the nearest cover (from where you tell them to go) jump out of your way when you're shooting and yell at you when you get in their way.  Squad management can be tedious on harder levels when you really need to manage your squads.  You have a definite health bar (no health regen) I believe the only way to possibly regain health is to beat the level or reach a checkpoint.The graphics and default controls are dated, thankfully you can customize the controls.  Despite being dated I think the graphics hold up really well, animations can be a bit stiff but everything looks pretty good considering it's age.  I can still play this game and simply find a quiet part of the level and just enjoy the scenery.Weapons handling is about a legit as a game can to this day in my opinion.  I get most modern shooters create this ease of use (EOTech/red-dot sight) interface where the bullet always goes where you point the reticle, but this game pretty much relies on you using iron sights (and at times scopes for sniper rifles).  Each weapon feels like it handles in a unique way, they each fire with different levels of accuracy.  Of course some people don't like this level of realism (which I can understand).I really recommend this game, sale or not, it's some of Gearbox's finest work and really wish it would return to these roots someday.

Posted: July 3, 2014
												What makes Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is how authentic it is. When Gearbox advertized it as being the most authentic and realistic WWII game to date, they meant it. With the help of retired Army Col. John Antal, Randy Pitchford and the creative team at Gearbox researched hundreds, if not, thousands of files and photos from WWII at the National Archive and Records Administration in DC, in order to accurately recreate the towns of Normandy, Carentan, and the surrounding farming areas using recon photos from 60 year old, now 70 year old aerial photos. The files don't go just from that, they photocopied written reports from Col. Cole and other military leaders on the tactical actions that are accurately recreated in the game. And how are the tactical movements accurately recreated in the game in an environment context? Amazingly, as Gearbox artists traveled and photographed much of the area shown in the game. The houses you will see, the buidlings, industrial areas, fences, hills, even the friggin hedges, they all exist in real life and were placed accordingly from research photos and recon maps. It's amazing and profound. The game is remarkable not just for the authenticity, but the true to life story of the soldiers. While the likeness and names aren't what they were in real life, the actions of Matt Baker and his squad are based on the actions of the 502nd Parachute Regiment of the 101st Airborne during Mission Albany. I shouldn't have to explain the story, as it's based on real events, but Matt Baker leads his squad from Normandy after the events of D-Day to secure nearby land and the town of Normandy. The in-between narrative is what really makes Baker's character profound though, because it's evident that the war is effecting him emotionally as some of his men die. The tactical movements from the files mentioned above are use as accurate movements of the linearity of the levels. Because these movements actually happened, that means the game isn't very open, but that doesn't detract from the quality of using your squad to suppress fire and flanking the enemy with your assault team. The gameplay is a hybrid of being an FPS and a strategy game. You command your squads, fire and assault teams. You can place your team into cover and then order them to suppress fire. Rather simple, but intuitive and fun. There's also the strategy view, which is supposed to simulate recon maps a Sgt. would have studied and memorized beforehand, but being a videogame, Gearbox doesn't strain this on you and allows you to view the area in a semi bird view, getting a strategic idea of how to move on.I'd like to say that the graphics are decent enough. I just can't believe this game came out nearly a decade ago, 2005, and how they compare now. The levels are designed perfectly, just play the sniper level, you get to see all of Carentan. But only two years later, the first Crysis would come out. I just think Gearbox could have spent a little more time in the textures. Otherwise, the animation was made using motion capture as a basis, and it does look good. The sound design is insanely well done. This game puts you in the battlefield without some soundtrack playing Hans Zimmer for no particular reason. As for the music that is in the game, the pause menu music or the music played over some of the cutscenes are remarkable and true to WWII films. The Prague Philharmonic did a fantastic job in the orchestration.I think I covered everything. Absolutely my favorite WWII shooter, next to Brothers in Arms: Hells Highway.9.3/10			"

												Ive been playing a lot of games lately from my teenage/college years and this is the latest game to recieve a rerun. I have to say it is a really good game and does deserve high praise. When i first got this way back in 2005 i think  i wasnt that impressed at start but it does grow on you. For a start the graphics may be poor by todays standard but at the end of the day graphics cant be the major factor in rating a game. The gameplay can be clunky and frustrating at times but at the same time the guns, the accuracy of weapons, and the skill of the germans in normandy make this an authentic experience. The Flanking idea or Tactic, with the four ""f""s was an interesting and effective concept along with the job of controling two squads. This flanking tactic has not been repeated on any fps game since as far as i know. Also you get a true feel for each charactor in the game and each of them has a personal story. In a way the whole storyline, action is quite similar to the excellent miniseries from around that time ""band of brothers"". The producers of this game put a huge labour of love into producing this way back in 2004/05 with numerous trips to normandy, researching, visiting battlesites, testing weaponry etc and all this adds to the realism. Each Battlescene in the game was actually a carbon copy of the real battlesite so the producers did definitley put a lot of effort into it. On a lasting note earlier i did say the graphics were dated but Normandy in this game does look beautiful, with its countryside, canals, small villages, hedgrows etc. i would definitley recommend this game and even though the years have passed since its release, it will always have a place on my steam library.

												My favorite part about Brothers in Arms is how they really focus on your squad members. It's not necessarily the best story I've ever seen nor is it the best WW2 shooter I've played (though it is both a good story and shooter). However I think this is the closest I've ever seen a game kinda emphasize the drama of war in a way shows like Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers do.			"

												If you ever played the game Freedom Fighters this game will feel pretty familiar. The combat is pretty realistic for the time of release and one wrong move can mean your entire squad gets wiped out. The stakes feel real without any quicksaves or quickloads to undo any mistakes. This game rewards quick thinking and careful calculation. I only wish I had bought it sooner.			"

Posted: December 28, 2013
												Now, in order for a tactical, squad-based shooter like Brothers in Arms to succeed, three key elements need to work: level design for allowing tactical choices, the squad commands for being able to efficiently tell your squads what to do, and the AI for being able to actually do to what you tell them to do. The level design is open enough to allow for flanking and other such tactical strategies. You'll get a spot for one squad to lay down supressing fire while your other squad or yourself gets a path to flank them. It also doesn't get too repetitive in repeating that formula through every level though, so it keeps things fresh. In some levels, for example, you get to command a tank and you and your squad have to use the tank as cover while moving down empty streets towards the enemy. The level design also provides a decent challenge for players who enjoy that, like myself, though two or three of the levels do ramp up the difficulty quite unexpectedly. The level design isn't as open as I hoped, as you usually get only one or two ways to flank an enemy. I would have preferred lots of ways to get around the enemy so there are more options available to the player. However, the level design is good enough that it emphasises the main mechanic of the game, that is supressing and flanking, and keeps it fresh throughout.Controlling squads is very easy and very quick, both of which are very important if you're in a firefight. Telling one squad to suppress an enemy then switching to your other squad and telling them to move to a certain postition is very simple and straightforward. No complaints here.The AI is probably the most important aspect that needs to be good in a game like this, and for the most part, the AI was good. Your squads will follow your commands quite well, be it suppressing an enemy or charging they're position. They listen well and react quickly to whatever you tell them. Occasionally though, the AI had it's hiccups. A couple times one of my squadmates would be killed because they took cover on the wrong side of a wall and twice I had to continue the rest of a level without a squadmate because they got stuck in a bush and couldn't move. The enemy AI could have been better, as they usually stick only to their cover and never try to flank you or try any other aggressive tactics that could have added a little more to the gameplay. For the most part though, the AI is good and does its job very well.As for the rest of the game, the voice acting and writing aren't awful, but they're not that good. Not like that should really affect the game as a whole, that main draw for this game is the tactical gamplay and that is very good with good level design, easily controllable squads, and sufficient AI.

												I tentatively recommend this game. The easiest way to describe it is to say that RTH30 is equal to the sum of its parts. When the parts work well, the game works well, and when the parts let you down it can be a clunky, frustrating experience. The basic concept is that this is a much more realistic WW2 shooter than the others out on the market at the time. Your weapons are inaccurate, your recoil drastically effects your ability to shoot straight, and the enemy is dangerous - you rarely fight waves of cannon fodder. You order your Base of Fire or Assault squads to suppress the enemy, and once they are suppressed, their accuracy and rate of fire drops considerably. This gives you the opportunity to maneuver around them and take them on their flanks. This tactic is rarely deviated from, but the enemy is often quite difficult, and catching them exposed and spraying them with a submachine gun is quite enjoyable.While ahead of it's time in terms of the concept and execution, the technical aspects of the game leave something to be desired - the voice acting is quite average despite the characters being distinct, and the animations are poor enough to break your immersion and therefore your emotional connection. In saying that, I loved the weapon sounds and feel, and the gunplay feels very realistic - just because you have the drop on the enemy doesn't mean you've beaten them if you don't fire smartly. Gameplay wise, you'll find that enemies can shoot you through surfaces that you can't see through, and you can be one-shot-killed by things you can't even see. I enjoyed the game the most during the opening few hours when the battlefields were open and the enemies were relatively few, as the core gameplay innovations were most effectively put to use, and clearing a field of enemies was a fun experience. But as soon as they ratchet up the difficulty and scale down the size of field of fire, you can often find yourself employing trial-and-error with multiple reloads just to get through pitched battles, and it starts to feel cheap. As much as it encourages you to use your assault team, more often than not I found myself just planting my squads to distract the enemy, and doing all the work myself, as they would tend to get cut down as soon as they get close to the enemy. They have a tactical map feature which I used once in the training mission and then immediately forgot about for the rest of the game. To be fair, that's my fault, obviously, but it wasn't essential to gameplay at all. Hell's Highway is a much more developed game, but makes a lot of references to the story of this game, so you will need to start here to get an idea of what's going on. RTH30 has the seed of good ideas that are more refined later on. I would get it cheap.			"

												the start of an incredible ww2 games series. The idea of mixing strategy with fps worked great and made it crucial to use the right squad for the right job. I felt like a real commander when I managed to take out an mg position with only my men. The AI is smart enough but there are times they get stuck etc. Other than that the game is great both visually and gameplay, and the sound is also very good in this game. There are parts in the game where you get stuck and makes you really frustrated but you just have to keep trying. Worth the buy if you are really in to both fps game or strategy games, but also if you are interested in ww2 since you can learn alot more about the d-day campain.			"

												Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is a game-changer first-person shooter that introduces a tactical element into the FPS genre. BiA spoiled me for years on FPS games since I began to crave control of squads in a tactical environment. FPS gamers should certainly tryout the BiA series to experience a new tactical play versus the typical run-and-gun game.			"

												Hill 30 is a great game, if you're into that sorta thing. This is definitely not meant to be fast-paced run and gun type shooter. Gameplay is much slower and more methodical than games such as Call of Duty, commanding and leading a couple teams of soldiers. The characters have great dynamics, interacting and bantering with hilarious dialogue. People die in war, and after a while of playing with these characters and watching them die I genuinely felt like crap. It's a pretty immersive game for the most part, except for some rough spots where the game just decides to crap on you. If you want, after a few deaths in the same spot the game offers to heal up your squad so you can get through the mission, but it's entirely optional. All in all a pretty good game.5/5 would experience again			"

												Buying the box edition of this, I rammed that CD into my computer as fast as I could when I first bought this game. It combines the first person shooting of the time with basic tactical combat of cover and flanking. The gameplay is more realistic, you're not going to be sniping people from across a map with the basic guns. Rather you flank and manuever your team to take out the unfortunate enemy. If you want to play an engaging, somewhat realistic WWII shooter which allows you to really control the action, give it a shot. The sequal is even better so you can for sure skip to that one for more content, but I still love the original.			"

												Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30The first of a 3-way game for pc, and ofcourse the least graphically game of the 3.The game really is all about tactical placement and attack. 1.Find your enemy, 2.Fix it, 3.Flank it, 4.kill it.To me it doesnt have the wow factor, but then again i already played it once when it came out on playstation.It is a game from 2005 and from the creators of ""Gearbox"" so a bit old.Make a genre on steam with Classic's or just BIA, cuz thats where this one belongs.Things i like about the game:- Not expensive (Bought the whole package) BIA road to hill 30, Earned in Blood, Hells Highway.- Tactical advantage by placing squads into the right positions.- Story Mode with 101st Airborne Division Sergeant Matt Baker on D-day Normandy.- Historical CorrectnessThings that i didn't like:- Aiming, long distance aiming is hard even when your perfectly lined up for a headshot.(im not a noob;)- Walking, there's no way you can run/sprint. (however the missions arent that big either)- Installation Problems, after i installed the game it was all in german.Searched for solutions and eventually found it. i will explain more about what i did below.- Some encounters with AI cant be done tactically, you just have to take the initiative to take them on yourself. just get real close.I do recommend the game, but only because i wanted to relive the story once more.and it was cheap at the time.How to fix/solve your game language problems?First try Right click on your game>properties or features im not sure ;p, then go language in the above tab, and change.ORGo to ""Steam\steamapps\common\Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30\System""Search for ""Default.ini"". Brothers in Arms configs file.Search for a line under ""engine.engine""  language=detchange language=det to language=int.Hope this helped,Greetings Rdx			"

The game enforces you to suppress and flank the enemy, do this carefully and you'll get a good hang on the game.Definetly for WWII fans and those who want to see Normandy during WWII and how infantry fighting was.There are some vehicles which you can use:  M5 Stuart and M4 Sherman.

												Brother’s in arms Road to hill 30 is the first game created under the BIA franchise.  Oddly I played Earned in Blood before I played this game. There is virtually nothing different between this and the sequel. Combat feels extremely shallow, it’s like rainbow six and call of duty 2 had a baby and decided to call it Brothers in Arms. The squad play is there and the WWII feel is there, but the gun battles are atrociously boring. The story is top notch and the voice acting is very convincing. If you like story-time FPS games, you’ll really enjoy this game. If you’re the COD4+ generation that loves senseless shooting nonstop don’t even bother wasting your time.			"

												Quality small-squad tactical FPS, easily the best of the trilogy, but I got tired of listening to grown men pontificate about the meaning of life while overly-dramatic trumpet music blared in the background. We get it; ""war is hell"", now STFU and do your job already. Yeesh!			"

Besides Call of Duty 2, this was one of the first war FPS games I played as a kid.I remember all the characters, the story and the animation. What a terrific game.Rather then your typical run-and-gun, this focuses on commanding a squad, using suppressions and flanks to defeats waves of enemies.Pretty fun still, but kind of out-dated and tedious.8/10 "

												Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30 is a first person, squad based shooter, set in WW2.STORYI don't really know what people are talking about when they say things like ""Wow, this game changed my perspective on FPS games"" or ""This story's amazing"". The story's damn near non-existant. It's basically a bunch of levels that are cobbled together in a linear path. I played the game when I was around 13. The first opening sequence was quite extreme and shocking back then. But the main reason was that I had never really watched war movies or seen anything remotely hardcore. Now that I have... it just left me feeling nothing. Most characters are random and also pointless. There's also ludonarrative dissonance. The game's point is that war is hell, casualties are plenty and it's a huge struggle. In the gameplay, your squad can die and resurrect by the next mission. Same characters, same names. It's like nothing happened. Also, even in the narrative portions of the game (which are few and far between) no one really gets killed. I can remember 4 deaths in total. There's also another thing... I never gave a damn about anyone. The start of the game shows the last level of the game (the best part of it as well) and it just expects me to still get emotionally attached. It's like showing you how you can get your hand burned on the stove, yet it still wants you to put your hand on the hot stove.The voice acting ranges from annoyingly awful to above average. The best example is Baker, the main character. He delivers some lines pretty well and some lines really well. The more annoying one is Leggett. The voice actor tries to put in emotion and it just ends up being on the level of a hilariously bad teen drama. Just awful. GAMEPLAYThe main portion of the game consists of you commanding up to two squads with up to three members in each of them. The game expects you to use one squad to supress the enemy while you either send or go with the other squad to take them out with either just rushing them or flanking them. What it actually boils down to is you running around the enemy thanks to their awful AI and conveniently placed walls on the sides of the battlefield. It all boils down to: 1) Spot enemy squad. 2) Set squad(s) to cover(s) 3) Wait for full suppression 4) Sneak around them 5) Empty magazine into the enemyVery bog standard. This would be more fun if the shooting was actually good. The ADS shakes all of the time, making it already difficult to aim. But then you also get the issue of half of your shots not hitting the enemy for some reason if they're more than a close distance away. Plus, your M1 Garand won't kill an enemy in one shot... Yeah, you read that right. Even with a headshot. It's so weird. Plus, the hipfiring is probably the most unrealistic part about it all. You'll fire at the enemy and the bullet can fly upwards of 45 degrees to the side...GRAPHICS & SOUNDThe game's ugly. No other way of saying it. Even for its time, which is a long time ago, this game just looks mediocre at best and awful at worst. It's the modified Unreal 2 engine. At least it runs well.The guns sound weak. Maybe it was the purpose, but it just made the guns so boring to use. The soundtrack is very forgettable except for the main theme, which is very good. It'll haunt me for a while. DIFFICULTY The game's pretty easy. I did die a fair few times, but a lot of those were cheap deaths. Things like random instadeaths because of an LMG or something like that. It's hard to understand where the enemy can hit you. They even seem to be able to hit through some obstacles/holes that you can't hit through. But once you get used to the game, you'll find out that the game REFUSES to give you any attention as long as you try and flank the enemy. The enemy won't find it out until they instantly react to you hitting some certain point.OVERALLBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30™ (Don't forget the ♥♥♥♥ing trademark..) is a fun game that'll test your patience. I barely managed to finish it because it was just too boring and repetitive most of the time. Will I play it again? I seriously doubt it. There's nothing about it that made me interested in playing it through again.4/10(All games start at a 5/10 and move up/down based on the pros/cons)			"

												This is a series I missed when it first came out. I bought the entire pack and started with Road to Hill 30. If you're like me and don't have any nostalgia from the series, I would recommend skipping this one unless it's on sale. Even if you got it in a bundle, it's hardly worth installing.There are certain mechanics in the game that are very interesting. You have to command two fireteams while battling German infantry and the odd tank through the fields and towns of Normandy. Suppression is very important and this is a mechanic I liked. It wasn't easy to shoot and it's very difficult to snipe heads poking out of cover like in most other games. This is on purpose, and forces you to try and flank your enemy. Some levels start behave as puzzles as you figure out the best way to move your squad.But in the end, this game has aged badly. In 2006 it may have been great, but by today's standards it's all very dull. The writing is cliche and awful. The voice acting is bad. The story is completely unengaging. I won't judge this game by its graphics, since that would be unfair. But the environments are boring. You spend half the time ducking behind the same hedgerows and mounds of dirt. The towns are empty and lifeless, and the battles are quiet and not very exciting. The game of suppress and flank starts to get tedious after the first few levels.By the last few chapters I was raring to get this game over with so I could just uninstall it. If you've never played Brothers in Arms before, I would recommend skipping this one unless you really have time to kill. I'm looking forward to moving on to the sequel - I'm hoping they've made improvements.			"

												Played this back in the day on PS2 and by god has it not aged well. Mostly in the gameplay. The reppetition would be more managable, but playing this on normal and still not being able to shoot a guy a foot infront of me is infuriating when that's kind of the one tactic in this game, surpress, flank, kill, relies on me being the one to kill the enemy.Currently stuck on the second Tank mission, and back when I had this on PS2 I got all the way to Hill 30 itself, and I can't say I feel the need to bash my head against this anymore. If you feel like you can, or just want to play this for completions sake, then it might be worth a go.Here's hoping the other two built on the ideas of this one to much less vexing experiance. "

												Imagine my thumb pointed straight to the side for this one. The concept, atmosphere, and gameplay fundamentals are great - certain levels make you feel like you're seconds from being overwhelmed by German soldiers, and good art design helps distract you from the game's age.There are too many technical issues, though. It's not a difficult game in terms of the tactics you use. When you make mistakes in leading your squad, your losses are earned, but when questionable level design and bad botpathing mean your squad gets chewed up because they go somewhere you never intended, it's just frustrating. The difficulty spikes you come up against aren't because the game's too hard, they're because you must play through a map where your squad's A.I. is plagued with bad pathfinding. In fact, I find the broader, more complicated maps are done very well, while the simpler, tighter maps will find your squad regularly running to the wrong side of a wall and getting cut to pieces. I like difficulty when it's part of the design. I don't like having to fight a game to make it work properly.It's a phenomenal game when it works, but you'll come up against a few levels that so badly implement the gameplay that playing through turns from a joy into a chore.

												This game is all about tactical, it's a good playstyle, but the only tact is FLANK, nothing eles, no smoke, no stealth, This only tact, unfortunately, sucks too, there are only few situations can fits the FLANK tact, because the battlefield is llinear and ill-design, sometime all you can do is shoot emeny to die from cover. Even you have the chance to flank, it still risky because ridiculous accuracy make you outgunned by emeny, Even successful flank and kill them, you may got serious damage too, because emeny is deadly even been fully suppressed in later stage.  And all of this are not the worst part, the worst is AI, the teammate AI is stupid as hell, dumb reaction, stay outside the cover, bad pathing, thus easily got killed. Coop with AI is all the gunplay works in this game, but the AI sucks, how can you experience a good teamworks with this dumbass AI.			"

												This game has not aged well at all and I’m starting to wonder if it was even good at release. The AI in this game is some of the worst I have ever seen, the pathfinding is horrendous, your squad runs around like headless chicken most of the time it gets really annoying. The enemy ai gets really annoying too especially the mg42 where it will instantly kill you without it even being pointed at you, there was a moment where I was behind an mg42 and the bullets do a 180 to hit you, it’s really bad. There is no consequence for your squad dieing because they get revived the next mission. The game has this very low budget feel to it making it hard to get immersed in the game. The game was released in 2005 but we had Half-Life 2, F.E.A.R, Doom 3 and Call of Duty 1 released before this game and you can’t even compare the difference in quality because it’s too massive. The story and the voice acting is the only thing that saves this game from being awful. The voice acting is very well done and the story is just ok. It failed at getting me emotionally invested to the characters because there isn’t much development to them and there wasn’t much plot progression or really any significant events that take place throughout the story, only a few. There are some pretty cool missions like defending the church but they are too few and far between all of the mediocre gunplay. Thankfully it is a pretty short game.4/10 (Mediocre)			"

												it's not bad, but I would say brothers in arms franchise do not live upto classic call of duty nor medal of honor standard. Let me begin with good aspect of the title. The music is great. The writings aren't bad. The recoil and shooting experience actually feel very authentic. Not a dead-right-on accuracy, but less accurate iron sight gives an impressive remark. and that's about it. While it is trying very hard to impress and attach emotions to chracters, it feels too short to be attached. I feel like I was more attached to chracters in call of duty like Pvt Elder when stealing a car. He died the next mission? dang I liked that guy. Poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Here, a pop-up screen of your soldier bleeding and smashed face shown time to time when they are injured and about to die. Then big cross mark on the pic if he is dead. Welp, that's too bad. Didn't feel much other than NPC supporter. The mission designs are too linear. I do appreciate how dev developed suppressing fire and morale system have developed, but they should have not used it as a core mechanic. For almost all missions, you order your men to suppress an enemy behind cover, and you get to become a hero by flanking and kill the rest of enemies. Or send other squad to flank them. Because dev wanted to force players to use flanking tactic, you will very less likely to snipe enemies from cover. The game actually prevents you from doing it unless there are only one or two enemies left. Also you are on the offense side most of the time. Enemies on defense will very less likely to move out of cover or even try to reposition. They will wait to be flanked. The movement feels like you are stuck in the ground as if you are dragging a 10lb chain along with you or something. The terrains are pretty much flat. Very little variation in hills. Not much of indoor battles which is very different design from medal of honor and call of duty. Sure it is not like shootem up style, more focused on tactic, but there should have been more tactic other than flanking.			"

												Personal Rating: 2 of 10Overly simple FPS with a little bit of tactical gameplay. This is basically a WW2 themed FPS but each combat can be planned by scouting the area and planning your approach. Sounds good and looking good with the screenshots? Unfortunately it is not but rather disappointing.The dialogue is really lame like a conversation about what the German soldiers had for breakfast. Not funny and terrible. The dialog and voice acting naration by the main character made him sound whiny. The characters don't seem angry, afraid, agitated, motivated or anything at all.Weapon aiming is terrible. The game started with crosshair display set to off and I think I know why. Because aiming without looking down the iron sight is so much better. Either way, ammo projectile don't fire within the crosshair area but it gives you more view without zooming down the iron sight. Maybe it is how rifles and pistols work back in the day but it really gets on your nerve after you spam the entire clip missing every bullet. Reloading changes the entire clip so remaining ammo is discarded.Enemy A.I. is simple. Each battle, I simply run beside/flank them and take them off close range. Its much more effective his way really. Maybe it works for the first few chapters but no matter because my patient ran out sooner.Now in the screenshot of the game made each battle seems engaging. This is simply a matter of angle the shot was taken. The maps are bare minimal. Each chapter is so short that the map might be smaller than a CS:GO map. There is only 1 route to take and it is blocked off with 2-D grasses or trees most of the time. Reaching a combat area, are some trees, branches, fences and probably a building. That is literally it. Imagine a flat area with a few props placed ""strategically"" for enemies to appear and how you can flank them. You cannot heal during chapter but automatically rearmed and back to business on the next chapter.You can give orders to the squad mate following you but their deaths are permanent I think. Honestly, the story is so badly written I could not care less for these mates. They are simply there to be cannon fodder or distract enemies. Orders are issued by right clicking and directing them to another location. Depending on where the destination lands, action will automatically be executed such as taking cover, mounting the machine gun and etc. You can also get them to focus fire and supress the enemies as indicated with an icon over their head. Supressed enemies fires with a longer interval so you have more window.All these I pressed on to play since people are claiming the story is good. The final straw is when I threw a grenade and it probably landed few feet away. I moved out from my cover to throw a second one to find it landing in front of 2 enemies covering behind 2 pieces of wooden fence with legs and torse obviously visible since the fence does not cover entirely from ground up. The grenade explodes without dealing any damage to the enemy.So why the 2 in the score? For such an old game it actually supports native 1080 resolution.			"

												Gameplay may be solid, although it is repetitive, I found the storytelling unappealing. It basically consists of the main character explaining his thoughts and feelings through narration as opposed to seeing him interact with his squadmates which in turn would establish relationships with other characters while simultaneously showing us how the protagonist is feeling as the game's story progresses. Since I found the storytelling in this game to be incredibly lazy I had a difficult time becoming invested in thre story so in turn it is hard for me to recommend this game,			"

												I am not a fan of this format for an FPS. I found the squad manipulation painfully tedious; suppress, flank, wash, rinse, repeat. Trying to smartly move your teams while under mortar fire was even more tedious. Then there was getting your tank to maneuver on enemy armor - flat out aggravating.This game is so mechanically driven that I found myself not enjoying it - not even the satisfaction of completion was enough to make want to ever touch this title again.The extra attention on cinematics and the storyline was also excessive; it seemed to simply interfere with the gameplay.

												The whole game (series) is based on the same principle: flanking. So the idea is your aim is deliberately extremely poor and you have to give orders for your squad to create cover fire while you go around the buildings or whatever to shoot the enemy in the back.The idea is boring and terribly repetitive and it's a very bad FPS, with all the mistakes a bad FPS could make: you can miss a shot even if the crosshair is on target, bad gameplay feel and viewport, clumsy controls, very bad map hit boxes, small obvious maps without any surprises...I really wanted to play a WW2 FPS, was bitterly disappointed.

												My nostalgia got ruined by playing this game again. I first played it back when it came out in early 2005, and I remembered the game all of these years and decided to get it again, with all of the BiA games.It turns out that this situation is where the nostalgia was better than the actual game (to be honest, that doesn't actually occur as often as people think it does). Back when I first played it, I was a big WW2 game buff, way more than I am now. I think that's the biggest reason why I had such good memories of it.But later that year, Call of Duty 2 came out, and looking back (and even looking at right now, since I've played CoD 2 again recently), that game is much better. Out of all of the WW2 games that I've played (and played again recently), I have to say that BiA: Road to Hill 30 has disappointed me now. I loved the Medal of Honor and Call of Duty series about 2007 or 2008 and before. I do NOT like the CoD or MoH series after those years.My favorites are Call of Duty 2, Medal of Honor: Allied Assault, and Call of Duty: World at War. Turns out that I enjoy all of them more than I do this game.To go into more detail on the game itself, I mostly remembered the characters and what happens, who dies. The game is known for being very historically accurate and also based on real people, but other games are very historically accurate as well. The game is often compared to Band of Brothers, but after having replayed BiA, I would rather watch or read Band of Brothers than play it. Gameplay-wise, the mechanics are rather bad, really, especially in comparison to other games released at the time, especially of CoD 2 which was the exact same year. I snuck up behind soldiers many times in the game and shot them in the face, and they didn't die. Some soldiers I shot point-blank about 5 times before they died.I can't tell if the mechanics are just from running it on a modern machine or not. I was able to run on Windows 8.1 with no problem whatsoever, no extra installations or settings needed. I also downloaded the popular group of mods for the game, which you can find the forums easily. I would recommend them if you do play.But honestly, the only thing that struck me was the cutscenes of the characters dying, because I remembered them dying the exact same way. Those scenes stuck with me, because you are with the same people the whole game, mostly. But in terms of the overall environment or progression through the game, it actually didn't feel as life-like as some of the other better WW2 games.It turns out that my own nostalgia overrated the game.

												I got a couple of missions in and this is probably one of the worse WW2 shooters to come out of this time. The sound design undermines everything about the game because its just so bad. Voice actors who can't deliver lines with enthusiasm and just come off as a guy talking in a sound studio. Guns that sound ridiculously bad with no oomph with them. These are huge issues. Try to play any good FPS with the sound off and tell me it dousn't effect the game.Mechanics wise its a very poor FPS. Theres no real logic behind how to hit a target or atleast it seems random most the time if shots miss or hit. Shooting with accuracy is impossible from what I have seen especially at far distances as bullets dissappear after a certain distance traveled or atleast it seems like it. Its easier just to run up and hit people or shoot them from feet away.  Your freindly AI have as much trouble, but unlike you their bullets don't just stop existing after a set travel distance. Controls are pretty sucky and overly fluid like aswell but you can get used to them. The game wants you to flank every single time just about and theres pretty much one way to do that right in an area....which isn't fun. Its repatitive and drawn out.Its really more of a strategy game where you command troops to attack, defend, and flank essentially, in order to remove Krauts from the area. Unfortunately its not a good strategy game either. Freindly AI have a tendency to get themselves killed randomly and in incredible ways. Even if you tell them to follow you, their pathing might lead them face first into a squad of Germans or a grenade. Men Of War titles are far far superior RTT/Strategy games of this style. Part of the reason is that in this game you have to worry about managing your stupid partners (which die for good unless you lose enough times to respawn them) and managing your own life at the same time.Its also pretty boring. The point where I stopped playing was basically you go around and hit F at a whole bunch of wooden poles in feilds until you move on to the next one. Every time you hit F you do an animation of placing a bomb and theres a bunch of them spread out. Previously to this I was doing similiar but with AA guns. This isn't fun. This is crappy game design.The story might be pretty good, but its certinatly not worth wading through sewage. I bet the later games fill in perfectly well anyway.TL:DRJust play COD 1-3, Pre Modern Reboot MOH games, SOCOM PS2 games, or later BIA game (Hells Highway demo was great fun when I played it years ago) because this one just sucks. Im sure it gets ""better"" later on but the base mechanics I have seen just suck so bad that its guranteed not worth the unfun.Atleast in COD you don't have to rely on terrible AI team mates who need babysitting.The whole time playing this is just thought about what better games I could play that involved AI squad mates and you as the leader. Then I realised I wasn't having fun with this soggy POS and uninstalled it.			"

												Wow just wow...I mean I never thought i would play a game so ""authentic in my  life. As stunning and brave srgnt baker you  will lead a squad of the best that the resource center has to offer, fully armed with m1 garands and thompsons that cant hit♥♥♥♥♥♥ Use stunning tactics such as flank, flank, and flank and dominate the germans with your squad that has the shooting abilities of helen keller. looking for a great singleplayer game? well look no further as brothers in arms has taken one step further since their is no multiplayer and your squad has the combat ability of a class of third graders leaving you with the joy of mowing  down all the germans all by yourself.  Unlock extras as well which include pictures of stuff you dont care about and vaction photos from the developers. the game is based on a ture story so you know its gotta be good because just those words alone make it an awesome game. the game also includes a total of 6 (thats 4 away from 10) guns that were expertley reconstructed to look like they were props for the little people big world show on abc.did I mention you can flank.for the love of god dont buy this game buy call of duty united offensive or medal of honor airborne			"

												This game is so bad because of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ washed down AI and cheap deaths.The enemies will target specifically you and only you and never your squad distracting them so the concept and gameplay basis of flanking and tactics can go straight out the window.Youll be begging for your squad to suppress the enemy when they all can say after 3 or so shots ""I cant hit them sarge"" even if they have a clear LOS just because of a barbed wire counts as a wall hit box and only certain points are considered cover and windows.Your men follow orders really poorly since they cant shoot or they get snagged especially when they dont even act as good distractions since all the gunfire will be shot towards you and never them.Might as well play one man army in this game which is impossible but more concievable then trying to get your team to follow you.The enemy knows your location every step and for even on easy which i tried to see the difference its still also hard just a difference of 5 more hits from rifles in your health bar it doesnt matter since the enemy also throws grenades and machine gun nests are 1 hit kills in any difficulty.You cant even run or sneak for tactical elements when the situation demands it no its slow walking BS which counts as your running speed. Getting from cover to cover feels like a game of luck than tactics.The weapons are even more better not aimed down the sights because the sights jump around all the damn time.The glitches like enemies disappearing and reappearing as you can see a floating rifle up close to say hello and shoot you in the face for a free hit.Your guys will lag and shoot and say ""I cant hit em sarge"" over and over even when you give orders to advance and then shoot they still wont follow the only time they will follow is when there are no enemies around you.Yet they can still get snagged and by myself i can do just as bad with them like theres no difference.Speaking of snagging characters when you complete a mission when theres multiple dialog characters pray that the game works in your favor that it starts the end level dialog for the next frustrating level of glitches and bad game AI.The settings in the controls are bugged they dont come in preset you must do it or you can be stuck and that sucks.The best thing about it is (sarcastic) You must do it every single level as it will go back to its default not configured setting after a level and when you shut off the game. The crap graphics are also not original but worse i seen the ps2 version and i can say it was a much better game even with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI there are no glitches in the ps2 version.The game is not even easy on easy it feels the same on hard because getting hit by rifle fire is rare but everything from MGs, Anti tank weapons, grenades and surprise assaults will always target you and not your men my men never got hit and i am the one doing most of the flanking work.As soon as my face was exposed to the flank all enemies are pointing guns in my direction when i was supposed to be sneaking around them.The enemies take like 3 to 5 rifle shots to kill not 1 not 2 but 3 or more no matter what difficulty and smgs forget them they suck at range even if they are useful in close range you cant flank around.In all this game sucks to the core in every aspect besides concept of being a squad leader but executed so damn poorly it deserves to be forgotten as its a disgrace to live on the same planet as the same people who tried to get a cashgrab out of this awful game.I didnt want to bash this game for all the fans out there of this franchise but sorry you might have played the ps2 version. I saw the mostly positive feedback and stuff about this game also feeling nostalgic but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ when i played this again it just reminded me of how hard i raged and now even more so with glitches up the pc's versions♥♥♥♥♥ruined almost all of my ps2 days memories.Good things are: Concept ... and thats it what else ?Bad things are: Gameplay, Realism, Difficulty, AI, Mechanics, Controls, Graphics, Story, Checkpoints, Enemy difficulty, unfair situations, Weapon damage, Walking speed, Bugs, Vague objectives and everything else besides the concept of the squad leader thing.This game should be a 0/10 It will just make your day really bad. ♥♥♥♥ THIS GAME !!!

												Not a bad game, but not a good game either. It jumps between FPS and RTS in the middle of battle and I have to admit it's fairly fluid, but the wonky controls, the faulty AI, and the bad voice acting really put a damper on the whole experience. And while it doesn't do any of the RTS or FPS sections poorly, it all seems fairly washed out and generic.			"

												I got Road to Hill 30 after playing Hell's Highway to completion on my PS3, and boy are there significant differences. My biggest issues with Road to Hill 30 stem from the game design, so if your the kind of person that sees ""classic"" and ""old"" as meaning ""timeless,"" you should probably ignore this recomendation.Aiming reliably is a huge pain, to the extent that I found myself relying on my AI squad. Trouble is, the squad AI is so dumb it will walk in front of bullets, throw gernades at your legs, and take cover right on explosives. If you don't do your best to lock your team down, they will freely walk in front of you during a firefight. You can try to coordinate stratigicly through a special top-down mode, but this mode is unreliable for doing more than getting your bearings.I have rarely so noticed the absence of any ability to stick to cover or sprint. Hell's Highway has both these things, in addition to better aiming, and the severe loss of freedom I felt as I tried despirately to manuver in Road to Hill 30 is so bad its almost funny.In the absence of good controls or gameplay, the story has to pick up the slack. Unfortunitely, I knew going into this that I probably wasn't going to like the story. WW2 and the endless massacre of the mostly-white soldiers bores me to death at this point. In other games, the tired WW2 cliches are often mixed up by the introduction of new elements, such as the alternate timeline of the new Wolfenstien. Road to Hill 30 is a full-on historical drama, however, so expect no mercy for non-enthusiasts.At the end of the day, you'll probably like this game if you like WW2. Trouble is, Hell's Highway has better gameplay. You will miss out on some of the story if you skip ahead (these games are a fully realized drama, after all), but such is the cost of fun.			"

												I meant to buy Borthers in Arms: Hell's Highway. TOTALLY brought the wrong game! It's standard fair for a WWII FPS before they were all streamlined with regenerating health and ADS gameplay; however Hell's Highway is a much more polished version of this game so I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to learn of how to make an old school WWII shooter. But if that were the case I would tell you to play Medal of Honor: Rising Sun before slapping you and asking you why would would want to make a game like that.On an unrelated note, Medal of Honor: Rising Sun has an automatic weapon in the game that sounds like a perpetually farting machine; no reason to bring that up other than to show how far along we've come in game design and polish. Should probably also give you a good idea of how dull this game is: So dull that I would rather talk about other WWII games that haven't aged well. Don't buy it.			"

												I honestly don't get everyone going on about how amazing this game is, particularily how realistic it is.. because it's far, far from it. If you're looking for a realistic WWII shooter, don't even touch this game.Sometimes this game is easy.. but when it's hard, it's what I call ""artificial difficulty"". That is, difficulty due to poorly implimented and/or repetative actions, or difficulty due to bad design.The checkpoint save system is annoying. It doesn't add challenge to the game. It forces you to re-do the same easy, mundane parts over and over to get past the one odd difficult part. I just spent 10 minutes taking on a pair of Panzer IVs. Tanks in this game are a joke.. find rocket, shoot it ad infinum until it blows up. A Panzer IV should be shredded by a single Panzerfaust. I wouldn't have an issue with the liberties taken here if I could see a point to it, but there isn't any. It isn't ""difficult"" getting rid of tanks, just time consuming (once you get your squad somewhere where they won't get mowed down). After I killed the one tank, another appears. Wash, rinse, repeat. Then a squadmate kills me with a grenade. Thanks, bro. Checkpoint? 10+ minutes earlier before I dispatched the tanks. That's not difficulty. That's not a challenge. That's tedious. And moments like that happen numerous times throughout the game. Actually, come to think of it, this game is very repetative overall. Every chapter plays out almost the exact same way with slightly different scenary.The small maps are atrocious. This game is suppose to be about maneuver and flanking, yet many, many times the maps design is such that it feels like a railed cover shooter more than anything else. Your squad AI is so stupid you end up spending more time babysitting them to make sure they don't do something dumb and get killed than actually PLAYING the game. Many of the maps are too small to actually maneuver realistically, and winning becomes a matter of ""gamey"" tactics. If you want a game with tactics, play Combat Mission.And the story? Uh.. what story? Maybe it's because I've actually read Band of Brother by Ambrose I'm finding this game incredebly light on the story. I don't give a hoot about any of the characters. Nothing makes me want to like them. If you want the story of the 101st in Europe, go read the book or watch the movies. They're both more entertaining and much heavier on the story than this game.I can forgive the issues I have with the game because of the technology at the time it was developed. But frankly this just isn't that good of a game. I think a lot of people let the content simply colour their ratings.			"

												Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 was the beginning of one of the best World War 2 shooter franchises in history. Great characters and action keep this game unique from all the other WW2 shooters out there. This game feels so authentic, and it's probably due to the recreated locations and the stellar voice acting. The squad tactics in this game can get a little annoying due to dumb AI every now and then, but overall, it's not really a hassle. This game actually takes strategy, as you'll more than likely have to flank and suppress your enemies at every encounter. Health doesn't regenerate either, so you'll have to stay behind cover. Well, enough talk, here's the deal: if you want a good shooter with fantastic characters, story, and gameplay, get Brothers in Arms. Now. Best WW2 franchise out there.			"

												Buyer Beware: The PC vanilla version has very glitchy friendly AI that will not hug up to cover correclty, or will flat-out just jump into the open and get mowed down for no reason. There is a mod called Rendroc's Warzone Mod that has a plugin that fixes friendly AI to be even better than the console version. I heartily recommend you use the mod even on your first time through. Link:https://sites.google.com/site/biawarzone/(It also works for Earned in Blood)Road to Hill 30 separates itself from most WW2 games by having interesting strategy-shooter mechanics, a tighter focus on a smaller theatre, and a good amount of writing that makes you feel for the characters and their situation. The main bulk of the gameplay consists of you ordering squads around so you can outfire and outmaneuver your enemy. There's a heavy focus on suppressing enemy squads so they can't return fire, then swinging your soldiers on to the flanks to finish them off. The gameplay is challenging and engrossing, and allows the campaign to separate itself from games like CoD or MoH  by having long challenging missions that take place over realistically-sized engagement zones and against a reasonable amount of enemies. You won't be securing all of Stalingrad in eight minutes while mowing down three hundred Germans, but you'll feel even more satisfaction after liberating a small farmhouse from a defending Germany company.Another unique thing about the game is the fact that its story, while hammy in spots, is pretty engaging. Soldiers have personalities and you feel for them once the squad starts taking casualties. It's not the best out there and there's some VERY obvious cut content, but it's good to see a war game have an actual engaging story with relatable characters.			"

												The developers must have some internal property or setting that only a percentage of your shots will actually hit, even when the crosshairs are on target. Be prepared to ""spray and pray"", because aiming seems pretty useless.  While this aiming issue was apparent in Hell's Highway, it still  seemed within the realm of possibility. given the recoil on real automatic weapons.  However, in  Road To Hill 30 the aiming seems much worse and more like a defect.For example, I came out from cover right beside a couple of enemies after flankiing them, and unloaded a full Thompson mag from point blank range. One was lined up perfectly behind the other with the crosshairs center mass, yet neither one went down.This aiming problem is really too bad, as otherwise the game is pretty good-- especially for an obscure title.I haven't tried the third game yet, but hope it is more like Hell's Highway, than Road To Hill 30.If you can get this game on sale for a couple of bucks, then it is worth trying-- just be forewarned that you will be fighting WW2 with the marksmanship skills of a blind, drunk guy with a degenerative nerve condition..

												This game is great I would recommend that you get it. I only played 40 mins of this and I already love it the music is great the squad system is a new way to play fps which I absolutely love (this is a little bit of a rant for other reviews)   The hotbox are not broken it's the iron sites (scuse the spelling as well to lazy to fix it) they said that they want to make the guns as realistic as possible and they don't want it to be like cod and medal of honour, they want to it tell a story they want it to make you feel like your in WW2 not some game where you have stupid jet packs and MLG FAZE CLAN TRICK SHOTS 2015.Plus the game wants you to flank them or suppress them. the rant is over now. Ok let's get back on track, there's nothing I hate about this game nothing at all I think this is a very solid game for its age I would give it a 10/10 IGN. The multiplayer may be shutdown but the campaign is what speaks to me. It's a must buy if you want rich story's and great atmosphere. Also I've read some reviews saying there's some ""game breaking"" glitchs but I haven't ran into any of them yet so I think it might be fixed I don't know these reviews i read where YEARS ago.			"

												The game is good.. I mean really good.  You play as the squad leader of an elite airborne division.  There is a good balance of tactics and that ""keep your head down"" WWII shooting that I loved since I played the first Call of Duty.  This is not a Call of Duty game though.  If you are expecting to be supressed with the deafening sound of gunfire and mortars exploding around you as you run from cover to cover, you might be dissapointed.  This is a great game and it does well to capture the spirit of WWII, but you command a small airborne squad.  So instead of raiding the beaches of Normandy or trying your best to keep the overwhelming German forces out of stalingrad, you are behind enemy lines raiding small towns and ultimately making your way to Hill 30, where you will repel a German counter attack against all odds.

												This is a long lost World War II training simulation given new life in a computer game. This simulation demonstrates the top-secret United States suppression flanking maneuver. America single-handedly kicked the asses of the Germans in small-scale infantry skirmishes by practicing the newly invented 'suppress the bad guy then run up to him from the side and shoot him in the face' tactic. Despite the attempts of the Nazis to counter this tactic (the 'squadron in box formation' technique they came up with worked for only a small amount of time, confusing the hunks in U.S. uniforms before they realized they could still do what they were doing), they were overrun with only minimal effort and manpower on the part of the Allies.

												Oh no, another WWII based shooter!Well this game isn't bad and should be played.Based on a true story, set during the famous airdrop before the invasion at Normandy, where Sgt. Matt Baker and his squad of 101st Airborne Paratroopers are scattered over the French countryside.There are 20 chapters to play through and with the action and story, you'll really want to know whats going to happen next.Controls are easy enough for anyone who has played FPS on PC but it does have a little bit a getting used to. Why? Because player not only controlling Baker, but the squad thats with him. Player control two fire teams and can place one team to place covering and suppressing fire while Baker and the other team flanks the enemies. The game does have a tutorial build in so that player can learn to lead their brothers to victory.Music in game is the pretty standard fare of orchestral but the sound FX of the gun fire and squad members yelling at the player were so life like and is really immersive.The game just looks great as every house, plant and character are all textured wonderfully and bring the game a gritty realistic feel.The only draw back is that the team AI isn't smart enough sometimes and continually says that they can't see or shoot a target and don't move to get a better shot and sometimes gets shot and dies so the strategy part is mandatory most of the time.Really the game is fast, furious and a blast to play and the story is compelling to continue to the end.8/10			"

I recommend this game but you better be ready to be frustrated by its shortcomings...			"

												A phenomenal tactical shooter that still holds today. This game actually captures the feel of WWII combat, unlike Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, which simply are shooters set in WWII. The squad mechanics are deep yet extremely simple to learn and use, and the enemy AI is some of the best I've ever seen. The combat model is very realistic, with weapon recoil keeping the player from running and gunning most of the time. The health system is one of the most original things about the game; instead of you losing health gradually before dying, the game accumulates danger based on how close you are to an enemy firing, and when the danger reaches a certain level, you get shot and die. This mitigates much of the frustration involved with waiting for your health to regenerate, and establishes a realistic disparity between how much danger you're in engaging enemies close up and far away. The sound design is also ridiculously good, with patriotic melodies that really bring out that ""Murica"" feel to the game, and convincing weapon noises that make you feel like you're shooting a gun. I only have two problems with the game. One is that the visuals have not aged well at all, and even for 2005 this game looks meh. The other is that sometimes I found my shots being blocked by invisible cover boundaries even though I had my sights on the enemy's helmet; this is likely a contrivance designed to make the player use flanking tactics, but it was still annoying.

												This is easily one of the best and most underrated WW2 shooters ever. The tactical elements of the game were really distinctive and ahead of its time when the game was released, also. It's fairly short, but the story and characters are pretty gripping, especially for how little real character development there is for anyone not named Baker. This is basically the Band of Brothers of WW2 shooter videogames.			"

												I played BiA: Road to Hill 30 when it first came out in 2008 and really enjoyed it. Since I recently bought the BiA pack from the recent Steam sale I thought I'd revisit it before continuing on with the other two. So how well did it hold up five years later? Not well I'm afraid. The graphics haven't aged well at all but they are serviceable. Level design is pretty bland. Grasslands with a few humps are the order of the day,  My biggest issue was the gunplay.  You can be point blank range from an enemy and there's a very good chance you will miss. This goes for using the iron sights as well. I can't remember another shooter where the guns were so inaccurate. Mission variety was okay. Escort this guy, take this house, typical military mission fare. There are some positives though. The ability to control your squads is very easy and they do their job okay. The scope of the game is cinematic and the sound design is wonderful. The level protecting the church was a good time, especially since you get a scoped rifle that is very accurate.  The banter between your squad before the level starts is realistic and adds some humanity to the proceedings.  Overall, BiA gets a recommendation from me. It's a shooter that any fan of WW2 should play at least once. Welp, onto the next installment.			"

												Hill 30, for me was a interesting game as its the pivotal standpoint unto how each team member of 13 would be redefined. This story however follows that of Matt Baker, a soldier of the 101st Airborne division, whom seems out of place somewhat and lacking the experience of what is ultimately to become his role, being a leader. In this installment, he is trying to figure it all out as well as his team members in accordance to their characteristics and traits, even his own. Matt Baker seems to be quite lost within himself as well as the start of this war he has entered, which is based on a true story as depicted, so that alone to me is motivation because you follow in his footsteps of that time. Soon Baker however realizes that he will be the most trusted and relied on pillar of leadership to his men. In order to appreciate the next two installments of this game you have to play this one to understand who he is and watch/learn how he matures with experience in the fields of battle. This is a title that puts emphasis on turning boys into men. In terms of graphics, don't expect next gen, it was released in 2005 however smooth and fluid when playing with realistic sounds, npc verbal activity and interaction,great fighting action and explosive,iconic and historical places to visit on mission. The storyline and gameplay however will quickly distract you from that issue of graphical realism as its a shooter that is based on the choices you make and for you and your men, not just a simple run and gun. I highly recommend this game as its a lasting title of its class.			"

												The bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and steer the ship back home, where it sinks in a whirlpool, leaving only the Mariner behind. A hermit on the mainland had seen the approaching ship and had come to meet it with a pilot and the pilot's boy in a boat. When they pull him from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot has a fit. The hermit prays, and the Mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot's boy goes crazy and laughs, thinking the Mariner is the devil, and says, ""The Devil knows how to row."" As penance for shooting the albatross, the Mariner, driven by guilt, is forced to wander the earth, tell his story, and teach a lesson to those he meets:He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. After relating the story, the Mariner leaves, and the Wedding Guest returns home, and wakes the next morning ""a sadder and a wiser man"".			"

												First, don't let the time spent on this game fool you. The majority of this game I have spent playing offline, due to a recent internet outage, and this being one of the few steam games I had already downloaded.  Apparently Steam doesn't count offline time toward gameplay time.The game is a fun WWII Squad based FPS. Normally, I don't like squad based games. I have enough trouble keeping me alive without having to worry about different characters too. However, this was highly enjoyable! It however doesn't feel very cinematic, which for me is a downer. However, there are some minor cutscenes between chapters that help tell the story along.You can tell that Gearbox was inspired by the popular HBO series Band of Brothers(Which came out 4 years before BIA). Not just in name, but similar opening soundtrack, Similar titling colors..among other details. However, similarities aside, it's still very much it's own game, and I think has proven it's self to be one of the better WWII titles of that generation of games.The graphics are very dated, but for a 2005 game look fantastic! Likewise, the voice acting isn't too shabby either! Much better than I expected from a game from that era.Only a few negatives really, and those are: I felt default controls for me were a bit of an annoyance, but that's all changeable in the games options. A better cover system would have been nice. Yea, you can crouch behind walls/barrels/logs/ravines, but theres no Real cover system in place. That being said, Cover systems weren't common in 2005, so again...that complaint is easily forgiven.Other than that, the game is a fantastic WWII title! I'm looking forward to checking out the rest of the BIA titles.			"

What I liked about the game 	A great selection of ww2 weapons, like the Thompson, Mp40, and the Springfield rifle. The Springfield and the Bazooka are especially fun and satisfying to use.	You get rewarded medals thoughtout the campaign, which unlock bones content; like the history of WW2 and information on weapons and vehicles that were used in the game.	Good character development. 	You get to command a tank; like the M5 Stuart and the Sherman. I especially enjoyed the missions which involved the M5 Stuart tank, because it's a tank which you don't see in many WW2 games. 	Historically accurate. 	I like these certain things you can do in the game; like climbing on an axis tank and throwing a grenade inside to destroy the tank. What I disliked or was disappointed with 	The game can be frustrating sometimes, especially when the other soldiers don't follow your commands. Sometimes when you tell your squad to take cover behind a fence, they go and stand in front of it instead. The enemies towards the end are a bit overpowered, especially the ones with the Mp44. Enemies seem to be invincible when they are using the MG42 and you're not when you're using it.    I wish the game had medikits. I known the game is trying to be realistic, but sometimes that makes a less enjoyable experience.	Wasn't keen on Baker, he was a bit depressing. It's a shame you couldn't play as other squad members, like Risner. 	Shame you can't use the AA guns. 	Some of the missions are too short.     Conclusion  A good game. Something a bit different in the WW2 genre. If you like Call of Duty, Medal of Honour or tactical games like Rainbow six, you should give this game a try. 79/100  "

												This game was just as fun as it was when I was in elementary school.  Can be frustrating on higher difficulties, and the accuracy of every weapon feels like a coin toss regardless if you have your sights on an enemy.  Squad based games are very rare which is why I recommned this to anyone that likes RTS and FPS games.			"

												One of the best WW2 shooters, it offers a rare, realistic take on the conflict. With a story reminiscnet of Band of Brothers and a cover-based, squad tactics combat system, it absolutely nails the tactical WW2 FPS.			"

												I've played the XBOX version countless times but i will honestly say that it was a smoother experience on PC. The shooting, the aimming, and moving the cursor felt very crisp and smooth, The graphics are okay but nothing to complain about. The only mission that I had a problem with was ""Push into Caretan""The sequence with the panzerfaust and the 2 panzertanks made no sense. Overall this is a great game that builds ones awareness about Flanking enemies and Finishing  "

												I've been a fan of BiA since the original Xbox days, very nostalgic game for me. Amazing story, it's like playing a different take on the series 'Band of Brothers'. Still solid gameplay despite it's age. During a time when 97% of FPS's were mostly run and gun, this game made the players scout the enemy position and apply tactics to use the ""Four F's"" with your squad: ""Find, Fix, Flank, Finish"".

												First, don't let the time spent on this game fool you. The majority of this game I have spent playing offline, due to a recent internet outage, and this being one of the few steam games I had already downloaded.  Apparently Steam doesn't count offline time toward gameplay time.The game is a fun WWII Squad based FPS. Normally, I don't like squad based games. I have enough trouble keeping me alive without having to worry about different characters too. However, this was highly enjoyable! It however doesn't feel very cinematic, which for me is a downer. However, there are some minor cutscenes between chapters that help tell the story along.You can tell that Gearbox was inspired by the popular HBO series Band of Brothers(Which came out 4 years before BIA). Not just in name, but similar opening soundtrack, Similar titling colors..among other details. However, similarities aside, it's still very much it's own game, and I think has proven it's self to be one of the better WWII titles of that generation of games.The graphics are very dated, but for a 2005 game look fantastic! Likewise, the voice acting isn't too shabby either! Much better than I expected from a game from that era.Only a few negatives really, and those are: I felt default controls for me were a bit of an annoyance, but that's all changeable in the games options. A better cover system would have been nice. Yea, you can crouch behind walls/barrels/logs/ravines, but theres no Real cover system in place. That being said, Cover systems weren't common in 2005, so again...that complaint is easily forgiven.Other than that, the game is a fantastic WWII title! I'm looking forward to checking out the rest of the BIA titles.			"

												I don't know why, but I've always like WW2 / historical shooters more than sci-fi type FPS games, BIA:RtH30 is no exception either. It's dated a little which is to be reasonably expected for a game thats over 10 years old, but it's still really enjoyable. There's a decent storyline (considering how limited WW2 is in terms of plot) and has a good range of level formats. The script and voice acting are decent and the music is well composed and fittingly marshal. The AI is a little awkward at times, and the squads don't quite seem to understand what you want them to do. ""I can't shoot over there Sarge"" was a common occurrence, and I had an interesting experience with my screen rotating 90 degrees on one occasion. But its not a bad game at all. Worth picking up when its on sale. Time to try the sequels now. My score is a comfortable 7/10			"

												Great game based mainly on cover, suppressing fire, and flanking the opponent. its not really like a call of duty where you can pull rambo stunts and one man army the game, all though im sure people have done it. you're team is very usefull if used right and they are usally going to be the reasion you are able to win most of the skirmishes you come across throught the game. the game is very well put together with a solid story especially if you play the the other two! its an old game and sometimes its easy to realize that with some glitches, Graphics, and how the AI  sometimes	  function (clunky) but overall its a fantastic game and worth a shot if you have never played it!

												It was a great game when it first came out, and it's still a great game today! Highly recommend you pick this up and the two sequels if you enjoyed these growing up. Also cross your fingers that they finish the series with a 4th game instead of an HD reboot, not that an HD Reboot wouldn't be amazing.			"

What I liked about the game 	A great selection of ww2 weapons, like the Thompson, Mp40, and the Springfield rifle. The Springfield and the Bazooka are especially fun and satisfying to use.	You get rewarded medals thoughtout the campaign, which unlock bones content; like the history of WW2 and information on weapons and vehicles that were used in the game.	Good character development. 	You get to command a tank; like the M5 Stuart and the Sherman. I especially enjoyed the missions which involved the M5 Stuart tank, because it's a tank which you don't see in many WW2 games. 	Historically accurate. 	I like these certain things you can do in the game; like climbing on an axis tank and throwing a grenade inside to destroy the tank. What I disliked or was disappointed with 	The game can be frustrating sometimes, especially when the other soldiers don't follow your commands. Sometimes when you tell your squad to take cover behind a fence, they go and stand in front of it instead. The enemies towards the end are a bit overpowered, especially the ones with the Mp44. Enemies seem to be invincible when they are using the MG42 and you're not when you're using it.    I wish the game had medikits. I known the game is trying to be realistic, but sometimes that makes a less enjoyable experience.	Wasn't keen on Baker, he was a bit depressing. It's a shame you couldn't play as other squad members, like Risner. 	Shame you can't use the AA guns. 	Some of the missions are too short.     Conclusion  A good game. Something a bit different in the WW2 genre. If you like Call of Duty, Medal of Honour or tactical games like Rainbow six, you should give this game a try. 79/100  "

												Currahee 3 miles up 3 miles down!! This game's story reminds me so much of the mini series Band of Brothers. I love this game. It is a must play if you like tactical and just WWII shooters in general.			"
