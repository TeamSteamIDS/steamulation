												As with my review for Jedi Knight, Steam's version of Mysteries of the Sith has the same graphical/compatibility issues that JK does.  If you want a decent, modern, updated version of this game download the GOG version.  I don't mean to sound like I'm trash talking Steam, but if a competing company can take the same games, fix the compatibility issues and sell them for about the same price then something is wrong here.

												I used to play this game a lot when I was 8. As a kid who loved Star Wars and loved Doom, when this thing came out it was so hot. I only had the demo back then (which featured level 1) but I played that badboy about 200 times. I knew every secret and tactic there was for that level.Fuelled entirely by nostalgia, over 15 years later, I saw this for sale for 89c and pounced on it. I fired her up... It appeared stuck in windowed mode and I started to panic. When the opening cutscene finished, it went into fullscreen. Relief washed over me in an awesome wave.Suddenly, it all came rushing back to me. My hands guided me and I started moving like I knew exactly what to do... Then I realised the mouse aim was inverted and all the control bindings were odd. I fixed that up and then I was back on my feet. Even without the conscious appreciation of what I was doing, my hands and subconscious knew what to do:There is an enemy around that corner. A secret weapon can be found down there. Look up and slash that vent with your lightsaber.I was on fire. I finished the level on hard with 100% completion and no retries. Now I was in new territory. Despite the 8yo me playing level one ad nauseum, the demo had not allowed me to progress further....Help guys. I'm stuck on level 2 now and it's hard.			"

Acid trip simulator 2015Got it working properly after looking up a very easy solution to all these weirdly coloured textures being dragged across the screen. This was a rather great game, a timeless classic. I remember playing it for quite a while on my old computer back when Windows XP was quite a popular OS (RIP Windows XP, may you rest in peace sweet prince) I'll just put the link here for anyone who would like their game to run properly. Same solution works for Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1346269 "

												This is one of the best games in the Lucasarts catalogue. Mysteries of the Sith is park of the Dark Forces series, which usually starred Kyle Katarn but in this you play as Mara Jade later on which is a nice change. One of the main reasons I enjoy this a bit more than the previous standalone Kyle Katarn installments is because it feels different, not a copy paste entry. Mara is on a mission to find Kyle and it seems that he has fallen to a less than light path. The latter levels add an eerie element, as you traverse through Sith laced catacombs, which is a welcome change and it's always intresting when the lore of the Sith is included in a game. I've not personally played a game that's really focused on that and gave off a slightly spooky feeling, since the first time you land on Korriban in the amazing Knights of the Old Republic I.The weapon roster is fun, Mara's Jedi powers are enjoyable to play and we see parts of the SW universe not seen before. I have replayed this game so many times when I was younger and still come back to it. Also...purple lightsabre wooo!			"

												Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith some say a classic in the Jedi Knight series, while others may have forgotten it as just a expansion for Dark Forces 2. (Played between 2013 and Early 2014) I may have not played this game during its release but even playing it recently I had respected the old visuals, in order to enjoy the fun experiences of each level. The levels in this game are very diverse, you never spend two missions in the same location with the same playstyle. This game was also unique the the franchise other than Jedi Knight: Academy in the fact you don't play as Kyle Katarn the whole time. Switching between characters was a nice and I really enjoyed the different gameplay from each character. Mara Jade's missions gave something new to the series, as you play in very different settings against foes who normally only appear for a short time in the other games. This game is rather short, being only 14 levels but with each of these levels not playing like the next. I would definitely recommend this game if you have played the other Jedi Knight's and enjoyed them, and don't mind playing with an older generation's graphics. A few closing statements are beware the cutscenes are only in one resolution, while the rest of the game can handle any resolution. Also you must be open to a more challenging game where fighting may be less advanced in terms of keys, but is way harder then the newer games. (Played on Jedi Master)If anyone has any other questions or concerns don't hesistate to add me i'll be happy to answer them!			"

												+Excellent level design+Lengthy for an expansion pack-Compatibility issues-Storyline and voice actingStarting out Mysteries of the Sith, I really wasn't sure I was going to finish it. I had completed Jedi Knight back in its day, and decided it would be fun to revisit the gameplay via this expansion pack. (On a personal note, I feel it's deeply frustrating to play through a 1998 expansion pack with the length of the average full-priced game of today, since nowadays the best we can hope for is a 3-hour story DLC for $15. Oh how the times change.)The game's age was the first thing I noticed - blocky, pixelated character models and textures, complete lack of AI, the strange inability to change the inverted mouse look - and it's admittedly offputting. Spending hours configuring the game to be playable on my system didn't help either (see the Notes below).Despite all of this, Sith is a deeply engaging experience. This is based on a few key factors.One is its level design, which not only holds up well despite its age, but is actually smarter and far more interesting than the majority of shooters released today. For one thing, the levels are enormous. Sith is the antithesis of the corridor shooter that was so popular back in the 90's. Every level has you exploring what feels like a real place – a Hutt palace, a mining facility, a spaceport – whatever the case may be, the level design feels congruent throughout, like a fully realized location instead of a series of shooting galleries. It is a linear game, true, but the way forward often loops back on itself and isn't always apparent, even very frequently hidden, requiring the use of a HUD map to find it. In fact, since I'm used to never having any problems figuring out where to go in a linear shooter, I forgot about the map feature and got stuck a few times – this is the effect of being spoon fed by modern gaming design. Since you play as a Jedi with the ability to use the Force to jump very high and very fast, there is also a truly remarkable verticality to the maps, requiring the player to look carefully up and down for the next area, using a combination of Force powers to access it. By today's standards, I often found myself thinking I had found a secret, when in fact I had just found the correct way to advance. I actually missed most of the actual secrets in the game, which is a testament to its brilliance in design.Another very important positive for Sith is its combat. While I initially thought the first level a bit bland, I was suddenly low on health, trying to scrape by each conflict with lots of quicksaving. Soon after, I found myself facing a giant rotating fan I had to pass through in order to proceed, and since the player has to take damage to get through, I was forced to backtrack to find a health pack. This was the first in a series of lessons that taught me that careless combat, even on the normal difficulty, gets quickly punished. This is still an FPS of the run-and-gun variety, similar to Quake II, but a player still needs to be careful when moving through - ambushes abound, and especially considering the verticality of the maps, you'll have dudes shooting missles into your face from out of sight high above. The AI isn't too sharp, but the enemies are quick, very aggressive, and all deal high damage, which means you can lose half or more of your health within seconds if one of them gets the jump on you. Frequent quicksaving alleviates some of the difficulty, though the curve isn't balanced – the second level in particular is by far the hardest in at least the first two-thirds of the game (not only in combat, but also navigation and puzzle solving), while the last few levels see another spike in toughness. Still, that's the 90's for you.Other aspects of the game are less successful – the lightsaber is next to useless for blocking shots, which is disappointing, but does force you to play the game like a shooter instead of just standing there deflecting blaster bolts like the sequel allowed you to do. The force powers are underpowered, clumsy to use, and not really necessary, save for the jump. The storyline feels less epic than the other games in the series, and as a whole, falls pretty flat. The voice acting is weak and the cutscenes are rendered in game, and are clearly not the focus of the developer's time, inserted minimally to advance the plot and the player to the next (awesome) location.I reviewed Mysteries of the Sith since it's the one I played recently, but honestly, the things I have said could almost certainly be applied word-for-word to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, and thus I would still recommend both today. I am not particularly a fan of 90's shooters, but this is a game that really did get it right.Anyone born after 1995 will still probably think it's a piece of crap though.7/10Compatibility issues:This is not a Windows 7 or 8-friendly game. The .exe should be run in Compatibility mode for Windows XP Service Pack 3 to even get it to start. Running it through Steam's Play button for whatever reason puts the entire game in a windowed mode, but clicking the .exe file itself to start gets rid of the problem. 3D acceleration to make the game look and run smoothly can only be used by downloading a .dll file available online (check the Steam forums for its location), but even then, this is only apparently fully compatible with Windows 7. Windows 8 users such as myself do not get the luxury of having a HUD when using 3D acceleration, and selecting force powers also makes the screen go black and thus the game unplayable. So the only option available for Windows 8 is disabling hardware acceleration as well as the Backbuffer in System Memory – this latter option improves frame rate for a short time until it crashes the game. In any case on any system, higher resolutions will immediately crash the game. I had to run at 1024x768 in software rendering mode to get 25-30fps, while remaining clear enough that distant objects don't overpixelate. It's not ideal, but I found it very playable and still a good amount of fun. At any rate, whatever your setup may be, this game's graphics will not impress you, so who cares.			"

												Mysteries of the Sith is an expansion pack to the second entry in the Dark Forces Saga, Jedi Knight. In some ways it improves upon its predecessor, and in some ways its a few steps back.The game gives you a good, if false, first impression in the opening level. While Kyle Katarn is training his new apprentice (smuggler-turned-Jedi and future wife of Luke Skywalker, Mara Jade), the Republic base they're at is attacked by the Imperial Remnant, using space stations disguised as asteroids to ambush their enemy. You spend this section playing as Kyle, and its a breath of fresh air from Dark Forces II with a sprawling, semilinear level and two or three new varieties of Stormtrooper to fight.However, this level was either designed to catch your attention so you'd be strung along with the rest of the game, or was indicative of the original vision that ultimately didn't pan out, as once you move on from the Republic base things quickly deteriorate into largely linear run-and-guns punctuated with both the unintuitively specific progression of Jedi Knight and at times the baffling moon logic of the original Dark Forces. The impressive scope of Jedi Knight is also lost, leaning more towards the relatively cramped and linear confines of the later Jedi Outcast. One notable exception to this is the final level in the Sith Catacombs, which involve a series of puzzles spread along the perimeter of a massive central chamber that gives your efforts a sense of continuity and scope.Finally, the story is the absolute thinnest of the series, which given the flat characters and often thin establishment of Jedi Knight, says a lot. While I never was at a loss as to what I was doing at any given location and why, there is no overarching story to the game whatsover. After the initial attack by the Imperial Remnant, Kyle leaves Mara Jade behind to look into an unrelated matter, and the Imperials never come up again, apart from a minor occupying force on a later planet that never factors into the plot at all other than as someone else to shoot. Mara is left to run errands for the Republic in the meantime, first by gaining the assistance of a crimelord for supplies, then by guarding and then recovering a Jedi Holocron when it inevitably gets stolen by pirates. Absolutely none of these things relate in any way to each other or the final act, other than Mara's hand in all of them.Mara Jade is a more interesting person than pre-Jedi Outcast Kyle Katarn (being little more than a gun-for-hire in Dark Forces and a bland grizzled action hero in Jedi Knight), but she is without question the most horrible person I've ever played in a Star Wars game who wasn't a Dark Sider trying to make their puppy-kicking quota. When sent to negotiate with the crimelord I mentioned earlier, the doorman speaks highly of her former smuggling career but says his boss is uninterested in seeing her due to distrust of the straight-laced Jedi she seems to have become. Her response? Kick down the back door, murder about 80% of the crimelord's employees, and then force him into negotiations at gunpoint. He relents in return for a favor, but the fact that we're supposed to be rooting for Mara here kind of disturbs me.Once that's dealt with (an affair that mostly involves a chase through a city, being captured, killing a rancor, and then fighting your way out of your target's base), the crimelord agrees to a business relationship with the Republic, but not before Mara Jade decides to blackmail him one more time, just for kicks. This plotline never comes up again, as we next see Mara overseeing the transport of a Jedi Holocron, when her ship is attacked by pirates and she's forced to smuggle herself onto their ship, fight her way through their docking facility, then to the base of the collector it's been sold to in order to retrieve it. This plotline has nothing to do with anything else either.Finally, Mara decides to go looking for Kyle as she hasn't heard from him since he took off on his private investigation. At this point the game largely plummets into Xen Syndrome, as you wander through a swamp with nonsensical puzzles (you can't pass unless you use Force Persuasion on the statue? What?), overpowered enemies that will kill you in two hits (and in the case of the trash-squid things, can't be killed at all for some reason despite Kyle gunning down a dozen or so of them in Dark Forces), and the complete inability to use any weapon except your lightsaber for the rest of the game. Oh, and there's Sith Zombies for some reason, because I guess that's a thing now.It turns out that the strong Dark Side aura of the ruins on this planet sent Kyle, who has been established as a borderline-neutral individual throughout the games, off the deep end into crazy Sith hermit. Exactly what happened to twist him that way is probably a more interesting story than the actual game, where after a few ignored attempts to get you to either♥♥♥♥♥♥off or join him, he decides to finally try and kill you dead, at which point your only option is to turn off your lightsaber to convince him that he's not far gone enough to start offing his friends. At which point you leave, the credits roll, and two massive plot points that occured between this and Jedi Outcast (Kyle switching from a yellow to a blue lightsaber and eventually giving up his Force powers) are left entirely unadressed.In summation, this game is roughly on par with Jedi Knight in quality, with every improvement balanced by a downgrade.  And much like Jedi Knight, I ultimately can't recommend the experience. Basically nothing happens over the course of these two games couldn't be guessed at based on offhand comments in Jedi Outcast, and quite a few things that ARE mentioned in Jedi Outcast are never actually addressed in these games. Not needed for the story, and the gameplay isn't up to snuff with Dark Forces or Jedi Outcast, so just play those and skip these lesser installments.			"

Devo's dropping the mike...AGAIN!Disclaimer: I am a huge Star Wars fan, and have played this game a lot as a child/teenager, so as my foot note points out (see the bottom of my review pages), this review may be biased.Title Information  Review Title Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith   Review Date 23rd of February 2016   PC Release Date 24th of February 1998   Developer LucasArts   Publisher LucasArts   Genre 1st & 3rd Person Shooter/Action Adventure   Series Dark Forces (Expansion to 2nd title in the series)   Single Player Yes   Multiplayer Yes  Ratings  Category Score   Story 7/10   Single Player Gameplay 9/10   Multiplayer Gameplay 9/10   Graphics & Art Style 7/10   Replayability 6/10   Overal Rating 7/10 (See bottom of the page for ranking descriptions)Devo's Seal of Approval?:Yes, but only by association. If you enjoyed Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, don't miss this expansion, however, be warned that the the level design (which in my opinion is one of the aspects of this series which pass the test of time) is not quite as epic, with the majority of locales taking place in settings which don't resemble those from the original trilogy quite as much. Additionally, cut-scenes are rendered in-engine and draw attention to how out-dated the graphics are.PROS Has interesting gameplay elements and story progression points which pay homage to Return of the Jedi, More great gameplay identical to the main title, A meaty single player experience which lasts as long as the main title, New enemies, some of which are truly superb (cough...RANCOR...cough), New weapons, New Force powers,CONS Poorly executed cut-scenes make it hard to become engaged in the story, The level design is not as aesthetically pleasing as the main title, There aren't as many encounters with Imperials as I would have preffered, Steam overlay didn't work, Issues with resolution and full-screen settings are still present in the expansion (as they were in the main title - see my Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II review for more details) and the game can be unstable at times,CONCLUSIONS...The same great single player experience is still there with additional characters, weapons and Force powers, however, this expansion didn't feel as polished as the main title, with somewhat uninspired level aesthetics and poorly executed cut-scenes.With that being said, if you enjoyed Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, you shouldn't miss this expansion...and what a sizeable expansion it is - the single player experience included is just as long as the main title! Beware of difficulties getting this running at 1080p however (more so than the main title), and at times it can be a little unstable._______________________RANKING DESCRIPTIONS  Score Description   1 This pile of c%$p made me want to take a break from gaming!   2 Avoid this title like a fat man on a diet avoids cake.   3 Why did they even bother? Oh wait...they didn't, so niether should you.   4 I wouldn't play this unless I was really, really desperate, or the biggest fan alive.   5 While there are some interesting aspects of this title, there are just too many faults to recommend it to anyone.   6 An ""average"" title which has some redeeming qualities, however, be warned that it also has its fair share of flaws...   7 A good game and it probably shouldn't be missed by fans of the series or genre, but be warned there are better games out there which are more deserving of your time and money.   8 An excellent title which shouldn't be missed if you can help it. I found it hard to put this game down, and I hope you do too.   9 A master piece! As close to perfect as any title can get. You are truly missing out on an unbelievable gaming experience if you do not play this game.   10 PERFECT. Nothing more needs to be said All ratings and opinions expressed in this review are subjective, and therefore are effected in part by my own preferences & predisposiitons. I have not received any gifts or gratuities froma any party for this work. "

												I absolutely highly recommend this game. I've never played the first Jedi Knight (though now I want to) but this is simply a steal for $3. Dated graphics aside, this game is one of the best single-player experiences I've had in a while. The level design is excellent: the levels are large, and secret areas reward you for exploring around (though you'll probably find some of them by accident anyways); and the levels are also challenging and sometimes require you to think outside the box. There's only one particular boss that I think is overly difficult (you'll know when you get there), but besides that I think this game is well designed. And it oftentimes does a good job of creating some awesome atmosphere, along with allowing you to explore some nice views--even in the dated graphics, I still enjoyed perching high up and looking at a cool view. OVERALL: somewhere around 8.5/10NOTE: I suggest ""Enabling 3D Acceleration"" in the display settings. Also match the resolution to your resolution. For me, that made the graphics optimal and worked perfectly great. Also definitely go to the control or gameplay (can't remember which) settings and make sure that the Y axis is NOT inverted.			"

												The game itself, I enjoy. Cool level designs that encourage exploration, good weapons, fun story, etc. If you've played any of the other Jedi Knight games you know what you're getting into. From what I've seen this definitely the weakest link in the Jedi Knight series but not by much.This particular release, however, I can not recommend.To be honest the release is trash. Music is missing, thing won't even run properly or at all without having to find a bunch of fixes. Literally asks for a CD if you don't have a CD drive so you'll at least need a virtual drive. The epitome of lazyness. I've heard people defend it because it's ""old"", but if it's old, the proper thing to do is not re-release it at all or provide fixes (which obviously exist if you search the forums here) to make it playable on modern hardware that purchasers are going to play on. In short, that fine print in the system requirements is there for a reason and you would do wise to take it seriously.If you're willing to jump through hoops in order to play this game, get it, but get it on sale. If you want a game you can just install and play, look for something else.			"

												This review is for the game in June 2016.The game itself is OK.  An FPS from the early, ugly days of true 3D.  Expansion to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II, you get to play as Mara Jade, how cool is that!  The cutscenes are all CGI rather than the cheesy FMVs though.  Aw.Now for the problems. The music doesn't play.  You need a fan patch for that.  I had graphics problems with colour pallette and with movement leaving artifacts across the screen.  Took a couple of hours of fiddling to fix those.  Then there was trying to play in fullscreen.  I tried a LOT of things. Nothing would work.  There were problems with parts of the HUD being cut off in larger resolutions.  I ended up playing the game on my TV, in a window, and with the TV in ""zoom"" aspect ratio.  It was very awkward.I tried the GOG version of the game.  Fullscreen, no artifacts, full HUD, functioning colour pallette straight off the bat.  Unless the Steam version gets an update, I would recommend buying this game from GOG instead. Edit: Sadly, on gog you can't buy this game individually, it's bundled with Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.			"

												STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith takes place a couple of years after the events of STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.The game once again features the famous Kyle Katarn, who is now a renowned Jedi Master.This time however, Kyle has his own Padawan, a woman called Mara Jade. Mara Jade is also the wife of Luke Skywalker in the Expanded Universe of Star Wars.This time, the New Republican base is overrun by the Imperial Remnant (the successor of the former Galactic Empire), and Kyle has to once again help the New Republic.Later in the game, you take control of Mara Jade herself, and for the rest of the game, you play as her.The game is very similar to Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II in many ways, which is to be expected because Mysteries of the Sith was originally an expansion for this game, but was later released as a standalone game on Steam.Besides some characters and the art- and combat style however, the games are very different from each other.Mysteries of the Sith follows a completely different story in a different period of the Star Wars universe.Because of all this, the game feels very fresh and most of the levels and enemies are very unique and memorable.The game no longer features live-action cutscenes, which is a huge downgrade in my opinion.One other negative thing that I would like to point out is the fact that the choice between the light- and the dark side in this game is hardly present, and compared to the previous installment, it is very dissapointing.On the technical side of things however, the game still experiences resolution issues and frequent crashes.This is of course not very suprising, seeing as the game was made in the same engine and around the same time as Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II.The controls are also a bit weird at first, and the amount of possible binds is a bit overwelming, but after doing some remapping myself, I found game to be very playable with just a few binds.All in all, I thought that Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith was very enjoyable and rewarding, but the frequent crashes do still bug me.Nontheless, the game is still very impressive for its age, and anyone that has played Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II should definitely give this game a go.

Star Wars Jedi Knight: Misteries Of The Sith			* 6/10""Kyle Katarn and his apprentice Mara Jade are..."" Wait, what??? XDFive Years have passed after Kyle defeated Jerec and his Six Disciples and now He's training a new Apprentice, Mara Jade, in a New Republic outpost. Imperial Forces will attack the place and Kyle will save the situation on his own. Later he will entrust the Republic assignments to Mara, while he will leave to investigate an abandoned Sith Temple.In this Stand-Alone expansion You will control Kyle first during the Imperial assault, then You will Switch to Mara Jade. And this was a great surprise as Mara Jade is a very known and important character (the Future Wife of Luke Skywalker in what now is no more canonical expanded universe... Thank you Disney...).If you already know Dark Forces II there's not much to say as it presents the same gameplay and issues. You can control a Jedi Knight with Force powers... Actually two of them. Anyways, The engine is the same, so the same bad-aged look made of low polygons characters and low textures maps, animations are the same coarse movements as seen in the previous game and the force powers control system is the same. Unfortunately there are no cinematics with real actors so everything is made with a pre-rendered version of the game engine. Unfortunately they've changed Kyle's voice as well. Anyways the most important aspect of this game are its maps. they're 14 against the 21 maps in Dark Forces II, but they're bigger, longer, more complicated with more puzzles, some of them very lethal, and a very difficult maze-like pattern, so it's quite easy to get lost without finding a way out, especially in the latest maps. And this is the aspect that makes this chapter quite frustrating, not to mention the puzzles with non-linear solutions (just like the final fight as well). Even though the story is quite important it's a bit superficial and a bit predictable, but still I consider this chapter important for the consequences in the saga.Obviusly the original amazing soundtrack from John Williams will still accompany our adventures. Unfortunately, as in Dark Forces II, they're no longer dynamic tracks as in Dark Forces and the music doesn't loop immediately so there wil be moments of silence which kind of ruin the atmosphere.Since this chapter uses the same engine as in Dark Forces II you might run into the same issues, considering the age and the very low compatibility. Luckily the solutions are almost the same as in DFII, and you can find anything from the Steam Discussion Forum.+++PROs+++ JEDI! We get to move and control not just a Jedi, but two of them with a lightsaber and force powers... And one of them is Mara Jade! SOUNDTRACK. Of course there's always the amazing music from the Original Star Wars soundtrack.---CONs--- SOUNDTRACK. ...But unlike its predecessor and successor it isn't a dynamic soundtrack that alternates calm tracks in exploring situations and more active music during fights. Besides the music won't loop immediately leaving moments of silence. STORY. Even though this chapter holds an important passage it's a bit predictable, and despite the title it doesn't explain much. LOW-COMPATIBILITY ISSUES. This game is very old and of course issues and glitch were expected. My first attempt resulted in a black screen ingame with all sounds and events running, or completely inverted/pixel-blasted textures. Luckily, after GTA IV I've gained enough patience to read deeply the Steam Community to find different solutions and patches, and I've made it work eventually... Too bad that seems like the GOG release is already patched and fully working... -.- LEVELS STRUCTURE. This Expansion is way more tough than the predecessor, it's easy to get lost, some puzzles are quite difficult to solve and the latest maps are really REALLY tough. It requires very good observation and attention to details. "

Mysteries of the Sith is a pretty terrific game. I played the demo years ago and forgot about it until now. Here's my breakdown of MotS:PROS+ Awesome Storyline+ Challenging Enemies+ Smooth Gameplay+ Can be run on a potato+ There are Graphical Improvement mods available!CONS- Weird (possibly bugged) saber system- Outdated Graphics- Steam Overlay doesn't work- Mods are needed to play Online- Full Screen only works in-game. Shrinks to window for cutscenes, menus, etc.- Poorly-excuted cutscenes- Contains some of the worst voice acting imaginableMy Rating: 7/10 (Recommended) "

												Decent game, and does a good job of providing continuity between Dark Forces II and Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. There are some idiosyncracies (like running windowed until the level itself begins), but nothing which cannot be bypassed.It does seem however that getting it running on newer systems is quite challenging, as different people use different solutions. I played on Windows 10 x64, and used a combination of the below guides (all credit for guides and/or fixes goes to OPs):

												Fist-fight a rancor! Punch it to death... and then realise there was a lightsaber and an escape there the whole time.   /)_-)If you can get the game running properly and accept the game for what it is (made in 1998), there is a good game here. Not as good as Dark Forces 2, but still decent. A quality expansion that made some fair advances with the Sith engine.However, Mysteries of the Sith kinda felt rushed. The voice acting is patchy and whilst I personally enjoyed the smarter level design, it could be confusing to new players. Someone give that bad guy a hug.That's a hint.			"

												So much more than just an addon pack for Jedi Knight. Mysteries of the Sith was the first Star Wars game to give exposure to existing EU characters, namely Mara Jade. The brilliant gameplay from JK was deeper with new force powers, and the great storytelling was even darker in this game. The cutscenes were not as cheesy and out of place as JK as they were done using the in-game engine. With the improved gameplay, more gripping storyline, this was the first addon pack that was actually better than it's parent game. A true Star Wars classic from the heyday of Lucasarts.			"

												I was really excited to play this expansion ever since I got Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II back in the 90s.  It was also great considering I got it for less than $1 on Steam.  Other than new locales, force powers and enemies, there's not much going for this expansion.  In fact, the negatives really weigh down any positives this might have.1. Running this on Windows 7 Pro, everytime you launch the game or hit Esc to go to the menu, the game reverts to windowed mode.  Tried several fixes to get this resolved, but just couldn't get it to work. An annoyance more than anything.The game would run in full screen however.2. Kind of surprised there was no FMV like in Dark Forces II. However, considering its an expansion, I can live with out it.3. The story is what suffers the most. ""Mysteries of the Sith""? The first 11 missions have practically nothing to do with the Jedi/Sith ideology.  Just run around, blow up remnant Imperial forces, or when playing as Mara Jade, shoot up pirates....really? Pirates?4. Not really having control of choosing what force powers you want is very annoying as well. If I chose to add a ""Force Star"" i earned to fill out a power, new options might disappear. For such a short expansion, I figured they'd want you to try as many as you could. 5. There are times while playing the games framerate will drop considerably for now reason.  The only thing to correct it, I found, is to save, exit the game completely, and load it again.  Very annoying.Overall, this expansion really doesn't add to the JK:DFII story and if I could, I'd probably just skip it altogether and move straigh to Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast. Soooo much better.			"

												I played these games heavily as a child and have fond memories of many of the events of JK and the Mysteries of the Sith. Upon revisting JK, I was filled with joy to find that it hadn't aged quite as poorly as I'd expected. The run and gun mechanics still work, the levels are well-designed and expansive, and even the puzzles can at least be reasoned out. I feel the bland story and characters are buoyed by the fun, campy FMV cutscenes, giving the game a B-movie feel. The lightsaber battles are a little janky and un-fun at this point, but few games are perfect.In playing Mysteries of the Sith, I found all of the levels I rememberly fondly; however, the feeling with this expansion is completely different. Practically everything in this game feels an order of magnitude more frustrating. The story falls flat, meandering around a bunch of unrelated events until it fizzles out at the end. The characters are worse, Mara being painted as reckless, illogical, and sometimes downright distasteful. Kyle, for whatever your opinion of him was before this game, was at worst a bland, uninspired character. Suddenly, this game turns him into a paper-thin, boring villain for no reason other than need of a climax.The puzzles have suddenly become several times more obtuse. If you thought Dark Forces was hard to figure out, buckle up. The level design feels like an afterthought. These feel like throw-away levels from JK, possibly explaining why the story feels like an afterthought. The worst part of their design is the constant hiding of the way forward behind grating in the dark corner of a hallway halfway to a dead end. All of this is pretty bad, but the last two levels take the cake. The game spends thirteen levels with scarcely a single use for the lightsaber other than a glorified wire cutter before immediately removing use of all weapons other than it. Two needlessly long levels filled with non-stop ambushes by enemies that can kill you in two hits on easy? Surely, this was top-shelf game design in its day. I merely squeaked through these levels by slowly spamming saber-throw for a lack of a better way to defeat most of the cheaper enemies.I can understand that JK hasn't aged greatly, and my nostalgia for it certainly elevates my opinion of it. However, it stands as a solid, if forgettable, FPS game set in the Star Wars universe. Mysteries of the Sith is more akin to a steaming mess that reeks of horrific, likely rushed design choices resulting from a desire to cash in on the success of JK. "

												This is a puzzler, 100%.It may look like an FPS (though you can play in third person), but it's a labyrinthian puzzler. Not just that, but a ridiculously hard one. The aim of the game is to find little nooks and crannys, do specific things in specific places to reach certain unseen spots, find certain keys and open locks in a certain order etc. to progress.If you go into this as an action or FPS game, you might get through the nice opening level, but that's it. Most kids (heck most adults) who played this didn't get past the second level, which as well as being full of hidden passageways is incredibly dark. This is repeated throughout the rest of the game. No Dark Forces II gameplay here.To sum it up perfectly, there are even YouTube video guides where the uploaders get confused as to where to go for several minutes. The rest of the time they look like they're breaking the game or cheating but are indeed following the route they're suppoed to.Even ignoring the gameplay and awful level design, the plot and characters are more unlikeable.Kyle Katarn returns, though no longer in his handsome FMV form, but via in in-game cutscenes and now rocking a terrible goatee. In fact his whole character has changed. He now speaks nasally and says cheesy things (""gravity is a harsh mistress"" *snort*). The force has turned him into an internet forum mod.The plot itself is lazy. You initially play as Kyle and go on a bit of a Rambo errand. You would think this serves as a tutorial, but as mentioned above it turns pretty unfriendly after the first level. So Kyle does his shtick for a few levels, then he goes off to investigate a Sith temple he's found. You can guess what happens. You then take control of Mara Jade, who just does a couple more Rambo errands as filler before she eventually goes straight to the temple to find Kyle and finish the plot that had been abandoned.The temple is very creepy, and the finale is nicely thought out, it's just a shame you won't see any of it without cheats and a guide and a LOT of time, patience and repetition.

												Ugh, this expansion pack was amazing. It's a near-forgotten expansion pack no one talks about. You can't help but expect a waste of time, stuck in mediocrity and never really going anywhere...so when you see it's pretty much on the level of the original Jedi Knight, but with improved level design! finally!....Maybe that's why it impressed me so much: The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed level designers at LucasArts finally figured it out, just, sadly, in an expansion pack no one bought or played, and only AFTER the introduction sequence.It's also far longer than the base game, surprise surprise.I'd also rate it lower than Dark Forces 2 because it's an expansion pack and no one plays it anymore, therefore it must be worse.

												The only mystery here is how on Earth (Tattooine, Hoth, etc) one is supposed to complete this game without cheating!?This game is the very definition of unforgiving; one tiny slip up. one teeny error of judgement, the very thought of making a mistake and you are punished like a fat Gamorrean in the Rancor Pit.The business end of this game will kill you for just getting too close to a wolf.  In one swipe.  It will kill you for turning a corner in the Sith temple.  It will kill you for standing on a completely camouflaged dart plant thingy.  It will kill you by forcing you to make jumps you cannot make without force points which you cannot acquire because you cannot jump high enough BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FORCE POINTS.  Don't for one single solitary second think you are provided with the means to overcome these obstacles either.""I've got a baaad feeling about this"" is so relevant for every stage of this game.Other than that it's not half bad for a hardcore Star Wars fan!3 subligars out of 5.Enjoy.

												While I thought Jedi Knight was an excellent game, I wouldn't recommend this expansion. The story is all over the place and the levels don't feel as memorable or well designed. The cutscenes are in engine and are pretty rough compared to Jedi Knights FMVs.  The game basically devolves into taking the main character from the first game, pretty much invalidating his character arch and making him evil for no real reason except to have an antagonist. That really left a sour taste in my mouth. I really disliked that the last 3 levels take away your weapons so you HAVE to use your lightsaber, and then throw an onslaught of difficult enemies at you that can kill you with 1-2 hits. I didn't want Jedi Knight to end, but this I couldn't wait for it to be over. Also, you will have to spend a good bit of time finding and installing patches to make this game run.			"

												Well, I sort of recommend it. Mysteries is not for everyone. It's unforgiving like Dark Forces 2 but there's a strange difficulty spike in Mission 12, 13, and 14 where you are forced to use only your lightsabre and your firearms mysteriously missfire. It basically turns into the grandfather of Bloodbourn and Dark Souls. The enemies, depending on the type, can kill you in either 1 or 2 hits and since they all use melee attacks, they bypass the energy shield.Sabre Throw and Destruction force powers help but unfortuanetly I DID NOT GET THEM! So yeah. You're going to die A LOT.That bit of whining aside the levels are great in terms of design and the secret areas are mostly pretty damn well hidden. Some of the progression rooms are well hidden as well. They story however isn't something to hang in the Christmas tree unfortuanetly. It's odd and messy I feel and there's not real overarching story that I could dicern.Enemy variation is nice and challenging to engage. Force powers are fun to use, especially Force Persuation which makes you invisible. It does not work on the final 3 levels though.Lastly I have to talk about the version: I have had difficulties running the Steam version of Mysteries of the Sith with several crash issues related to saving and sometimes loading the game. The game saves, buuut it'll crash right afterwards unless you use quick save. And loading to many times crash the game as well.There is hope however. Over at GoG com they have a working version with which I have only experienced one crash.Oh, and there's a default mouse setting which inverts the mouse Y axis so moving the mouse forward looks down and moving it backward looks up. Why? I have no idea but you can change it in the Setup, Controls, Mouse, Mouse Y Axis and then uncheck the Reverse Direction box.All in all I recommend it for the puzzle challenges, combat play, thought not the lightsabre. It kind of sucks, and the level design.			"

												Great game. Can be a little confusing as to where you need to go or what you need to do. I saw all the problems people had with windows 7 and up, so I played it on an XP (where I had played Dark Forces 2 with no problems.) There is a big difficulty spike towards the end. And parts of it are not intuitive. I needed a walkthrough 3 times to tell me what stupid unknown thing I had to do. Some of the enemies are frustrating at the end.But even this decade old computer had problems: -Cinematics where really sped up. -Crashes alot of the time when I save or go to the pause menu (use quicksave F9).-Music will keep playing after the game crashes-Messed up my computer (only ctrl-alt-delete will work), had to restart the computer many times.-erm... the voices are all wrong. they couldn't just use the DF2  voices?Really though, get it.

												Star Wars Jedi Knight Mysteries of the Sith is a surprisingly poor game despite being part of the otherwise fantastic Jedi Knight series. It's map design, story progression and combat variety are all absolutely horrible when held up the other games in the series. The last 2 maps of the game in particular will forever hold a place in history as some of the most tedious ever made for an FPS. Adding in the fact that the great live action cutscenes that defined the rest of the series have been cut, and Kyle Katarn has had a change in voice actors and there simply isn't much left to enjoy.This is the only game in the series that's truly worth missing. A horrific pit of poor game design in the usually superb Jedi Knight series.			"

Mystery 4: If a Sith leaves Nar Shadda travelling at 100 MGLT per hour towards Tatooine, and ten days later another Sith leaves Mos Eisley spaceport because he's worked up a debt and can't repay it without selling a kidney, at what time will they meet to try to kill each other because there is a third Sith selling popcorn on Coruscant and there can only be 2 Sith at any one time? This game answers all of those questions. I give it 8 Sith out of 10 Sith.			"

												While it's not as good as Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight (the game this is a standalone expansion to), Mysteries of the Sith does things slightly different. This time around you're playing as Mara Jade, which is interesting, but unfortunately the cutscenes are done entirely in-engine, so they end up looking awful (the FMV sequences in DF2 were great... Quake 1 engine cutscenes are ugly). Luckily the cutscenes aren't representative of the whole game, which is a solid FPS and a good Jedi Knight experience.			"

Cheaper than Call of Duty Black Ops, and has a more grown-up community9. Pretty low minimal requirements (works on pretty much everything that can boot a normal operating system)10. Astonishingly beautiful main heroin11. Polished animations12. Solid FPS (see 9.)13. This game is complete as it is - no content was cut to be released as DLC for 9.99 two weeks after its widely announced and anticipated premiereThus I highly recommend this gem among mediocre SW games and other shooters.

												I love the game and all, but when it started playing Metallica I♥♥♥♥♥♥a brick. I then quickly realised it was actually playing music from the CD I had in my drive.10/10 would rock out to Lepper Messiah on lvl 2.In all seriousness. The game is buggy as all hell. It's understandable that it is an old game, but this would cause utter outrage on any respectable release so I see no difference here.I would say buy the game to support the developers... but at this point I'm not sure where the money is going.I'm still reccomending the game as there are fixes for the people who stillwant to experience this game in a propper manner. I didn't use any fixes to get the game running which is why I ran into this mildly satisfying bug.Seriously tho, get ur♥♥♥♥♥♥together Disney.Full disclosure: Obtained my copy for 28¢ while on sale.

												For a time when walkthroughs were not readily available, this has to have been the most impossible games ever created by Lucas Arts. Suffering from poor map design, backtracking,  convoluted puzzles, and some enemies (near the end) that are absolutly impossible to kill. I have never had to use cheats to beat a game before but this game pretty much requires you to do so. Worst Star Wars game I have ever played.			"

												Unless you're nostalgic or curious about older Star Wars games, stay away from this.First of all, the Steam version has horrendous compatibility issues with modern PCs and needs some workarounds.Next, the game simply isn't very good. As a shooter it's tolerable, but once you switch to lightsaber combat it becomes terrible. The lightsaber mechanics are clunky and nothing like the fun combat from Jedi Outcast or Academy. Even worse, using the lightsaber becomes mandatory in later levels, where enemies that can kill you with one or two hits are thrown at you, making the game incredibly frustrating. I would recommend simply skipping this one (Dark Forces II isn't that great either) and playing Jedi Outcast instead.			"

Very difficult to play, didn't even get past the first area... and you have to put the graphics settings on their lowest quality so you don't get any rendering anomalies. If you were dumb enough like me to waste your disk space with this game, do a web search on how to fix the rendering issue.			"

You play as the padawan of Kyle (the protagonist of the main series), Mara Jade, and learn the ways of the force and the obsticles in your way. You help the Republic stop the remnant forces of the Sith and the Stormtroopers, and ultimately find out your master has been seduced by the dark side. Great game, very challenging, and just as solid as the last game.			"

												The weakest of the entire Jedi Knight series, Mysteries of the Sith still offers the same challenging, old-school shooter gameplay the original Jedi Knight epitomized, with a new storyline and 16 levels. While it pales in comparison to its forebearers and sequels, $3 USD is a fair price for what you recieve. If you enjoyed Jedi Knight, and are still craving more after playing both runthroughs, give this a shot. It's gameplay, plus its distinction of being the only Star Wars game to feature Mara Jade, makes it worth the price of admission. Be advised, you will be forced to look up fixes for this game, so buyer beware.			"

												This game is a bit like SW Dark Forces or a Wolfenstein 3D/Doom -style of game, but with a little more technical polish. For any favor gained by the technical polish that it has over games like the aforementioned, it comes up short in gameplay. A lesser entry; weakly recommended. [ 6 / 10 ]			"

												An expansion to Star Wars Dark Forces 2 Jedi Knight, this time, we follow Mara Jade, another Force “User” who has a two way learning relationship with Kyle Katarn. While you will be demolishing the poor cronies of the Empire with Kyle for the first two missions, you will be getting to know Mara for the remainder of the story. The live action cutscenes are no more however, (which I must say is a HUGE disappointment) and are replaced with in-game cutscenes which in my opinion are a step down in quality. There are some graphical improvements to the game as once again, you are led across the galaxy to new set locations, new enemies and people to meet and new weapons and force powers. Priced less than $2 during the sales (Pro Tip: Look for coins in the couch or change in soda dispensers), you can not go wrong in finding out the conclusion to the Dark Forces series. This is not the end for Kyle Katarn, the Chuck Norris of the Star Wars universe however…*The game requires DosBox however, with the Steam download, everything will be set up for you to enjoy as soon as the game is downloaded.Story/Characters:Mara Jade, a mercenary who works for Talon Karrde (In this game, works with Kyle and the New Republic) is the main character. There are many different locations you will be going to, many of which is in the Expanded Universe books and such. Also, many of the cutscenes or scenarios in the game harkens back to the Original Series (think Dagobah) which was a nice touch in my opinion. The last several missions are one of the spookiest and well, excellently crafted atmospherically set pieces I feel in the whole series.Gameplay:Mostly the same from my previous Dark Forces 2 review as this is an expansion for said game. There are not as many mini bosses in this one, and in my experience, the difficulty really ramps up exponentially at the end which gave me several frustrated moments because of the lightsaber still being random and inelegant (Obi-Wan you lied to me!) but still, solid stuff. Graphics:Once again, same sentiments from my Dark Forces 2 review. The 3D technology is still not “there” yet but you get the gist of what you’re whacking away at with your lightsaber.Sound/Music:Sound and music is still excellent. The voice acting in the cutscenes was a bit more on the “meh” side but that did not impact the overall game too much for me.Controls:The game allows you to use a joystick or the standard keyboard and mouse. You may also customize hotkeys from everything from moving to weapons to force powers.Replay value:Little to none as there is no Light or Dark Side paths you may take. Online:This expansion adds new maps and play modes but I feel you’ll be up a crap creek without a paddle (Note: That is not good) if you want to play.---***If there are any mistakes to the facts pertaining to the game, please let me know. Also, if you have further questions not covered by the review, or if something were unclear, I will try to clarify as best as possible. Thanks!			"

												This game is an extension to Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, but it is no where near the quality of that game. Highlights here are that you start with a lightsaber, get to use the Han Solo blaster (no real advantage over the original Kyle blaster, but it looks good), get a scope for the blaster rifle, fight some new enemies, runs fine on old hardware.Lowlights are that the game looks awful - chunky, dark, considerably worse than Jedi Knight. It is also seriously difficult, even on easy setting. Unless you are extremely talented you will spend your time dying a lot. Puzzles are more confusing that challenging. Basically getting through this game is painful.If you feel like you *must* have it to complete the story line from Dark Forces to Jedi Academy, then at least it won't cost too much. But it isn't worth the time required to play.If you haven't played Jedi Outcast, get that instead - it is better in every way and maybe cheaper too. Same for Jedi Academy.			"

												Disclaimer: This is a review of the game itself. This title worked fine on my system but technical issues have been reported on others.Star Wars: Jedi Knight - Mysteries of the Sith simply isn't as good as its predecessors. The FMVs of the previous title are gone and replaced with 3D animated cut scenes. The voice acting isn't as good and the story isn't very interesting. The levels are still huge if not bigger but that also makes them more confusing and tedious. Best to stick with Dark Forces I and II or go straight to the more recent Jedi Knight titles.			"

												I have found that a lot of these older Jedi Knight games have their issuses, whether it be a lack of HUD or the UI in general being a bit slack. But this incarnation of Jedi Knight has so far caused me great headaches with the game not working, either by ""insert disc 1/2"", the general compatibility issues of older games, or just not starting at all, no error codes or anything. Once you get the game started it seems simple enough, however there is a bug in mine, and many others' versions of this game where the save system crashes the game, which is disappointing. From what I have been bothered to stomach of the game so far the plot seems typical of a Jedi Knight game so in that I am happy. It would be more playable if there was a better method of playing the game on a system from 7 onward. I do not reccommend paying full price for this game, if you want to risk the stress buy it when it is on sale and have fun trying to get the game to work.			"

												This is a VERY loose recommendation. It's honestly a 6/10 game (since Steam released it no longer as Dark Forces II DLC). Mysteries of the Sith, in my opinion, is more preferable to Dark Forces II in some ways, and a lot worse in others. It's better, because missions are more direct and have a lot more of a heavy atmosphere (especially the last three levels) combat is greatly improved, especially the Force and lightsaber combat. However, story-wise, it does have some good points, but utterly falls flat on its face. The story is 4 random moments between Kyle and Mara Jade, Master and Student. Parts 1 and 4 are what the story IS about. Parts 2 and 3 (Where Mara deals with Hutts and Pirates) literally has NOTHING to do with the plot, creating pointless filler. It could honestly have aided the plot, but ultimately it didn't. But Parts 1 and 4 between Mara and Kyle specifically are good, and definitely Part 4. It's created to be creepy, challenging, and mind-bending. Oh, and the boss battle is totally easy when you find out the secret. Took me 5 seconds to beat him.			"

Also, the fact the lightsaber and force powers are immediately at your disposal makes it more fun.The story is not that great, and there are no FMV sequences anymore. the scenes between missions don't look that good anymore, but it won't spoil the fun.Regarding this steam version, it will not work without some troubleshooting first. Look in the steam support forum for this game to get it working properly.In short, I would give the game a ""yes"" vote, but the steam version is definitely a ""no"" vote. It is a shame to sell a game like this. Message to steam: if you sell classic games, make sure they do work on the modern systems!!.			"

												_______________________________________________________________________________STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith™_______________________________________________________________________________Basis:Star Wars Jedi Knight: Mysteries of the Sith is an expansion pack for the 1997 first-person shooter Star Wars Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II. The expansion includes a single-player mode and fifteen multiplayer maps. The multiplayer mode allows up to eight players to play online or over a Local area network. The game features several technical improvements over Dark Forces II, including colored lighting, new textures and models, and improved artificial intelligence.______________________________________________________________________________Singleplayer:Mysteries of the Sith is primarily a first-person shooter, but offers the choice of a third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light side or the dark side ending, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels. and each has set objectives that the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. ( Fan Favorite ). The player has a Full choice of weapons to use throughout the game. These include projectile weapons such as a blaster or thermal detonator, and the lightsaber. The player also has access to Force powers. Some are capable of causing damage to enemies while others can be used for non-violent activities.The single-player story is set five years after the events of Dark Forces II. The player controls Kyle Katarn, protagonist of Star Wars: Dark Forces and Dark Forces II, and later in the game, Mara Jade, one of the most popular Star Wars expanded universe characters.The Single player experience is a really good one the Game is both fun and narratively intrestingand in my personal Opinion of being a Huge fan of Star wars its a great star wars classic and is fit for any star wars finatic. (  Such as me ).________________________________________________________________________________Multiplayer:Mysteries of the Sith includes fifteen multiplayer maps, four of which only allow players to battle with lightsabers. The player can choose an avatar and the lightsaber color, and compete with up to seven other players over the internet or a local area network. The game includes a ranking system that tracks the player's experience. Multiplayer mode allows the use of pre-set characters featured in both Mysteries of the Sith and Dark Forces II. There is also a choice of characters from the Star Wars films, such as Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader and Boba Fett. Each type of character has advantages and disadvantages. Several locations from the Star Wars films have been recreated as maps for multiplayer gaming. These include Luke's home on Tatooine from A New Hope, the carbon-freezing chamber on Bespin from The Empire Strikes Back and the Emperor's throne room on the Death Star from Return of the Jedi. The capture the flag multiplayer mode has been altered since Dark Forces II. The player must now steal a ysalamir from the other team and return it to their own base. The ysalamir has the added effect of reducing the Force powers of the player who is carrying it.With the new Updated Multiplayer From its predecessor Dark Forces II it provides many fun and action packed moments. I remember playing this game 3 years ago with a few freinds online and pulling clutch moments in CTF by utilizing the Lightsaber Throw it just put such a smile on my face playing the multiplayer of this game. And nowadays most people would think these servers would be dead but there are still many dedicated servers online today. Its goodtoo see this games multiplayer has not died.________________________________________________________________________________Final Rating:Gamplay - 7.8 / 10Visuals - 7 / 10Story - 9.7 / 10Multiplayer - 8 / 10Star wars Fandom - Yes 10 / 10Replay ability - Yes 8.9 / 10______________________________________________________________________________As always i hope this reveiw helps This is a very fun game for how old it is and in my opinion is a nessasary Collecters itemis the Very Definition of Good Star wars games in my opinion.I hope you guys enjoyed the reveiw and hopfully i might see u on Multiplayer someday.For any questions go ahead and ask in ( Comment ).

												Very intetersting game... for it's time, of course. It's not a simple shooter, but an RPG - you need to collect points and learn Force Tricks, which you can use ingame (speeding, jumping, grip, lighting, etc). First part of the game we're starting as Kyle Katarn and second continues as Mara Jade, storyline - I feel - is better then in JK2! Graphiq isn't too old (not like in doom2), it's like in Gothic1-2, but, of course, much simplier.			"

												Play the first level it's great... then stop.. there's nothing else to see, really.Level design is worse than Jedi knight, the story is wafer thin. Having some friendly AI was exciting at the time, but now they mostly just stand around and don't do anything... we were easy to impress once....Anyway... don't bother unless you REALLY want to know why Kyle was so against using the force in JEDI OUTCAST>> which is a much better game by the way.

												After wrestling with compatability issues and troubleshooting for about half an hour the game was starting to work, albeit with color bugs and old-timey controls that simply didn't work (At least they got WASD right back in those days). So with a bit more fiddling with the controls then the game was playable and to be quite honest it was not that bad. Having played both Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy prior to this game it was quite interesting to see the short bite-sized bits of Katarn's past in the short time I played. That being said, it was too much of a hassle to get it to work with not enough payoff. Maybe it's just cause I've alreadly experianced the later titles first that going to the older ones simply felt... underwhelming.			"

												I can hionostly say that this and Dark forces 2 are quite possibly what made me a gamer. i was always intrigued by star wars as a kid, and dark forces was my first game i played, followed by jei academy and then jedi outcast. Recently, i played this game. And wow, its terrible on windows 10. cant even run it. Put it on old laptop and BAM im reliving the childhood memorys. i strongly recommend this game to true gamers open to any options.			"

												A mixed-bag expansion to the classic JK. The then-cutting-edge colored light betrays a later feature creep and turns many levels into disco infernos. The disjointed mission sets share little connective tissue, though the Dromund Kaas levels are a highlight.Ultimately only a must-play for dedicated completionists or hard-core Mara Jade fans (the primary protagonist after the first levels).
