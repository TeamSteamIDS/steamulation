												I wish Steam had a neutral rating for games because this one is so mediocre that I can't really thumbs up or down it. It has its fun moments, and other times it gets a little tedious, but both come in equal measures. I'm only recommending this game on the basis that it only costs $5 and is a decent way to pass some time, So, this game is worth the price, but you'd probably be better off spending tthat $5 elsewhere.

												Only buy this game if it's 75 cents or less.Legendary has it's upsides, the most notable being the premise of the game. Griphons and other mythological creatures invading the modern world is the selling point of this game, and it ends there. Literally everything else about the game is bad or poorly imagined.First off, this game is broken. Absolutely, fundamentally broken. You literally can not beat this game if you just install it and play it. Right before the final level, there is a game-breaking glitch that causes you to fall through the floor. It is impossible to complete the game. There are a few files you can change to fix this, but the fact that this is included in the game shows how little the developers care, and how poorly the game was ported to PC.The gameplay is boring and repetative. There are about 3 enemy types you will regularly be fighting throughout the game, most of which are just cannon fodder. A plus gameplay wise is that you get health by absorbing enemy souls, and I find this to be the only redeeming quality of this game in a world of regenerating health shooters.The environments and character design are actually pretty decent. AI teammates will occasionally warp through walls, and you can stand inside of them as well. Friendly character clipping wasn't taken into account at all. The animations for most characters are done nicely, but some enemies have poor animation cycles when waiting for a cutscene event.Cutscenes in this game aren't impressive in the slightest. Every time you beat a major story plot point, you are given a slideshow of images and text that is read aloud. The most dissapointing part of the game is at the very end. After you fix the glitch and get to the final level, you complete 3 simple tasks and are given a wall of text. I have never been so dissapointed with an ending since watching Evangelion.My final verdict is to get it on sale. As a game, it isn't so bad that it should be avoided, but you should definitely not pay full price for it. This game is common in indie bundles and I've seen it go as low as $0.74 (£0.59) on Steam.

												So if you haven't noticed yet, this game doesn't get the best reviews, but this is more of a neutral review. Since steam doesn't give me a neutral option I will put to not recommend. My reasoning behind this is because for the most part the game has a lot of technical problems and one huge game breaking bug that happened in an elevator that leads to the final battle of the game, with all these issues I can't bring myself to recommend this even if I enjoyed it. One issue I had was the controls, the way your character moves is very stiff, he jumps like 2 inches off the ground which is annoying when there are some vital points in the game where you need the ability to jump a little, but when you sprint he's all over the place. Another technical issue is the shooting, they have a weird delay from when you shoot the gun to when its supposed to register on the enemy, this makes shooting moving targets more difficult, but it seems to only occur when you shoot human enemies. There are a few more but those are the most important ones to know about, the big elevator glitch I pointed out earlier (which would drop me through the floor of the elevator when it started to move ending up in me falling forever or being stuck below the level) took me a while to find a fix for, some people said to mess around in the ini files, some people said to look at an angle, some said to use FRAPS to limit the fps of the game, so what fixed it was a combo of everything. Multiplayer for me at least was out of the question based the problems with the single player and the fact that you didn't a different account just to play it. But not all is bad with this game, I like the story of fighting a bunch of mythical creatures who were let out because the character you play as was hired/tricked to open Pandora's Box, and the whole game nobody really busts his balls over it, they just accept that he did it and tries to fix it. The creatures are amazing, each one brings their own challanges, Minotaurs are fast, strong, and take awhile to kill while Nari's are more stealthy, come in packs, and are invicible untill they get ready to attack. I was surprised by some of the great face animations from the characters while in game (not cutscenes) reminded me a lot of BioShock Infinite. Some people complain about the graphics but to me they were pretty good especially for the time this came out. The game was very action packed, you are constantly going against something that surprises you and keeps you on your toes, watching massives golems destory the city while griffons fly over head is just one of the wonderful sights of the environment around you will your fighting. I do wish there were more enemies just to bring more diversity and a longer single player experience. This is a decent game that I feel is haunted by a lot of technical issues, I would recommend it with a warning but in this case I don't think most people would enjoy this as much as me, but if you can get it for cheap you have nothing to lose, give it a shot.

												A rough around the edges FPS.  The story is a bity cliche, but I actually enjoyed most of my time with the game.  However, there is a save breaking glicth that causes you to fall out of world in the middle of the final level.  I looked into it, and it apparantly hits most of the people who play it.			"

												Legendary is a horror action first person shooter in the fashion of Duke Nukem Forever and Half-Life 2. Horror as in blood and gory, but not scary, its action first. You have unlocked Pandora's Box, and you'll have to fight mythological creatures to present day New York City and London. You'll fight flying griffins, charging minotaurs, sneaky werewolves, and yes someone released the Kraken. The thing that stands out about the game are the fights. Not just you fighting the enemies, but your allies fighting a hostile faction and enemies attacking everything living. It all adds to a level of strategy. Do you shoot open the lock to a werewolf's cage and have it attack your enemies? Do you flank your enemies while your allies keep them occupied or throw a grenade? One enemy can attack another and light it on fire. Combat isn't scripted. Your allies will die and that's okay. You can leave them, you're not chained to them, but they do help you.The game has brief cut scenes, THAT ARE NOT SKIPABLE. Some of the cut scenes are like an advanced slide show with beautiful art and voice overs. I'd rather see that when interluding between things. There is humor here and there. About once every two hours without being in your face. The game will tell you where to go, what to do with voice overs, because that's what first person shooters do. Thankfully this one says use the rocket launcher against that griffin instead of hold that button, to lock on the griffin, then press that button to fire the rocket. So it keeps me in game. What doesn't keep me in game is the loading screen when I died. I died a lot on medium difficulty when it came to the bosses. I'd say more than other similar first person shooters. There is no easy health. No health kits, no regenerating health at least on medium difficulty. Things will crush you, such as the Kraken's giant purple tentacles. You need to stay sharp and look up.When you start the game, you're given incredible hand powers to do three things. You can absorb what I'll call ""souls"" from dead creatures. Absorbing souls takes time and you need to hold down the button, but if there are 3 souls in 1 area it only needs to be done once to absorb all souls. With these souls you can either hold the same hand button to heal yourself or double press it to send out a wave that stuns enemies. Other than that the weapons are pretty basic, you have a pistol (which I never used), shotgun, machine gun, assault rifle, heavy machine gun, flame thrower for giant swarming blood ticks and rocket launcher. Every weapon has 'iron sights.' The rocket launcher will lock on a target, no matter where they move, the rocket will follow. The hidden gem here is the fire axe. With it you can break the arms of werewolves so they can't attack you. However, it makes a glitchy sort of dangling arm since its broken, not severed. You also have detonation grenades and molotov cocktails that start enemies on fire. With all that said, you can carry two guns at a time, in addition to both kinds of throwables and your fire axe.This is more of a spectacle first person shooter. A towering golem made of junk will walk through Times Square, Big Ben will get obliterated. What there won't be is any sort of exploration. This isn't Quake or Doom. Legendary only has winding maps with short deviations. Things like shoot this object to open a path and hold a button to flip a switch. There are challenges like hold this point for X amount of time. Kill werewolves and absorb their souls and use that to charge EMPs or generators. Kill the giant bosses. Rocket kill griffins. Its all engaging fun, even if you won't get lost. The game even has a waypoint button to see where to go, but I never use it.The enemies each feel unique. Drakes will pop out of fire, roll around and then either spit lava balls from a distance or spew massive amounts of fire like a dragon. You can use water to extinguish them. Werewolves feel like the most typical creature. They will climb up walls to attack from different angles. They have a standard melee, but they'll also throw objects like barrels and stones. If you attack their head, they'll block and they'll jump around. Once they're down you need to behead them or they'll come back. The hairless werewolves are easy enough, but the hairy ones are tougher. The navi are little ghost sprite imp things. In their ghost form you can't hurt them, but they will inhabit objects to attack. Either they'll throw objects or posses vending machines that will shoot cans at you. Minataurs and Griffins will smash an entire area to kill things. They'll go through pillars, walls, bookshelves and anything else. You are not safe. They will always find and kill. The only difference between them is one flies and screams, the other gets stunned after charging. Other than that, the main non boss creature is a tentacle. Green tentacles will attack from water and try to pull you to your instant death. Kill it before you die. If that wasn't enough there are typical soldiers to fight, just as you have your allies. They shoot guns and throw grenades your way when you stay out of sight. Its easy enough to headshot them if you're not using a shotgun. Their aim is too good if you're not hiding behind something. Plus since you don't get to take their soul when they're dead, there's no health from them either. There are cool armored flame throwing soldiers. It adds nice tension seeing them just walk at you making a wall of flame. A nice twist to the game is there are also creature controllers. You can use your soul energy to temporarily charge it and the creatures won't come after you. The game will respawn creatures at times (but not soldiers). Even if you've killed 100 werewolves in the same spot. If you stand there, more werewolves will come. So you need to move on. It'll only waste your ammo, but you have an excessive amount of it.I feel like the game has good intelligence. Soldiers will move back into cover when I flank them. Werewolves will flank to attack, even if some run straight up to you. However, the game's maps don't make good use of that intelligence until later maps. Most maps are just straight forward with cover and no flanking opportunity. Later maps have flank opportunities while your allies occupy enemies.The game looks great and there are a variety of atmospheric environments. New York City streets with cars everywhere, ancient ruins, a graveyard, sewers, subways and parliament libraries. but it feels like it has a fog or a haze over it. Even bright green things have a layer of gray. Maybe its gamma correction? Sometimes objects and characters have a white glowing hue. The fire and water look great. Enemies catch fire and dynamically light the area if not spread the fire. Water is everywhere in the game. You'll be trudging through sewers, walls will have water slicking down them and of course broken pipes. You can't run or jump while in water, although there was one time where I felt like I could. Maybe the water wasn't deep enough. Speaking of jump, its the most hilariously pathetic jump I've experienced. Yet while holding run and jump suddenly you shoot forward. I blame the Unreal engine. Even with all the water, you won't be swimming or anything other than walking and shooting.Overall, the game has silly glitches. Dead werewolves get stuck in the ground. Bullets can hit invisible walls when on staircases. Soldiers have incredible aim. Health is tough to come by. Ammo is too plentiful. I never ran out unless it was rockets. No saving, just check pointing. People in the forum and elsewhere complain about game breaking glitches, but I never ran into any. The graphics look foggy yet great. The cut scenes are unskipable. It has an air of AAA yet not AAA. Yet after all that, I still enjoy the game because of its enemies and their interactions. The game has been on sale for 50 cents before. Take a chance. Even if its to say LOLz Call of Duty with mythology.			"

												An interesting game with some amazing visuals.  For once we get a fresh take on battling monsters, instead of taking place in the far flung fantasy filled past of wizards or knights, or in a galaxy far far away in some doom wannabe, we get a game that lets us take on mythological creatures of the past in the modern world.  This game does have bugs, its not perfect, and the controls are kind of shot.  Some strange bugs encountered was that the sun in the sky would appear through objects or when in an enclosed room or tunnel and one gamebreaking bug at the end of the game.  The game played with a keyboard and mouse is way to easy.   The controller controls arent great they skate around and the look or aim seems to often fly all over.  While normally I would hate that, this isnt a platformer where any precise jumps are required.  In a way the bad controls added to the challenge.  Somehow the floaty controls for aiming made me feel like I was there since noone would stay perfect in that situation with their aim.  Multiplayer is dead since gamespy is dead, but the story is fun, many of the visuals of the blown up burned out city are great.  Def worth a playthrough and if its too easy  just exit and change the difficulty.  To pass the elevator glitch that kills you at the end of the game go to ""C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config"" set framerate to 30, then play until the next checkpoint exit and set it back to 300.Rating:  5/10  Value:  $4.99			"

												I don't understand why this game's got such a bad rating. It's very old school similar to Doom, it's linear and you shoot everything that moves. The monsters are cool and the minotaurs can be hard to kill sometimes. I did not encounter any bugs except one, which I agree is game breaking. I took forumer ZanyCynic's advice below and was able to progress without any issues.To fix the Elevator bug, Open the PandoraEngine.ini (on vista it is on C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config-Folder) and search for""MaxSmoothedFrameRate=300"" and change the value to 30. So the game runs at maximum 30 fps. Play through to next check point save then edit it back to 300 and continue game.I got this for 99 cents and it's well worth it if you pick it up during a sale. I defnitely recommend playing it if you like old school games like Doom, Quake and Farcry 1. "

												I don't understand why everybody hates this game. Sure, this is an ultra-linear FPS that almost plays like a railshooter, with mediocre graphics. I understand people that got mad by purchasing this game on full-price when it came out, but I got this game for two dollars, and it was totally worth it. It's a fun game, with a badass soundtrack, and the best intro that I have ever seen.			"

												This game is better than most people say it is. I think it's a good thing this game got so much bad press, because you will go into it expecting crap, and you will be surprised by how not crap it is. Actually, you'll probably be amazed at all the scripted events and chaos and enemies lurking about. A griffon causing havoc, breaking into buildings and nearly taking your head off, another griffon flying through a cathedral... truly... this is some fantastic stuff for a game released in 2008. And it looks good too.Also, Legendary touches upon a story that, when you see Pandora's Box as a symbol for genetic splicing, is all too realistic and believable. I think this scares the haters and they don't want to admit it, so while in fear they just hate. For FPS games, this is pretty good. Granted, it's not the most engaging, but if you play the game with the mind that that awesome fireman's axe is your primary weapon and what you use for most of the game, believe me, this game all of a sudden becomes very engaging and worthwhile. The guns are pretty good, but there's something lacking in engaging enemies with them, but that axe... it's all about that axe and hunting werewolves with it. A good challenge is to face the first Minotaur with the axe. Grenades and molotovs are very welcome to use, but always weild that axe.The enemies, not including the humans, are also really well done. The Nari are very well scripted and a real treat to witness and axe to death. They go around lifting things and throwing them at you. They appear in front of your face and do a little mockery dance. They lift soda machines and cause the soda cans to fly out at you. The Nari truly make this game really enjoyable. Of course, they are an enemy, but a very unique enemy. It's obvious a lot of love went into creating them. Also, there's that game-breaking bug at the end, which solutions have been made available by players.If this game ever got achievements, it would only need one. I challenge all you players to earn it:Legendary - Beat the game weilding the fireman's axe for at least 80% of the gameThis is how you make a decent game more fun. Enjoy.			"

												Here's a game with an interesting premise that falls flat. Gunplay is wonky, ADS is hard to control (and seems pointless anyway). Combat is, well, boring. Enemies have rudimentary AI that's easy to overcome. Human enemies tend to stick behind cover with their heads sticking out and stationary, making them easy one-shot kills. The constant werewolves are easy to take out with automatic fire, and if you have trouble with a minotaur, use a flamethrower. Ammunition is more than abundant, meaning that, even if you didn't have super-human accuracy, you'd still not run out. Constant ""hold button to open door"" prompts severely interrupt the flow of gameplay and probably are a result of consolitis, the press-and-hold prompts being a way to allow consoles to catchup on load times. Multiplayer is Gamespy-reliant, and thus non-existant. Also, there's a bug in the last elevator that causes you to fall through the floor, either killing you or leaving you falling forever. Since the devs won't fix it (claim they can't fix it), here's a solution I had to find. Open PandoraInput.iniChange Bindings=(Name=”PageDown”,Command=”dummy”) to Bindings=(Name=”PageDown”,Command=”walk“)Change Bindings=(Name=”PageUp”,Command=”dummy”) to Bindings=(Name=”PageUp”,Command=”ghost“)When you fall through the floor of the elevator, hit PageUp to go into noclip (ghost) mode, then follow the elevator. Get out of noclip mode when you catch up with it (PageDown). What should have been an amazing game with an excellent premise turned out to be about seven hours of just ""meh"" gameplay with an ending that has no resolution and promises a sequel we'll probably never see.If you see it for 50 cents, consider it, but only if you have nothing else to play in your library.

I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND THE INCREDIBLY NEGATIVE REVIEWS.(here I'm expressing my strong disagreement with the negative reviews, if you're not interested in this, just scroll down for the actual review)1. I don't get it. What did people expect to get for 3 EUR? BordeIands 2 or Bioshock Infinite? Maybe Fallout 4? This game now normally costs 3 EUR, but during sale even less. I paid 0,74 EUR during a sale, (some got it for even less in bundles, etc.), and this is not even half as much as you would pay for a cup of coffee in a bar. Still, I have to say after I played the game for about an 1,5 h, I have already felt like I enjoyed myself much more than I would drinking a cup of coffee... 2. This game in many ways really feels like I'm playing an AAA title from 2008 - it is that good. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you compare this game to other FPS games on Steam in the same price category, most (if not all) are not nearly as good as this game.You don't believe me? Check for yourself, these are the best FPS games that are under 5 EUR, check among them the ones that are normally priced 3 EUR or less and compare. So?http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Reviews_DESC&tags=1663&category1=998&filter=ut2The point is, don't expect BordeIands 2 or Bioshock Infinite for a regular price of 3 EUR or less, but the game, despite being a somewhat mediocre & linear FPS, is still really good considering the current price tag.3. I realize this game can be a little confusing sometimes, but fact is this is not the only game on Steam where you might eventually need to check a gameplay video to be able to progress. There are countless of puzzle, point & click and even some FPS games where you'll at some point need to turn to a gameplay video for a little help. I think the game is good and fun to play despite this drawback.4. I also realize the game has some bugs and some people have reported having serious problems with the graphics suddenly becoming weird for no apparent reason (didn't have this issue myself), but there is a way to fix this:


How to FIX the clay texture/Low resolution problem. 
A Guide for Legendary
By: Crystal Bullet

			Hello and Welcome. If you're like me You purchased Legendary the game and Were hoping to get a good expierence from playing the game.		


5. Last but not least, some people have criticized the game for not having any story, but most of them haven't played the game for longer than 30min. Fact is this game has a good story, but it becomes revealed as you play. Furthermore there are many FPS that ACTUALLY don't have any story, but still have very good reviews on Steam and are quite popular, one example that comes to mind is Quake II - one of my all time faveroute FPS.So in conclusion to the ranting part of my review, I want to say, that if this game was 10 or 20 EUR, I could somewhat understand the negative reviews. But if you can get it for 3 EUR or less... as far as I'm concerned - it's a steal. GREAT GAME, really feels like an older AAA title.THE REVIEW: (the rating is considering the regular price tag the game has in time of writing)+ Graphics & Atmosphere: 10/10 (good atmosphere and really good graphics for a 2008 title - didn't age badly)+ Gameplay: 9/10(the game is a port, could be better, but generally the controls are good, experienced no issues worth mentioning, only minor ones like the aiming with the sniper gun being a little awkward, etc.)+ AI: 10/10(I found the AI surprisingly good for a 2008 game title in this price category)+ Story/Plot: 10/10(starts with many questions unanswered, but becomes more and more clear as you progress - overall good and different, not generic IMO)+ Voice Acting: 10/10(overall feels professional, as you'd expect from an AAA title)+ Settings / Options Menu: 10/10(had no problems with the settings/options menu - more or less what you'd generally expect in a well made AAA game)+ Fun Factor: 10/10(the games did not feel repetitive or boring)+/- Quite linear and somewhat mediocre.(but that didn't bother me, the game is still fun and I enjoyed playing it)+/- FPS elements variety isn't wast.(the opponents are not very varied, but IMO varied enough and also original, consisting mostly of mythological beings that entered our world from another dimension and are now wreaking havoc AND while the variety of weapons is not big, it does slowly grow as you progress, though you can carry only 2 different guns/pistols)+/- The game autosaves on save points. (if you die, you can restart from the last save point - the save points are well placed and frequent, so I had no problem with this)+/- Some cutscenes put INGAME.(there are instances where instead of making an actual cutscene, the devs decided to make something happen as you play (like a mythological creature attacking innocent people), but when you try to take part in the happening, you can't (like trying to save somebody from being killed, but your bullets are ineffective, because it is actually a cutscene) - I think the idea behind this is really good, but the execution... not so much.- The tutorial at the beginning of the game is good but doesn't teach you one very useful thing...(despite the game being very linear you might sometimes find yourself feeling lost / confused about where you're supposed to go next - if this happens to you, just press Q and a blue sign will appear to show you where you're supposed to go)- Be prepared to sometimes have to look at a GAMEPLAY VIDEO to know what you're supposed to do to progress. (there are instances when you might be unable to progress because of the puzzles in the game or because the game doesn't make it clear what it expects of you... for example there's a puzzle in the game, that involves shooting/destroying few barrels to be able to progress, but generally when you shoot things, most are not affected (so the game contradicts itself in this sense and confuses the player), OR you're suddenly trapped in a room and need to break a window to get out (totally unexpected solution for me) OR a griffin attacks you on a bridge and the squad commander shouts ''get off that bridge!'' but you can't, the solution is actually to use your special power to make the griffin fall off the bridge - otherwise it will kill you)- Graphics & Elevator bug(didn't experience the graphics bug myself, but there's a fix in the forums - I shared the link at the end of the first part of my review AND there is also a bug where on the elevator to the last level you fall through the floor, but you can bypass this problem by simply walking/running towards the back of the walls of the elevator and not stopping as it's going up - do this and the elevator will successfully take you to the top)CONCLUSION:Despite a few bugs and confusing moments, this game is still fun and quite enjoyable. IMO a very good game considering the price. I definitely RECOMMEND this game for purchase to anyone, who generally enjoys FPS and doesn't mind playing a very linear & somewhat mediocre, but also in many ways fun and interesting FPS title.

												I wish Steam had a neutral button.The Story, random guy has to steal the box of pandora but opened it by curiosity (or had to open it, idk it doesnt change anything) -> legendary creatures invade the capitals of some countrys -> you need to save itIs quite generic but also thanks to the creatures such as gryphons, minotaurs and werewolfs it had potential.Pro:- Recource System.  Once you killed a creature of the pandora you get energy that can be used as a knockback skill or selfheal. - The groundskeeper tbat randomly cleaned the military base in the middle of the game although the whole world is about to collaps (he sure likes his job, i enjoyed watching him ^-^... the fact that he is in the pro says pretty much all about the rest.. doesnt it?)- Atmosphere of the surface (shame you get to play mostly in subway stations and others so you cant see the scenery that much... destroying world seems to be nice)- The cracen as Boss was quite spectacular... RELEASE THE CRACEN!  (although he was not realy hard...)- The first time you get to face Minotaur and Gryphon as a enemy (miniboss), the feeling of the fight actually is pretty nice. After the first one you simply nuke them with rocket launcher or getlingun and that makes it quite dull again.Cons:- The last lvl has a BUGG where you have to change the maxframerate to 30 or you will get bugged in the elevator- too less monsters (you mostly fight against werewolfs... which first seem to be a nice enemy as you have to execute them, but you will soon notice that you do not need to lasthit him with a meleweapon but still simply shoot him... lame) - You actually fight more military men than monsters- The synchro is not that good (some maybe will think otherwise)- Whole game is based on checkpoint data which means that nothing is random in the world but actually spawns for you at the right moment... the checkpoint part also occurs for the military guys you get as support... they die about 1 or 2 minutes after you get them by default (mostly even secounds after you get them).... all... the....time..... that gets boring- The scoped version of the weapons is too fast and it is actually therefore easier to aim without scoping at all... (if you are playing ego shooters all the time you might think not so, but at the moment i do not play shooter games that much)- You can barely get out of ammo and therefore the melee weapon is just a style way to killl (most weapon spots have unlimited amount of resupply)- The mobs randomly spawn and sometimes they don't see you at all although you are right in front of them- 3-5 hours of gameplay for 7gb to download is not realy efficient.- Decard can actually jump like 5-10 centimeters high... that is so unrealistic and makes it quite clear where you have to go..- The whole world arround you dies, you actually have nothing to fear at all as you are never in a realy huge threat... lame...- probably some points i have forgotten Result:This game is not realy worth to play, BUT when you see it for its saleprice of not even 1€ (0,95 or sth like that) you can pick it up.. this game is so terrible in many stages that it is actually fun to play because it is so bad.It is worth the 1€ but not the 5€ it is soldProbably a 3-4 / 10It had potential to be a good game but the potential was not used correctly so it became a quite bad but still playable (no replay value at all) game			"

												This game is the textbook definition of an ""ok"" game.It plays well enough, is engaging at times, has some interesting mechanics, and has an alright storyline. But that's the thing. Everything is just ""alright"". Legendary sits on the fence between good and bad to the point where it's a bit forgettable. It's not so bad it's good (looking at you Bad Rats), but its not good enough to be memorable either. There are some things I liked though. The graphics aren't stellar, even for the time it came out, but a lot of care clearly went into the environments. Some of them are pretty creative and look really nice. The little magic-y mechanic is reminiscient of Bioshock, but it adds a little something to the game as well. Overall all though the game is just your standard ""pew pew, shoot the monsters"" fare with a particularly dissapointing ending. It may not be horrendous, but its not great either. Unfortunately that puts a somewhat enjoyable game like Legendary firmly in the forgettable category. Still, I'd say the game is worth picking up on sale. Just don't expect too much out of it.			"

												The metascore of 50 doesn't lie.The game is average. It has a gamebreaking bug at the end of the game "" The elevator bug "" there are ways to bypass it but that bug show's the quality of the game itself.The game isn't bad, it's just average and is lacking the fun factor.The pros however are the unique enemies and the world you're in.It's a fine average fps to check out with nice cut-scenes.

												Legendary is a run and gun FPS offering a very crazy short story about unleashing Pandora's Box. There are some interesting enemies and you get some type of superpower to boot. The weapons felt underwhelming.Falling through the elevator out of the map at the end was priceless.I've played better, but I've played a lot worse too.  Good entertainment for the price tag, at least when it's on sale.			"

												Wow... Legendary is just bad. Legendary is just... everything wrong with modern games. Legendary is overly scripted, easy (when it wasn't easy it was just cheap and artificially difficult), boring and out right dumb.So, before I start my rant about this piece of ♥♥♥♥, you're probably asking ""What's this game about?"".Legendary is about cliches. Everything is cliches in this pile of ♥♥♥♥. You play as Deckard, a thief, who is the most boring character ever. ♥♥♥♥ing literally, he just wears a suit and he's completely silent. So Deckard is hired by Lefay, the obviously not evil corporate man, to find and open Pandora's box. Deckard, like the moron he is, finds the box and puts his hand over the big obvious hole and gets his ♥♥♥♥ing hand impaled, imbuing him with the completely boring video game powers of healing and pushing (although it only works on some enemies for some reason), and opening Pandora's Box in the process. This releases the mythical bullet sponges across the grey lands of earth.And this is why the game is ♥♥♥♥. It takes itself so serious. Everything is grey, dull, and desaturated. Even locations like Big Ben are made boring because the devs can't lighten up. One of the only joys in the game I got, in the form of laughter, came when the kracken destroys big ben and you hear one of your friendly face-less troops yell ""It's destroying Big Ben!"" in the background, as if I'm too stupid to know it's Big Ben.As you probably guess, this is one of those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games where brain-dead AI Team mates follow you around, and whenever you enter a new big corridor shooting gallery you always end up on the same side of your teammates, with the enemy humans on the other side, and the werewolves running around doing whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they want. It gets so damn repititive when you realize EVERY level is this... all eight of them... for 4 hours...In terms of just the gameplay, it sucks. The most common enemies are the werewolves. These ♥♥♥♥ers are annoying. If they hit you the camera flips out and flies everywhere. This is compounded by the fact that big red claw marks come on your screen, ♥♥♥♥ing up your vision. It doesn't help the aiming sucks. This is another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ modern game that insists on using ADS and Iron Sights. Now, I have liked games with Iron Sights (Far Cry 2, as one example), but overall they're dumb as a mechanic. It fills up to much of the screen, and the only reason it exists to to slow down the sticks for consoles. But it's a huge problem in Legendary. Why? Because the mouse sensitivity goes to ♥♥♥♥ when you aim down sights (there's no option for it exclusively, either), it's so bad it's near impossible to hit anything while using it. You might just say ""don't use them, fire from the hip"". But you can't do that either, because the accuracy for the guns are so bad if you don't ADS. This led to me just tanking damage to get close to human enemies, which honestly wasn't that hard. It actually may have been harder to play it the way you're supposed to (Given the mouse control ACTUALLY WORKED), at longer ranges, because the weapons suck so hard. I recently played through Far Cry 1 for the first time, which has amazing mouse controls (as it was actually built for M+KB, and not just thrown together like this pile of ♥♥♥♥), and it was actually fun to use the weapons (despite how insane that game is with those trigen ♥♥♥♥ers).So... yeah. All of the mythical bullet sponges feel the same. The alpha werewolves are just soak up more bullets than the regular ones do. Griffins (the like two times you fight one without a rocket launcher, which one hit kills them, by the way), along with the minotaurs, are once again, just glorified bullet sponges. Minotaurs are the worst in the game, by far, as you have to fight two of them EVERY SINGLE TIME after you encounter the first one. And these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can probably take more than 30 shotgun shells to the face, each. The game's Netricsa- I mean PDA says you can do more damage by shooting them in the back (Super creative, I know), but good luck with that. They're almost always facing you, pretty much no matter what.That brings me to the PDA. If you've ever wanted to know how NOT to write video game logs, this is the game for you. There's literally a line that says ""I bet this guy doesn't fart without checking rules and regulations"". Brilliant. Sometimes you can find logs laying around the world. Most of them amount to one or two sentences (Suck on that Deus Ex) that almost have nothing to do with the story and are so laughably written. Look at my most recent screenshot for this game, you'll see the worst one in there (and it's one of the longer ones, too).So yeah, this game suxorz, never buy it, even on sale. The only reason I played through it was I had it back on the 360 in like 2009. As you can imagine, I sold it after beating the first new york levels. I wanted to finally return to it (after I bought it for like a dollar on a sale like two years ago) and see where the ♥♥♥♥ splattered. It was way worse than I remember.There's so many stupid things, like why is Deckard running around in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ suit? Why doesn't his friends at the order of 86 give him a suit of power armor, like everyone else has. I also find it funny that you don't open a single door in the entire game. Yep... not a single one.The only thing I liked was at the last level you could see the head of the statue of liberty in rubble and ♥♥♥♥. It totally reminded me of the poster to Escape From New York.Whatever, don't buy it. It's one of the worst games I've ever played. Going next to Metal Gear Solid V and Alien Isolation on the mantle of ♥♥♥♥.-MandatoryAlcatraz "

												It's decentPro's:Enemy's are interestingMid:Story, narration, and delivery is awkward but cheesyCon's:Weapon varietyLevel DesignLevel textures sometimes doesn't loadDetails:The enemy designes aren't per say interesting, it's more of how you deal with them.  Some you can only shoot the head, others only the back, others when their mouth is open, etc.  I wish more games did that with their enemies, and sometimes they will react to getting shot.  The story is... interesting but also stupid, the way it's told is kinda forced and kinda half-♥♥♥♥♥ at the same time, a few conversations are interesting but the story is mostly a few cutscenes and some hidden messages all through out the levels.  There are only around half a dozen weapons through the whole game, and there are clear better weapons. The levels themselves are hit and miss, sometimes you'll be powering up something while a team gets your back, other times your wading through set-peices, and other times you have no idea what the hell you need to do to continue forward.  And sometimes when you play for long periods, the textures in the levels don't load; not just on objects like cars or rocks, but whole water-ways, backgrounds, even enemies.You get around 6-8 hours of gameplay from this game, and for that price, I think it's worth it if your looking for something to waste 6-8 hours on, you can do a hell of a lot worse.

												Love the introduction, great gameplay so far, graphics aren't the best but it's unique and I found it great for the best part of 40 minutes. Then I got to a part in the mission where I needed to get ontop of a platform, ended up improvising - after not knowing what to do - and dying to a wooden crate XD, nethertheless I will watch a way around it and to progress onto the next checkpoint. So far I loved it, I do recommend it, especially for monster lovers - demons, flying monsters, FPS, firey, all the rest of it.Wish the introduction let me shoot civilians as it would've kept me entertained as I walked around the vents etc, but then again I suppose I am trying to find a way around the hell-ish world!

												I got this game for 18 cents and it provided me a couple hours of fun. Of course it's not a great game, there's lack of variation in enemies, and it'd be cool if you could get other powers for your Animus arm besides stagger enemies...That being said, the level design is good anf there are really fun moments.The game is very VERY on-rails and linear. It suffers a bit from being a port, and this is very obvious when zooming in and trying to aim with guns, the motion is very jittery and obviously adapted to a mouse from a controller.On the elevator to the last level you will fall through the floor, but I found a way around this simply by running straight into the back of the elevator and not stopping. Doing this will get the elevator to successfully take you to the top.All in all... the story is nothing spectacular, but if you go into your nvidia (or amd) graphics control panel and turn on vsync and FXAA this game still looks rather good and is still rather fun. I wouldn't but it for full price on steam, but if you can get it on sale for under a dollar? I don't see a better way to spend a couple of cents.			"

If you own a logitech device:Disable Logitech software (G-15 keyboard/game panel) before playing (or else face HORRIFIC lag).G-15 Keyboard: This program adds an applet to LCD Manager, open the LCD manager & DISABLE IT, otherwise this game may/will run on O/S start up/log in!Fix aim sensitivity:For some screwed up reason, your aim sensitivity is faster than your normal sensitivity. This may not be the best way to fix it (maybe there's a multiplier somewhere that needs a < 1 value) but this method works!Set up your controls in-game first.Go into UserName\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config\Open ""PandoraInput.ini""Adjust to your preferred mouse sensitivity at line 6. Example:MouseSensitivity=5.600000About line 1121, you're going to modify your ADS command. Follow my example, replacing my sensitivities with ones that you prefer. I found that if you take your base sensitivity and divide by 1.75, you get a good result in game (but this again is personal preference). So I would use 3.2 as my ADS sensitivity (= 5.6 / 1.75). This is what your new line should look like:Bindings=(Name=""RightMouseButton"",Command=""GBA_AimDown | setSensitivity 3.2 | onRelease setSensitivity 5.6"",Control=False,Shift=False,Alt=False)Save the file. Then set it to read only.Now you can enjoy the game 'properly' (or at least more than before :P )Game ReviewYou open Pandora's box. You stupid, sorry @$$ SOB. Now the modern day world has been filled with all kinds of mythological creatures you must fight off, on the plus side you get some special power (you can absorb energy from enemies and use it for attacks or to heal yourself). You get standard FPS weapons: pistol, smg, AR, shotgun, sniper, grenades, and an ax for melee. You have to fight through some mind strange level designs, where it's not quite clear where to go or how to get there. Fortunately you do have a waypoint marker you can bring up, but the levels take some thinking to navigate at times. You have to face some respawning enemies.... (from spawn points you sometimes can destroy) ugh... Which is annoying when you're trying to figure out where to go (or how to open the passage to where you need to go, or find a way around something). To be fair, I must mention though that ammo respawns as well.I haven't gotten very far in the game, so I can't say too much. The gun play isn't bad once you apply the sensitivity fix for ADS. The graphics are decent, the enemies are interesting (nice to fight monsters instead of always more guys with guns). Yes, it's post apocalyptic and yet the police are still concerned with hunting your ♥♥♥ down even though there are all sorts of creatures hell bent on killing all humans... and you're fighting against the monsters and the police still want you dead? Maybe I'm missing something here. I was never one to pay much attention to the story.TL;DR / Conclusion  + It's less than a $1 on sale  + The graphics and sounds are good/decent  + Varied, Interesting Enemies  + Average (but still fun) gun play  -  Navigating levels can feel like a chore at times  + Cool Story, bro. Pandora's box, Post apocalyptic setting in modern day  -  Can be buggy for some users  + If you can't get it to run, there's always steam refunds			"

												The well-known legend of Pandora’s Box demands much more than what Developer Spark created here. Also, it just doesn’t seem right that Deckard is capable of force pushing and draining life-energy, but utterly fails at simple jumping. The single-player campaign is quite short, but full of spectacular and varied scenes. It's a lot of fun, but too linear, and the use of generic weapons, imprecise controls and inconsistent graphics show a lack of fine-tuning.Legendary isn’t the most involved or technically excellent shooter out there, but it’s a fun change of pace with extremely satisfying combat.

												Great game in terms of price and what you get with the cheap price. You play as a theif who is hired to steal an ancient artifact...Pandora's Box! Unsuccessfully you have unleashed an ancient mythological evil across the world. It is up to you to right a wrong. Face off against a cult like human organization and greek mythological creatures. Feels like a B action movie in Hollywood. Weapons are fun to use, plot is actually suprisingly interesting that makes you want to keep playing. As it says in the game description, your enemies are your enemies enemies. How is that for a tongue twister lol. Enviroments are destructable in both New York and London settings.

												To my mind, Legendary was the 21st century equivalent of a pulp fiction magazine.  Pros and cons:+ The story and little cinematic moments offered some enjoyable surprises, and not just of the ""Ha, monster closet!  Gotcha!"" variety.+ I liked the mechanic of absorbing energy (health) from corpses: it made the player character feel supernatural and gave you a reason to care about the carnage you're leaving behind.+ The setting really felt like a city torn asunder by supernatural forces on a massive scale.+ The different cryptid enemies like werewolves and griffins attacked with an animalistic quality that felt very different from, say, a shooter where you only shoot enemy humanoids.- The graphics aren't so much dated or low-tech as they are poorly executed.  Other contemporary games looked better.  In particular, the normal maps are cranked up to an unrealistic degree.- The weapons get the job done, but none of them were particularly original or tactically interesting.- There's little reason to re-play the game.Is it a good value?  Well, I liked it enough to play through the campaign over 7 hours, and as I write this the game is on sale for 49¢.  So that's 7¢ per hour of entertainment.  They know it's not on par with a $60 game, and the price reflects that.  I recommend it on that basis.			"

												The game is good! I don't know why it has such reviews but for 3 euros it's worth it.Here's the good, the bad and my own opinion.+Good atmosphere.+Suprisingly good A.I. considering it can rival some of todays A.I.s.+Great enemies. Unique and well made. Each has it's own pattern and abilities.+Nice level designs. Truly beautful views from time to time.+Good graphics considering it's from 2008.-Technical issues. The notoriuos elevator glitch happened to me, but I read that if you walk towards the walls when it's moving up you'll be fine. I did it and it works, nonetheless this is a glitch and it sucks.-Not a good console port. Especially the aiming part. When you go from normal aiming to iron sights the mouse sensitivity is like 3x more sensitive. Really frustrating.-Uninspired weapons.-Few enemie types (10 - 12).-As all whole the game is a little rough. Little things are missing like the ability to have multiple saves or having a buggy collision from time to time. When rotating a valve you can turn around and go 20 meters away from it but it still rotates. Nothing gamebreaking(except the elevator glitch which is avoided easily), just little stuff which are not well tought out.As a whole it's mediocre leanin towards beign good. It's got mediocre story and characters. For 3 euros I'd recommend it. I don't know what people expect from the game for this price, but you can't find a better FPS game for 3 euros or less than this one. You can start, play for an hour having fun and blowing some steam off and close it. It's that kind of a game. There were sections in the game that were so well made that I stopped and just stared at the panorama. It was really beautiful. So if you play this game don't compare it to a 20-60 euro game. Although rough around the edges Legendary is a good game.			"

												Legendary is that odd little game that stirred up so much disappointment and controversy with FPS fans upon it's intial arrival, but nearly a decade later, is actually much better than a lot of what passes as a FPS game anymore. Granted, this title is still barely Triple-A status, but a far cry from the notorious reputation it garnered. Sadly, this title and the even-more maligned Turning Point: Fall of Liberty both made and broke it's developer Spark Unlimited, which after two failed titles sank into oblivion afterward. This was the far better-looking and far better-playing of the two major-publisher offerings it had, and even though this game's publisher (Gamecock) would also be bought then assimilated into the fold of some larger being, at least for a brief moment it showed that independant developers and publishers could still compete in the Triple-A gaming world. But enough about the back-history, onto the game.Legendary basically tells the tale of opening Pandora's Box, but in a modern setting. The player assumes the role of Charles Deckard, who is cursed with a life-absorbing sigil on his hand after breaking into the museum holding the box and opening it ubeknownst to it's true power. His employer, one Ormond LeFey, wished to unleash the horrors from the box and then wrestle control of them to rule the world with the help of his Black Order. But the Council of 98 (charged with protecting the box throughout history), jumps to Deckard's aid to try and help set things right. Decent and original enough story, just not executed with the most interesting gameplay.Legendary isn't awful, it isn't even bad, it just has very conventional Doom/Quake style blast 'em FPS gameplay against mythological baddies like werewolves, minotaurs, dragons, gryphons, Cthulu-style tentacle monsters, and even evil faeries. The garden-variety shotguns, assault rifles, SMGs, grenades etc. serve their purpose just fine, but if anything is to be a let down here, it's the Human enemies and their almost listless AI that prove to be the least entertaining of targets in the player's travels. Additionally, this game has areas of infiinte monster respawns, arbitrarily intermixed with areas of finite enemies, so the player never really knows if they should (or can) clear the area, or just muscle through in a bum-rush fashion onto the next objective. Another gripe is the cumbersome fire axe Decard caries around the whole game a la Half-Life 2's Gordon Freeman; that weapon could have easily just been an extra fillable slot for something else.Graphics were decried as underwhelming, and I agree that on the console ports, the Unreal 3 engine wasn't properly optimized (as with a lot of mid-2000's third-party titles using the then easy-to-license engine), but on PC, turning up everything to it's highest setting makes Legendary more than sufficiently pretty, if not downright gorgeoous at times, and is one of the better titles I've seen NOT made by Epic Games using the engine. Same goes with the aiming: stiff and oddly wonky on consoles, but smooth and perfectly customizable sensitivity even with gamepad on PC. I think most reviewers were playing this on Xbox 360 anyway at the time, so their arguments hold water for that platform. I remember playing this on 360 and it seemed MUCH worse than the PC version that I almost didn't decide to try due to my bad experience with the console version.Ultimately, this is simple. fantasy-fueled fun that didn't have the right amount of polish or a really hooky multiplayer to reign in enough of the mainstream market, and during a golden era of FPS games where everything was compared to Halo or Call of Duty, that was a massive no-no, in addition to a poorly optimized console port that would end up being the majority of what this game's intended audience played. This should have been more niche, spent a bit more time in the development oven for both the console ports and multiplayer aspects, and maybe Spark Unlimited would be around to this day working on this game's sequels, meaning I would be reviewing the first entry of a franchise instead of a failed attempt to break into the FPS big leagues.

												One of the reviewers mentioned that there should be a ""neutral"" button, too, beside the thumbs-up and down selections. And how right he was! As I have found Legendary relatively mediocre I would not recommend it, but it is not a bad game, at all.Legendary is an interesting FPS. It tries to have a unique story by unleashing mythical creatures on our modern world. Minotaurs and huge werewolves stroll the streets looking for prey. And it's all because of a thief trying to steal an artifact. As there's an order behind all this you can expect to encounter human foes along the hordes of beasts. To make the gameplay a bit more interesting our protagonist has a unique power due to the use of mentioned artifact - this can be used to hurt villains but only after collecting all the energy residue left behind by monsters.There really is not much to say about Legendary. It is a mediocre game but what it was aimed at it achieves very well. There are some nice scripted sequences and some huge boss battles. Using a rocket launcher against the Kraken in London is very entertaining; at one point you come across with a huge griffin beast in a cathedral. I say some of these monster encounters are coupled with the appropriate environment to make these scenes memorable.Too bad you complete the story in a mere 5 hours and Legendary is pretty much done for as multiplayer is not played by anyone. I'd say give it a try if you have an awful lot of spare time and a very open-minded approach to these games.			"

												I have no Idea why people keep giving this ""Meh"" reviews. The game has a decent storyline, a good variety of monsters from diffrent mythologies, and new gameplay elements. The game is about a thief named Deckard. He is hired by a powerful company to open a box in a museum. However, the box is pandoras box, and releases monsters from many diffrent mythologies. The mythological artifacts and creatures are slightly diffrent then the original myths, and the game lets you know about the changes. A minor setback of the game is that you can tell the developers focused more on the werewolves then any other creature. All in all, It's a good FPS with new elements and an original Idea, which I reccomend.			"

But there are lots of problems. You jump like Metal Mario, every single door has a keypad you have to hack into, you just can't open doors, enemies feel like paper, the voice acting is choppy, lots of bugs including a game breaking one that can be fixed from the steam forums.I don't know.

												For those of you who are looking for a completely mindless gaming experience directed by Michael Bays peers. Explosions, everything explodes. No story to speak of, just explosions, guns and some pretty entertaining fire fights. I wouldn't really say I recommend this game (because of it's lack of story and being awfully repetetive), but it was a kind of fun way to kill time.

												A laughably bad, but oddly charming title that sometimes doesn't work but will have you rolling your eyes and chuckling the whole way through.The story sets itself off like bioshock infinite:""Why is he going TOWARDS the lighthouse/pandora's box?""""Why is he opening pandora's box? Is he stupid or something? Has he even heard the ending to the myth?""""Dude, he just unleashed the apocalypse. Ha. Good going, dork.""The game then proceeds to be more-or-less the same kind of campy, stupid, and ridiculous bad gameplay crap-shooters are known for. The game is quite fun at times, but what makes it worth it in my opinion is how laughable it is. I mean, look at those graphics! The fov! This game is a guilty pleasure. It's not quite as ""good"" as chaser or ubersoldier or Red Faction 2 were, but it's well worth a good 45 minutes. Wonderful for let's plays.			"

												A marvelous game from start to finish. After being tricked into opening Pandora's Box, all hell breaks loose. Mythological creatures ranging in origin from Greece to Japan spread across the Earth destroying every major city. You need to make your way to fight the man who tricked you and left you for dead.The animations were so great in this game. In any given Apocalypse, Zombie, or Horror movie/game, nameless soldiers will die. This game is no exception. I almost just wanted to kick back and watch as the werewolves brutally slaughtered every ally I had because it seemed like every time I turned, they were being killed in some new way.And I mean, come on! What other game lets you take down a Gryphon with a rocket launcher?!			"

												For the low price this game has now reached (£2/$3/€3), it's definitely worthwhile.  It's certainly not one of the greats, but it is above average and reasonably fun.HOWEVER:  This is only half the story, and with the developer and publisher both having gone out of business, a conclusion is almost certainly never going to happen.  That said, the story is mostly contained and doesn't end on a major cliffhanger.			"

												You can try this game  if you want to play a simple FPS : go there , kill the things , go there , activate that thing or shoot that thing and you can go further , not really a lot to explore : ""tunnel FPS"".  Average game but it's rather good for its price and its age, I mean how many times have you bought some old game to discover that the pixels hurt your eyes and that the gameplay is horrible. You don't have to notice the lore,  it's a plus for simple Shooty game . You don't have to think too much so it's a relaxing game for when you just want to destroy a few werewolves or toad-fire-monsters.The healing system is original , you don't regenerate like in modern games and you can't find medikits, you have to harvest the magic energy coming from dead monsters but that energy can't be found on the human soldiers you have to kill too, so sometimes you have to strategize who or what you want to kill first if you need to heal up  but that side of the game is minor because the game is not that hard in normal mode ( I've not tested any other difficulty).The only regret I have about this game is that there is not enough different weapons in it and all the weapons are usual ones ( pistol, shotgun, machine gun , automatic rifle, heavy machine gun, bazooka) plus a flamethrower . It's a game about myhtical creatures and ""magic"" energy they could have added exotic abilities or special weapons .Also, if your PC is powerful you're probably going to meet a bug where you fall through a lift near the end , the fix from the steam forum :------------PawPaw 04-04-2009, 11:38 AMhere is a fix that works for most people.Open the PandoraEngine.ini (on vista it is on C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config-Folder) and search for""MaxSmoothedFrameRate=300"" and change the value to 60. So the game runs at maximum 60 fps. Play through to next check point save then edit it back to 300 and continue game.If a setting of 60 does not work try 30.Game will not run so good but it's only a short level to next checkpoint where you can then reset back to 300. --------- "

												Legendary: The Box is a 5-hour linear Call of Duty style cinematic setpiece FPS. You play as a dude who is hired to open Pandora's Box by an Evil Mad Scientist who runs some sort of Private Mercenary Cult. When you do, monsters come out. The monsters including werewolves, minotaurs, and gryphons. And the Kraken. In the second level, you kill a giant trash golem that wrecks time Square. The Kraken wrecks Big Ben. In the end, you overload Pandora's Box with Cyber Energy or something and then the bad guy dies. The ending sets you up for a sequel where, like, your Cyber Energy lets you control the monsters and as it turns out the good guys were a bad evil government or something all along.The shooting is not particularly good. Enemies are a bit spongy and don't react to being shot, except Alpha Werewolves, whose skin starts to fall off. Both types of Werewolves need to be decapitated or they will revive themselves, doing so with the axe is pretty fun the first few dozen times. Unfortunately since they're one of the game's main enemies, it gets old. Quickly. AI is pretty weak. Guns: Assault Rifle, Machine Gun, Rocket Launcher, Shotgun, Pistol, end-of-game Flamethrower, axe. You can carry two at once. The boss fights all have unlimited ammo rocket supplies near them. Hmm.There are no real branching paths, even areas that should be open have debris blocking your way so you're funneled through the linear intended path. You go through sewers. It hits all the clichés. Occasionally you stop to push a switch or turn a valve or fight waves of enemies until the game decides to let you go on. There are data diaries you can pick up. They have riveting anonymous text like ""We're going to have to take a run for it the monsters are everywhere"". The PC version does not have achievements and there is no in-game incentive to find the diaries. I stopped reading them after a level or two.The game would have taken me less than 5 hours, but the checkpointing is pretty poor so expect to repeat long walking segments when you manage to get yourself killed at the end. I also ran into a 100% guaranteed bug just before the last checkpoint of the game that causes you to fall through the level geometry. To solve it you need to edit an INI to either bind a noclip to some control or to cap the framerate of the game at 30. This did not endear me to the game. It is well documented on Steam discussion forums.One of the more positive reviews of the game claims it's 8 hours long. I'm sorry, it's just not. It just isn't. Again, I died a bunch and fell through the game's geometry a bunch at the end and had to restart and fiddle with that and I got to a hair over 5 hours on Normal difficulty. It's not an 8 hour game.The game has a hard rock soundtrack and a pretty bad attitude. It's almost a horror FPS except that it's not scary, it's just... abrasive. Like you're constantly being yelled at, I guess. It's very loud. There are sporadic moments that are sort of inventive but mostly they're covered by sort of a very generic game shell.Did I hate it? Well, no, not really. It's functional. It probably doesn't deserve a 50 Metacritic when there are games that are similarly bad or worse and have 25 points higher because they have big name IP or had big publishers. Like, Homefront has a 70 average score. If Homefront is a 70, this is a 70-ish. But do I recommend it? Not really. It's not a great use of your time. You're not going to finish it and say ""well, it was rough around the edges but this and this and that were kind of cool"". Like, Walking Dead: Survival Instinct is not a good game, but it at least tried and failed to do stuff. Legendary doesn't really feel like it tried, most of the time. I didn't try the multiplayer, which is a GameSpy casualty.			"

I decided to play the game thinking it would be alright, setting other reviews behind as to not notice the flaws. The game itself was not very bad, but the mechanics were not great. Some of the fighting kind of annoyed me at times. Got stuck in a couple different rooms with tough enemies.

												Good day together, I have seen a lot of reviews with less than 1 hour playtime and I wanted to finish the game at least before I write my opinion here. Sadly  I wasn`t able to finish the game but I will write what I think.Story (short version..): You stole Pandoras Box and opended it. Suddenly you got superpowers from opening the box and a lot of monsters got summoned to the earth. Like Drakes, Griffins, Ghosts, Werwolfes and stuff... A bad guy wants to controll them and you are the only one who can stop him. Gameplay: The graphics are ok......For a 2008 game at least. You can sprint 10 metres than your character is breathing like he is going to die. The jump is sometimes completly broken, you cant jump over 20cm obstacles.The weapons are nothing special, you have a pistol, small machinegun, big machinegun, assaultrifle, flamethrowers and 2 types of grendes and a rocket launcher.Whats most annoying is that sometimes you dont know how to proceed. There are endless spawning enemies, do I need to fight or to run? Sometimes you need to kill a certain amout of enemies so something happens, And sometimes you just have to kill the spawner of the enemies to proceed. If you dont do exactly what the game wants from you, you die. Jump over a wall you shouldn`t = kill. Solve a ""puzzle"" otherwise than planned = kill. Thats frustrating and very sad coded. Before I just list some points that were cool on the game or sh itty I have to say  that I COULDN`T FINISH THE GAME. Because in the last level on an elevator I ALWAYS fall through the map and die. Loaded the map several times and I couldn`t fix the bug. That was the time to uninstall for me. If something serious like this doesn`t get patched you know how much the devs care about their game. Positive aspects of the game:+ The music was overall very awesome.+ The scenery was well done with all the nonstop explosions and the feeling you are really in a war between factions. + The other soldiers who mostly follow you give you a feeling that you arent alone in this ""war"". + Funny ideas like, you try to open a door but you can`t because suddenly a ghost appears and took away the handle, made me smile at least. + Story is ok to understand and you know at least what you are fighting for. - KI incredible stupid and own allies completly useless. - Enemies are bulletsponges like hell. A centaur and griffons are able to absorb 2 minutes of nonstop gunfire which is just dumb.- Named allis got too less of personality that you could care about them. - Jumping is broken and you feel like you can`t even pass a blade of grass. - TOO much ammo around every corner. - The superpowers feel really useless. The nonstop absorbing souls to heal the own life is just more annoying than fun. Medipacks would have done the job I guess. Potential wasted there...- 9000! Wasnt able to finish the game due to a gamebreaking bug where I always fall through the ground...Peace Hexor.  "

												This game could have been a great game. Just see Shadow Warrior, it has almost the exact same storyline but is amazing. However, there were some things that make this game bad.Jumping and iron sights are broken. You jump either one foot or 30 feet depending if you hold down the run button or not. It's completely random.Iron Sights are not affected by changing the mouse speed. So if you're like me and like a slower scroll you suddenly are all over the map with iron sights. I was literally getting motion sick briefly at times.RNG fights. The giant squid or Kraken attacking seems to be mostly random with the deaths. I hate RNG in fights.The jumping puzzle early on in the game at the warehouse. This is because of course jumping is broken. This is beatable but frustrating.The infinite mobs. You don't see this in modern games too often for a reason. People like to clear areas.Not much variety of enemies. All of mythology and you have werewolves, minitaurs (five of them), tentacles, ghosts, lava monsters and that's it... all of mythology and that's all? And of course the obvious fraud. Yes, Fraud. They sell a game that is unfinished and will simply crash on most people's computers. I'm going to try a few more times for this elevator bug but this is fraud.			"

												Let me start buy saying that i got this game for 18 cents and went into it with absolutley zero expectations and came out really enjoying it. this game started off a little rough with cutscenes in low resolution and only 30 fps, and the story was really sub-par with a overused story, but then around 2 hours into the game it really opened up and provided me with an intresting setting and weapons that are actually fun. It also brought in some nice ""spooky"" elements of a Graveyard and a underground sewer with werewolfs. Sadly at this point and I have not finished it and so i cannot say anything about the ending and or conclusion, but the story is definitly not the strongpoint of this game and is not a reason to buy it. but all in all it might me a game to keep on your radar and maybe even buy it during a steam sale sadly i cannot recomend this game att full price and as i went into this game with no expectations i suggest you do too.

When that portal opens in the sky, you will probably stand and look at it for a minute and take in how pretty it is. This game is also kind of clunky and as a shooter, is as generic as it comes. The general narrative is pretty interesting, but they could of done so much more to really pull you in. While this game is clunky and generic, you will probably enjoy the graphics more than the gameplay.

												Yes it was short. It was still fun though. Also, I don't know why everyone was freaking out about the werewolves. You can shoot their heads off. You don't need to whip out the axe every time.The one issue I had was an elevator near the end, that no matter what you do, you fall through and into the void. I found a fix in a forum somewhere that involved changing a config file.$10 or less.			"

												For the £0.59 price tag this game is more than worth the cost. It may now be aging but the visuals can still be impressive and the story enjoyable. The cut scenes seem edited with a cleaver but again, the price makes this so very easy to overlook.  I suggest buying on offer and for hours of gameplay the hourly rate you pay with this price is a mere pitance.			"

												Legendary, um jogo de FPS com uma quantidade boa de armas, inimigos legais e bons momentos de ação. Roteiro legal, mas parece que se enrrolaram todo no final e deixaram para uma possível continuação que pelo que parece nunca irá acontecer.Este jogo vale a pena se comprado em uma promoção como eu fiz por não ser um jogo extenso, finalizei com 5h de gameplay.Possui um glitch terrível no final do jogo, quando vc tenta pegar um elevador e o mesmo vai embora e vc cai..¬¬Recomendo para quem curte FPS que envolva um pouco de fantasia.Nota: 8.0/10.0PS: Como resolver o glitch se encontra em uma das minhas imagens do jogo.

												I bought this game for around 70 cents, so I'm going to give it a thumbs up.Do you like mythology? Do you like mythological creatures?Well I sure hope you do, because this game is literally throwing all sorts of mythos at you with no legitimate reason at all. Sure, Pandora's Box opened and is unleashing hell on New York, but who really cares? Well obviously you do since you were branded by Pandora's Box and now have the power to absorb the creature's life force. Jewish mythos? There. Greek mythos? Obviously. Irish mythos? Why not! Heck it even has the mythological creature of obscure cultrures. Thanks, Legendary.Why did all of this happen? What did New York do?Well okay, you're some sort of person who does dangerous and odd jobs. For example, mowing the lawn for that old lady who lives on the incredibly steep hillside. Your back's gonna need some time to recover from all that leaning. But really, this old rich dude is obviously the spokesperson of white capitalism and asks you to insert a key into Pandora's Box. Because unleashing hell for about $10,000 is a good investment, right? Of course it is, Deckard.All in all, I give this game a 7/10. The gameplay is dull, the voice acting is alright I guess, and the graphics aren't anything to write home about. Though the real seller for this game is the fact that those GRIFFONS LOOK SO MENACING AND COOL LIKE HOLY COW I WANNA HAVE THAT GRIFFON'S MYTHOLOGICAL HUMAN-EAGLE-LION BABIES. And ♥♥♥♥, it was 99 cents. Not really, it was like 70-something.			"

												By far one of the worst games I've played in the last decade.It's amazing how this game excels in complete and utter mediocrity, it seems the 'designers' went out of their way to get pretty much everything you can get wrong in a game, wrong.Some of the highlights:- Horrible mouse controls, insane mouse acceleration on iron sight (making it pretty much impossible to hit anything)- No FOV slider, and the FOV is way too narrow.- Horrible animation, characters are clunky and actions are often without purpose.- Terribly bad and uninspired level design.- Even on release it looked very much outdated.- Overall design is uninspired and without any direction or artistic vision.- A bug that has never been fixed even to this day, that prevents you from actually finishing the game. Without editing the settings file so you can noclip/ghost through the walls (if you even make it this far) this game can't be finished.- Absolutely horrendously placed collisions (the dreadful jumping in this game even exacerbates the problem.)- Terrible play time padding mechanics (keep E pressed for 10 seconds to open a door)- Sprinting with a cool down that last longer than you can actually sprint (which is about 2 seconds, it's like you're playing with an asthmatic 70 year old chain smoker.)Anyway, you get the point.It's  amazing that I can actually think of not one redeeming quality this game might have, absolutely none, which is actually quite the achievement.Actually, that's not true, the one redeeming quality that this game has is that the play time is so short (4 hours), you might actually finish the game before giving up in utter boredom or disgust.Avoid this game at all costs, even if it where offered for free.

												I'm very disappointed in this game on pc - played it first on xbox and loved it. I love the griffons and other creatures involved, liked the story, and even the achievements were fun (and full of puns). But this version is very buggy, gamebreakingly so. It really destroys the experience to play this on pc. The Steam version doesn't have achievements either which would not be as disappointing in every game, but was disappointing in this one because I know achievements already exist for it, just apparently not here. As a game I'd recommend it, because it's fun and cool and has excellent griffons and is different from the usual and their achievement puns are the best, but as a game on Steam I would not recommend it for any price as it is broken (as in, unable to complete the game due to unavoidable bugs). So, no, I do not recommend *this* game. Go try it on xbox!			"

												Legendary is interesting game to say the least. You play as Deckard a theif hired to steal Pandora's Box. You then end up unlocking the box and releasing Legendary creatures to cause havoc among the world with the new found power you gained from the box it's up to you to stop what you had set in motion.The power given to you is the ability to absorb the spirits of fallen creatures and either use it to heal yourself or push enemies out of your face. The enemies themselves are pretty interesting and varied. The Werewolves are certainly a favorite of mine because Werewolves won't stay dead unless decapitated, meaning after knocking one down you have to go and chop it's head off before it gets back up, unless of course you were aiming for the head then with a well placed headshot they won't be getting back up. The weapons feel a bit weak and one even sounds like a laser gun but that doesn't mean they are weak. there is a decent enough mix of weapons to change up how you play but it doesn't really matter once you find something you like you will most likely stick with it. Also ammo is scattered all over the game so don't worry too much about it however don't just go around soraying down corridors either.Speaking of corridors this game is VERY linear. it's a straight forward path the entire wa through. Now for me this isn't nessicarilly a bad thing but for others it may be an issue especially for those who enjoy exploring.TL:DR I enjoyed my experience with Legendary and it may have some things that turn people off I still like it and recommend it especially given it's current price. Side note just wanna go ahead and say it I feel like this game deserves a reebot. With the technology we have today we could improve this game perhaps make it more open don't make Deckard a mute character and tweak the enemies a bit and it would make a great new gen game.			"

												This could have been an amazing game if it had another year worth of all types of work.Let me just say the concept, idea, and storyline behind this game are very smart, well thought out, and creative.But the overall gameplay and execution of the game isn't the best. It is lacking, and a bit dull sometimes.The single player is short, but the ending was something to crave and leads to a possible sequel.Overall a very good game, if you can get it on a sale, definitely buy it. If you are me, even on hard mode, you can beat the game in about 6-8 hours. "

												For a game that came out in 2008, during a time when it had a lot to compete with in the shooter genre, Legendary was suprsingly good! There wasn't much to do with games then as AI was limited and graphics were too but the devs definately made a playable combination of diffculty and entertainment. If you like mythology and big, violent creatures tearing people apart, this game is for you. If you get bored VERY EASILY with linear gameplay, this game is not for you. It was 2008 when this came out, remember, there weren't a whole bunch of open ended games then. If I could fix two things, I would have asked for more weapons/animus abilites and better collision detection. There are times where you're running in a straight line to escape an enemy and you suddenly stop - not because you meant to but because your character got stuck on a penny-sized bump on the sidewalk or a plant. Seriously. Other than those two minor hiccups, the game was great for what it was and when it was made. Over all, 8/10. 2 points off for aforementioned problems/issues.			"

												I originally bought a boxed copy of this game on a whim in Jan 2009.  I had never seen it before and it looked different from the usual fare so I decided to give it a try.  I really enjoyed it, despite a few bugs.  It received some really bad press from IGN and Gamespot, which is odd because when they previewed the game's beta they gave it high marks, so I'm guessing Spark Unlimited couldn't pay for a good review the way some of the larger devs can.  I no longer trust review sites.I'm going to set the record straight.  Legendary is a pretty good title that's been largely overlooked.  Gameplay is familiar in that it's a fairly straight-forward shooter with a few puzzle elements thrown in.  You get everything from a fire axe to anti-aircraft missiles for an arsenal and gun-toting baddies to a 20-story collosus and everything inbetween for enemies.  If you like running and gunning and fighting monsters with the whole world falling down around you, give it a try.  It's only $10.			"

												This game feels like it is only half finished. From the storyboards used as cutscenes, to the sticky controls (I use an xbox 360 wired controller and the analogue controls are extremely jerky) this game looks as though it could have been a real gem but constantly falls short. There are times when your character literally get's stuck on a ramp or a step, because the programmers haven't made the blocks fit properly. The controls regularly let you down as well, such as the jump (which is the worst jump feature I have ever seen, it's practically a hop) which you can press and time to climb over something and yet you simply don't. The story starts of well, but by the end it is clear that the writyers have no real idea what they are doing and it pretty much goes to hell quickly. The missions have you jumping around the globe in an instant and the storyboard cutscenes do a really poor job of showing you any sort of time passing. The ending of the game just sort of happens as well. It doesn't really explain (at least very well) what your role is in stopping things, you just have to use your powers to overcharge a computer that is connected to Pandora's Box..... Which personally I find pretty funny considering this is based on a Greek myth and so I would have figured that there would have been a more magical and godly way to close the box, but apparently not. Finally, the main reason I am leaving a negative review....I could have lived with everything I have said up until this point and whilst I wouldn't have recommended the game, I wouldn't have complained either. However, right at the end of the game there is an elevator that is simply broken. You stand in the Elevator to go to the final platform, and your character falls straight through and into nothing, seeing the worldspace dissappear into black above you. I looked this up and it is a known issue that has been complained about since what I am assuming is release (2012). There are posts that claim there are ways to fix it, but none of these fixes worked for me. Frankly though, I shouldn't have to fix a game that has been out for at least 4 years anyway. This is a gamebreaking bug and the developer has quite literally ignored it and ignored the complaints that it has triggered. This is unacceptable and frankly it is disgusting. The only way I could complete the game was by using a noclipping (walk through walls) hack that someone on the forums suggested. This led me to wander through the world space until I found the next trigger point to be able to continue the mission. Again, this is pathetic and unacceptable. Do not buy this game. Whether it is £10 or 1p, I would not recommend paying for a game that is riddled with bugs and where the developer clearly doesn't care. Save your money and buy something from a studio that cares about the product that they release.			"

												A decent cinematic FPS compareable to Half-Life, Bioshock or Metro from its gameplay, pacing and progression making you traverse post-apocalyptic-ish levels by rather indirect means and engaging various types of enemies inbetween.A wealthy/evil entrepreneur leading a secret society tricked you, a silent mercenary, into opening Pandora's Box in modern New York. Mythological creatures assault the world and you traverse broken - most of the time urban - areas in an effort to halt/reverse the spread utilizing the help of another secret society, man-made firepower and a signet that was burned into the back of your hand when you opened the box and that allows you to absorb energy - ""Animus Vitae"" - from dead creatures restoring your health as well as stagger them briefly with a burst of it.The story is rather basic stuff of evil guy dooming the world and you going to save the day. Well, more or less, as the ending isn't as definitive - the devs clearly left room for a sequel which I would like to see as there is sort of a cliffhanger making me a little hungry for more, but I'm not sure if this will ever happen for this seems like an under-the-radar title. The gamebreaking bug towards the end that the devs obviously never got around to fix seems to be a proof of that (there is one workaround or another for this bug, but its still a severe one).Aiming is rather hard for reasons unknown to me. I haven't fiddled around with the options much but I've read other reviewers had similar issues. It's rather imprecise and twitchy. Putting the crosshair on a certain small spot is almost impossible. It's similar to what I experienced in Bioshock. It's doable when shooting from the hip but aiming down the sights or going for specific hit zones (like the heads) can be a pain. Some reviewers argued this adds to the challenge, and while this is true at first glance it's very artifical nonetheless (I could also blindfold one of my eyes or tie one of my hands to my back to increase the challenge).Sometimes I would have hoped for more checkpoints. One boss fight or another and some puzzle-ish scenes with me interacting with various environmental things to open blocked paths while certain enemies ""stalking"" me took me longer than I had expected. It felt a little tedious at times. When I took more care and understood how things worked I got them done though.The characters could have deserved a bit more love. Besides you, the silent mercenary, and the evil businessman there is a somewhat self-confident and sexy-ish female companion (who may remind the player of Alyx Vance - but then she too was an archetype character), some high-ranking military guy advising/ordering you around and nameless field-operatives you wouldn't want to get to know better as they like to get eaten by the creatures. The characters are not bad for what they are supposed to be - they serve their roles and their voice actors are good - but they aren't surprising or too memorable either. Still, despite it's flaws and that one bug it's game that plays out fairly well and consistent from start to end. It holds a decent premise of throwing mythological creatures at the world and the player, providing some nice settings (New York Times Square for example) and being pretty good at creating the ambiance that the world is getting torn apart by those creatures, as there are always griffons, werewolves and other creatures lurking about and stalking the close or distant skies, the roofs and walls, the waters and just about anything else. The fight between the two secret societies with you in the middle of it felt quite believable too. The game takes some effort into teaching mythology by providing brief intel about the creatures you encounter (and how the two societies are related to the whole affair) and putting you into the need to adapt a little when fighting them because their nature gives them certain strengths and weaknesses. There are pickable data logs scattered around the levels too that flesh out their background a little, either informing you about the activities of hostile or allied agents on the field or about former citizens and how they experienced the attacks from the creatures. Had this game gotten more polish and maybe more advertising perhaps it could have been brought to a similar level as Half-Life, Bioshock, Metro or other games of this kind. It's not too far away from that either, however, and in this manner I believe this is an underrated game.			"

												I don't quite understand all the hate. The game is somewhat dated, but it's still ok for it's price. It has a similar rating to CoD Advanced Warfare.. sigh. Anyways. The world is overrun by mythological creatures and it is up to you, the genius that cracked opened Pandora's Box, to save it using the powers ironically given to you by the Box itself.>I'd give it a 6/10>Pros: Mythology was always appreciated by me, it has some nice parts to it and it is rather visually appealing, low price for solid content.>Cons: Buggy buggy, needs hotifxes but it seems to be abandoned by the devs, not very balanced, jumps are lame, I'd prefer fighting a more variated amount of creatures rather than fighting the same couple of creatures and soldiers, if it would've spent less time underground it would've been more impressive.

												What's sad is that this could EASILY be a COOL game, by: Putting in more frequent checkpoints, making those checkpoints appear AFTER cutscenes, being able to SKIP cutscenes, making the healing mechanic faster and nerfing enemy spawn points so enemies don't INFINITELY spawn in most areas.If those few changes were made, this would be a solid 8 out of 10 game. Sadly, what it's ACTUAL score is a 2 out of 10. Those few little problems it has COMPLETELY SUCK THE ENTIRETY OF FUN OUT OF THIS GAME.

												Legendary turned out to be much better than some reviews would have you believe, but I can attest to the game-breaking glitch at the final elevator of unattainable victory, and the fact that Steam will not permit you to cheat in any way to get past it. I tried absolutely everything, but the game itself was patched to prevent these solutions from working.			"

												Reminiscent of BIOSHOCK, the series as a whole, this should be what you're looking for!

												★★★★☆This is a really good game, I have no idea why it has so many negative reviews, the game has awesome monsters, a satisfying beginning and ending, nice gun control, sometimes monsters clip into areas but that’s about the only bad thing that this game has, if you want to experience a fps game with a cool rich mythological theme set in current times this game is definitely for you, I finished the whole game in one day from how much I liked it, 4/5!!!!

												Wow. That was rough. I've been wanting to play this since I first saw it all those years ago. Starts out well enough, then shoves you into corridors and simalar areas for the next hour. There's no reason to have a jump button in this game as your character has less jumping power than a fat kid on a hoverround(hoveround? whatever). Afwul generic platforming, enemies that endlessly respawn every 5 seconds, guns that seem to be less accurate when aimed. Be warned: controller use is funky monkey in this game, turning left seemed to work only when the game felt like it.I'm suprised the devs even released this game, it doesn't feel unfinished, it IS unfinished. There's so much potential here that's just wasted by bad gameplay choices. The reputation this game has is warranted and I wish it wasn't. Don't waste your time or money.I never thought I'd say this, but I want my 75 cents back.			"

It is simply too buggy, I get to a place where an elevator will kill me, and I can't move on in the story. Therefore I cannot write a proper review and have to vote it down, as it is broken. Sad really because the game itself isn't too too bad, but I wouldn't recommend it.			"

												I've tried to like Legendary several different times on different systems and end up turning it off at the same spot. My biggest issue with this game is the fact that enemies keep spawning in the same location untill that spot is destroyed by dumping water on it. Every time I think I cleared an area of enemies, I would then start to work my way to the next area only to be attacked from behind by another. I've only play the game for about 30 minutes and this review is based only on that bit of time. It may be a great game for those who can forgive the respawning enemies issue My score for this game: 4/10			"

												Traditional Rating - 5.5/10Recommendation - Play Singularity instead.This game kind of slides into the same slot as Singularity: Slightly-older, somewhat-obscure, non-AAA shooter. Unfortunately, where Singularity shines, this game falls flat. Where Singularity's story is interesting, this one is bland. Where Singularity's gunplay and enemies are interesting, Legendary's are frustrating. The only exception is the BEASTLY fire-axe, which I rather enjoyed.-The graphics in this game are passable. They fit their purpose, but show their age.-The sounds are actually quite good. The burst-fire rifle in particular I enjoyed.-The voice acting is on the low side of B-movie quality. C+ movie, maybe.-The enemies, for the most part, are quite frustrating. The one enemy I did enjoy is the little rolling brimstone demons. Their AI was fun.Overall, the game is a disappointment. On the high-side, it's generic. On the low-side, it's teeth-gratingly frustrating. For example, let me explain the moment where I gave up on the game:There is a gigantic golem thrashing around the city streets (who for some reason attacks everyone else, but never tries to attack me), and I'm running around charging up EMP generators. Working on the 3rd one, I ran into a building filled with little pixie enemies that can only be hit when they feel like it (they turn ""ethereal"" and seem to only turn solid when your back is turned), and some little will-o-wisp thing immediately possesses the EMP generator and moves it up a floor. After getting slashed in the back by a dozen more of the stupid little pixies, I make it upstairs, slightly charge the EMP, and it moves up another floor. Kill another dozen pixies, run up another floor, charge up some more, EMP moves to bottom floor again. Run all the way down after killing 2 dozen more pixies, charge up some more, EMP moves to middle floor again. Kill more pixies, run up another floor, charge up more, EMP moves AGAIN. Run to top floor, all the while killing pixies, charge up some more, it moves to a new spot on top floor, charge it up some more, and IT MOVES AGAIN! Smash Alt+F4 so hard the USB drive on my desk falls over.That is literally an exact account of what happens in that section. Not one single part of that whole encounter were challenging. The entire thing was just pecking at me. The dumb little pixies posed no threat, except to my patience, and there was no environmental danger either. If there were some increasing level of danger every time it moved, that's one thing, but to move the EMP generator just for the sake of moving it is nothing but busywork.I get that that is just one tiny moment in the game, and the rest of it could be good, but every single part of the game I did see was utterly joyless, and given how badly that one section ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off, I'm done giving Legendary any chances. I did not enjoy it.			"

												I can't recommend this game because I'd feel too guilty for recommending this to someone. MY SOUL WOULD BURN.Being a fan of terribad films, I just had to pick this up and give it a try.This is the absolute epitome of terribad games. This is as good as horrible gets, but it is still pretty damn fun. Don't expect innovation and don't expect optimization settings..because you get neither. Everything that happens is 100% scripted and 100% uninteractive unless programmed so. At it's core it is a semi-solid shooter that does provide hours of amusement behind the monitor.Only pick this up if you're a giant fan of C-flicks. Yeah that's right, not B-flicks, C-flicks.I mean for crying out loud the plot is ridiculous (as all terribad plots are): You open Pandora's Box and unleash a cluster of dimensions upon Earth. It is up to you to eviscerate all of the mythical creatures in your path and confront the overlooming evil.Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat.2.5/10			"

												While at times the concept is taken to a neat place it also suffers from unimaginative set pieces that drag down much of the style. Sometimes the game can host fun firefights while most of the time the level design is linear in a claustrophobic and tedious way. It also suffers from awkward sub-mechanics as well, especially regarding its enemy types.  For instance you have werewolves that you can permanently kill through unusual means, only to face them in situations where they infinitely respawn which ultimately negates the point of killing them off permanently.  Awkward design decisions are plentiful throughout the experience.  Also why would they design jumping puzzles when the player can only jump upwards or two to three feet max?But thats not to say that the game is entirely without fun, there are a couple of neat firefights here and there.  For the most part though it is an jaunt through tedious levels with design that will bore and frustrate the player.  So while there is fun to be had ultimately the majority of the experience is not worth playing.			"

												LegendaryMore like Legendarily bad.This game is about as linear and dull as you can get, the game has some interesting ideas when it comes to health mechanics but they fail to make anything unique of it and just turn it into a poorly done medkit system.The enemies are dull and uninteresting, the set piece moments are all done in gameplay but they're so far away from you that you never get the sense of scale that makes them interesting and you're always safe from their massive destruction that everyone screams about in-game, so it feels more like you're on an amusement park ride than actually being a participant in the world.The guns are also just uninteresting and the game has horrid mouse acceleration and just made me want to vomit.For some reason you can also jump but I don't know why, you only go about 5cm off the ground and at no point can you ever really jump over anything, you're railroaded into a set path sooo much.Legendarily awful.Legendarily sickening.Legendarily BOOOORRRIIINNNG.Legendarily uninteresting story and characters(using the term characters loosely since they have no character at all)LEGENDARILY DULL.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.I bought it for $2.50, played it to completion, and I feel like a victim of highway robbery.

												Legendary is one of those FPSes that had an interesting premise: i.e. fight legendary creatures (griffons and more), but ultimately came away as a Half-life clone, where you go through the world exactly as the developers intended, watch somethings happen in the gameworld (many instances of tentacles of creatures dragging off / killing NPCs) and you can't interfere. While it was fresh and we saw scientist got pulled through ceiling hole and then gibblets came back out. it's no longer so interesting a decade later. Furthermore, the game basically postulated that not only the legends were all real (all the myth like werewolf, tentacles, and much more were real, there are also hidden forces, very well equipped (equipvalent to modern military), that just suddenly get into the city instead of the real military. Ancient secret societies that stayed together forever, and evil mastermind and all that. It's a lot like Underworld, except it wasn't a war between Vampires and Lycans, but merely, Black Hand (evil) and Council of 98 (good), humans vs. humans. Mechanically the game is a normal FPS, albeit with a bit of extra thing about this ""animus"". If you defeat one of these special critters, you get to collect their life force, the animus. It can be used to heal yourself, or to power actual devices (why? Don't they have batteries or generators?)  And I'm only a little in. And there are certainly a lot of these creatures.  You can also use the energy to do a ""stun bolt"". As some of the enemies are infinite respawns, you shold not run out of energyThe game is also dotted with ""environmental puzzles"", most of which are rather simple, and one of the earliest stumpers simply didn't give enough hint. At other times, the ""break the 4th wall"" hint totally broke the mood. For example, how do you kill a werewolf? You ""kill"" it, then cut off its headAll in all, Legendary is a relic of the FPS era, with an interesting premise, but so far, there was little of any fight against the critters			"

												Couldn't force myself to play past the 30min mark. It felt like an Original Xbox title not 360 port. Shiny plastic graphics. Monsters blend into the background. Scripted events that hinder immersion. Level design is mostly 'walk between rubble till you reach dead end and wait 20 seconds for the scripted events to catch up to open the path of more walking between rubble. The worst jump mechanic I've ever experienced. A story that is forced into the game, not by playing, but by reading it through the menus 'PDA.' Only good thing I can say is it has full 360 controller support.			"

												Basically the best worst game I have ever played. While I doubt it was done intentionally, Legendary acheives a level of such rediculousness through its story, bad acting, and general concept that it is an absolute masterpiece and a joy to play. It blends science fiction with the legend of Pandoras box, throws in some random mythological creatures (such as werewolves, griffins, minators..,) and it some how ""works."" The game feels reminiscent of older games like Doom and the outdated graphics work to it's advantage in that light. The controls aren't perfect, and occasionally feel a little ""clunky"" (iron sights less accurate than shooting from the hip,) but you quickly adapt by the time you're through the first level.  I picked this up for less than a dollar and I suggest you do too. It's worth a good laugh and to kill some time. Don't go into it expecting the greatest gaming experience of your life though, go in with the same expectations you would watching a b-movie horror/scifi flick, and you'll have a blast reveling in the sheer absurdity of it all.

												Bought it for the price of a chocolate bar, though not nearly as enjoyable... nicely spoken!I can't even tell, what the worst part might be, because I stopped playing after roughly 20 minutes.You get thrown into a storyline which doesn't even make sense, because ""You know nothing, Jon Snow""... seriously, I felt so uncomfortable because I didn't know what was going on, that I wanted to stop right there.After the start, you need to run through a set of conveniently placed corridors, doors which need to be bypassed, squished humans, several Bug Kahuna Burger-Boxes and so on. There is only one way to go, no alternate routes or anything. Every few steps you need to stop to turn a valve or bypass a door, which takes even more speed from the game than it actually generates.Also, this PDA-system is extremy awkward, since it looks (and feels) like being programmed in 1996.I had my doubts about a game with a metacritic-score of 50 for the price of 0.79€, but it even ""outmatched"" my rather low expectations by far. I mean, what would you expect of a game, in which the protagonist has super powers and accelerates like a Bugatti Veyron, but can't even jump over a dead guinea pig?Right....			"

												This game is so ""meh"" it burns. It kinda feels like it was rushed out to get a wolfenstein feel. It certainly doesn't feel finished at all. I haven't played this much, however, that is with good reason. The game is HORRIDLY boring and mediocre, with horrible pacing and checkpoints. The enemies are horrible paced as well, and with healing being such a major pain to do, and checkpoints being horrible, dying becomes really annoying, really fast. I personally quit the game after watching a long dialogue scene (5 minutes), then fighting continuesly spawning enemies for another 5 minutes. I did just not feel like going through it again.TL;DR:Dont buy this game. It's not fun. It will BARELY last you an hour or so.			"

												In a gaming industry with increasing repetition, it's nice to see a game take a chance with something different, and I think it pays off in Legendary. The mix of enemies is nice, as well as the feeling of being caught in a three-sided conflict. Each of the monster enemies has different strategies, creating some tactical variety. The environments, though not particularly original, suit the gameplay quite nicely (although frequently feeling cramped, there aren't enough big open areas that make for the best fights in the game). Unfortunately, Legendary does feel somewhat lacking in content; there are few weapons, and there's little reason to use anything other than the newest weapons you've found (and only one melee weapon available). While the enemies are varied, there's only a few types; more monsters to fight and more variety amongst enemy soldiers would be welcome. The game is also fairly short, and can be beaten in an afternoon without much trouble (which suits the limited enemy types). Animus powers (the games spells, for lack of a better term) also seem underutilized. Walking away from Legendary, it almost feels like a teaser for a better game that, sadly, won't be coming. Overall, I recommend Legendary for an afternoon of fun; it's enjoyable and different, but it won't blow anyone away.			"

												Ah *sniff* , do you smell that? Its the smell off poor game design. If this game was a potato(its strikingly similar to one), it would be the first potato of the Irish Potato Famine(wiki link here: ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Famine_(Ireland)"" ) that killed of a million Irish citizens between 1845 and 1852. A friend gifted this game to me when it was on sale for $0.74, instead of the normal $4.99 price tag. Even $0.74 is overpriced for this potato-esque game, a potato costs about $.33, instead of buying this game, you could buy 2 potatoes for $0.66, that's 8 cents less than the price of the game! That is like getting two good potatoes for the price of a different diseased potato(the different potato being ""Legendary"" of course). When the game isn't on sale, buying Legendary for it's $4.99 price tag is an even bigger mistake than buying it while its on sale for $0.74. Don't waste your money, buy something that is actually useful and buy a 5 pound bag of Russet potatoes for about $3.99, and a bag contains 11-13 potatoes. So not only is it a dollar cheaper, but a bag of potatoes contains 11-13x  the content of ""Legendary"". Its simple math really, 1 bag of potatoes = 11-13 potatoes, ""Legendary"" = 1 (diseased) potato , so , 1 times 11 = 11,or, 1 times 13 = 13, and thats how a bag of potatoes has 11-13x the content of ""Legendary"". Don't waste your money, and buy potatoes instead #Potatoes2014 #PotatoSimulator2014  One last note, the title of ""Legendary"" is very misleading as the game is definitely not legendary, ""Potato Famine"" or ""Autism in a Bottle"" are more suitable namesPlease, for the sake of potatoes, DON'T buy this gameI'm serious, paying someone $4.99 to kick you in the crotch is a smarter way to spend your moneyHell, burning a $5 dollar bill holds more value, you atleast get a miniscule amount of entertainment unlike playing ""Autism in a Bottle""This concludes my review of ""Legendary"", I hope you had fun			"

												Steam needs a neutral setting, or a slider or something, because Legendary is a strange one. I got it on the cheap long ago, and it's an interesting concept, if nothing else.The game revolves around you, Deckard, who causes the world to be devastated with monsters of forgotten mythology. At the same time, you have parties for and against you, trying to stop you because apparently, they like these monsters to destroy the world, and to help you because the perils of survival rest in your hands. Convenient because you hold the power of Pandora's Box, able to kill or heal with the arcane energy that you recharge by killing your foes and absorbing said energy.I use these fancy words, but the game is just an FPS for the fairness of it. It runs in Unreal Engine 3, making it semi-pretty, but very meh in visuals. The level design isn't exactly impressive, the world around you is crumbled worse than a Call of Duty setpiece. It's all so standard, the only thing driving it is the mythical creatures that attack and your abilities.The game info states that it's a singleplayer game, but it DOES have online multiplayer and support for a 360 controller, although you would be hard-pressed not to use the KB and mouse, since this is a PC title. Obviously, the game's age and lackluster quality means there's basically no community for this game, though.At the time of review, this game is on sale for 3 quarters. Less than a dollar, a couple of trading cards will get you this game.$0.74. For the price, I'd say you'll get more than your money's worth out of it. For the $5 price it would usually hold, I would not recommend it.			"

The mythical monsters were neat for like two minutes, and then just became annoying.  Contrary to anything you would think, it's easy to defeat them.  Werewolves  have a stupid gimmick of only dying permanently if you decapitate them.  There are fire lizards that you can only stem the flow of by activating the water pipe that is always above them.  Griffons appear like twice as fightable enemies, and only one is actually difficult to fight at all.  It works as a game, but is incredibly boring and mediocre.And I swear that this game only has two tracks of music.			"

												There's a clear issue with stupidly hard parts on normal. I genuinely recommend play it on easy. The bigger creatures are very hard to beat on normal difficutly, and you end up swearing at it. It constantly goes from easier bit to incredibly hard bit. Shooting is inconsistent, meaning sometimes enemies go straight down, and others take all eight rounds of the shotgun. It has a lot of, 'where do I go now' and 'how do I do this', moments.Weapons only feel medoicre-average maybe, and they swap positions in your mouse scroll. That means you struggle to find the weapon you want in time. Literally sometimes the axe is bound to key 1, then key 3. Your other two weapons keep changing slot. There's another really nasty insult which is the radio voice chatter. It is infuriatingly squelchy and screechy. In headphones it's pure pain. I do not know how anyone had the audacity to create and put that in a game.Overall it's an average-poor old type shooter. Shame because the idea is average-good. I decided to buy it because I saw werewolves and guns on the Steam store page screenshots. In the sale I bought it for £0.39, so I lost nothing because I easily go the fun back. I have played five hours and am tired of it. I might finish it though, but can't say right now; 50/50. I can't recommend it, and I can understand its poor reviews. However if you play on easy and give a it a once through, I can see genuine fun in it.			"

												Spark Unlimited, the developers of Legendary, were always /at best/ a B-list developer and their previous effort - ""Turning Point: Fall of Liberty"" - was so terrible that when I first played ""Legendary: The Box"", it definitely colored my opinion of this game. But six years later, I can replay this game and appreciate it for its... no, wait, it is still a terrible game. It's just not as terrible as I remember.There are occasional moments of - well, not of brilliance, but perhaps of adequacy - that make the game bearable, but these are overshadowed by the terrible story, characters, level design, gun-play and monsters. The game is extremely repetitive with very little variety in textures, monsters or guns. Even when the developers did throw in something interesting - such as the massive golem in the early levels - it rarely serves as much more than a backdrop to the overused werewolves and salamanders that make up the bulk of your opponents. In other words, I didn't actually get to fight the golem because that might be /fun/. On the other hand, it made me realize that a lot of the other ""terrible"" games I've played over the past few years aren't so bad in comparison. "

												Please, I would like my money back for this game. I think I deserve a refund. Yes, yes, I know this game was gifted to me and I didn't spend any money on it but I would happily give this game back for a full refund of 0 pence. I'm not saying its a bad game, I'm just saying its not worth the money I paid for it, all 0 pence of it. I worked hard for that money and it took me a long time to earn it, I just wish I hadn't wasted it on this game. I could of bought a free to play game with that money but now I have to spend even more money getting lazer eye surgery, because my eyes wont stop bleeding. I've also had to start a Stephen King book colelction. I barely even read but I'm hoping they're all so crap they make me forget about this game. Ooh look at this one! The author text is bigger than the title text! This one must be good!.Overall I give this game a 1/10 for trying.It's like the one disabled kid at the school sports day, I mean you gotta give him something.

												Hands down the worst game I have played. And I have played A LOT of games. I have gone through all the free games on steam, even the really awful ones because I like giving games a fair chance, even ones rated really low. This was just absolutely atrocious and I highly recommend never even laying your eyes on the game unless you want to risk getting cancer,The controls are completely shot, the jumping is terrible, the gameplay in general is ♥♥♥♥ing rediculous and the puzzles are childish. The only things making the game a challenge was the bugs and lack of direction. Even boxs were tougher than werewolfs and the barrels would take half my health when you walked into them.The story was okay and the mythical creatures were cool, I like those kinda settings and it had potential to be a decent game, but it was just butchered. 0.74$ still feels like a lot, it should be free and used in colleges and universities as a dirt standard of gaming. Show them what you don't create.  Unless you feel like laughing at an abomination of a game, don't buy it. And only buy it when it comes on sale for 74 cents, then it won't feel like your eyes have been violated.Personal Rating: 1/5			"

												I don't understand why this game has so much negative criticism. I decided to play this seeing that it was only around £1.80, I liked the Idea of the game. The gameplay is relatively straight-forward: Do this, kill this, find your way around or out of this, etc. However, the game's plot is what makes it so good. --SPOILER ALERT!--The story places you in the boots of a man who is persuaded into opening Pandora's box, he inadvertedly sets the world into a cataclysm as mythological creatures begin to invade the world, the myths and the humans are caught in a war. However it only appears that the myths aren't the major threat. early on you find out about the man who hired you -LeFay- is attempting to control the creatures for himself and you are brought into a group known as the Council of 98 who are attempting to stop LeFay's army's -The Black Order- plans. Both the council of 98 and the black order are caught in a war against each other and the myths.-My opinion-This game is very good, and I believe that the game is worth playing, as it is extremely well developed and the gameplay is well executed.

												TL;DR: Uninteresting console game from 2008, that has nothing for itself. Way overpriced (even at 3 bucks). Not worth your time (even if you're in sentenced for life in prison).----This game is from 2008, and it hasn't aged well. However, there are reasons why it didn't age well, as it wasn't particularily good to begin with. If you watch the trailer, you will hear: ""With Legendary, we're gonna take it where we've never gone before..."", ""It's unique, it hasn't been done yet."", ""You really need to understand the magnitude of destruction that they're causing"", or ""All the rules are completely different"". As far as I can understand, that has to do with the size of the destructible environment that supposedly has been created for the game.So let's start with that, the destructible environment. The first game I can remember that featured really destructible environment was Red Faction. Red Faction was released in 2001, if they're talking about that, they're wrong. Destructible has been done yet. And, to be fair, Legendary does not feature destructible environments: the first weapon you get is a fireman axe (and what better destruction tool than a fireman axe? It's designed for it!), and it doesn't even work on simple wooden boxes at the beginning (and the axe leaves a mark on any surface that looks more like an ink track than anything else) while it works on wooden boxes further on. At this point, it's not even wrong anymore, it's ""alternative facts"".So let's give them the benefit of the doubt (since the trailer is as unclear as it can be) and assume that they're talking about the size of the ennemies you have to fight. Really big ennemies surely haven't been done in video games prior to this one, right? I'm not even going to mention Kraid from Super Metroid since it's a 2D game, but the ""Necrogiant"" from painkiller (2004) is pretty big. And that's just one example. So not that either.Let's give it another try, what the game innovates with are the Mythical creatures you have to hunt down in first person. It must be that, right? Well, just to name one, Daikatana (from 2000).So then, what is new with this game? Nothing. This is one of the blandest game I have ever played.The worst aspect probably is the level design; but the game design also is terrible. For starters, you can heal from every single infinitely-respawning enemy (of which I've seen only six sorts - bosses and enviroment hazard excluded) you defeat, therefore completely obliterating any feeling of challenge or difficulty, as I found myself running with the axe to any ennemy, head first, most of the time (which caused me to die on the first griffin enconuter, btw).Then, the environments all look the same, the ""environmental puzzles"" (very probably a buzzword at the time) are all but interesting, and feel forced on the player. Same goes for the occasional QTE that seldom happens when an Alpha werewolf attacks you: they aren't mapped to any button in the vicinity of those you're using (they're mapped to the arrows - while the game uses WASD and the mouse). Another sign of a console feature rushed in the game at the last moment.To continue on the level design, the game is an utterly linear set of rooms and corridors, chained one after another (the character can hack any code locked door on his way by maintaining two wires in contact for a long enough time - essentially becoming a door knob that takes ages to operate. And there often are multiple ones in a row), with checkpoints that sometimes trigger without anything happening between them (aside the character walking). You very soon find yourself routinely playing, and forgetting what you are doing.To make matters worse, as I mentionned above, the game design is also to blame: the enemy cover system is binary they either are behind cover (it does not matter if you can shoot them), or not; and the aim-assist is always on, as if the game was to be played only on consoles. And as a canonical console game, the weapon selection is horrendous (you don't even have a selection wheel, it's button based, but designed to be mapped on only four slots, two of which are taken by the axe and the nades/molotovs), limited and takes ages (you can easily get killed by a tentacle if you were in the process of swapping your weapon).Graphically, the game is horribly looking, and I have a GTX 780, with all settings maximized. If you find the screenshots on the store page to be good looking, I invite you to see them in full size: I too was finding them more than acceptable in low resolution. There are no options whatsoever, let alone the possibility to change the FOV. Ingame, the models are pretty dated, the textures are very low definition, and the animations are notably unnatural.The audio of the game is pretty unremarkable, which totally fits with the rest of that title.The plot is as uncomplicated and dumbed down as it gets. Here is an except of a conversation (or monologue rather) that represents pretty well the level of thought put into this game: ""This isn't what <name redacted> said was going to happen today. I had no idea those creatures were going to be released, or that he'd try to kill both of us"". And the worst part is, they even paid the voice over actors for dubbing that...Now let's talk about the bugs. This game doesn't have so many of them, as it's mostly plagued by mediocrity, but a steaming pile of crap like this wouldn't be complete without its utterly game-breaking bug at the most appropriate place: right before the final boss: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=795351To summarize the bug (or in case the link dies), what happens is that as soon as you step through the elevator (one of many, many, MANY elevators) that leads you to the last level, you fall through the floor of that elevator, take damage, and can't continue the game. You can reload the last checkpoint, only to have the same problem. Again and again. The fix seems to be to change the MaxSmoothedFrameRate parameter from 300 to 60 or even 30. What fixed it in my case was to set the parameter to 10. I let you imagine how the game runs at 10 FPS, or how easy it is to play in those conditions.My only wish is that I had got this review, and a speedrun video of the game; instead of Legendary. That would have saved me some precious time.			"

												Not gonna lie, I did dig the creatures in the game, it was cool seeing griffons, werewolves, and minotaurs in a more modern setting. I did not dig the bugs and wonky controls, awkward jumping and lack of weapon variety. One game breaking bug was especially annoying towards the end of the game. There's an elevator(you'll know which one) that just shoots you through the floor and out of the map. I was unable to continue until I made my game run worse by limiting the framerate to 30FPS or below(there are guides online how to do so if you need to do this). So, just be careful if you do plan on picking this up. I payed 75 cents for it or something while it was on sale. So for 75 cents, sure it was fun, but it's not great.			"

I'll always remember this videogame, and I'll always remember how bad it was. There's a cool thing here with Pandora's Box, and monsters like gryphons and werewolves but it's just not fun, it looks terrible, and it's overall performance is shoddy at best.Avoid this game like the plague.

												Legendary is a legendary pile of garbage.   First off, let me say that the video on the store page trying to depict this game as some sort of carfullky nurtured game with developers that are passionate about how ""epic"" this game looks is a complete lie. This game is a march past setpiece after setpiece not unlike COD in its complete lack of choice in game design. The game has you walking down linear hallways around 90% of the game, which can be fine for a game, but when I am in a large open area and the places that I can walk are defined by wrecked cars, it is obvious the game developers are fairly bad level designers.   The combat design is just about as abysmal as the level design, being monotonous and boring solely because of the lack of content in this area. There are really ony a few enemies for the first 3 hours of the game, some being monsters and some being human. There is also a complete lack of imagination in the weapon choice, leaving battles to never feel unique or even necessary. The monster enemies drop energy that you can absorb in order to execute powers like healing and pushing enemies back just like in Bioshock, which seems like a neat mechanic, but it basically boils down to an extra health bar or in a situation were you need to ""Charge something up"" the way to advance the mission. One of the biggest issues is that the human enemies do somewhat unavoidable hitscan damage that can drain your healthbar quickly, but then they do not yield any energy to restore your health when they die. This forces these parts of the game to be a grind of memorizing where all the enemies are hiding behind cover and making sure you are not shot.  I could forgive most of these complaint and just leave it under ""The budget was too small"" or some other likely excuse, but the game has a nasty habit of just plain wasting your time. I like to call these AGOs, or Artificial Game Lengtheners. It's things that are put in to games like Legendary in order to make up for the lack of actual gameplay time and pad out the game length. Some of the feature AGOs in Legendary include: doors that take 10 seconds to open popping up very often in a level, breaking platform making you fall to a lower place to do a section of platforming again, and long enemy gauntlets while you are waiting for one of you allies to ""fix"" the device of the moment a la Half-Life 2. Overall, it gives the game an air of unfinishedness, knowing these things were probably added to make the pitifully short game just a bit longer.   Overall, this game is just an unispired mess. It riffs of so many other games that you wonder if the developers had an original thought in mind for the whole game. It tries to be Bioshock, Half-Life 2, Crysis 2, and Fear all at once and doesn't understand that many of the gameplay elements in each of these games were used to accomplish a certain purpose: a purpose that is lacking in Legendary. Don't buy this game unless you want to study what NOT to do in a shooter, because this isn't fun in any sense of the word. "

												Legendary, in concept, could have been a very compelling experience. Myths and legends released from Pandora's box by an unsuspecting thief who then must fight hordes of monsters, not to make everything right, but for survival. Instead what we got was a very repetitive and exhasperatingly mediocre first person shooter.Poorly executed and rather ugly, Legendary left me very, very disappointed. Give this one a pass, folks.

												Overall a good concept with some decent ideas that obviously were intended to be much larger than what it was. However its the final presentation, very clunky controls and game breaking bugs that let this game down.The first three quarters of the game are enjoyable, but as the diificulty ramps up in later stages the clunky and sluggish controls make it difficult to survive encounters even on normal. The key problem is that you can't jump higher than 1 foot, which means you'll constantly hump scenery and find that a single brick becomes an invisble wall, not the best thing to happen when retreating from a werewolf. Also the sprinting action which is essential later in the game doesn't always work. A lack of hit detection on the monsters also makes it difficult to know if your actually doing them any damage, most of which are bulletsponges. A standard FPS romp through New York sewers then London sewers then back to more New York sewers are telltale signs of a lack of creativity.  Finally this is the first time since the ElderScrolls 3 where I found myself constanly clipping out of the world, in particular right before you battle the final boss. So gamebreaking endgame glitch, sluggish controls and lack of imagination ruin an otherwise decent experience, pick this game up below £5/$5 and its a decent way to waste a weekend but don't expect anything brilliant.

												Eh, I only played this game for about a half hour and from what I saw, it looked pretty dull. *spoilers* You open pandora's box like a total idiot, get to use this sort of magic, and everything goes to hell and even your accomplice is going ""wtf?"" when she KNEW you're going after pandora's freakin box. The gunplay is pretty lousy with hardly any kickback and that fires as quick as you can click. Most of all, the game is INCREDIBLY linear. For the time I played, I was obviously pushed through an aisle where I could do nothing. Or in some cased I was made to wait untill an opening became created. As for the menu, there isn't much of one. The only graphical quality option is a ""Low-High"" setter, which doesn't allow for any advanced settings like altering only textural quality or bloom(not sure this game has any, though).All in all, the first half hour wasn't enough to keep me hooked, and even seemed awfully dull, setting enough of an impression on me to stop playing it.

Jump is ♥♥♥♥, you can't jump 10cm, but If you jump while sprinting you can jump like 5meters. character is not handsome at all (ugly ♥♥♥♥). Music is pointless, not connecting to the gameplay and it's mostly to try to not to scare you. monsters are pretty legendary, I mean there is like 5kind (one is Transformers). weapons are fine. voices are ♥♥♥♥. graphics is not soo awesome, but it has good animation, less dynamic and enjoyable gameplay. The game has one bug, which can RUIN the game and you can't go throught that ♥♥♥♥ing part. Story is dumped, pointless and does not make a lot sense. Do not buy this... Garbage. 3/10.			"

												First Person Shooter that centers around a relic thief who inadvertantly opens Pandora's Box, thus releasing chaos into the world. It also lances his hand and gives him magical powers? The game is fairly weak. It tries to be an advanced game, but its a little glitchy and doesn't look polished. The gunplay is underpowered in the game, making it feel like you have to unload several clips in monsters before they die. I didn't play it for long. Not sure I ever will again.

												I know this game is from 2008, so it's going to seem like I'm picking on it a little bit.Aesthetically, it's a game with big, although not pretty skyboxes. The game is so unashamed to use invisible walls that it becomes massively obvious where the level designer wanted you to go. Gameplay wise, it's your standard First person shooter, with lots of knee high walls, your default squishy human, hard wearing mythical creatures and tank-like minotaurs, but most enemies except for the minotaurs could be taken down in a few well placed shots. The story concept had mileage to go, but somehow this game really didn't do it justice, either they've had to cut the campaign and story down for financial reasons, or from publisher deadlines, but if I'm honest, I don't care. The ending left me feeling like it'd just cut the wettest of farts and left. It has so many bad story cliches, that if it had any more, I'd have thought I were in a printing mill.As for the voice acting, I don't know whether they used someone's fake english accent, or they just found some seriously stuck-up lady, but the accent sounded so unbelievably indignant throughout the game, even when you had to save her, not to mention the drawn-out exposition. Hey, I get it lady, I need to go to these three doohickeys and blow them up to shut down the watchamacakllit before time rund out and it goes off... What's that lady, oh, you want to explain it for the extra special soldiers in the room? Sure, it's not like the world is ending and we're on the clock.It still has potential for a sequel or DLC levels if they had left out that deus ex machina ending, but sadly, what has been done can not be undone.

												Hold [E] to bypass. No, seriously, avoid this game. I mean, it has an awesome premise and a solid-ish start... but everything about it is just lazy and the story is cringe-worthy. Also, one part actually requires you to either edit an .ini file or use an FPS capper [to 30] to avoid falling through an elevatotr. I am not kidding. Screw the devs.			"

												First off there's a game breaking bug right before the last fight that causes many players to consecutively fall through the floor in the same elevator ride.  The game company has chosen not to do anything about this.Now then, I bought this game because I wanted a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fps that I could speedrun through.  What I got was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fps that not only had uninteresting plot and design, but was riddled with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game mechanics and combat.  Even if you wanted a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fps to play, this game is questionable choice for that.			"

												Stay Away from this posin the 26 min i'v played this game it has been scripted pathmaking (having to run into a room that you can see has no way out, only for a scripted event to create a path for you), invisible walls, crappy hit box detection, cutsceen after cutsceen, endless spawning enamies that spawn right infront of you and a general feeling of ""wanting it to end"".  I give this game (based on the first few min of gameplay) 3/10I recommend that people Stay Away...			"

												While the action in this game is decent, it does so many things wrong I can't recommend it.When I play this I literally feel like the people who made it intended it to be garbage.  They constantly put you in situations that you will die several times before you get a lucky break.I'm willing to look past the graphics, AI, etc, but the idiot who designed the battles needs to gtfo of game design.  There was literally one part where werewolves would NOT stop spawning, even after you shot down a bridge and moved on and 3 of the more powerful versions spawned.If you play this you will enjoy it to an extent, then you will have the game dump on you for no reason.

												I've tried, honestly. Several times. Several times i have tried really hard to enjoy this game. I can't, i just can't. Bought this because of the description and some positive reviews that said that this game is like Half Life, Doom, F.E.A.R., etc, that it's a horror, it's immersive, it's fun, it's a good action, you name it. Well, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I was really just looking for a simple shooter, that's all. I knew the game was cheap but hey, there are many examples out there when cheap games turned out to be a real good fun after all. This one, nope. You remember that grip that Quake or Doom or Unreal or Gunman had on you when you first started playing them? Incredibly catchy from the very start, that grip just didn't let go even when it was almost morning and you had to go to school or work in a few hours but just couldn't stop playing. And don't tell me you weren't in a hurry after school/work to get to the computer again and continue playing ;) Yeah, i've been there too, wonderful feeling, lots of positive energy. These games were so simple yet genius. They had very comfortable pretty much everything. Controls, configuration menus, gameplay, concept... Again, you name it, all i'm saying that these games were so much of a success also because they were SIMPLE. Speaking about Legendary, i feel like it tries too hard to be that simple. And well, it succeeds. A bit. Monsters taking all over the place? Check. Protagonist that possessess some supernatural powers and doesn't talk unless absolutely necessary? Check. Dark filled with water tunnels? Check. Creepy sounds? Check. Gory scenes? Check. Weapons? Check. Bad guys? Check! See, everything's in place. The concept is somewhat simple yet catchy. Instead of some demons or dinosaurs or mutants we have mythological creatures gone wild. Not bad, not bad at all! With all this, i have no problem at all. The way the game is made TECHNICALLY is a problem. - First of all, controls, they are clumsy. It's simply not comfortable to operate your character. Movements feel just... i don't know, weird. All the time playing i had a feeling that there was a slightest delay between pressing a button and protagonist responding to it. Like, maybe less than half a second or something, but you can really tell, and that's what makes gameplay uncomfortable from the very beginning. The same goes with shooting btw. Ironsights are useless.- No flashlight. Considering the game is mostly dark, the flashlight would come in handy, but there's none, too bad. It's a small thing, yes. But as the great Sherlock Holmes used to say, ""There's nothing more important than small things"". - Endless enemies. Now that's more serious of a problem. I've only been like, maybe a few hours into the game so far and i've already encountered what, 5 points where the enemies just kept on coming. Now, i'm not saying that it's critical, pretty much every shooter has such moments. But not every 20 minutes, for all sakes!!! I love to explore places in shooters, i love to walk around, searching for ammo, medpacks, some hidden things, just admiring level design in general. Here, you ain't got no time to explore. It's just endless shooting and running with no time for a break to look around. Dislike.- Soul collecting/healing mechanics. The protagonist has a power to collect ""souls"" from fallen enemies and use this energy to restore his health, there are no medpacks. Interesting concept, hands down, encourages you not to avoid fighting monsters. The problem is endless enemies. Sucking the magical power down takes some time. With monsters constantly reappearing, you won't have much time to devour enough souls and heal yourself which also takes time, because you are going to be too busy shooting and reloading. This often leads to the death of protagonist because you just can't shoot, reload, throw grenades, consume souls, heal yourself and charge up the generator AT THE SAME DAMN TIME!!! IT. IS. NEARLY. ♥♥♥♥ING. IMPOSSIBLE. Well, of course, one can always switch difficulty to EASY. But i don't know how about you, my friend, but if i play a shooter, i play it on HARD or HARDEST. I love a challenge in FPS, but in this case, i gotta admit, i switched to EASY more than i wanted. Until i just gave up. Not good.- Checkpoint reloading time. Is enormous. Reloading the last saved checkpoint takes a very, very long time. I don't know why though, because visuals in this game are less than average. In fact this game looks like it was made 10-15 years ago. Why does it load so long, i have no idea. As i mentioned before, technically the game is... not so good. And it doesn't run smooth also, i think because it's probably a port. So yeah, here you have it. This game could have been fun, it could have been relaxing, it could have been enjoyable. Just a simple good old shooter that is so hard to find these days, a massage for your spinal cord. But unfortunately, all the good aspects have been killed by poor optimization mostly. No toggle crouch option, no flashlight, endless monsters... It could all be forgivable. If not for poorly made mechanics. To be honest i feel a bit guilty giving Legendary a thumb down, i wish there was an option to give games on Steam neutral reviews. The game definitelly has a potential, it could of made a good average shooter. Given into the right hands, it could have been a tasty candy in a shiny wrapper! Too bad that the developers didn't give their creation enough attention that it certainly deserved. Seriously, it feels to me like developers were just lazy! They didn't polish. I don't want to look for half a minute at a loading screen after each death. Dammit, the game just plays clumsy in general! Shame. The recipe was good, a little more seasoning was needed. A little more salt and sugar and a bay leaf. Here in russia you can buy meat for less than 10 dollars and make some very tasty Aspic out of it. All it takes is some effort. If only a few things were fixed, this review would be changed immediatelly, sigh. Sorry Legendary, not recommended. Just can't. Even considering the price. Too bad.			"

												This game is seriously fun. The cinematics are amazingly well done, more like a blockbuster movie, than a video game. Although the graphics can seem dated at times, it is completely balanced by the gameplay, and excellence in video game design. The storyline keeps you interested, the enemies provide a challenge, and I can't stop taking screenshots.I recommend this game in 2016.			"

												I've tried, honestly. Several times. Several times i have tried really hard to enjoy this game. I can't, i just can't. Bought this because of the description and some positive reviews that said that this game is like Half Life, Doom, F.E.A.R., etc, that it's a horror, it's immersive, it's fun, it's a good action, you name it. Well, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I was really just looking for a simple shooter, that's all. I knew the game was cheap but hey, there are many examples out there when cheap games turned out to be a real good fun after all. This one, nope. You remember that grip that Quake or Doom or Unreal or Gunman had on you when you first started playing them? Incredibly catchy from the very start, that grip just didn't let go even when it was almost morning and you had to go to school or work in a few hours but just couldn't stop playing. And don't tell me you weren't in a hurry after school/work to get to the computer again and continue playing ;) Yeah, i've been there too, wonderful feeling, lots of positive energy. These games were so simple yet genius. They had very comfortable pretty much everything. Controls, configuration menus, gameplay, concept... Again, you name it, all i'm saying that these games were so much of a success also because they were SIMPLE. Speaking about Legendary, i feel like it tries too hard to be that simple. And well, it succeeds. A bit. Monsters taking all over the place? Check. Protagonist that possessess some supernatural powers and doesn't talk unless absolutely necessary? Check. Dark filled with water tunnels? Check. Creepy sounds? Check. Gory scenes? Check. Weapons? Check. Bad guys? Check! See, everything's in place. The concept is somewhat simple yet catchy. Instead of some demons or dinosaurs or mutants we have mythological creatures gone wild. Not bad, not bad at all! With all this, i have no problem at all. The way the game is made TECHNICALLY is a problem. - First of all, controls, they are clumsy. It's simply not comfortable to operate your character. Movements feel just... i don't know, weird. All the time playing i had a feeling that there was a slightest delay between pressing a button and protagonist responding to it. Like, maybe less than half a second or something, but you can really tell, and that's what makes gameplay uncomfortable from the very beginning. The same goes with shooting btw. Ironsights are useless.- No flashlight. Considering the game is mostly dark, the flashlight would come in handy, but there's none, too bad. It's a small thing, yes. But as the great Sherlock Holmes used to say, ""There's nothing more important than small things"". - Endless enemies. Now that's more serious of a problem. I've only been like, maybe a few hours into the game so far and i've already encountered what, 5 points where the enemies just kept on coming. Now, i'm not saying that it's critical, pretty much every shooter has such moments. But not every 20 minutes, for all sakes!!! I love to explore places in shooters, i love to walk around, searching for ammo, medpacks, some hidden things, just admiring level design in general. Here, you ain't got no time to explore. It's just endless shooting and running with no time for a break to look around. Dislike.- Soul collecting/healing mechanics. The protagonist has a power to collect ""souls"" from fallen enemies and use this energy to restore his health, there are no medpacks. Interesting concept, hands down, encourages you not to avoid fighting monsters. The problem is endless enemies. Sucking the magical power down takes some time. With monsters constantly reappearing, you won't have much time to devour enough souls and heal yourself which also takes time, because you are going to be too busy shooting and reloading. This often leads to the death of protagonist because you just can't shoot, reload, throw grenades, consume souls, heal yourself and charge up the generator AT THE SAME DAMN TIME!!! IT. IS. NEARLY. ♥♥♥♥ING. IMPOSSIBLE. Well, of course, one can always switch difficulty to EASY. But i don't know how about you, my friend, but if i play a shooter, i play it on HARD or HARDEST. I love a challenge in FPS, but in this case, i gotta admit, i switched to EASY more than i wanted. Until i just gave up. Not good.- Checkpoint reloading time. Is enormous. Reloading the last saved checkpoint takes a very, very long time. I don't know why though, because visuals in this game are less than average. In fact this game looks like it was made 10-15 years ago. Why does it load so long, i have no idea. As i mentioned before, technically the game is... not so good. And it doesn't run smooth also, i think because it's probably a port. So yeah, here you have it. This game could have been fun, it could have been relaxing, it could have been enjoyable. Just a simple good old shooter that is so hard to find these days, a massage for your spinal cord. But unfortunately, all the good aspects have been killed by poor optimization mostly. No toggle crouch option, no flashlight, endless monsters... It could all be forgivable. If not for poorly made mechanics. To be honest i feel a bit guilty giving Legendary a thumb down, i wish there was an option to give games on Steam neutral reviews. The game definitelly has a potential, it could of made a good average shooter. Given into the right hands, it could have been a tasty candy in a shiny wrapper! Too bad that the developers didn't give their creation enough attention that it certainly deserved. Seriously, it feels to me like developers were just lazy! They didn't polish. I don't want to look for half a minute at a loading screen after each death. Dammit, the game just plays clumsy in general! Shame. The recipe was good, a little more seasoning was needed. A little more salt and sugar and a bay leaf. Here in russia you can buy meat for less than 10 dollars and make some very tasty Aspic out of it. All it takes is some effort. If only a few things were fixed, this review would be changed immediatelly, sigh. Sorry Legendary, not recommended. Just can't. Even considering the price. Too bad.			"

												Legendary is a decent budget FPS, but I cannot in good conscience recommend it with a game breaking bug in the last level that requires noclip mode to get past. I also had to glitch through one of the bosses by hiding in a corner behind some rubble, because it was seemingly impossible to dodge its attacks while it absorbed entire clips from a machine gun without flinching. It is a shame because the game has a lot of unrealized potential and some stunning visuals at times, despite an overall cheap feel. The very first level sees an epic cataclysm unfurl in the middle of a rush hour stricken New York City. The protagonist makes his way through a maze of abandoned vehicles as all around griffons are swooping down from the sky to snatch running civilians, and giant golems are smashing through skyscrapers. All of this wanton destruction sounds and looks amazing, until you realize it is all scripted and the player is in no danger. Furthermore, proceeding requires the player to stand in a specific spot that often looks like a dead end and wait for the scripted events to unlock the way forward. There are some good ideas and fun here, if you are willing to overlook the early 2000's budget feel of the game and pick it up at a steep discount, but there are definitely better ways to spend one’s time.

												I bought this game already knowing it is a bad game, but it was under £1 and I figured 'how bad could it really be?'. Well, the answer to that is 'really, really bad'.So what makes it so bad? I'll exlain:Bland visuals with low quality texturesLimited weapon varietyLimited enemy varietyHorrible fps capBugsMore bugsGame-breaking bugsMassively bullet-spongey enemiesJanky controlsExtremely limited configuration optionsVolume issues in cut-scenesVery linearTerrible voice actingAbysmal animationsSo are there good things about the game? Well, it is, mercifully, quite short so you only need to waste a single afternoon/evening playing it. That's a good thing, I guess. Anything else? Nope. The game itself has almost no redeeming features whatsoever.Do not buy this game, no matter how cheap it is. It's not the waste of money that's the issue; it's the waste of time that could be better spent playing a game that isn't so awful.			"

												well this game is pure sh***************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************t. The story is worse than a fu***** twilight book, dont believe me? Then buy this game and see for yourself. The game begins with you, the main character (well no sh**) opening Pandora's box in the worlds lowest security museum. After opening said box , an army of super ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Griffins ( *Gryphons if you cant spell properely) spawn in from the skies and kill everything for no reason. As the onslaught of the Griffins continues the crowd of people waiting to get slaughtered begin to scream. DO NOT USE MOTHERF****** HEADPHONES . My left ear drum has now stopped working which is awful for me as my right ear drum bled out watching Pacific Rim at the cinema. So by playing this very poor excuse for a money grab atte-*cough* video game you will more than likely become def and will then be left with negative brain cells due to the horrible voice acting, I also forgot how to read and write so my gran helped me write this review.   Disclaimer- Idk wtf the normal price for this game is but i picked it up on sale for 55p and it still isn't worth it. This game competes with BadRats and Temper Tantrum and should be avoided at all costs(Pun not Intended). Disclaimer part 2- I used to Fu***** love Griffins untill this pile of sh** came along. They were such majestic creatures but now they are only zeus's ♥♥♥♥♥s.  #FreeGriffinProtitutes            0.314/69- Griffins sh** on your shoulder a few too many times for my liking.			"

												What blows me away in the game industry is the time, effort, and dedication teams make to their craft. Oftentimes, it seems that teams who are so passionate about their projects for some reason or another just miss the mark. This is one of those occasions. The dev diaries, trailers, promotional materials all made this game seem extremely promising. Pandora's Box is opened and mythical creatures from Greek myths roam the lands in modern-day New York (I think?). Sounds cool, sounds fun, sounds ""fresh"" as the marketing and branding teams wants you to think.Do not, under any circumstances, purchase this game. This goes on the ""why do I own this?"" list of my collection. This shooter came out in the aftermath of a shooting rennaisance - Halo, Call of Duty(s), Battlefield(s), amongst many others - and yet couldn't take the queues from games that know how to make shooters and make a decent clone. A brief, and kind, summary:-poor controls-awful graphics-forgettable, unrelatable, and despicable protagonist-poor writing-absolutely no motivation for your actionsI would go more into depth with flowery prose, but I just want to distance myself from this game as soon as possible. I know many, many people spent years of their lives making this thing come together. I really wish they could have spent that time on a project that was enjoyable.Just... don't do it. You're better off using your money to wax your nether regions - it'll be more pleasurable.			"

The game has a decent soundtrack and the gameplay is there even if it is rough around the edges.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a really cheap game, this is especially true during sale times.  Get if for the single player if you do, as multiplayer is dead. Otherwise just have fun.			"

												Ich kann nicht verstehen wie man bei dem Spiel Wirklich abraten kann... Zudem wenn ich einige der Negativen Rewiews lese glaube ich die Leute haben temporären Gedächtnisverlust...Zusammenfassung: Ja es ist kein Weltklasse-Shooter, aber bei einem Preis von 5 Euro ist das Spiel voll in Ordnung und hat viele gute Aspekte.Kurz was zur Story:Eine Story um Pandoras Box, Okay ein alter Hut Aber an sich ganz gut umgesetzt. Hier und da Logiklücken, aber für einen Shooter eine gute Story und gut in Szene gesetzt. Das Ende hat mich übrigens echt bedauern lassen dass es keinen 2. teil gibt, der wäre bestimmt nochmal besser als das hier. Das schlechte:Nun Zuerst muss man da wohl das Gunplay nennen. Es ist nicht kaputt, aber schwammig und im Zielmodus hat selbst die LMG kaum Rückstoß. Zudem stört das gerade im Schleichen extreme Headbobbing hier schon.. Dann noch die andauernden Zwangsbremsen... Hier mal eine Schalttafel überbrückt, hier ein Ventiel gedreht, Da was beiseite geschoben, Ehrlich gesagt, ich verstehe es nicht. Immer wieder muss man eine Tür durch eine übern Daumen ca 10sekündige Aktion öffnen. In den meisten Fällen passiert währenddessen gar nichts. (Ab und an kommt da was aber nur eine Hand voll im Spiel) Deas hält den Spielfluss auf stört aber im Endeffekt nur teils. Die KI der Menschlichen Gegner... Wir Schiebens mal auf: 'Der Fokus liegt auf den Monstern' Aber die Menschlichen Gegner sind dumm wie Brot und treffen teils schlechter als jeder Stormtrooper, Der Bösewicht hat wohl keine besonders hohen Einstellungsvoraussetzungen.Das 'an die Hand nehmen'... Es ist sooo bescheuert. Du brauchst nicht denken, alles was wichtig ist ist leuchtend hervorgehoben... Das Neutrale:Die Grafik ist mittelmaß, für seine Zeit und die UE3 nicht ganz zeitgemäß, aber es sieht Stellenweise echt gut aus, und an anderen Stellen wieder wie hinge... naja. Es ist ansehnlich, wenn man stellenweise wegguckt. Die KI der Monster, sie ist in Ordnung, aber stellenweise auch sehr vorhersehbar. Das Leveldesign, teils ist es ein Korridor of Duty, teils bietet es schöne offene Areale mit freiem vorgehen. Nichts besonders gutes, aber die Abwechslung empfinde ich positiv. Das gute: Die Monster. Es ist wirklich toll man hat hier 4 Permanente Gegnertypen, die man jeweils anders bekämpfen muss. Eine gute Abwechslung, die Spaß in den Kampf bringt und teilweise Schlachtflächen, die ein wenig nachdenken erfordern. Hätte ich gerne mehr von. Die Bosskämpfe sind extrem gut in Szene gesetzt ohne das Spielgeschehen zu unterbrechen, hierbei auch eine echt gute Umsetzung des Gegnerdesigns. Das Anima-System. Du kannst die Seelen der monster sdammeln und dich damit heilen(Und ein paar andere Dinge machen) Ein echt schönes System und eine gut umgesetzte Idee. Die Waffenauswahl ist in Ordnung und so gesehen ist jede Waffe hier gut einsetzbar. Trotz allem der Flammenwerfer ist zu stark. Bemerkungen am Rande:Der oft genannte Fahrstulbug ist bei mir nicht aufgetreten (Stand 7.5.15) Wird also weg sein. Der Multiplayer ist faktisch nicht mehr existent (Gamespy) LAN Ginge noch, aber ist halt LAN. Es gibt keinen Grund das Spiel auf Steam zu kaufen solange es nicht im Angebot ist. Wenn ihr wie ich Steam mögt ist Okay, aber es ist hierbei wirklich gleich wenn man sich eine DRM-Freie Version holt.			"

												This game if you was wondering is alright voice acting the A.I the story the enemys are all ok nothing stands out and can get very boring at times i recommanded playing on easy as it is not worth playing at harder difficulties as there is no benifit to playing on them.The game is worth getting as a time waster when it is discounted to under £1 and maybe if you are really bored £3 but i wouldn't as there is better games out there for the same price.The game has a great idea but the fantasy enemys are poorly done and not scary at all more a pain to deal with as once you kill one you can heal and the human enmeys are the only true threat other than the minotaur which is hard to kill as they soak up bullets and are weak at the back but other than that nothing is hard to deal with i would give this game 5 out of 10.

												Ez egy 2009-es játék szóval nem szeretném a mai játékokhoz hasonlítani,amiből az következik,hogy a grafika illetve eme dolgoknál elnézőbb leszek.Szerintem ez a játék elmegy egynek,grafika,hang,játékmenet.Viszont a történet jó lenne HA többet hoztak volna ki belőle és a karakterekből is.A mozgás és arc animáció is elmegy.Ez egy közepes játék de tapasztalatom szerint a Steam nap mint nap új akciókkal vár és sok játék 5$ alá megy és azok még jobban megérik,de lehet vele tenni egy próbát.

												I may be a bit biased as I've never heard of this game, but it's very poorly optimized. When water would spray from a pipe or fire hydrant the game would stutter, even on explosions the game would stutter. You have limited running which makes no sense as you basically gain super human powers right at the start of the game. Even on Hard difficulty the game is a joke, you can probably use the fireaxe melee that you get early on to beat the complete game. Had to quit due to headaches from the choppiness and non-smooth AI movement.			"

												I can see why it got a low score on metacritic, but it deserves higher than a 50. It is not great but it is far better than a lot of fps games that I have played before that are more well known than this. One game that comes to mind is Aliens: Colonial Marines. This game is a thousand times better than that game. It has good sound effects, a decent story, satisfying combat, decent weapons, neat powers, alright graphics, and is actually pretty damn decent for a cheap, lesser known game. 70/100.			"

												So I bought this game for 74 cents which i thought was a steal. And as soon as i played it , it had a problem with loading the textures, which was resolved by just restarting the game. Well anyways, the basic game setup was good, fighting mythical creatures, but the game lacked so much potential it could have had. Basically a corridor shooter cause there is hardly any room to explore anything. And collecting the data PDA's was basically pointless. If you're trying to find a game to waste time on and this is less than 1$, you should buy it. Otherwise, bad choice purchasing this.			"

Ah Legendary, Developed by Spark Unlimited; the morons that developed Turning Point: Fall of Liberty.
There's a reason this game's only what like $1?
Installing it the game wanted to downgrade my video card drivers so it met their standards, lucky I cancelled it and still got to ""play"".
It was the honestly the worst game I ever played, don't bother unless you like venturing into s****y games like myself.

												The beginning is actually not as bad as you might think. But then there's the rest of the game which is about as generic and uninspiring as you can get. You could say this game has a legendary reputation for being legendarily bad, please kill me for reviewing this game and saying that sentence.			"

												Good idea, bad execution. I was excited to play this game as I thought that it looked very interesting and to be a good game. I loved the idea of what this game was about, and it would've been a good game, but it was poorly made. A crappy fps with bad game mechanics and some poor graphics, but the graphics were as to expect from a game from 2008. The use of the healing and psy(?) powers did not work well for me, and I don't know if this was a problem only I was having, but for most of the game when I needed to, I could not heal. So I died, a lot. The walking speed is too slow in my opinion and for having a very short running period, so it's tedious to move around. (Jumping sucks too). But, the game still has it's fun moments. Just most of the moments are just tedious or not too exiting. It is an ""okay"" game, but I do not recommend to buy it unless it is on a very low sale. I got it for .74$ on a sale, and I think that it's a perfect price to pay for it. Only buy if its on sale for at least a dollar. I give the game 5/10.			"

												Legendary, it's a fun little game (although rather short), that doesn't need a good rig to run (looking at the specs), but I just can't recommend it:Pros:+ Enemies spawn a lot+ Graphics are decent+ Okay voice acting+ Cool powers+ Combat/Gunplay is alrightCons:- There's not much of storyline- Only a small amount of enemies (2-3)- Forgettable people- AI can be really dumb- Only 2 real uses for the power- Barriers galore- Really buggy- Can glitch up on you at times- Miniscule amount of weapons at your disposal- Little to no replay valueOverall, 4/10, whilst I enjoyed it, it just wasn't for me, too many negatives.

												Not enough bad to be 'so bad it's good'. Just a dull shooter with loose controls and tight corridors. If things were vice versa it'd be on-par with most shooters around and story would be like icing on the cake. If there was a story...But... It is ugly, boring, sub-par FPS that make your ears bleed. Though it won't frustrate you in any way. Promising on paper, it only can get you bored to sleep. Enjoy you collection of fps cliches, sir.			"

												I had this game back when I was a Xbox 360 user, and I remember it being pretty good and solid. Whoever did the PC port/version needs to be disembowled though. The game is visually unplayable. The textures are all gone. Everything is so, so, so bare. If you've ever used Zbrush, the characters are ALL that shade of grey, and so is the rest of the level. Particles are horrid. Flames are just red blocks. It isn't a problem on my end either. This game really is a visually dead port. Which is a shame, as I really liked it when I'd played the console version.			"

												poorly executed game and the name is by far too promising.it was published in 2008, but the textures and graphics, except in the cutsequences, look like a standart from 2004. still i dont lie when i say that doom 3 looks much better.the short music clip is good but repeats itself over and over again, same goes for the types of enemies.the sounds are ok, the animations are moderate, not breathtaking.dont know much about the story yet, but it starts with: after some magical artifact in a museum grants you superpowers, you become so legendary that you can barely jump 10centimeters high and long.in case that it will impress me more in the next hours, i will change my review. for now i say dont buy it, not even for 99 cents.

												Well, I bought this game when it was 1,25$. You're a guy who steals stuff & for some reason you are mute. So there's no character developpement whatsoever. Some dude is all like gimme pandora's box cuz I wanna do stuff with it & you're all like sure, why not? I'll be rich! But then, you open the box cuz why not? Am I right? Then BOOM it's the apocalyspe you gotta do something about it now! Legendary is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port & because of that it has awkward controls. Legendary did not age well. The graphics are dated and like I said before the gameplay is awkward. But, if you're into greek mythology like me, you should maybe buy it when it's going to be real cheap. I didn't really enjoy this game to be honest but it's a great addition to a Hipster's library.Note: I know I haven't played much of it but it's bad really bad.			"

												Game is so horrible in every aspect i cant even believe it exist. Designers of this game should leave industry and never touch anything that require thinking and creativity.

												Just beat the game. I recommend this game to all mystalgic gamers especially those of you who enjoy the older shooters. Reminded me of Doom or Bioshock 1. Graphics were fair to good. Sounds was a little off, sometimes you could hear ♥♥♥♥ that was way far away. Music was AWESOME! it really set the tone. Story line was awesome if your into mythology. Only had one big issue with the game, It has bug issue on the elevator to last fight. BUT IT CAN BE FIXED, and it was fairly easy to do and some people don't get it so its only a percentage of happening. But all in all not a bad game. I Look forward to playing more games like this, if you can think of any please leave a comment. =)			"

												It's a shame really,  This game, judging by the screen shots, looked quite promising. However, it is let down frequently from the start by annoying and sometimes unnecessary development choices. If you are a fan of the invisible wall, you are in luck. The developer,  Spark Unlimited, almost certainly blew half their budget on them. They are implemented in a ' wait and see what we have to show you ' way. Fine, if you are building the up the story at a slow pace, and if obscured by scenery. However, the first ten minuets of the game are riddled with them, stopping you dead in your tracks in open space. They funnel you down certain paths to heighten the action and drama, but it's use is so sloppy that you will almost certainly be left more frustrated that captured by the environment.  The invisible walls will be placed in front of a small jump-able obstacle and open areas, or more often than not, dead in front of you so you physically stop to look at a set piece fall or some other mundane event. This is most noticeable in the beginning scene where you are told to flee from danger, only to be stopped ever 5 steps to watch the danger play out in front of you, while you stand their like a confused child. If you are expecting the sort of interactive storytelling more commonly associated with, Say, Half Life 2. You are out of luck. The opening scenes are a little like the beginning of Darksiders. Humans fleeing from winged monsters destroying a city around you. However, instead of capturing the excitement and joy that Darksiders offers, Legendarys offerings are much more hilarious. I laughed, audibly, when the ' Mexican Wave ' happened outside the museum. The hero of this game is, as in most FPS games, silent. But to make him seem more human and relatable, the developers applied Playstation 2 era facial animations to him. He is so convincing, his face slowly sliding into every expression known to man, that you will swear he has some form of medical condition. In fact, his appearance was so poorly handled I was sure the game was setting up the main villain.  To round this all off, once I acquired my first weapon I attempted to use it against the nearest enemy. But the axe just passed straight through it, over and over. The game was too busy showing me all the fun that I wouldn't be having.  The game feels unfinished, unpolished and linier. A cheap experience. What ever sale price this currently at, you would be better off keeping the money in your wallet and putting it towards a better game.			"

												The game breaks from the CoD mass, using a JC2/FC2 like weapon system (managed by the directional pad on a controller, as a posed to a 2 weapon switch + inventory). Levels open up as you progress, atmosphere can swing from dark, highlighted coridors and sewers to bright courtyards in a church/cathedral, and the dusty, vehicle and debris filled streets of New York. The weapon list may be a short one, but each weapon has it's advantages over another, without filling your arsonal with random ♥♥♥♥. Beign a console to PC port it doesn't take much to run, but that doesn't mean the graphics don't look great (even for this year, I haven't even run it with GPU PhysX; my card is a 270X). The game is based on a health bar system, collecting the fuel to replenish it from dead mythicals.Personally the game felt a lot like FarCry 2, Crysis 2, and Bioshock to me (all in a good sense, I recognise that FC2 and C2 are hated amoung the series, but seriosly give all 4 of them a chance). When it comes to public reviews (Gamespot, IGN, etc.) the only honest reviews (I can find) come from PlayStation Magazine (less so, a little harsh but Sony does force their exclusives onto people of the wrong demographic all the god-damn time), GameInformer (also a little harsh, it's the Unreal Engine (no offense), it can't do  really increadable things  (Antichamber was a greate game, but there are graphic ♥♥♥♥ who critisize it)), Gameplanet and Xbox Magazine, these 4 being less intimidated by Gears of War 2 (Impossible from PDM), FarCry 2, Call of Duty WAW and other during it's release.While I haven't tried the multiplayer mode myself (I have also heard that there aren't many players), the game doesn't really on PvP TDM, but more a single, objective based gametype where you collect the essence from the mythicals, first to fill their collector wins.I sugest having an Xbox 360 controller for this, being a game that was developed on consoles (I would recomend a controller anyway, it isn't PvP so you won't get beaten by an elite player with a laser/high accuracy/performance mouse). PS. IGN is still a  really  ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company/site/place.  "

												An interesting concept; reminds me of Painkiller with it's dark atmosphere. However, it's far too linear gameplay for my taste. There is no deviation from the path you are forced to move along, and killing werewolves gets old fast as they spawn indefinately while youre trying to find a way out of yet another warehouse.			"

												Let's just put it this way; if Final Fantasy XIII is a large hallway, this is a gigantic assembly line. Actually, no, scratch that, it's more  like a disassembly line, because the further down the line you go, the less functional this product gets. It's that flawed.			"

												Legendary is a good game in general, it is very linear upon the storyline as there are many invisible walls trying to prevent you from wandering around into meaningless places, the combat in it seems to be decent; for the time it was made that is. There are afew jump scares in it which keep the gamer from falling asleep but, if you are somebody who likes completing games this is not the game for you as on the last level there is a glitch in which you fall through the floor making it impossible to complete the game, i spent 3 hours playing it and completed everything (up to the glitch that is) so if you are looking for a game to last you some time dont buy this game.

												For all the flak this game has gotten, I was plesantly surprised at how much I've enjoyed it. Sure, it is very linear and dosen't have the best graphics, but it is pretty decent. The story is probably the most enjoyable part of the game. Not only do you open Pandora's Box (literally), but you get to live through the latest apocalypse, and it dosen't even have to do with aliens or robots! You want an interesting shooter that deals with more fantasy than sci-fi, you should try Legendary.6/10			"

												Could've walked down the hall in my dorm and bought a pepsi, but I bought this game instead. On sale for a $1.25 is a heck of a deal. That being said, if you expect anything other than a rehash of half-life (the original) with a different backdrop and creatures, you are out of luck. Same crawling thru vents, same whacking boxes with a hand tool, same pistol, rifle, kill the soldiers, go out of my way to turn of the electricity to go thru a  little bit of water...kind of game.

												Generic FPS with a simple preset path. You cannot deviate much, if at all... And that is a shame, because this one could have been so much better if you consider that you open Pandora's Box no less!!! Then mythological creatures get out?!? I mean how cool is that?

Even though the game suffers from graphical bugs, a short story mode, and hit or miss voice-acting, the game is still a blast to play. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to fight mythological creatures instead of aliens or zombies.			"

												Legendary is a game where you play as a guy called Deckard. I don't remember his full name so I just called him Deckard Cain and you work with the Good Illuminati against the Bad Illuminati. Neither of the sides are actually called the Illuminati but ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥ do you expect me to remember their actual names?The game is mostly a forgettable FPS with difficulty that goes all over the place (seriously why the ♥♥♥♥ is it easier to fight a bunch of werewolves and a minotaur than a bunch of Bad Illuminati stooges with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns). However one moment has scarred me for life. During a later part in the game, you see a giant squid destroying the Big Ben. The idea of destroying the Big Ben, the tower that tells the people of England what Bong it is, is an act worse than Pearl Harbor, 9/11 and the Holocaust.Overall, I think England should nuke Olympus since Pandoras Box  is from Greek Mythology. Besides the Greek Pantheon are a bunch of homosexual old men (and women) whereas Norse Mythology is full of badass ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Like Thor.Vote for Thorman in 2016. He will nuke Olympus and possibly Japan.			"

												Jan 8, 2013: This game has a promising premise, but it is plagued with flaws. Even on my good computer, I get frame-rate drops to near-crashes.. What a shame really.Aside from that, it makes me sort've remember playing Half-Life 2 in some ways. Not much else to say about it since the issue with the drops has stopped me from playing, for the most part.UPDATE, Sep 19, 2014: So, after pretty much ignoring this title in my list and letting it rot, I'm finally giving it a whirl again and would believe it took a massive, ridiculous upgrade past the requirements to get this to work better? 24 gigs of ram and a GeForce GT 740 -- there's still some clipping here and there, but overall the framerate drops are less dramatic, making this game playable. I've also tested disabling HID compliant devices in the device panel, which seemed to help. For anyone looking to get this sucker working, I would recommend the HID compliant items be disabled first. That may have been the issue from the getgo.			"

Average fps gameplay with addition of animus which allows you to attack or absorb life force of the mythological enemies. The story so far has been sweet. Mythology vs real world = awesome.

												Totally worth the $0.94 that I paid for it. It's linear FPS mayhem with a lil' bit of magic. Storyline is decent, but the game was told and wrapped up well. Controls are tight, but jumping up/down is cosmetic, however you can sprint-jump gaps. I wish the campaign was a little longer and that there were more big bosses. This game could use a sequel. 8/10(on sale) Would buy at that price, and play again. There is NOT a multiplayer.			"

												I had a great time with this game, i walked into it expecting problems due to the reviews but i never once encountered a noticable glitch or failure, there is one thing that i hated the most about this game, the jumping you jump like an inch, and it feels like there shouldn't even be jumping, but if you want to go 30 mph just get to a ledge and sprint jump off, you'll go flying. This game has alot of cool moments, but at other times it feels a tad bit boring. Especially at the end, there isn't any feeling of urgency during the final level. I only died once, and it was because one of the monsters in this game, the minotaur, is a pain in the ♥♥♥. He will constantly follow you, running at your pace unless your sprinting, he flawless tails you even when charging, he runs through the walls in the arenas, that they put you in to fight him, flawlessly, it's like he can walk through the damn things. The game tells you to shoot him in the back, and that is super difficult because he rarely charges and when he does, it's hard to dodge. Every other enemy though is easy to fight. This game will turn into a puzzle game easily, there will be times where you have no idea what to do, and the solution is so obvious you don't notice it. The weapon switch is super slow. When you try to heal yourself with the ""aminus"" juice you have, it takes a little longer than it should, and is hard to control. God help you if you're trying to pick up a weapon while running if you're being chased, it's a huge thing that would've helped me during a lot of battles. On the good side the cutscenes, soundtrack, atmosphere is amazing, the AI is ok, i've seen them do some stupid ♥♥♥♥ though. Overall for five dollars i think this is a steal, if you like games with good graphics that run well even on the highest settings with bad pc parts, this is your game, my ram runs at like 500 mhz, and i ran it on highest settings.

												I know the second you saw this you were confused. Legendary a good game?!?!? But I am being serious here. I loved this game. Everyone says either ""It is pretty moderate for a shooter"" or ""Bad game""  which I don't understand at all. I had more fun with this shooter than COD! In COD you fight a bunch of similair stupid ♥♥♥ enemies who have no special abilities at all. Or you play an average zombie survival mode. Or you play online agains't a bunch of screaming kids and swearing adults with absolutely no innovation at all even in the sequels it is almost exactly the same. What happens in Legendary? Griffins swoop down picking up enemies in their mouths and eating them. Werewolfs lunge at you and throw objects at you and when they are killed you have to chop of their heads or they recuperate. Fire drakes shoot fire out of their mouths at you but can be taken care of by activating a sprinkler or shooting a fire extinguisher. And while you are doing this a MASSIVE golem above is smashing through buildings and stepping on fleeing people. Also a giant tentacled beast is grabbing allies and pulling them to a watery grave. And guess what. Those tentacles can also grab you and the golem can also step on you. All these mythical creatures from different cultures are trying to kill you while you are trying to destroy a golem by activating 3 EMPs to seperate the energy of the golem from the body. Explosive spiders from Japan, Fire Drakes from old tales and a Kraken from common folklore. My favourite creature is the Nari. A creepy bat like creature with a childs face who can become a ghost and              a physical creature. They often possess objects and throw them at you and generally make life a pain. They steal objects needed for objectives and force you to chase them down often leading you to traps. One time a Nari stole a valve I needed to proceed and dropped it in a suspicious looking chamber. When I entered the doors closed and a fan possessed by the Nari  started sucking me towards it. Only by shooting the supports could I barely escape and when I did I was attacked by a tentacle and almost pulled towards my doom. And that is only level 2. The only bad thing I would say about this game is the graphics however because of the graphics it works on less powerful computers like mine. Some of the most popular games also have bad graphics like HL2 and Killing Floor but noone complains about that. All in all I would give it an 8/10. Definitely worth playing and fun.			"

												This game has a really bad outlook on contextual controls.The Animus Buttons is (Absorb,Heal,Push) all in one and rarely does what I want it to. Dodgy level design and seemingly infinitely spawning Mobs leads to immense frustration. The Soundtrack is really irritaiting and repetitive with the one major melody sounding 8-bit. Also if anyone could explain to me, Why does a Werewolf expose its rear end when It takes a shotgun to the face?Then there is the AI friendlies. They die in one hit and fail to make any kills.			"

												This game is worth $5... no more... no less.5 hours of game play.50 minutes of headaches.5 minutes of bad cut scenes5 mins of editing INI files.50 secounds of fun with the flamethrower.This isn't a bad game. It's not a good game. It's a game. Interesting plot/story in so far as the mythology is concerned. TERRIBLE voice acting. Truly the actors either didn't care or were directed badly. Either way it's not good.The save check point is annoying but not terrible since it saves your weapons and reloads all your ammo.The power yes... one. Could have been interested or at least had upgrades but no...All in all it's a fun distraction and if you're looking for an average FPS where you are the Hero and saviour of mankind then yes this game is for you.One thing though... there is a nasty clipping bug for the final level where you fall through the last elevator... horrifying that this wasn't addressed by the developer.No patch just some advice involving INI files.Here is the solution that worked for me. Best of luck fellow gamer.Here is a fix that works for most people.Open the PandoraEngine.ini (on vista it is on C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config-Folder) and search for""MaxSmoothedFrameRate=300"" and change the value to 60. So the game runs at maximum 60 fps. Play through to next check point save then edit it back to 300 and continue game.If a setting of 60 does not work try 30.Game will not run so good but it's only a short run to the next checkpoint where you can then reset back to 300 and trust me you will want to.GG.

												Don't expect a tripleA title when purchasing this game. But in fact, it's not that bad as long as you don't compare it to other, major FPS franchises.The storyline is interesting, diverse maps, many different enemys that require a unique approach, Weapons feel ok.As a time waster it's pretty tolerable, and in fact it does nothing especially good, but also there are no major cons...If you look for a cheap and average FPS-experience where you don't have to think much, this is the game for you.For all others: Better avoid it, it isn't a masterpiece and the game doesn't show anything new or does something particularly good, but it's a solid apocalypse-themed FPS with ok-ish graphics and average, CoD-like singleplayer gameplay.

												The only reason I am giving this game a negative review is the potential of a final game glitch that seems to occur on computers: The Elevator Fall Glitch.Spoiler: On the final assault, you are to enter an elevator to get to the last stage. But for some reason on computer, it causes you to glitch and fall through the floor and making you unable to complete the game. I like this game a lot an have played it a number of times on Xbox, but the fact that the computer version has this huge glitch that wasn't fixed as lead me to conclude it must be a bigger problem than previously expected.

												The jumping mechanics in this game are horrible. Your normal jump barely moves you a foot forward and the sprint jump sends you rocketing worward at least 10 feet. This wouldn't normally be something I complain about except for the fact that everything I've played so far in the game has been a jumping puzzle. Also, you get different weapons to fight enemies with but there's no point as everything dies with 2-3 swings of your axe. Inanimate boxes actually damaged me more than the ""enemies.""			"

												WARNING: This game has a game breaking bug, however it can be finished with tweaking a settings file for a very short section of the game. See Discussions Forum for Details!With that being out of the way, I can still fully recommend this game. It doesn´t take itself too serious, shooting the various Monsters is fun, the gameplay can´t really decide if it want´s to be old- or new school, but somehow it works. The campagin is fairly short (5-6 Hours) but at this price point it´s worth it and nothing to complain about. The overall look & feel of this is similar to an Hollywood-Action-Summer Blockbuster.

												I think this game rightfully gets in the mixed ratings category, but please don't skip this game simply because not everyone said it was good.It is a very standard FPS, but the mythological enemies really do sell it for me. How many FPS games do you get to lob a molatov cocktail at a werewolf and fire rockets at griffons? And the other legendary monsters are all very unique and fun to fight.The story is kinda basic too and the characters are a bit bland (you play as a silent protagonist for crying out loud) but I didn't pay the small price tag to get great literary characters (but I admit it would be awesome if I had). Actually it's probably better that the protagonist is silent, it keeps it from making him ""edgy"" like all the current heroes need to be.And it is a small price tag, but it is a short game: 7 hours for me on hard.I'd just say that I really enjoyed it and would probably play it again just because of the enemies. They really are fun to fight and even just to get scared of when you realize a werewolf is right behind you. The set pieces are fun too from the odd little boss fights to the tracking down a device to open the next door to just stopping and taking in the craziness of what's going on where you are.One more thing: I didn't really have the best computer to render graphics for this game. It was like playing an alpha build for it. And even when the werewolves, floor, and walls didn't have textures on them I still was having a blast. I know some people would have a problem with that if their computer isn't good enough though.It's not Halo, it's not Half-life (although I see some similarities), but it doesn't have to be. It's unique. High recommendations.			"

												Legendary is a pretty good first-person shooter full of intense action. I wasn't really expecting much, but it turned out to be a good buy. The story is nothing special, the game's rather linear and you can't backtrack, but that doesn't really bother me. The action is great and there's lots of it. Some of the enemies are really tough, but man do you feel like Rambo mowing down everyone with a machine gun.One thing that bothers me is that switching weapons doesn't seem to have any logic (I guess it changes depending on which one you picked up last), and I always choose the wrong weapon first, which is annoying in the middle of action. And even though the game is linear, there are still some ""where do I go, what do I do"" moments, and the rapidly spawning enemies don't help. But most of the time the game works well and is really fun. If you like Half-Life style action, you could check this out.+ Full of intense action+ Good weapons+ Interesting enemies+ Solid graphics and music (though nothing special)+ Challenging but fun~ Linear, can't backtrack (doesn't really bother me)- Weapon switching is confusing- The mouse is not very precise when aiming with sights or scope4/5			"

												$2.99 ain't bad for this game. If you're into Pandora's Box-Mythology-Lovecraftian stuff, this game is gonna be fun for you. It has enough story to not feel like you're playing a FPS, though your vision is first person, so if you're new to FPS and trying to branch out from your RPG-filled library this would be a good transition game. I've never been one for FPS games until recently and I found  this game to be easy to pick up and not THAT hard to get myself around with minimal dying.Overall: I would pay current price, but if you want it practically for free then wait for the next sale.

												So, as someone who REALLY wanted this game and was super hyped for it back when it was first announced but chose not to get it after the horrible reviews, here's my review after finally picking this game up.Overall, I'd say it's a pretty good little game.  I definitely wouldn't have paid full price for it at launch now that I've seen it myself, but for the current price on Steam?  Definitely worth it.Pros:-Interesting enemies.  Werewolves and griffons in New York?  As cool now as it was back when this game came out.-Destructible terrain.  I've had enemies blow up bits of walls that I had no idea they could blow up so they could shoot me in the face.  There's a surprising amount of stuff that can be blasted apart to get at the enemy, and I really think this game could have done a little better if they had pushed this point a little harder.Cons:-Endless enemies.  Some areas the enemies just keep spawning and attacking you until you perform a certain action, other areas you simply can't advance until you've killed enough enemies.  The fights where you have to kill a number of enemies tend to drag on, so it gets hard to tell which type of fight you're involved in.-Poor AI.  This is one of the killing points for this game after having the team hype up how advanced it would be.  I've seen enemies run circles around other enemies because the other guy was sitting where they wanted to sit.  And don't get me started on the number of times guys with shotguns thought they could peg me from the other side of a battlefield.-Buggy.  Quite buggy.  Loading from a checkpoint seems to respawn ALL enemies, even ones that you killed before reaching the checkpoint, and there's a fatal bug right before the final battle that you'll need to edit the game files to get around.-Story/writing.  Okay, I normally avoid bringing writing up, but when a guy comments about how he shouldn't be poking the mysterious puss sack only to start poking it again I'm going to complain.The game costs like $3 on Steam.  It's worth the price for a few hours of silly monster-mashing fun.  I admit I haven't beaten the game (I'm of the opinion that the final battle is just extremely poorly designed) but I absolutely have no regrets buying it.  The game probably would have done better in it's day if it had a lower price and wasn't hyped as much as it was, but as it's got neither the hype nor the price these days there's no reason not to check it out.

The feel of the way you move or hold your weapon is discouraging from going further. Too fast, too slow, never precise,....If there were a way to enable cheats I might continue it for the story, but since that is apparently impossible, I'll just delete it and forget I ever bought it...

Lucky Star is what Seinfeld might have been had it been animated, featured high school girls instead of adults, and slanted specifically at hard-core otaku. It is a show about nothing, one which lacks any semblance of a plot and seeks to derive its entertainment value from inane conversations about mundane topics and more anime, manga, and game references than you can shake a Popsicle stick at. The way it progresses, one might almost expect the Ramen Nazi to pop up at some point and say, “no ramen for you!”			"

												It's a shame really,  This game, judging by the screen shots, looked quite promising. However, it is let down frequently from the start by annoying and sometimes unnecessary development choices. If you are a fan of the invisible wall, you are in luck. The developer,  Spark Unlimited, almost certainly blew half their budget on them. They are implemented in a ' wait and see what we have to show you ' way. Fine, if you are building the up the story at a slow pace, and if obscured by scenery. However, the first ten minuets of the game are riddled with them, stopping you dead in your tracks in open space. They funnel you down certain paths to heighten the action and drama, but it's use is so sloppy that you will almost certainly be left more frustrated that captured by the environment.  The invisible walls will be placed in front of a small jump-able obstacle and open areas, or more often than not, dead in front of you so you physically stop to look at a set piece fall or some other mundane event. This is most noticeable in the beginning scene where you are told to flee from danger, only to be stopped ever 5 steps to watch the danger play out in front of you, while you stand their like a confused child. If you are expecting the sort of interactive storytelling more commonly associated with, Say, Half Life 2. You are out of luck. The opening scenes are a little like the beginning of Darksiders. Humans fleeing from winged monsters destroying a city around you. However, instead of capturing the excitement and joy that Darksiders offers, Legendarys offerings are much more hilarious. I laughed, audibly, when the ' Mexican Wave ' happened outside the museum. The hero of this game is, as in most FPS games, silent. But to make him seem more human and relatable, the developers applied Playstation 2 era facial animations to him. He is so convincing, his face slowly sliding into every expression known to man, that you will swear he has some form of medical condition. In fact, his appearance was so poorly handled I was sure the game was setting up the main villain.  To round this all off, once I acquired my first weapon I attempted to use it against the nearest enemy. But the axe just passed straight through it, over and over. The game was too busy showing me all the fun that I wouldn't be having.  The game feels unfinished, unpolished and linier. A cheap experience. What ever sale price this currently at, you would be better off keeping the money in your wallet and putting it towards a better game.			"

												For the price I paid for this on sale it's pretty good value. It's buggy though so much that I can't seem to complete one of the later levels (I think it's the last) I step in an elevator and fall through the floor... game over reload and there you go again through the floor. The way they do sniping almost requires a mouse with sensitivity buttons to change sensitivity on the fly. But as I said for the price I paid i'd even recommend it as it seems not everyone get's this bug.			"

												This game is worth $5... no more... no less.5 hours of game play.50 minutes of headaches.5 minutes of bad cut scenes5 mins of editing INI files.50 secounds of fun with the flamethrower.This isn't a bad game. It's not a good game. It's a game. Interesting plot/story in so far as the mythology is concerned. TERRIBLE voice acting. Truly the actors either didn't care or were directed badly. Either way it's not good.The save check point is annoying but not terrible since it saves your weapons and reloads all your ammo.The power yes... one. Could have been interested or at least had upgrades but no...All in all it's a fun distraction and if you're looking for an average FPS where you are the Hero and saviour of mankind then yes this game is for you.One thing though... there is a nasty clipping bug for the final level where you fall through the last elevator... horrifying that this wasn't addressed by the developer.No patch just some advice involving INI files.Here is the solution that worked for me. Best of luck fellow gamer.Here is a fix that works for most people.Open the PandoraEngine.ini (on vista it is on C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\My Games\Legendary\PandoraGame\Config-Folder) and search for""MaxSmoothedFrameRate=300"" and change the value to 60. So the game runs at maximum 60 fps. Play through to next check point save then edit it back to 300 and continue game.If a setting of 60 does not work try 30.Game will not run so good but it's only a short run to the next checkpoint where you can then reset back to 300 and trust me you will want to.GG.

												$2.99 ain't bad for this game. If you're into Pandora's Box-Mythology-Lovecraftian stuff, this game is gonna be fun for you. It has enough story to not feel like you're playing a FPS, though your vision is first person, so if you're new to FPS and trying to branch out from your RPG-filled library this would be a good transition game. I've never been one for FPS games until recently and I found  this game to be easy to pick up and not THAT hard to get myself around with minimal dying.Overall: I would pay current price, but if you want it practically for free then wait for the next sale.

												For all the flak this game has gotten, I was plesantly surprised at how much I've enjoyed it. Sure, it is very linear and dosen't have the best graphics, but it is pretty decent. The story is probably the most enjoyable part of the game. Not only do you open Pandora's Box (literally), but you get to live through the latest apocalypse, and it dosen't even have to do with aliens or robots! You want an interesting shooter that deals with more fantasy than sci-fi, you should try Legendary.6/10			"

												To begin with, I was lucky enough that I haven't encountered any crashing/poor graphics problems like some are reporting. Runs real well at 1680 x 1050 for me, everything maxed out.  (Used Nvidia control panel to force some settings not available in interface).  Didn't have to mess with any ini files to get decent graphics.   Game is quite linear, lots of action, and a bit of a B movie storyline which I found fine for an FPS.  Got this for less than a buck,  wouldn't have been disappointed if I'd paid more.  Not A list, but for me a reasonably competent shooter.   Well worth a look if you like the genre.			"

												I feel like this game's store page gives the wrong impression. With the solid 5/10 meta score and the low price of $5 it's easy to assume this game isn't worth your time but it definitely deserves a look. By no means is it a blockbuster triple A title but what it is is a short fun FPS with innovative ideas and an intriguing story. Don't buy it if the slightest bit of repetitive gameplay annoys you or else the limited different types of enemies and needing to hold E for every door might get you down but if you're out of a game to play and like a little First Person action then pick this up. If it goes on sale then you have no excuse not to!In short - Buy it and love it for what it is, a short fun FPS to fill in the gaps.			"

That being said, if you expect anything other than a rehash of half-life (the original) with a different backdrop and creatures, you are out of luck. Same crawling thru vents, same whacking boxes with a hand tool, same pistol, rifle, kill the soldiers, go out of my way to turn of the electricity to go thru a  little bit of water...kind of game.

Lucky Star is what Seinfeld might have been had it been animated, featured high school girls instead of adults, and slanted specifically at hard-core otaku. It is a show about nothing, one which lacks any semblance of a plot and seeks to derive its entertainment value from inane conversations about mundane topics and more anime, manga, and game references than you can shake a Popsicle stick at. The way it progresses, one might almost expect the Ramen Nazi to pop up at some point and say, “no ramen for you!”			"

												Despite a little bit of clunkiness, Legendary has been really fun so far. Average fps gameplay with addition of animus which allows you to attack or absorb life force of the mythological enemies. The story so far has been sweet. Mythology vs real world = awesome. If this game had a more known publisher Icould see this game being a big hit, sadly it wasn't. i got it when it was $0.74. and even for price right now, i still say it worth a buy.			"

												I know the second you saw this you were confused. Legendary a good game?!?!? But I am being serious here. I loved this game. Everyone says either ""It is pretty moderate for a shooter"" or ""Bad game""  which I don't understand at all. I had more fun with this shooter than COD! In COD you fight a bunch of similair stupid ♥♥♥ enemies who have no special abilities at all. Or you play an average zombie survival mode. Or you play online agains't a bunch of screaming kids and swearing adults with absolutely no innovation at all even in the sequels it is almost exactly the same. What happens in Legendary? Griffins swoop down picking up enemies in their mouths and eating them. Werewolfs lunge at you and throw objects at you and when they are killed you have to chop of their heads or they recuperate. Fire drakes shoot fire out of their mouths at you but can be taken care of by activating a sprinkler or shooting a fire extinguisher. And while you are doing this a MASSIVE golem above is smashing through buildings and stepping on fleeing people. Also a giant tentacled beast is grabbing allies and pulling them to a watery grave. And guess what. Those tentacles can also grab you and the golem can also step on you. All these mythical creatures from different cultures are trying to kill you while you are trying to destroy a golem by activating 3 EMPs to seperate the energy of the golem from the body. Explosive spiders from Japan, Fire Drakes from old tales and a Kraken from common folklore. My favourite creature is the Nari. A creepy bat like creature with a childs face who can become a ghost and              a physical creature. They often possess objects and throw them at you and generally make life a pain. They steal objects needed for objectives and force you to chase them down often leading you to traps. One time a Nari stole a valve I needed to proceed and dropped it in a suspicious looking chamber. When I entered the doors closed and a fan possessed by the Nari  started sucking me towards it. Only by shooting the supports could I barely escape and when I did I was attacked by a tentacle and almost pulled towards my doom. And that is only level 2. The only bad thing I would say about this game is the graphics however because of the graphics it works on less powerful computers like mine. Some of the most popular games also have bad graphics like HL2 and Killing Floor but noone complains about that. All in all I would give it an 8/10. Definitely worth playing and fun.			"

												If it's on sale- I bought it for $0.74- definitely worth the price. I wouldn't spring more than maybe $2 or $3 for it though. It's fun enough to hold your attention, and it's different enough to be intriguing. Worth a few hours of your time, and if you don't like it, you're only out a buck.PROSIntriguing story.Just enough interactive elements to make it somewhat immersive.A different take on combat than you sometimes see. For example, some beasties you might have to injure in a very specific way in combat or after they are felled to win. It's different, and you'll have to think on what you know of mythology to really get it, which makes the plot that much more immersive.  Some of the environment is destructable and has to be destroyed to logically solve a puzzle to get to the next stage.CONSSomewhat on rails as you're essentially guided from one area to another by the environment. The intrigue is taken away if you read the notes on the creatures and such as they're somewhat spoilerific. Although much of the environment is interactive or destructable, enough of it isn't that it's easy to forget to try to puzzle through it as if it were a real-life or Dungeons and Dragons type game.

												Firstly, there's a bug on the final level requiring you to rewrite the ingame code limiting your max FPS to 30, just to get to the final boss.Secondly, everything is pregenerated, and not completely random i.e. spawns, certain interactions and checkpointed events.Mechanicly speaking, it's a decent game, but not worth the full price.  No replay value at all, and feels too repetitive. If you want a similar game to this with a higher replay value, I would recommend Darkness 2.  This game lacks way too many things to be any good, like in depth character development, decent story plot (in a game like this that's kind of important) has random difficulty scaling at times. All around one time play through value and that's it.			"

												Bypass Simulator 20081/10 ""Too much bypass in this game"".No, seriously, don't buy this game. You'll regret it. Even for 0,49€. All the game is about bypassing doors. The gameplay is just horrible. When you shoot with an automatic weapon, half of the time you can't move your mouse. When an ennemi (Which spawn without stopping, too much ennemi, don't expect to kill all of them, it's impossible) hit you, the camera of your head mooves and you can't do and understand anything. The ennemi humans don't miss a shot (They always hit you) and the end of the game is just f*cking hard, even in normal. You can also be killed by nothing, maybe too much oxygene in the air. Weapons are useless against monsters (Except for the Rats/Wolves) and you'll have to bypass with them nearby. Your team (because they'll be there sometimes) is absolutely useless because they always die fast (Even with an armor, what you don't have). Monsters can kill them in 1 shot. Also, they somtimes hide behind a wall to shoot at the ennemies, and covering again. But they hit the wall so it's useless. The scenario is ok, but ideas are not used correctly. The game is so much scripted. Last con is checkpoints. Always put where you don't need it. At the end of the game, if you are to the point of win and you die, you'll restart at the beginning and you'll have to do the same hard thing.Overall, the game is boring, frustrating and i don't recommend you to buy it.

												Totally worth the $0.94 that I paid for it. It's linear FPS mayhem with a lil' bit of magic. Storyline is decent, but the game was told and wrapped up well. Controls are tight, but jumping up/down is cosmetic, however you can sprint-jump gaps. I wish the campaign was a little longer and that there were more big bosses. This game could use a sequel. 8/10(on sale) Would buy at that price, and play again. There is NOT a multiplayer.			"

												A modern-themed FPS where you fight mythical beasts with modern weapons. Showing it's age now, I still enjoyed it. Sadly the game ends with a cliffhanger and time has already told there was no sequel to this property. If none of that bothers you or you are not past a little retro-gaming, this could be a fun choice if you pay a pittance during a sale -- Fighting werewolves and Griffons with a machine gun can be fun... and they do an alright job of portraying the horror and chaos of modern forces and civilians trying to grapple with the sudden appearance of monsters. Not a bad game. I played it to the hilt.			"

												This game is a generic shooter, nothing exactly special except for the story of Pandora's box. Gameplay is generic while graphics are decent for its time, the strong point of the game is the story. When you start the game it becomes repetative but for me I actually like that. This game has mixed reviews overall and I for one just find it as a guilty pleasure, its just a good game to kill time. Don't expect anything ground breaking from this game, Its not for eveybody. FINAL VERDICT: 6/10 (Good)Reasons: Good Story               Standard Graphics               Mediocre Gameplay               Frame Drops               Good Price               Minor Glitches			"

												Point out some of the bad things first:Jump: SucksPuzzles: SuckEverything else is good. I don't really have high expectations when it comes to games, unless the story line sucks. Weapons are good and all, and all I see is a small time delay for hitting humans. Only because I have a low graphics card but runs sort of smooth. Just a bit jumpy for my pc but over all, game is great.			"

												i got to the warehouse area where ""werewolves"" pour in non stopthen i encountered an issue, this is that i more or less sprint-jump clear across the entire room when im trying to just jump a normalacceptable distance for a sprint-jump.i was stuck there half an hour before i said ""ehh, not worth it"" and deleted it from my systemother things (might be me) but i turn fast when i turn left, then i turn super slow when i turn right, it was easier just to turn left until i was right-facing.there was also the issue of having to decap werewolves, but having them clip into a wall from the shoulders upat times enemies would either just stand there seemingly be completely bewildered and let me kill themthe storyline was forced and the whole game is in setpeices that were irritating at best to navigate and it fealt like i was punished for standing and observing something, often the landscape would seemingly crumble overhead or i would recive damage in a random hall as if to say ""keep moving, dont look at stuff!"" overall: not worth the $0.87 i paid when it was on a steam sale			"

												Legendary is a good game in general, it is very linear upon the storyline as there are many invisible walls trying to prevent you from wandering around into meaningless places, the combat in it seems to be decent; for the time it was made that is. There are afew jump scares in it which keep the gamer from falling asleep but, if you are somebody who likes completing games this is not the game for you as on the last level there is a glitch in which you fall through the floor making it impossible to complete the game, i spent 3 hours playing it and completed everything (up to the glitch that is) so if you are looking for a game to last you some time dont buy this game. But all in all i had fun playing this game :)			"

												I had a great time with this game, i walked into it expecting problems due to the reviews but i never once encountered a noticable glitch or failure, there is one thing that i hated the most about this game, the jumping you jump like an inch, and it feels like there shouldn't even be jumping, but if you want to go 30 mph just get to a ledge and sprint jump off, you'll go flying. This game has alot of cool moments, but at other times it feels a tad bit boring. Especially at the end, there isn't any feeling of urgency during the final level. I only died once, and it was because one of the monsters in this game, the minotaur, is a pain in the ♥♥♥. He will constantly follow you, running at your pace unless your sprinting, he flawless tails you even when charging, he runs through the walls in the arenas, that they put you in to fight him, flawlessly, it's like he can walk through the damn things. The game tells you to shoot him in the back, and that is super difficult because he rarely charges and when he does, it's hard to dodge. Every other enemy though is easy to fight. This game will turn into a puzzle game easily, there will be times where you have no idea what to do, and the solution is so obvious you don't notice it. The weapon switch is super slow. When you try to heal yourself with the ""aminus"" juice you have, it takes a little longer than it should, and is hard to control. God help you if you're trying to pick up a weapon while running if you're being chased, it's a huge thing that would've helped me during a lot of battles. On the good side the cutscenes, soundtrack, atmosphere is amazing, the AI is ok, i've seen them do some stupid ♥♥♥♥ though. Overall for five dollars i think this is a steal, if you like games with good graphics that run well even on the highest settings with bad pc parts, this is your game, my ram runs at like 500 mhz, and i ran it on highest settings.

												I bought this for $0.76, beat it in 5 hours, then unistalled it. Will I ever play it again? Probably not. Was it worth it? Yes. Well, considering the price, I can't really complain. FPS are my favorite genre and Legendary does everything a Half-Life type FPS should do, in an average-to-subpar way. I will say that the menu screen are horrible, but who cares?. Gunplay was fine, premise was cool, execution was a off in a lot of places, no real biggie. Story-wise I didn't really care/pay attention, but I knew what I was getting into for a $0.76 game. One thing, however, that bugged me about the story: the game just sorta ends. Like in ""Did It glitch and play the credits"" sort of way. Ehh. At the end of the day, however, this is the cheapest game I have ever bought on steam or anywhere else. I probably would have paid the whopping full price of $5 if I hadn't found it on sale first and been just as happy.			"

												Decent.Bought it cheap on Halloween Sale.Story: Decent. Some points are predictable, but it keeps you going. A good author could novelize the game into something much better. Graphics: Decent. Grayscaled Unreal Engine 3.Creatures: Good. I enjoyed reading the description on the in-game protagonist PDA. They researched their monsters.Gameplay: Decent. Mildly repetitive & linear. The introduction of new monsters every little while makes it intresting.There is a glitch in the final level of the game that can be fixed manually by use text editor to edit one of the game's files. That sucked!If you catch it on sale, it's worth a few hours of play. The hate it receives is too much.			"

												Legendary. The game that *tried* to look like it was going to be open world.This game was a complete disgrace and I wish I never dropped 2 bucks on this crap. The tutoial, understandingly linear even felt like it was acting like a open world game.With the 19 (really about 12 minutes) I played of this game felt like hours. I got out of the tutorial; only for more open world (not really; but we made it look like it), it plays a cutscene. And another cutscene.Anyway; outside of it's not open world gameplay, You get meteoker voice acting, Bad writing, Linear as hell gameplay, Bad levels, etc. Just,  Not fun.  The story goes you are in some museum, you put your hand in ""Pandora's box"", and OH HEY THIS THING IS MAGIC. Now you have magic powers as the museum begins collapsing and various myths start popping out (You know; this could EASILY become a ghostbusters game at this point) and you have to run to the metro then in which case you have to make this jump (that you have to figure out how to cross yourself) THEN keep running to the metro while miracoulously NOT being murdered by these things while cars are being flung at various people closing   and all open world opprotunities [/b]  for that level. Then; you get into the metro and the SAME CRAP HAPPENS. At which point I decided to stop playing.Had the game captured me better I would feel good about playing the rest.The final rating for this game as I see it is about a 20/10. It has a great idea for a game; but horribly made. "
