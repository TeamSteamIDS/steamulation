												It's a well polished game where the loot is actually viable to use. You are not just selling everything to the vendor but you find stuff that you can use and come up with different combinations for your characters like maybe an embermage that carries a gun and a shield or a traditional weapon like a staff or even two wands. Simple put: the itemization in the game is enormous! There are skill trees available that offer numerous different builds. For example, I started with an embermage and went all +Ice damage. But then I added some fire gear and spells and now I have a completely unique spell build that just makes me want to create another embermage to try out different combinations.The only thing that I am not a big fan of is the art work and bright color scheme of the game. At first it wasn't my cup of tea per say but it actually does work well for the style of story they are presenting the customers/gamers.It's extremely well done. There is no Auction House or Real Money Auction House. It is the standard for an ARPG and what a game should be.			"

TL;DR? See ConclusionNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:Torchlight (1) ReviewINTRODUCTION:Torchlight II is an isometric action Role-Playing Game developed and published by Runic Games who's composed of developers from popular titles such as Fate and the Diablo (1 and 2). This game was designed to resurrect the old school dungeon crawler genre adding to it a fresh coat of paint and an attempt to quench the thirst for the classical isometric experience. True to the formula on what made the first Torchlight great, Torchlight 2 is one of the better Dungeon Crawler / Top-Down Action RPG available in the market.PLOT (No Spoilers):The game takes place several years after the first game. The Alchemist, one of the three original heroes, gets corrupted by the Heart of Odrak, the monster that was the source of evil that plagued the small town of Torchlight. The Alchemist, wearing new power armor and wielding the Heart of Odrak, destroys the town and sets out on a mysterious quest that would, if not stopped, eventually disrupt the flow of nature and interrupt the delicate balance of power in the world. PROS:+ Classic gameplay with nice little tweaks to fit the modern age of gaming+ Colorful Graphics+ Good level variation and environment design+ New classes and a much more varied choices for pets+ Much more complex skill tree: This is a good new addition from the first game. More complex and more specialized player builds are sure to come up.+ Good re-playability: Lots of characters, lots of builds and lots of loot.+ Multiplayer option that was absent in the first game+ Better end game content+ PC hardware friendly+ Steam Workshop Support+ Does not require 24 hour internet connection to play. CONS:- Inferior voice acting: -Unlike Diablo II who had very good dialogue and memorable quotes.- Inconsistent volume levels on dialogue: -background music can sometimes drown NPC voices.- Confusing Story: -The story isn't immersive enough to keep you interested. Story is also very difficult to comprehend without paying close attention and references.- Inconsistent Difficulty: -Normal is extremely easy that you will probably get bored the moment you get some of your more powerful skills/spells. Hard and Elite however are extremely difficult that it would make a frustrating experience to the casual gamer. I would recommend playing at Hard since I believe that getting a better challenge is much more acceptable than getting bored.- Connecting to multiplayer can sometimes be difficultCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME, GREAT BUY and comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.WORTH IT?:Whether this game is at full price or on a sale, this game is worth your money.FINAL NOTES:Torchlight 2 is a great spiritual successor to the classic Diablo games that provides a good alternative to the Always-Online Diablo 3 experience (specially if you're only looking for a Singleplayer or Local play.) WORTH IT?:This is a MUST BUY and MUST TRY title for both fans of the classic isometric RPG games and new players alike.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												I didn't buy this for a long time, despite wanting to try it, because in my opinion, once you'd played one Diablo clone, you'd played them all. And I still hold this opinion to be very true in a lot of ways - for example, Titan Quest, while initally intriguing, became a hellish repetitive single-player slog through to the end that, after 20-something hours of playtime, left me exhasted and scarred. Torchlight, however, surpised me. Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation within the same class, or the well-honed difficulty scaling that makes you feel like you're always growing, or perhaps it's all these features combined that make this game stand out. The controls are intuitive and the mechanics of the game are well-implimented. The enemies are numerous and varied, and there's always surprises to be found in every corner of the randomly-generated maps. The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle. In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely. On the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart. Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server. Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game. I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat? In any case, all I can recommend is that you start multiplayer games at exactly the same time.Torchlight 2 is a well-made, deep and enjoyable experience, especially with friends, that separates itself enough from other Diablo clones to really stand at the top of the pile.

												Let's be completely honest, Torchlight was a Diablo clone. Nothing odd about that either, seeing as both Max Schaefer and Erich Schaefer worked on the game - both once members of Blizzard North, the team behind Diablo and Diablo 2. So, basically, Runic Games returned to the same formula, polished it up a bit, incorporated a few cool features and voila - a new RPG was born. As Torchlight 2 boldly steps onto the contemporary gaming scene, ready to tackle heavy competition (well, mostly Diablo 3) we are immediately drawn into its simple and yet incredibly compelling gameplay mechanics.Torchlight 2 commences several years after the conclusion of the original game. The Ember Blight has corrupted the Alchemist. The Ember Blight originates from an ancient evil entity known as the Heart of Ordrak, which is the very source corruption beneath the small town of Torchlight. Your task is to put a stop to this evil, which threatens to disrupt the balance between the six elements of the world.Simplicity is the key, as you'd imagine. Torchlight 2 takes a similar approach to storytelling as Diablo 3. There isn't much of a plot or any exceptionally interesting characters to draw you away from the gameplay. To be honest though, Diablo 3 does have a better story than Torchlight 2, but I guess that's beside the point. Slashing your way through countless foes is the main drive here, so essentially, you'll be on familiar ground if you've been playing Diablo 3 in recent months. There's nothing wrong with borrowing Diablo's mechanics, particularly in T2's case, because Runic has really polished this one to perfection. Everything works smoothly. There are no hiccups during combat or exploration that would warrant any major concern.There are four character classes to choose from. The Engineer (Railman in Torchlight), who represents a heavy fighter suitable for melee combat, the Outlander who employs magic and ranged weapons, The Berserker who's quick and agile and often uses animal-based powers and, last but not least, the Embermage, who mainly resorts to powerful spells. The combat differs according to the class you choose. For the single-player playthrough, I selected the Engineer and it was fun all the way. The fact that this is a character focused on close combat doesn't mean that you can't make use of certain magical abilities and scrolls that can be picked up along the way. This goes for other classes too. So, apart from your default class-based skills, you also get a chance to use a range of useful spells that can help you heal or improve your character's abilities like movement, marksmanship etc. Players have one basic attack, a secondary attack and an additional powerful attack that deals extra damage - providing the charge meter is filled up. The more it fills up, the more damage you can cause with this attack. Usually, the best way to handle groups of enemies is striking when the charge meter is maxed out, giving you the edge in combat (even when you're massively outnumbered).The game is likely to hook players straight away, largely thanks to its appealing loot system. There's an impressive variety of items on display and ready for players to make use of. Exploring as much of the map as possible is the key to this game. Locating hidden areas and defeating stronger enemies is often enormously rewarding. Taking your time to sort your gear to suit your play style is what the whole thing is about. For instance, items like swords, axes and staffs may come in socketed variants, so you have to decide which chips, shards and gems to attach (depending on which enemies you're facing). In addition, the same item can then be enhanced by visiting the Enchanter in the local town. Certain armor and weaponry may hold class-specific traits, so you need to keep your eyes peeled for those.The game is enjoyable both in solo and multiplayer modes. There's nothing more satisfying than taking on hordes of baddies with friends and things can really heat up in Torchlight 2. Several cool boss encounters await players and the really cool bit ensues when friends join together, mixing different abilities to take these large opponents down. There are certain impracticalities in multiplayer such as having difficulties finding sessions created by friends. This may prove annoying if you want to jump smoothly and quickly into a co-op game. However, as soon as things kick off, Torchlight 2 becomes a barrel of fun in multiplayer.The graphics have been significantly improved since the release of the original. The cartoonish-style art looks great, while every area in the game was meticulously designed and, of course, enriched with Matt Uelmen's eerie Diablo-inspired tracks. Matt is the renowned video game composer, best known for his brilliant darkish Diablo and Diablo 2 melodies. Subtle touches, like beautifully animated background details, create an eye-catching atmosphere. Also, we salute the animation team that brought all those cute little monsters to life and were responsible for a variety of cool-looking spells to boot.Torchlight 2 is an experience you can't easily walk away from. The combat is the beating heart of the game. It's simple and incredibly fun. Commendably, Runic improved everything they possibly could in this one. As I've already said, I witnessed sharper and more colorful visuals, in addition to a delicious multiplayer mode that allows up to six players (a highly compelling feature not present in the first title). This is quite simply an action RPG that has everything for both fans and newcomers to the genre. Don't miss out on it.			"

												After 250+ hours i can say this game is a great sequel to Torchlight, and i'm not going to stop playing it. TII has improved almost every aspect of the original game. It basically is a greatly expanded version of Torchlight, with wider maps, more items, more enemies and more classes to choose from. Everything seems smooth and well placed. It is a pleasure to keep trying new classes and, most importantly, new builds and skill paths. In conclusion: Torchlight II is a great hack 'n' slash every fan of this type of games should own. It will entertain you for hours and hours and you will hardly repeat boring actions like farming and grinding. A must have, for such a low price.			"

												Torchlight 2 is the successor of Torchlight, having you pick up right where the action ends in the first game, in a scenario where you must again save the world.Unfortunately, I did not play the original Torchlight, but that might intrigue others who are coming into Torchlight 2 as their first game of the series.Torchlight 2 came out around the same time as Diablo 3 and was arguably better at that time, the controls feel very tight and responsive and the combat enjoyable and satisfying. Diablo 3 has improved, however, and so has Torchlight 2! The huge modding community has added such a dearth of content to the game it's almost added an entire gamesworth of content to it!For myself, I completed the game on Veteran mode within 22 hours and enjoyed it all. It got a little tedious towards the end as I just wanted to complete it, but that's just me being impatient and not being too au fait with these types of games (D2/D3/PoE etc). But yeah! A great game overflowing with charm and depth! Check it out!Nilesy			"

												I didn't even realize I had over 300 hours in this game until I decided to write this review. That's how fast time flies with it.It has depth; it has fun; it has character. And most of all — a feature that separates it from most ARPGs out there — it's rewarding. You can reach level 100 with a character without hundreds of hours of mindless grinding. You can get rewarded for intentiveness with builds. You can play however you like.It does lack in a few departments, namely, some of the lore and bosses are shoddy. However, the sheer number of brilliant design decisions in this game in terms of character progression, gear management and peripheral activities greatly ouweighs its shortcomings. Give it an honest try, and you won't regret it.			"

												It is a very fun game.Many call this the worthy successor of Diablo 2.The combat is extremely rewarding and smooth.Unlike many RPGs,you actually want to go and grind because it feels so good to kill stuff and the graphics are extremely appealing.The storyline is pretty boring to be honest,it didn't even try to make it interesting.I was more concentrated on the loot and the killing even though the game really tried to be a bit storyline oriented.This I believe is a weak point,some people may enjoy a good story but TL2 doesn't have one.A strong point of the game is the replay ability of it.After finishing the story you can choose to continue the game in 2 modes,either do random dungeons or restart the campaign with the same character but face equally strong monsters.Another thing that makes this game replayable is the sheer number of mods that you can find for it.The skill tree/abilities and characters are pretty basic,I would say user-friendly because you quickly learn the game.It could have been better polished with more options and more paths but it's decent,this might upset the ''hardcore'' players of the genre.One of the best RPGs around and it is incredibly cheap for the amount of content it has to offer.

												Runic Games, creator of the award-winning Top-Down, Action-RPG Torchlight, further the Torchlight franchise with the second rendition in the saga, Torchlight II.Torchlight II commences with you, the protagonist, in hot pursuit of the Dark Alchemist, the inevitable villain. The Heart of Ordrak, which he has taken, has imbued him with inconceivable powers & a clear purpose. Will you be able to stop him before his mental blight sets Vilderan aflame?The game takes place in Vilderan, a vast continent, sub-divided further into different areas. Vilderan’s areas are diverse & unique to each Act, from lonesome deserts to dense marshes. It invariably exudes an open-world adventure unlike its predecessor.There are four distinct classes – Engineer, Outlander, Embermage & Berserker. Each class has three different skill trees, which enable mixing & matching different skills to maximize efficiency and/or enjoyment. All weapon types can be used by any class, further adding to the sheer variability of play styles. The character creation screen has a small selection of different aesthetic options. The option to choose between genders is also present. There is a wide variety of pet companions to choose from. There are four distinct difficulties – Casual, Normal, Veteran & Elite. They pleasantly suit a wide array of gamers & scale in difficulty at a fairly even pace. Hardcore mode – a defining proponent of the genre – is also present & available at any difficulty. Enable at your own risk, of course. The co-op in Torchlight II boasts of a user-friendly system that enables up to six players to play together. Either join a band of adventurers or start your own adventure & wait for others to join in on the fun. From showing your friends your lackluster DPS while a werewolf teaches you a lesson in face-to-paw combat to trading your wares to better your gear, the co-op experience is not to be glossed over.Did anyone mention modifications? Steam Workshop enables the use of a sheer endless amount of mods to suit almost every whim. Mods may also be used during co-op sessions if users have the same mod(s) installed.The graphics and universal interface in Torchlight II are reminiscent of its predecessor but overall feel refined & improved upon. The graphics while marginally cartoony bring the world to life & does the game its due diligence. The musical notes are fairly bland & unmemorable; they don’t go beyond fulfilling their base purpose. Apart from the musical notes, the animation sounds are crisp & noteworthy, bringing Vilderan to life.In conclusion, Runic Games’ Torchlight II is the quintessential culmination of the defining proponents of the Action-RPG genre & an improved iteration in the Torchlight saga. Truly, a must-have masterpiece in the collection of any Action-RPG fanatic.9.5/10			"

-Quick Review-Torchlight II is a dungeon crawler game that lets you chose to play as a few different classes. The basic concept is the same as nearly all dungeon crawlers:  Explore, level up, find gear, beat the boss, rinse and repeat. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Oh no! the alchemist is going to bring about the end of the world! You there, unnamed random hero, it's your job to warn everyone, and be just a few steps behind the alchemists defiling touch.As I implied, you're obviously the hero, the villain you will be trying to catch is known as ""the alchemist"", whom has been corrupted and destroys all that is in his way.Game Play: I sense that most dungeon crawlers are time consuming on purpose, I spent a good 30-40 hours before I beat the game, then I kept playing for another 30 hours to get to max level, and at that point I stopped playing.The whole dungeon crawler genre is criticized for giving us ""carpool tunnel"", you click, a lot. you do use keys to cast different spells, attacks, and abilities. So for fair warning, you will spend a lot of time in this game clicking.There is a feature in the game that lets you load up your pet with tons of gear, and send 'em back to town to sell them for you, or buy health potions, basically you never need to go to town to sell gear or buy potions, you're servant pet will do it for you. What does this mean for you, brave adventurer? More dungeon crawling, less vendering trash items! Yay!  (Hopefully!) Achievements: So I hit 76% completion on this game, I've given up trying to actively get 100% completed for achievements, mostly because RNG (Random Number Generator) hates me. I decided getting above 75% was pretty good for a game with 123 achievements, many requiring grinding.Achievement categories: Beat the game/boss, try doing this, kill this many enemies, open this many of these, do this ____ amount of times, get lucky, play long enough to do this 100,000,000 times. Again, basically I assume that I'll eventually make more progress on this game as I find people who are like ""hey, play this with me!"" and I'm like ""okay, I only need to 3,000 more potions! let's do it!""Half of these achievements are from just playing the game, so you can enjoy that, but getting 100% will require a lot of play time. Just a warning :)Price: Torchlight II costs $19.99, I've spent 70 hours playing it. That's definitely worth it. Most people will at least get over 20 hours in the game, even if they're not trying to beat it.As always, I suggest getting the game on sale or in a humble bundle, but the stand alone price is very much worth it, based on the amount of game time I squeezed out of it. Conclusion: Story: interesting the first time through, it was very dragged out (not in a bad way, really),  Game play: click x1,000,000 (over 9,000 clicks used in the making of this review), Achievements: nothing to write home about, Price: very good price based on the amount of time required to play through the whole game.This type of game is best suited for people who already know they like dungeon crawlers, I've played several, if you're new to the series this is a great game to start trying it out with! Just be warned there is a lot of clicking involved. Again, this game becomes a 100 times more fun with a friend or two. But, I did play through the whole game solo my first time.			"

YouTube™ Video: Torchlight 2 Review 

			Views: 1,654		

			We take a look at the hack and slash action RPG Torchlight 2! http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

Torchlight 2 takes everything that has come to define the action-RPG genre and delivers it all in an incredibly well polished package. From fast paced brutal hack n’ slash combat to immersive diverse level design to an abundance of loot, Torchlight 2 has it all. Developed by Runic Games; a small Dev team of around 30 members in Seattle WA, they prove that they have what it takes to create a quality product that can compete and even outshine the likes of juggernaut developer Blizzard and their own ARPG Diablo III.The game starts the way you would expect an Action-RPG to start, by choosing your characters class. The game offers four different classes to choose from; Outlander: the gun wielding bad♥♥♥♥♥class, Engineer: the steampunk style, tinkering, gadget using class, Embermage: the typical wizardry spell casting class, and the Berzerker: the warrior heavy hitting class.  Each class feels different enough from one another where your play throughs still feel fresh and entertaining if you decide to give the game another play through as a different character. The combat is fast paced and hectic, the best way to describe the way it feels would be to call it a “controlled chaos”, meaning that while at times things do get crazy as you’re being ambushed by a massive horde of enemies, but you never resort to just spamming mouse clicks to succeed, you have to understand how your characters class works and use that knowledge to stay alive. For example; if you are an Embermage, you aren’t going to be able to rush head on into hordes of enemies and make it out alive like you would as a bulkier Berzerker.Next to the combat, the games second greatest strength is the level design, with each map being randomly generated you will never experience the same thing twice. This allows the game to continue to feel fresh if you decide to do multiple play throughs. While randomly generated maps aren’t anything new to games, Torchlight 2’s random generation feels like they are gorgeously hand crafted levels, if you weren’t already aware of the R&G then you wouldn’t ever be able to tell by the games gorgeously laid out levels and dungeons.The developers also paid a strong attention to detail in the weapons, armor, and items in the game. With such a large diverse number of weapons and various armors to equip you won’t become bored from having to use any one weapon or set of armor for any long period of time as there are loot drops and chests galore located all throughout the expansive dungeons you’ll be crawling your way through. But what good would such a large trove of weapons and armor be without an expansive onslaught of enemies to vanquish? Have no worries, the game has a large array of varying enemies to slaughter, from hulking snow beasts to dark lord necromancers the game does not burn you out on any one style of enemy.Torchlight 2 is best played with friends, but even if you don’t have anyone to play with Torchlight 2 provides you with a trusty animal companion who will fight alongside you. Not only does your pet companion work like a beefy tank to distract enemies when you have to run off and heal, but they are also your errand running slave, they double as a 2nd backpack that can be packed full of all the valuable loot that you’ve managed to acquire. You can then send your pet off to the market with a shopping list of various health and mana potions and he will sell your loot and return with the potions, this eliminates the need to travel all the way back to town yourself and interrupt your questing. Not necessarily a revolutionary gameplay mechanic but it is incredibly convenient and keeps the game pace going full speed ahead. Torchlight 2 doesn’t do anything that hasn’t really been done before, it’s not new or innovative, but it does take everything good that has been done before and bundles them all together and manages to deliver them all perfectly. The combat is seamless and the expansive diverse levels and dungeons leave much to explore. The game has so much to offer and I would highly recommend Torchlight 2 to anyone looking for a fun fast paced gameplay experience. "

												Amazing. Torchlight II is all about skill trees, equipment, looting, equipment, defeating hordes of monsters, making your name known to the world, and equipment. Did I mention equipment? Because you'll be finding tons of that. I love that changing equipment actually changes the appearance of your character (I wish there were vanity items because sometimes I went with the prettiest gear, not the ones with the best stats). Playing with a friend is, naturally, a lot more fun than on your own though, to be honest, all you need is the pet you choose at the very beginning because SPOILER: it will never die. There are a handful of such pets to choose from and the pet system is one of my favourites out of any I've experienced because, not only do they act as a completely necessary additional inventory (did I mention you'd find a lot of equipment?) but because you can send them off to sell the goodies you no longer need. Mind blown. If you're getting this game, that should be reason enough.There are also classes with their own customizable skill trees--both of which keep growing in diversity due to mods from other players. There's something for everyone: if you're into blasting everything to pieces with a cannon, do that. Fan of fire? There's a class for you, too. The world is constantly growing for new and old players alike.Torchlight II is a hack and slash adventure that will have you traipsing through zombie infested bogs, crossing the desert and going to the underworld itself in order to save your world from the evil Alchemist. I invested a solid 20 hours during my first playthrough and I'm ready for a second round with a whole new class.Buy it.			"

												Finally I found an action hack and slash game bringing me back in time to the edge of millennium. Running around searching every corner of the map and furiously clicking on everything that moves, that's what you want and what you get. Wide scale of equipment (inc. enchantments; gems) and talents gives you many oportunities and playstyles and that's what every player appreciates. Torchlight 2 has much to offer, just grab it and play! I recommend Synergy mod, it significantly increased my personal rating. In basic game there are only 4 classes with 3 talent branches, synergy widen this to 8 and that gives this game a new dimension, but it is only one feature, there is more torchlight players shouldn't miss this. 8.5 /10			"

												If your a fan of the diablo 1 & 2 and your looking for an alternative to diablo 3.Then look no further torchlight 2 will be a game you will want to play.Sadly there are few things which prevent it's from achieving a masterful status. The lore of torchlight 2 is not that interesting and cutscene are reminess of bad cartoon network show.The voice over is not that great and the story it self is something we have seen a 1000 time.However the pet system, looting gear and the Master Full soundtrack will keep you entertain till the end 7.9/10 Verdict: Torchlight 2 should satified your looting needs just dont expect the quality of a Blizzard Game.

Torchlight 2 ReviewOne only has to look at the numbers to see that Runic Games really struck gold when they released the hit sequel Torchlight 2 as a follow-up to their original action RPG game, Torchlight. While it may not give anything new to the genre and it didn't win a bunch of awards like its predecessor, it still sold over 2 million copies in less than a year of its full release date. Impressive. The reason is quite simple: everything Torchlight 2 does, it does well.All of our favorite features from Torchlight return and have been improved, such as pets and fishing, in addition to some new features being added. Some of the changes you can expect to see include: an expanded crafting system, a longer campaign that spans across various maps, the user interface has been improved and made simpler, mods are openly welcomed, a Multiplayer co-op mode has been added, and now players have two choices to continue gameplay even after finishing the campaign with New Game Plus and Mapworks. The graphics and sound are really nice and the special effects are superb. With Torchlight 2's random map generator for dungeons, replay value is even greater. Loaded with action and filled with loot, this game is sure to entertain.Probably the best thing about Torchlight 2 is the seemingly endless customization possibilities. Players can choose their character from four different classes, each with their own unique abilities and specialized equipment. There are countless armor and weapon variations throughout the game, most of which add additional bonuses or power-ups to your character. Then of course, sockets can be added to the equipment which will allow you to insert gems into them, giving even more bonuses and special abilities. And don't forget that while journeying through the expansive dungeons scattered across the maps, players will come across furry little critters that offer an assortment of enchantments that can be added to each item for a fee. With the right combinations you can turn your character into a demigod and that's before you ever begin experimenting with the almost limitless crafting system where players can create stronger potions, better gems, more unique items and armor, etc.Of course, no game is perfect and players have their own tastes and preferences. So while the game is a lot of fun and highly recommended, there are a few things players should know when deciding on whether to buy this game or not. There is no controller support included with Torchlight 2. Players who prefer controllers over mouse will need to add in their own mapping or download one. The good news is there are several already out there and can easily be added, so its not a really big hassle. Don't expect a deep storyline in this game. While there is a story that plays out across the campaign trail, its not fleshed out very well and is less than enthralling. While it is lacking, this shouldn't be an issue for the most part because the game keeps the action moving at a steady pace so most players probably won't even give it a second thought anyways. Also, expect a few random bugs. Fortunately none of them are game-breaking and not of big consequence but they do exist. From fishing holes not being accessible to loot being hurled out of the player's reach or even characters occasionally being pushed onto a ledge by a charging mob with no way to escape (other than using a port scroll), know that on occasion something like this may happen. Players aren't really going to miss much of anything as a result and aside from these minor nuissances the game runs very smooth and never crashes.The Good:=======+  Good graphics with top-notch special effects+  Solid sound effects and above average voiceovers+  Full-length story campaign+  Limitless character & item customization options+  Variety of special abilities+  Well-developed crafting system+  Simple controls+  UI is comfortable and easy to use+  Multiplayer co-op+  Mod-friendly game environment+  Low resource requirements allow gameplay on most machines+  Steam Achievements & Trading Cards+  High replay value+  Price (similar games often cost twice as much)+  A ton of loot and treasureThe Bad:======-  No controller support included-  Random bugs (not game-breaking)-  No auto-collect for treasure after battle-  Story is not very intriguing-  A ton of loot and treasureFinal Thoughts:===========While Torchlight 2 isn't ground-breaking and its not going to blow your socks off, the game is still very entertaining and offers numerous hours of gameplay. There's a reason why its one of the most popular and liked games on Steam and can be found in most game libraries. This game has a lot of features included and all of them are packaged extremely well. If you don't already own it, I definitely recommend picking up a copy.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

Overall Rating: 9/10I can't believe I owned this game for so long and never played it until now. One of the more fun aRPG hack & slash games I have ever played. (/10 only because of some odd input bugs or glitches that prevented mouse inputs at times, making me use all keyboard inputs for short periods of time. Which was bit annoying and broke the flow a bit.First full playthrough as a REALLY tanky Berserker. Seemed like I was a bit too OP? (Played through in Normal Mode softcore). Tanked up hard, with obnoxious HP regen and signinifcant dmg reflects in gear and socketables, and made my pet a Warbeats (Mittens is a little badass...), mainly because I expected to take more, or even some damage. Made it through w/o using many pots. Still haven;t used 50 for the first achievement for pot quaffing. Kinda dissapointed it was so easy. Looking forward to using maps now and going into NP+. Quite possibly will do a HC run, even though I generally do not play HC in hack & slash games. Highly recommended to anyone who hasn;t played it yet. I can;t be the only one who wated so long. Can I? Great Easter Eggs and humor in the game, made it qyite fun. Ran beautifully on a true toaster, 100+ fps, which shocked me for as old as my rig is. No stutter or hitching. Only issues was the mouse input failures. Wired mouse, so no battery issues, mouse is functioning perfectly in othe games and on regular everyday PC apps. But it wasn;t gambreaking, so, not that big of a deal. Just a small PITA a few times.Just plain fun, though future builds may be done intentionally underpowered, just for more challenge.   :)			"

-----------------------Introduction---------------------One of the major fantasies I've had since childhood, is that of being a strong warrior. The concept of destroying hundreds of enemies with ease, facing legendary monsters, and having reality-breaking abilities, have been inspired through countless forms of media. Whether you're a superhero fanboy, or you're grounded in reality, the hero concept is always fascinating to explore. Torchlight 2 takes the simple hero concept, gives you a story, and some excellent gameplay to boot. With an overall rating of Overwhelmingly Positive, is it really worth the acclaim? In this review, we'll find out.------------------------Gameplay-----------------------Torchlight 2 at its core is an action RPG, in which you slay monsters, collect piles of loot, and clear countless dungeons. Taking inspiration from games such as Diablo, Mythos, Fate, and of course its very own predecessor Torchlight, this game expands upon a fairly well known formula, and creates something rather unique. You see, this game has the makings of an online MMORPG, but can be played completely offline. The loot-focused, grind-oriented nature of the game is something that is frequently delivered in a variety of games, but is not often done well. To my relief, this particular game really shines in this aspect.You generally take quests from NPCs, which you will find primarily in the base camps. There are many other quests to be found in the world as you explore, so there's never a moment where you should be lacking in direction. I particularly liked the feeling of having so many quests to complete as I journeyed. It reminded me of some of my favourite MMORPGs, and I finally realized what it was that I liked about them; direction. Don't worry about being overburdened, Torchlight 2 strikes a very fair balance between quantity, and quality. To my recollection, I never had more than about 3 active quests at a time.StoryTorchlight 2 is a story-driven game. It's about as predictable as one could expect, though this does not make it a bad story by any shot. A good story gives the player a real motivation; a reason to exist. No longer was I just your everyday hero. Instead, I was a pivotal character in this world. I was important, and I felt a sense of purpose as I cleared hallways and caverns of monsters, getting closer and closer to my end-goal.The story is divided into 3 major sections, exposing you to different environments with each, and bringing you closer to the final showdown. Playable CharactersYou start out by choosing between four distinct classes: Engineer, Berserker, Outlander & Embermage. Each one specializes in the use of unique weapons and armor, and each one can have a widely flexible play-style. To allow this, each class has 3 skill trees that they can allocate points to. Depending on your preferred gameplay style, you can take a melee or ranged approach. From bows, to dual swords, to staves, and even cannons, you'll find a rather large arsenal available to you, depending on your class. The number of potential builds are quite limitless, so it really inspires creativity and flexibility.In addition, you are given a permanent companion; a pet. This pet will usually serve as secondary storage, as well as additional damage if you so desire. I really love the pet selections, the ability to change its nature, and the ability to send it to do my shopping whilst deep inside a dungeon.CombatThe combat in this game is one of its greatest strengths. Each character has a wide selection of abilities. You can assign each one to a numbered hotkey, as well as your Mouse 2 button for easy casting. You can also have two separate weapon loadouts! This allows you to swap between two different weapons in the middle of combat, to further suit your play-style.During large battles, you'll find yourself running around trying to avoid dangerous monster abilities, while dealing damage at the right time. This is even more crucial for boss fights, as they often have unique mechanics which you need to play around with. There are a wide variety of monster abilities and strategies to be used, so you'll have a bit to learn.Game ModesWhile being primarily story-driven, Torchlight 2 extends the re-playability with New Game Plus, Mapworks (special dungeons for your grinding needs), and LAN or Online Co-Op. It's an absolute pleasure to have a game that caters to multiple gaming needs in this way. Whether you're home alone, or you want a great LAN party game, Torchlight 2 has you covered. You may be able to finish the story at level 50, but chances are, you'll probably not stop until you reach closer to level 100 thanks to the addictive nature of the game.In addition, Torchlight 2 supports MODS! Hell yeah! Thanks to the ease of modding, and the large community behind the game, there is an absolute ton of mods you can use to enhance your gameplay experience, and change almost everything about the game. If something about vanilla didn't appeal to you, chances are, there's a mod for that.-------------------------Visuals-------------------------While being slightly dated as of 2017, the graphics aren't the worst I've seen. In fact, they hold up quite well. While not being the primary area of concern, Torchlight 2 delivers a pleasant visual experience, filled with colours, particles and effects galore. Prefer something less fancy? Turning the settings all the way down is perfectly fine, and can help framerates on weaker PCs. Overall, while not being the primary focus of the game, I never found the graphics distracting or hideous to complain about. Many of the effects were quite beautiful, and perfectly suited their environments.Map DesignFrom wide platforms, to tight corridors, the world of Torchlight really felt immersive and really gave me a desire to explore every inch of it. To my knowledge, many (not all) of the maps are procedurally generated, which added to the unique feel of each new environment.----------------------Sound Design---------------------From the soundtrack of the game, to the varied sounds and effects of combat, I had a great experience with this game's sound design. Each shot from my Engineer's cannon felt powerful. You could really hear the kick of the blast, followed quickly by the sound of monsters dying and loot being dropped.There was a substantial amount of narration, mainly for the story, but it was well done. I had initially been uninterested in the story, but listening to it being read really gave it life and energy.-----------------Summary & Conclusion----------------Torchlight 2 is possibly one of the best games to play if you're interested in great combat, unique classes, and abundant mods. It's one of those old but gold types of games that you really shouldn't be skipping unless this type of game doesn't appeal to you in the slightest.At $20 you could easily spend hundreds of hours playing this game and it would be worth it. However, this game frequently goes on sale for a quarter of that price or less, so you really have no excuse not to get it.I rarely ever replay games, but I found myself coming back to this one, again and again.For excellence in the action RPG genre, I give Torchlight 2 a:10/10 - Addicting gameplay, Wide appeal, High re-playability & great fun!======================================This endorsement approved by The Reviewers' Union,providing better standards for reviews and reviewers.====================================== "

												After 2-3 years of not actively playing it, I gave this game another try for nostalgic purposes. These are my thoughts.A great game for its time, but destroyed by nearly every other ARPG to follow after it. Most of my hours on this game were put before Diablo 3, Marvel Heroes, and Path of Exile made substantial improvements to their games. First couple years this was out, game was bliss. Only other viable options were Titan Quest, Diablo 2, and Torchlight 1. The game was designed to be played in Multiplayer, apparently, but I spent most of my time solo. The multiplayer is actually very bad and scales terribly with the more players you have. Monster damage and health isn't properly tuned and everything ends up doing too much damage and being sponges, especially the bosses. It also forces you to sign up for a Runic account because apparently this is a good idea for some reason. The network code happens to be abysmal as well, and handles lag in the weirdest way I've seen in a game. For the person lagging, the game creates a seperate instance, until the lag stops. Causing confusion for everyone involved (wait you already killed those monsters?).You can manually allocate stats, but this doesn't actually matter. The most important stat will always be strength, unless you're using a shield, then you pump vitality in until you reach a high enough block chance, then back to strength. Enemies crit in this game, which is a stupid mechanic when there's no way to properly mitigate this, so you'll die to random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, making this game a poor choice to tick the ""hardcore"" option on.The protection and armor systems are probably the worst I've seen in this genre. There are no percentage reductions, only ""armor"" for each damage type. Which is literally a flat value. So if you've got 20 physical armor, you take 20 less physical damage. 60 poison armor, 60 less poison damage. There comes up a point pretty quickly in the game where the armor stats don't mean much at all, and it's more about dodge chance, stacking self heals, getting health boosts via gear, and popping potions constantly.In addition, no matter what mods you try, the game is inherently designed around doing what I described above, as well as using only one active skill (many of the skills for classes are worthless) and spamming it constantly. The rest of your skill points go into the overpowered passives. In addition, there are many skills in the game which scale terribly, and it's actually discouraged to improve upon them further, because it substantially increases mana costs which low level characters can't keep up with. Alternatively, some classes such as the Vanquisher (ranged gun user) can make builds around using the normal attack. But either way, the game is designed aroun you holding down and clicking on one button and mulching everything.Modding tools came out far too late after the game was out, and the community didn't end up doing much, and the tools are limited to begin with. So the modding scene has been dead shortly after the tools came out, outside of the most popular mod, Synergies. Which seems to be dead, when it hasn't had an update in over a year. The engine itself is quite bad, and lags horribly when too many monsters are on screen at once. It also has atrocious loading times, which are worse depending on how large of an area you're loading. For a game which has such poor graphics and didn't even look good for its time, this has always been very annoying. Titan Quest came out many years earlier and looks far better and suffers from none of this. In addition, there's almost zero benefit for using a solid state, so load times are perpetually slow!The good thing about this game, is this was THE game to play when there were hardly any competing ARPGs on the market. Years later, this game has proven to be an outdated relic. Which in many respects, Titan Quest, which came out years before it, is still a better game.It's totally worth buying on a sale, but not at full price. You'll possibly get one playthrough out of it. The campaign for TL2 is actually very well designed fun, but drags on at points, particularly in act 3. It offers a decent endgame and mods expand more on it somewhat. If you've been playing other ARPGs recently, such as Grim Dawn, Diablo 3, Marvel Heroes, and Path of Exile, you'll find yourself frustrated with this game pretty quickly, as it has no depth and customization worth a damn.

												Runic Games, w/ some former members of Blizzard and Travis Baldress of Fate, have once returned with Torchlight II. If Torchlight 1 felt a lot like Diablo 1 to you (in its ARPG gameplay department + with the constant direction of going further down the dungeons w/ each level), then Torchlight II should then feel like Diablo II. Torchlight II improves so much over the original TL, I don't even know where to begin - just like how Diablo II improved immensely over the original Diablo. Granted, TL2 has its own spin on the ARPG genre, in some ways: you have a pet by your side (who you can send back to town to sell items; who can help you in battle; etc); the graphics are much brighter + more colorful than Diablo series; and it has a steampunk-inspired setting. No longer are you confined to go down, down, and down the dungeons some more like Diablo. The game is now a bit more open and epic than that. TL2 sports multiple towns - just like Diablo II. Also, the side-quests here - they also can be found when you're out an about in the game-world, which likely will have their own areas and dungeons for you to crawl through. Combat is as awesome and as action-packed as ever, with the game constantly chucking out tons of new and unique loot to the player to modify and upgrade; and there's tons of skills to learn. Leveling-up allows the player to sink points into the player's base-stats for numbers how they see fit, unlike some other major ARPG (Diablo III) - allowing the player's builds even within the same class to possibly be different from another player's build. While the story + characters are nothing truly special here - like in many of these ARPG's - it's still certainly better than the previous game. The graphics are nothing truly remarkable in terms of technical quality, but the art direction is fantastic, quirky, and colorful. TL2 sports SIngle Player support (for online play or offline play); Online support for Co-Op via Runic's servers; and also LAN support - unlike another ARPG that has currently forced ""online always"" gameplay (Diablo III). If a gamer is looking for numerous different ways to play this game - it's certainly here. Once finished with the Campaign, fans can come back and explore some other Randomized Dungeons and even enter New Game Plus Mode. Given that, and that this game offers a lot of value for those not just who do one playthrough (took me around 27 hours, all by myself - SIngle Player style) - but also to those who want to replay the game. When it debuted at its budget-price ($20), it offers plenty of value and ""bang for the buck"" when compared to its competitors that were charging $50-60. Even now, when it's on sale dirt-cheap - it's pretty much a steal. And this all, this isn't even counting that the game also does have Mods out there, which further can extend the life of the game - since this game comes with The Game's Editor (GUTS) and also supports The Steam Workshop.If you love ARPG's, this one's pretty much a no-brainer: Torchlight II is an excellent ARPG that just cannot be recommended enough. Simply put: it's one of the best of these loot-crazy, action-packed ARPG's around.Final Grade = A.			"

												This one was hard for me to decide on.  Diablo II was one of my all-time favorite and most played games.  Torchlight was good, scratched the itch, but didn't really 'hold' me.  I had a lot of hope for Torchlight II, but like TL1, it just sort of felt.. empty.What works: The atmosphere is pretty good, I like how the monsters 'exist' before you wake them up in various sets of realistic repose.  Very nice touch.  The game is colorful and generally graphically engaging, although I don't really like any of the character designs.  It /is/ a Diablo clone, so it has that addictive loot-gathering gameplay, but I can't really evaluate it, because I didn't stick with it long enough for that to become relevant.What doesn't work:The skill trees feel bland, with a limited number of 'correct' choices.  The class-specific charge bars are terrible - either really boring (wizard and archer) or uninteractively 'see-sawing' power spikes (berserker).  The engineer is the only one that feels like it 'works'.Melee still feels kind of like a bad choice, with the amount of damage enemies deal at closer range.  As a ranged fighter, much of the combat takes place off-screen, which is terrible game design (albeit, extremely common in the genre).Having some skills be dropped or bought (for example, most of the summon spells) makes building characters even /more/ dependent on drop luck than is the norm.  It also breaks down some class variety.Most significantly, the game just felt off, for reasons I struggle to describe.  I never felt fully engaged.  I put a fair amount of effort in, pushing multiple characters through act 1, but every time, I found myself fighting boredom by the halfway point, and had totally lost interest by the time I stumbled blearily into the desert.  (Act II is a desert?  How novel!)I kind of regret voting 'no' on this one, because it's plainly a labor of love, because I had high hopes for it, and because I still desperately want to like it, but it is what it is.

												Current NG+13 Elite Lvl.500 Berserker's save file has been corrupted. Over 600 hours played with the class over the span of 2 years.(NOTE: I have played 550hrs up to this point with my one and only berserker, NG+8 Elite w/ SynergiesMOD, maxed to lvl.500, all skills unlocked, fully socketted legendary weapons and armor (cast swords) <- The fact that I've spent all of my time with one character 1 class out of 70-80 I have from mods is telling. This should also emphasize how much I've played this game and my experience playing it.)(This is my first actual review, I thought I would give this masterpiece the honors.)Intro: To start I would like to say that I will have bias towards the game even if I try to be as objective as possible. Given my playtime and connection to this game, this should be a given. I found out about this game from a friend of mine who told me they loved the first game but never played the second, I found out about it and decided I would buy it on sale for I think around 10 dollars around the time (forgive me if this is wrong my memory may be wrong). My past arpg's had been only Diablo 1 & 3 and Sacred 2 at the time so I was excited to hop into another being a newfound fan of the genre. It all started when I clicked that ""New Game"" button. Clicked the berserker and typed ""Shaddah"".Now to the actual review!I'll make each of these sections quick for your reading pleasure.Gameplay: (Almost Perfect)Everything in this game plays extremely smoothy, response times are instant and combat is quick, flashy, and most importantly fluid.Except for the occasional bugs like when i try to shift-click or right-click an item to transfer or equip and the ocacsional hiccup everything else is like it says up there in the parenthesis, almost perfect.Randomization is extensive in this game, loot enemies, levels, basically almost everything in this game is randomly generated, except for things like your chosen character and pet.Recommened Mods for ridiculous amounts of content:Adventure Pack II (and levelscale:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WITH LEVEL500 MOD)SynergiesMODHaknslash Essentialsclasspackand level500mod (KEEP IN MIND THIS WILL BREAK AND/OR RENDER SOME GAME MECHANICS USELESS Examples:Making Builds, Some Synergies Content)Graphics: (Perfect)They are cartoony, doesn't go for realism and fulfills it's purpose.Graphics mods I would recommendInk'd & Ink'd for SynergiesThe Half-Life 2 ENB Enchancer (ran through Torchlight II Directory)Sound: (Perfect, phenominal with mods)Music fits it's purpose with general orchestral pieces (my favorite being the menu theme) and nice songs that fit the mood, theme and atmosphere of every location.Phenominal music mods:Diablo II music modFinal Fantasy music mod (includes track from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross)Overall: (Amazing game)Overall this game is a phenomincal package for it's extremely low price and even better it you happen to catch it on sale, the community is friendly and the modding scene from what I've seen, seems to be strong and thriving (mainly being represented with Synergies). The game is, in my opinion, the BEST arpg out there hands down and offers the MOST content out of any arpg I've seen here on steam or played in my entire history with the genre. Sadly there comes a time where I must mention the cons, because even with my deep love for this game I must point out the quirks and cons.Quirks and Cons: (ehh?)No OpenGL support? - whenever I've tried this by enabling it through .config the game crashes on start.Shift-tab and Right-click sometimes don't work.With a freely moving camera the detail on the levels is only viewable from the fixed and defualt isometric perspective.Some achievements require online play (just a really tiny quirk for me)Mapworks accesibility and variety is, at times lacking, I found it more worth my time to beat the game again, given the more intresting randomly generated enviroments.All in all the game is phenominal, the DEFINITIVE arpg, If you love arpgs or are intrested in the genre, or even just want a relaxing game to kill time in, this is a MUST BUY!To end this I would like to thank all the developers and modders that made my experience possible, Runic Games, Salan and all the other mod authors and players out there! Seeya and happy looting!Do I recommend this game, yes... hell yes!			"

												Everyone, hail the new Diablo 2!!Tochlight 2 is the sequel to (You guessed it), Torchlight. It takes everything the first game did wrong (Or not quite good), starting for the lack of Multiplayer, and fixes it, improves it, and makes it right. For torchlight 2 the developers did really listen to the communitty and did their homework: Gameplay, mechanics, upgrades... everything is fixed, polished and balanced. The multiplayer, although with some connection problems here and there, tends to work great and is really well implemented into the game (both loot wise, as each player gets its own loot so no more fighting over the coins and mod wise, as you can easily connect with other players who has the same mods) and, as expected, not only really fun to play, but the main reason to get the game.  But, this is it. It's a polished but already known formula. If you are a veteran in this kind of games, you will feel at home in the world of Torchlight 2, but maybe you will feel it is ""too home"": There's nothing you have already seen in other diablo like game, nothing original in its approach, even each of the acts style is similar to the Diablo 2 acts (desert-jungle-hell/volcano anyone?): It's a genuine jewel, but a jewel we all have seen in a lot of places before.A huge extra point is the communitty behind this game. Mods like synergies have added TONS of new places to kill monsters, TONS of new monsters to be killed, TONS of new weapons to kill with and TONS of armor to avoid getting killed. Although the vanilla game is short in its main campaing (remember: the fun is in the second time you finish the game), with the mod support the Torchlight world expands beyond any other Diablo like game.Torchlight 2 is a great game many of us have already played. If you are looking for the next step in the Diablo formula, you are not looking in the right place (maybe the workshop has some hints already), but if you are looking for a step in an already stablished place, a consistent, fun and balanced Diablo clone, Torchlight is the best option you have right now.

												Man I feel like such an idiot. When I first saw this game on steam a long time ago I said to myself. ""It seems to be a crappy eagle vision version of Dota 2"" No offense to any Dota 2 fans...   I ended ignoring Torchlight 2's existence for about a year.About a week ago I saw this game on sale and I bought it well because it was on sale xDMan, I feel so STUPID as to dislike this game on its appearance.Pros:- Amazing loot selection. Your not just selling every single item that doesn't appeal to you.- Freedom of weapon customizations. Maybe you want to have your Berserker use dual pistols or whatever you feel like using.- Interesting bosses. Your not just fighting a giant blob...- Most of the time, you use your mouse to move and attack so you rarely need to use your keyboard, which is great for those who want to multitask...no not in that way...-Beautiful settings. (Realistic forests, dungeons, etc). - The game runs very well with all settings turned the highest. Unless you have a windows 98 or something which can't run this game xD (OBVIOUSLY)- Max level is 100 so you can show off and get a bunch of characters to lv 100 if you wish.Cons:- Sometimes the quest marker really pisses me off. Sometimes the quest marker will direct me to a dungeon that I have already explored. I end up going inside, the quest marker tells me to go back out. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥?!?!? Though this rarely happens, but when it does, it is on a side quest mission. This was for me though, I have no idea if the game will be like that for you guys.Overall I rate this game 9/10                                                             SUGOI!! "

												Many people compare this game with Diablo III, but in my opinion, this game takes the cake.With an outstanding amount of loot you can find, numerous of Boss battles, hours of gameplay with your buddies, and what's best is YOU GET TO DECIDE WHAT YOU WANT.Not only the game is affordable, YOU DON'T NEED TO PAY FOR A SINGLE DAMN THING IN THE GAME. (Well, excluding the items you buy with gold. P/S: Stop it trolls.)Now it may seem farfetched, I would probably have more people telling me that ""DIABLO III IS BEST BLA BLA BLA"" than playing this game.Well, I can tell you for a fact that they're certainly wrong.

												Deciding to re-review this game now that I'm abit older and the game's been out for quite awhile. Torchlight II is the definite successor to the original game which played a lot more like a hidden continuation of Fate in some sense. This game isn't very much different in terms of gameplay, so if you didn't quite like how the original played out...you might not enjoy this one to much. Thankfully however, this game now comes with its own Workshop which is still very active to this day. With the community coming up with more and more ways to expand and improve upon this already fairly massive game, there's nearly endless mounds of playtime. To prove this, I have nearly two hundred hours dumped into this game. I regret no wasted moment of my life, but on to the actual review. Gameplay - Like I said before, the gameplay isn't very new. It's a slightly improved version of the originals Diablo/Fate style of hack and slash where you click on opponents to engage in a fight with them while constantly spamming skills with the use of your hotkey bar above your exp gauge and clicking on the ground to move from space to space. You'll be finding tons of loot throughout each area as well as mounds upon mounds of monsters to fight depending on the difficulty. Occasionally you'll get a critical hit on an enemy and make chunks of his body explode over the ground in a bloody mess that's often just so satisfying to see. Then again, I'm just a sadistic ♥♥♥♥ with a bloodlust so don't listen to me. The pet system in this game is much the same as well. You have an interesting variety of choices at first that can expand massively with the use of mods from the workshop. Really, the thing is ♥♥♥♥ing glorious! Back to the topic however, your pets will aid you in battle. Rushing in and clawing, stomping, or ramming your enemies in your defense or sometimes just because they can depending on what you set them to, which brings me to the options below there health bar. You can set your little companions two one of three options. Defensive, Passive, Aggressive. This is useful for coordinating different plans for various areas especially if you carry around a decent amount of a transformation fish you may find yourself stocking up on by grinding in the multiple fishing holes you'll find throughout the game. I don't know how many times I entered a dungeon and found maybe just five to many enemies for my little self to handle around a corner, so I fed a fish to my dog and made him grow into a snarling, badass dragon before setting him to aggressive and watching as he bathed in the organs of the undead!Sound: I'm not sure where to begin with this game as far as the audio goes. Sometimes the constant noises along with the animations of each attack can get repetitive to listen to and look at for so long. Despite this however, the game has an amazing and beautiful atmospheric soundtrack that blends in perfectly with the scenery and graphics. Enemies sound like there own, and never once did I get annoyed with anything other then the attacks I stated earlier. Graphics: I'm honestly not sure how to describe these. It's like Dota meets Wakfu. The art looks wonderful and detailed, the animations polished and smooth. The weapons can sometimes lose there charm in appearance due from more then a few looking the exact same, but there's always enchantments for that and its hardly an issue when considering everything else around you. Enemies have there own personalities and feel to them as well as movements occasionally. Aside from a few flaws, the graphics are perfect!Overall: Torchlight II is a very fun ever-changing experience that fans of Diablo, Fate, or even Van Hellsing should be able to get into rather easily. With the shear amount of loot, action, management, and planning you'll be doing; its impossible not to sink more then ten or multitudes of more hours into this title before putting it down and eventually starting it up right back again. It's timeless, get while you can. 9/10  "

Perfect just to sit down, connect to a friends server and click till your fingers will burn.Starting at the moment my third character (engi, bersi done) and I still don't get the point what happens in the story, but I seriously don't care.

												Very much like Diablo 2, but less dark in both its themes and graphics.There is more humor here and it is cartoony enough that it is appropriate for younger children than Diablo ever was.Fairly easy learning curve with a few crafting nuances to pick up along the way.Overall, it is a good game that is a certain BUY for under 10 dollars if you like AARPGs that can be a little more casual.

												I love Torchlight and Torchlight II. Having said that I have to admit I loved Diablo III as well. The mobs are easier in Torchlight. The characters and classes including the add on ones make for a great game. I am hopeful they bring out a Torchlght III that improves on the gameplay further, not that there is much for which to ask. I kept going back to Torchlight until I got Torchlight II and now, despite over a hundred games, Torchlight II pulls me back in. It plays like a dream on my 2011 MBPro, which cannot be said of similar aged games.Thank you for making such a great one Runic Games. Thanks also to the people involved in adding classes/characters so the original game could be so much more.			"

												One of the best ARPGS games made by the original creators of Diablo II. While the lore and story are nowhere near as engrossing as Diablo, the world is varied and complex. The game oozes originality, creativity and tender loving care. The classes are completely different from each other and each have their own playstyle. The sounds effects and the impacts of each hit is wonderfully rendered, the skill system rewards you for truly dedicating yourself to one playstyle instead of a jack of all trades approach. The loot is plentiful and creative with very interesting procs and combos built within the gear itself.Difficulty is built on a basis for veterans of ARPG series with stats distribution, skills points, enemies with stuns, aoes, resistances to elements, and procs off of melee attacks. A wonderful game that is always great to come back to. My favourite game of all time by far.			"

												I am a huge Diablo fan and I've never played this game. I've always rejected it as a cheap diablo clone.I picked it up because it was on sale for like nothing. I had it over a year and never played it. But once Diablo 3 turned out to be a huge disappointment, I gave this game a try. And oh boy is it awesome.It surpassed my expectation by far! I couldn't stop playing it.It does almost everything better than Diablo 3.The game just plays and feels great.I really love the free skilltree and character development, you can do whatever you want.You can choose every difficulty right from the start.The Elite difficulty offers a great challenge, right  from level 1 and it wont get easy until very very late into the game.The game world itself is huge and feels alive.The towns are full of merchants, gambler, enchanters and other NPCS.The over world and dungeons are filled with hordes of monsters and many bosses that offer a great challenge.The Mapworks offer a unlimited amount of random generated dungeons. Which is just awesome.And the best thing. The loot system. Every player gets his OWN loot. There are hundreds of items with 5 quality tiersAnd set items.Enough with the good stuff, the game lacks story. If you don't watch out you miss the story. And the story is also pretty short you can get through the game in 20h or even less. But it has a New Game+ feature so its no that bad.The multiplayer loading time can  get really really REALLY long. I don't know why but sometimes it takes like 5~10 minutes! to move from  map A to B.The game saves on your local hard drive so you run  into a lot of cheater when playing multiplayer.Only 4 character classes. That's always a letdown for me but...Thanks to the Steam Workshop and the great community we have access to so many mods that we are able to change every part of the game to our own liking. Every point I've listed can be changed. I've ended up with over 30 character classes and thousands of new items, new dungeons, bosses...everything Is possible. Most mods do work in multiplayer. New mods are coming out almost everyday and you even get the developer kit to create your own mods.At this point, i want to point out one specific mod, Synergies.Synergies is the best Mod  for TL2. Its an overhaul mod that changes almsot everything. Salan, the mods creator put alot of work into this awesome mod.Make sure to visit us at: http://forums.synergiesmod.com/index.phpI recommend this game to everyone that like RPG, mod and co-op/multiplayer games.End.

												Torchlight II is a quite enjoyable ARPG dungeon-crawler with a huge amount of loot, fun, and exploration to be had! I've enjoyed this game since 2013, and I still play it with friends.Torchlight II has some very enjoyable gameplay, and its visuals are pretty cool and its soundtrack is good too, and they both compliment the game and give it its cool style. The environments in the game are pretty cool, and sometimes quite varied, and there's many places to explore and quite a few side quests to participate in, too. Its combat is also incredibly satisfying. Throughout the game, there is a huge variation of armor, weapons, and enchantments that you will find, and you can also transmute items and enchant things at an enchanter. You can also find ""ember"" to socket items with that will give you a boost in elemental strength, from defense to attacking with that element.There are four classes in the game: The Embermage, the Berserker, the Engineer, and the Outlander. Each class has different skills and weapon specializations, although you can use any kind of weapon that you want, no matter what class you play as. You can also customize the characters a bit and choose a pet, although the default options aren't very extensive.Torchlight II is also a mod-friendly game, and it has plenty of cool mods that can change the gameplay, add areas, give more customization options, and add convenience features.Overall, I have no complaints about Torchlight II. The story isn't very fleshed-out, but I find that it's still sufficient for the game nonetheless, and its gameplay is very satisfying and quite fun! I would definitely recommend Torchlight II to anybody who enjoys ARPGS, Co-op games, and loot games. ^.^			"

												Torchlight II is a dungeon crawler RPG, created by an indie developer Runic Games. In this review, I decided not to talk about the story of the game because I was not paying attention to the story (pretty much killing mobs to obtain legendary loot or leveling up) and it is really difficult to remember what happened so let's get on the review. The game's theme is robotic, magic wizardry and witchcraft. Once the player progresses the story (Acts) of the game, it will take you to different lands and it's completely random generated dungeons as well. There are 4 classes to choose from; Engineer, Outlander, Berserker and Embermage. The game's mechanic is obviously similar to Diablo's gameplay. The loot system, weapon add-ons, pet system are great. You can do the item micromanagement without going home by sending your pet to the home portal and sell the inventories you have been hoarding for you, so you can keep grinding on the fly. The skill system on each classes have unique skill trees. Including Active and Passive Skills. They have 7 Active skills each trees and 3 Passive skills (About 21 Active skills including Ultimate and 9 Passive skills). It's very accessible skill trees, you can build whatever you like. There is an end game content, like purchasing any random generated scroll map to level up and your fame level (to earn fame level, you kill any legendary monsters to earn EXP or XP and gain skill points.) You can do another play through or New Game Plus which is great additional, whatever floats your boat.+ Pros+ 4 classes with different skill trees+ Replayability+ Randomly Generated dungeons+ Multiplayer with friends (even though there aren't plenty servers)+ Gameplay mechanics+ Mods are available to implement your game experience via Steam Workshop and Level Editor to create a map- Cons- The story is lacking and no one cares about the story since it's dungeon crawler genre.- Servers are lacking due to the population of the game.For the final review of the game, the gameplay mechanics are strongly familiar to Diablo III. The classes are great but I wish they have sub-classes. The content is limitless because of the mods, RNG dungeons on end game content. But no one cares about the storyline of the game and I found it shallow and snooze fest. The looting system of the game and all RPG aspects that make me want to grind more. The final score for this game is an 8 out of 10, a strong recommendation. I would recommend you Grim Dawn or Path of Exile (Free to Play game) if not.			"

												I recomment this game ALL the way, very cool hack-and-slash and can easily run on crappy PC's or Laptops!Here are some Pro's and Con's about the game that I found.Pro's-Diablo-like style-Hack-and-slash, very cool mechanic that keeps you enticed and excited to play-BIG variety of items-Pretty good and well written plot-Lot's to do such as fishing and more-Good amount of quests-Single player (YES! I love this feature! If I don't have internet, it doesn't matter, I can still enjoy the game and level up my character)-Multiplayer (The multiplayer is GREAT with friends, or even by yourself, very cool)-Different map designs-Pets (You actually bond with your pet on a personal, real life experience, I know that's weird, but its kinda cool)Con's-There isn't really any con's in this game, all I can really think of is that after a while, it gets a little repetetive, but not very.

												I really enjoyed this game. Playing solo or with a friend - it can prove to be challenging. Graphics are pretty, story line is interesting and the gear skins are nice. My only gripe is with the lack of inventory space. Granted, once you  get your gear and all gemmed up there isn't much of a reason to keep new items, but I like to save things for the hell of doing so. One of the best features is allowing your pet to go sell your drops while you remain in the dungeon.  After beating the game, buying maps to replay for a quick or more difficult run keeps you coming back for more. I played most of my time multiplayer but still a fair amount of solo play.			"

												While quite enjoyable in the short term, the game is more repetitive than others in this genre. It relies on visual razzle-dazzle more than evolving mechanics, and after a couple of hours classes don't offer new mechanics or interesting hooks.			"

												Torchlight II is one of those timeless games which you can play even in 10 years and feel enjoyment every time. After Diablo II, it was very hard to find some game that can keep me interested for a long time play. And there comes Torchlight II with the same old style like real RPG should look. With graphical point, the game is more with cartoon style and wild west elements, but nothing overwhelming. The dungeons and monsters goes as hard as the character is strong so gameplay can sometimes be challenging which is actually good because it's very well balanced.			"

												First off I would like to start with then fact that people saying this is a ""clone"" of diablo. Well, every single top-down dungeon crawler, can be called a ""clone"" of diablo so be quiet haters. However if you are debating over getting diablo 3 or this game, this game is the way to go, because 1:it's cheaper. 2:Diablo 3 is not even that good without reaper of souls. Thus this game is a better deal for cash reasons, and the mods are amazing for it, so if you still prefer diablo over this game you could at least mod this game so much that you can at least make it enjoyable. If you wanted to get diablo 2 over this game, then yes get it, it's like 6 bucks on amazon and like $4 shipping that's why it is like $6. Now that I have that cleared up I will actually talk about this game. This game is made by the people who made Fate, my first dungeon crawler I ever played, and that game is quite good as well. I suggest it, but not over this game. This game is so enjoyable, especially with the synergies mod, if you like vanilla of this game then you will love the synergies mod it makes the game easilly twice as better. Now this game follows the classic dungeon crawler basics get loot, and kill stuff, but also instead of just leveling up a few skills that the game already has for you to level up, instead it has skilltrees so it has major replayablity and also it has many different weapons for you to use and there is 4 classes with 3 skill trees on each so that could easily be 12+ playthroughs. But i can tell you with my mods i have i have like another 6 classes easily all well made. Another thing that is great about this game, is that the pet mechanic works brilliantly, inventory full, I think not send your crap you don't want and put it in your pets inventory, pets inventory full? Send it to town to sell that crap you don't want, so you can stay killing stuff and looting stuff. I highly recommend this game one of my favourites of all time. 9.5/10 this game is waaaaay to underrated it must be more popular. Also I have an idea if this game evr gets a torchlight 3, if they can try this, maybe make it like a dungeon crawler but heres the catch mix those mechanics and make it like an open world sandbox, such as skyrim or fallout. That is all, once again 9.5/10 I hop this game gets a triquel.			"

												Torchlight II, another fun and entertaining ARPG. I've had the joy of experiencing multiple ARPG games, but something about Torchlight II really kept my attention. Not only does it offer a continuing story from its first installment, you get to choose from four new classes. My first run through I started with the Engineer, because in all honesty having a healing bot and many other bots to assist you creates an easier education of the game. Later on I did check out the other classes and eventually followed a guide from a fellow gamer for the Outlander truly finalized the experience I was hoping for.Pros:- Choose who you want and build them how you want. (True there are main recommended builds for each class, but it is much more rewarding when you experiment yourself.- Plenty of loot to get you excited.- Champion mobs or bosses, not sure what they classify them as; some pack a punch to test your survivalbility.- End game runs to complete your build with loot.- Having a pet you can send out at any time to sell your items is the best ARPG aspect ever!- The story is fun to follow- Mods!- Fishing- Not just your character, but your pet can also learn scroll skills too!Cons:- Only four classes. Not truly a big deal, however, sometimes it is nice having slightly more variety from the creators.- You can only respec the last three skill points you've spent. This feature alone bugs me, because it limits the idea of altering a build or changing up a character's build without having to start over.- Maps don't reset. I do recall someone writing up a guide on how to reset maps, but this feature alone should have just been implemented.- Cookie-cutter class specs. This, sadly, will always be an issue in any game that offers customization on character growth.As usual in any review I write, this is all based on my experience and opinion. The game is still really fun and with a modding community it does have a long life. I do wish to see, some day, Torchlight III hit development and introduce even better features to a promising campaign. This game does have my recommendation!			"

Tons of different monsters, cool levels, big dungeons and of course items with plenty of room for enchantments and embers to further customize your equipment.

												A huge upgrade from the first Torchlight, and that's a fact. Not only are there plenty more weapons, accessories, and armor combinations to choose from, but a more immersive environment with a decent story behind it. The cutscenes are very simple, yet still makes you want to play on for another few hours. It's also considerably longer than the first one.One thing I have enjoyed the most would have to be the large amount of skills provided in the game, and the ability to upgrade them to different tiers, making them even more powerful. That is certainly one of the best parts of the game to me. I'm constantly working to level up so I can get a new skill or get to the next tier because it sounds so awesome to be able to ""slash your way through your foes, leaving them stunned in your wake"" or to ""stomp the ground causing ice shards to come out in four different directions, producing massive damage"". That's not word for word from the game, but you get my point.Another thing I really love is the fact that during multiplayer, everyone gets their own loot so you aren't fighting for who gets what items and gold. That, to me, improves multiplayer 100%. Even still, while playing with friends, the difficulty increases so it's not a walk in the park. I like a bit of a challenge, so it's fun when you and someone else have some sort of epic boss fight and get your own epic loot from it.I highly recommend you try this if you have played the first Torchlight. Even if you haven't, it's not like the entire story will be confusing, almost forcing you to play the first one.It's that good.			"

												Torchlight 2 is a hack n slash game made by the original creators of diablo II.The story is about a dark alchemist threatening the balance of the world by opening the nether portals for a cure of some sort.There's a total of 4 classes, engineer, embermage, berserker and outlander, and you can add more with workshop mods, i'd recommend sinergy one but after you beat the main game due to the increased difficulty.Once you create a character and select a faithful pet, you can even get the headcrab from half life 2 if you're into that O.o, you get prompt with a difficulty setting, nice mechanic, all the way from easy to elite and obviously the famous hardcore mechanic one death equals losing that character forever.Each class got a nice set of skill trees and those skins are fun from level 1, unlike games like titanquest or diablo where the cooler spells require tons of hours in the game, plus you can learn additonal 4 spells for you and your pet, summoning creatures, haste, and more.Your pet similar to the game Fate, can pick up items or take the items from your inventory to go to the town and sell it while you keep killing hordes of enemies, can also buy portals and potions if needed, there's also fishing spots you can catch unique fishes to transform your pet into monsters in order to make it more efficient in combat for the duration of the fish.Game is a must have for hack n slash fans, and even if you're not one but enjoyed diablo II you should get it, even at full price is still a great deal.

												Torchlight II is almost everything I want from a loot driven RPG. It's a fast-paced game with a good loot drop variety and frequency. Its co-op supports a party with up to 8 members (with an official mod). By the way, it's also very moddable and it has a lot of cool options that range from slightly modify the game to complete rebalance. The classes are all different from the original and there's a lot of different ways to build everyone. It can have some problems when it comes to syncing with other players but that seems to have improved a lot in the last months. It's better with friends and there's even a LAN mode but it still has an active community if you're interested in playing online.			"

												Kept me up all night, I'd give it a solid honey badger / 10.Believe me, I really, truly wanted to leave it at that.But after ages of telling myself, ""I need to try it out,"" I finally purchased Torchlight II last night. And I was blown away.Is it like Diablo? Kinda, yeah. But it's a lot... comfier, for lack of a better term. You can customize your character a bit and you get to start with a pet that isn't just cosmetic. Character building, as I understand, is really flexible. I mean, I wanted a battle-mage and I made one. Not fully optimized, mind you, but it's working so far. For the first time in a long while, I've found a game that's made me want to start a save after save, just to see what kinda stuff I can come up with - at only six hours in. The soundtrack hasn't gotten on my nerves yet, which is saying something. The graphics surprised me, positively; for some reason I was expecting it to look like WarCraft 3 zoomed in. The gameplay's familiar if you've ever touched Diablo, but the game adds its own little things to the mix (inventory cleaning service says hi). I'm sure everything that had to be said already has, so I'll just add one more thing.Best 3,79 euros I ever spent.			"

												A very good Diablo II-esque hack'n'slash.Graphics are nice, if fairly basic by today's standards. The art style is hit or miss, it's very colourful and almost cartoonish across the board, giving the game a distinctive vibe. I like it.Audio design is mostly fine, some voice acting is borderline garbage, the soundtrack is really nice though.The story is as basic and unengaging as it gets, and the fact that you only get walls of text with no voice acting for sidequests doesn't help either, but you know what? I don't care. I play games like this for the beatdowns, not storytelling.The gameplay is exactly what you'd expect from an ARPG - kill things, get loot and experience, optimise your loadout and build, rinse and repeat. And it does all of this pretty well.- What I like about this game as opposed to Torchlight 1 is that it incorporates large open areas so you're not just dungeon crawling all the time (in fact you're likely to spend MOST of the time in overworld areas if you want to explore them completely). The environments are largely varied and nice to look at.- Four character classes focusing on melee, heavy weapons, ranged weapons and magic. You can use most weapons with any class (and some crossover builds may be viable) but it's obviously most efficient to use the ones you have bonuses for.- Lots and lots of loot to go through, with numerous things to take into consideration, like ""is 20 more armour worth giving up my +10% crit damage bonus?"", you'll probably need to do some serious math if you want to get the absolute most out of your gear.- A wide range of active and passive skills that are only limited by level - no skill requires you to unlock a different one first (although there are cases where getting one skill is pointless without having another). A considerable downside is that there's no full respec option in the vanilla game so if you pick a subpar skill and don't realise until later on, you're stuck with a broken build.- Like in TL1, you have a pet who helps you in combat and you can send it to town to sell items and (unlike in TL1) even buy some consumables (e.g. potions or identify scrolls), saving you a lot of warping back to town.- Four difficulty levels (plus hardcore mode where dying means game over) allow casual players and masochists alike to have some fun.- New Game Plus (being able to play through the game again at higher level with the same character) and The Mapworks (where you pay to enter randomly generated dungeons with modifiers that may noticably alter gameplay) make sure there's always something you can do with your character.I picked this game up when I was feeling nostalgic for the old Diablo games and it more than delivered on what I expected from it. An absolute must-play if you're into ARPGs and worth checking out even if you're not.(special thanks to steam support for making this review postable)			"

												Forged by the former Blizzard developers who brought you Diablo games (none of the former Blizzard North employees worked on Diablo 3, btw) it's hard to not compare the two, especially when you hear that nice and atmospheric soundtrack from Matt Uelmen (who, of course, wrote the soundtracks for the first 2 Diablo games) which will certainly bring back some memories of Sanctuary. Since they are just an indie dev studio now, without WoW-milking Blizzard budget, there's no more shiny things like super-duper CGI cutscenes, but that doesn't take away from its charm.Besides those mentioned reasons there are some others with Diablo vibe. Former hero who got corrupted, and now poses a threat to the world, while he is traveling across the wooden-snowy/dusty desert/jungly regions (sounds familiar, doesn't it?) in an attempt to free an ancient evil. Of course, you are always behind him, while you are trying to fix things which he messed up, until the final showdown at the end.Each region has a town which serves as your safe heaven/hub area. There you can trade, use enchanters to boost your equipment, certain specialist who can recover your gems by destroying the equpment or vice versa - destroying gems and freeing the slot to insert better gems to give better stats to your equpment. And there you will get majority of your story related quests. In the town, and in the areas around it, there are folks who can give you bunch of optional quests. You can ignore them completely if you want, but without the experience from their quests it will just be harder for you the further you travel into the game.You can chose between four classes: Embermage, Engineer, Outlander, and Berserker. Personally, I've found Engineer to be the most versatile, as through investements in his skill tree you can turn it easily into close combat fighting machine or into ranged fighter. Sure, you can do with other classes whatever you want, but Berserker is obviously close combat class, which you can't say for Outlander.You can also chose a pet, including iconic Half-Life headcrab. Your pet is your shadow, it fights beside you, and also serves as a secondary inventory. You can send it into town to sell whatever you don't need, and also to get the potions/scrolls from your shop list, and in this way you don't have to bother using town portal scrolls or to travel back to do it yourself. Pet can be fed with various kinds of fishes (yes, you can also fish in this game), temporary transforming it into different kind of a beast. And, just as yourself, it can learn spells, making it even more usefull in combat.There's multiplayer co-op, which requires creating 3rd party Runic account.  Group can contain up to 6 players, although I've never played in a group this large, but more players will certainly help in the hardest modes, especially when you create an hardcore character who's death is permanent (at least pet's death isn't permanent, even in this mode). Speaking of which, you can also share your equipement between your own characters over shared stash in towns, but you can't share between hardcore - non-hardcore characters. As gold and loot flies everywhere just grab anything without any pardon, since every player sees his own loot. Then you can trade with each other, which is usefull for getting rid of certain class exclusive pieces which your current class may not use (unless you are planning to share it with yourself for another character of yours, over previously mentioned shared stash option).Once you complete the game, you can start the New Game + mode, and continue developing your character. By finishing the game you are also unlocking Mapworks area (also available in NG+), where you can buy dungeon maps with various buffs or nerfs for either yourself or your enemies, and spend the time killing and looting in them to your liking.If I have to nitpick about something... Those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4 broken achievements! UARGH, this achievement-hunting junky rash in my hand... Its really lame when you've spent so much time completing everything, including some annoying grindy achivements, and devs are still saying it will be dealth with, even after an year since they originally promissed it will be solved... As you can see, the support of this game is dead, as they are just a small studio which moved all of its manpower to the next big thing. But there's Steam Workshop support, and no lack of quality mods for this game. EDIT: After several years of whining at Runic Steam forums those broken achieves have been finally removed. It was totally worth it...But if you don't care for such things, the game itself is worth the cost (even with some free quality titles such as Path of Exile, but T2 doesn't have microtransactions like PoE has), especially on the sale, as you can easily squizee at least 20-30 hours of fun from it. Friend of mine who said he got sick of the game has over 20 hours.			"

												Torchlight 2 is it worth it ? Torchlight 2 is a sequel to original torchlight top down dungeon clawler that has you playing as 3 classes in original game, and four classes in sequel, how does this one compare to original ? quite well.  Gameplay = Second game gives us Coop mode, which was a must, in a first game, but devs didn`t think probably, and we had that since diablo 2, New Game Plus was introduced, which makes alot easier once you have your character on a cap :) to start NG+ game tells you to have level 51, i didn`t find that all that neccesary as embermage, could take down level 60 mobs, in 4 hits. Story, Characters = Torchlight 2 story continues from where torchlight 1 ends, after you kill ordrak with alchemist class, you become insane, and after that torchlight 2 starts, and alchemist starts searching for cure to cure ""ember blight"" sickness which was a problem in a first game, alchemist sets out in search for guardians, and power ordraks heart once more, and you have to stop him.as for characters i don`t have much to say : i liked once person in act 2 which rhymes and gives quests he was the most memorable of a bunch.Boss Fights - you have three kinds of bosses, Champions, Side Bosses, Main bosses, Champions you encounter through out the game, and those guys hit like truck, if not underrestimated. Side bosses, and Main bosses, can be found, and usually you`ll get achievments for killing them, which makes doing all quests worth it. Favorite fights have to be ending of an act fights : those being Regent Fight, Guardian fight (Mana/Siege guardian) and Alchemist. Final boss could have been alchemist, because netherlord is a pushover. i killed him being level 48 and with full unique gear. so wtfP.s Mods for this game are insane #PlaySynergiesoverall : if you want a game to runthrough endless amount of times, to get 100 hours in, and do all classes, this is the game. Get it on sale, or if you can find it for a cheap price :)			"

												One of the best Loot-based RPG that I've ever played. You can play as one of the four classes that have their own unique skill-tree and play-style. They are:> Outlanders, who are good at long range weapons and poison-based magic. Skill Trees: Warfare, Lore, Sigil.> Berserkers, who are goot at close range weapons, quick attack and animal-based special powers. Skill Trees: Hunter, Tundra, Shadow> Embermage, who are goot at high level elemental magic attacks. Skill Trees: Inferno, Frost, Storm> Engineer, who are good at heavy melee wapons and steam-puck technologies such as robots and stuff. Skill Trees: Blitz, Construction, Aegis.Pros:+ Good story.+ Great gameplay. + Great pseudo-randomly generated world. Each map is generated so that you will feel certain differences in each of your visits.+ Great loots. There are so many great Items that you wont be able to carry and save with your very limited Inventory slot.+ Good and gorgeous graphics+ Great arrays of side missions, which will keep you busy for hours and hours and gameplay and loots.Cons:- Inventory slots are too limited, wont hurt to add more :DOverall: 90/100 "

												I purchased Torchlight 2 on a hunch because I never played the first game and I was in need of a Diablo 2 clone type game to fill the void and after playing the game for about 2-3 hours I was very much enjoying it, the character customization though not brilliant (Diablo 2's is for depth but customization it isn't) is good. The pet sidekick is a welcome feature that I actually love a lot a feature that would have been great in D2 but granted this is probably TL2's unique feature as remember I never played the first game. I love the idea you can give them items and when your full send over the useless stuff and then send them to town to sell the stuff is fantastic, bear in mind when you do your without your attacking pet for a limited amount of time but using it wisely you'll have no problems. I love the skills system and the levelling up system is pretty much the same as Diablo 2 so that's a good thing because sometimes games can have a cheap feel or a complex feel, but you can respec your skills points as much as you like providing you have enough gold to pay for it this is one feature D2 only got very late in it's patch history and only then can it be used once.The story is good and the world is vibrant and colourful with plenty of variety in enemies I have yet to play a co-op game or online but I probably can say it's like any other RPG game that has it again D2, Titan Quest etc, for me this purchase was one of the best purchases in the last few years when it comes to finding a fresh RPG for myself I would recommend it especially if you see it on sale because it's steal at any price.

You are now still stuck with Multiplayer problems, you can't see your friends online or join them unless you logged in on the same server. So after 5-10 times of relogging in you should be able to play with your friends. Also there are 4 broken Achievements, who where promised to get removed after Summer Sale 2013, sadly that didnt happen. It's been a long time since I saw a developer saying something in the steam forums. You are better off if you play this game alone in my opinion.Edit: Unachievable Achievements were fixed early 2015.			"

This is a great top-down action RPG game, even coming from me, someone who really doesn't like top-down games. Action is fun and smooth, skill trees lack a little but each class is quite different, coop with friends is crazy fun.One of the biggest things for me about these top-down games is I hate the click fest it is because you have to click to move, so you are just constantly clicking just to walk across the room. Well in TL2 you can map a key to be a movement key (I used W) then use the pointer to direct the character. +1 for that. Best control feature.There are some great mods out there as well, it has a very rich mod-base to choose from to tweak the game to your liking. Minorly or majorly. I use stuff like minimalist item labels so I can actually see when there are lot of items, respec and reskill potions added so I don't have to worry about the “perfect character build” right from the beginning and can just re-skill my characters if I get a new skill or want to try a different style, and the LurkerHud which gives tons of stats and info right on the dash and I recommend it very heavily. As I do the game, try it!			"

												Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. Not the most popular game however I think that if more people knew about it I think it would be. Highly Recommend. 10/10 from me!			"

												This is a top Arpg that can keep you entertained for very long time. It has a very complete workshop where you can find rebalance of foes, new classes, new adventures, companions and all kinds of stuff, which make you want to play again and expands the life time of the title beyond vanilla version "

												I really can't sing the praises of Torchlight 2 enough.  A lot of people I know describe it as ""Diablo 2.5"" and to be fair, it kinda is.  I maintain, however, that it's not a bad thing.  Graphically, it's as pretty as anything I've seen Diablo 3 produce.  Its interface will be instantly familiar to you if you've played Diablo 2, unlike D3 which looks like I'd have to learn all over again.  It has a quest system overworld-and-dungeons combo you'll be familiar with from D2, a potion and scroll system reminiscent of D2's, an item transmutation system that's a very simplified variation of D2's, even tiny atmospheric critters you can squish underfoot, just like in D2.That's pretty much where the similarities end.  For one, your inventory is far more convenient.  Gone are the days where you have to juggle space for every item - now everything takes up a single inventory block, and furthermore, consumable items and spells (more on those later) have their own inventory tabs.  Gone are the skill trees, where you have to take this skill in order to take that skill.  Now if you meet the level requirements, you can level the skill.  You can even freely mix skills between various trees without feeling like you're penalizing yourself.  Gone is the irritating stamina system - you can move at full speed, full time, instead of being forced to walk unless you guzzle potions.  Gone are the complicated extra rarities of stuff - there's normal, there's enchanted, there's rare (which includes some sets), unique (also with some sets), and at the highest end, legendary.  Everything drops, eventually.  No need to jump through complicated hoops of requirements to get a particular item - if you're at the right level range for it to drop or appear in the Gambler Shop's inventory, you can get it, if you have the patience and gold.New to the genre are permanent pets.  They're more than just there to look cute.  For one, they have their own inventories, which are as robust as yours.  Load 'em up with everything you don't want to carry, like all those trash items you'd never bother with otherwise.  Then, send them off to town to sell your loot.  No need to stop adventuring or use a town portal scroll just to clean out the garbage!  Your pet can even go purchase supplies for you while you're in the field.  Just a brief one or two minute wait is all it takes to get whatever basic amenities you need to keep adventuring.  More than just pack mules, all pets can fight, possessing a basic attack.  However, you can also teach them skills, too.  Ever wanted an alpaca that could spit fire and ice?  How about a bulldog that shoots swarms of bees when it barks?  Or maybe a necropanther - a panther necromancer, summoning skeletal archers and exploding zombies?  Find the right spell scrolls, and your pet can do just that!Speaking of spells, these little gems are throwbacks to the days of Diablo 1, where all the magic you own was found in the dungeon and learned the hard way.  Spells exist in addition to your class's skills, and you can have a maximum of four spells.  They're not unique to any class - any class can learn any spell, with the only restriction is having the required level or better.  They range from passive effects to buffs to direct damage spells.  Your barbarian, in addition to his horrific melee combat ability, can supplement his murderous rampage with fireballs, or buff up his attack and movement speed to get him into the fray faster.  It all depends on what spells you find and learn.Finally, Torchlight II does away with the slowness and stodginess of Diablo 2's gameplay.  Characters are fast and dynamic, enemies are slightly fewer but more brutal, with many, many more enemies having special attacks and abilities, not just champions.  You need to think on your feet a lot more, and use your skills intelligently and in good combination to dominate your foes.  There's less a focus on the stats you fight with and more on how you fight, and there's always numerous ways you can approach a situation with every class.  As an engineer, do you charge in with melee attacks and rely on your armor and defensive buffs to survive?  Or do you hang back with a cannon and blast crowds of enemies while your various killer robots do the grunt work?  It's up to you, and both approaches are completely viable.  In addition, enemies and the world feel more 'alive' - they don't just approach you in random themed hordes, but instead appear dynamically from the environment.  Ezrohir ambushers will burst from the sands of the desert underfoot.  Sturmbeorn raiders will leap from the cliffs overhead to challenge you.  You'll encounter zombies and ghouls devouring a corpse, and when you kill them, the flesh-stripped corpse rises as a skeleton to fight you as well.  Vile mystics will be found performing rituals upon desecrated tombs or will be trying to sacrifice innocent captives, and you can draw the attention of a lich by disturbing its grave.  You can rescue slaves from packs of slaver-bandits, and be surprised when you fight a horrid monster, only for its even-more-horrid mate to show up and join the fight!All in all, I consider Torchlight 2 to be a worthy entry to the action-RPG dungeon-crawler subgenre.  It strips the BS out of Diablo 2, keeps what Diablo 2 did well, and then improves upon the whole formula without being as wildly experimental as Diablo 3 is.  And hey, if you don't like what Torchlight II does, vanilla?  Well, it's mod-friendly, and has Steam Workshop support.  If you don't like it, change it!			"

												so i've put a few hundred hours into it and decided its time for a review. so its basically diablo 2.5 only in a cartoony environment. right from the start you feel powerful and everything explodes when it dies and its just very pleasing if your a fan of arpg's. the combat is very fun and there are tons of unique spells that i have not ecnountered in other arpgs. yes there are generic fireballs and damage buffs, but there are also interesting spells like summon gunbots which is a little npc robot that follows your character for a short time and shoots enemies. one interesting thing is that your spells get more powerful with your level so a level 1 spell could have 50 damage at character level 1 and 500 damage at level 100. this is very useful when putting ""value"" points into spells. the multiplayer has some issues like random long loading times and with 3 or more players spamming spells at large groups of mobs it can cause your fps to drop, but overall a very solid experience. the mp community is on the smaller side but overall they are friendly and like to help you out. most of the higher level characters will just jump in a world and start passing out free gear to the new players if you dont bug them asking for frees. speaking of fps drops when playing single player it runs fantastic. almost non existant loading times and fps stays consistant. the overall system load is pretty minimal and should run on most systems. in the future if i ever get board of playing unmodded i can start downloading mods off the steam workshop like synergies that from what i've heard will completely change the game or maybe one of the custom class mods that mix and match spells of the vanilla classes into 1 theme'd class. i eagerly await the day a median xl style mod is made for torchlight. overall its worth every bit of the $20 price (current as of 5/2016) and if you can get it cheaper on sale it becomes a no brainer purchase.

												Overall a very fun game and I can recommend it to anybody! Especially if it's for sale like JUST RIGHT NOW. Worth to spend those 5$.Different difficulty for each of the classes. (E.g. berserker is kinda hard to play while mage or gleve hunter is quite easy).You can easily get into the game while also experiencing a good end game and depth later. You have the option to play it casually or grind extreme on an almost competitive level haha.What seems weird for me: Whenever I try to play with friends, the multiplayer always seems bugged. Sometimes one person won't load and such. Am I the only one experiencing this? If you found a fix please message!I can just recommend this game.			"

												Torchlight has been revamped and upgraded in every aspect since its first debut.Amongst the best ARPGs, Torchlight II is one of my favourite. It has moderate random generated landscapes, insanely customizable, 4 totally different characters, moddability (!) and tons...no, I mean TONS of loot.In Steam Workshop, there are heaps of mods that improves/completely changes the game, giving you the ARPG you really want to play. I do not like to compare games or saying which one is better. Grim Dawn, Torchlight II, Diablo...: all of them are unique quality.			"

												This is how an ARPG should have been made! Torchlight II offers fine tuning of your character as you level up that you just can't do in Diablo 3. Pets can travel to town and buy-sell items for you while you're explorin' dungeons. And mods, which add more content to the world. Though this game support 6-player co-op, I'd suggest you to play with your 2 or 3 friends only as things get very messy when there are 6 players on the screen.			"

												If you enjoyed Torchlight, you'll find more of the same in Torchlight II - and 'More' is pretty much the theme.Whereas Torchlight was a very concise game with one central hub and a very deep mine to explore, Torchlight II has expanded with several 'base hubs', themed areas and a whole host of new enemies to turn into gibblets. Personally, I found this to have it's positives and negatives.There were times that I missed the simplicity of Torchlight, of just digging down deeper to find tougher and tougher enemies the deeper I delved into the mine. I missed how all your essential services were kept together at the mining camp, and it was easy to navigate. There were times in TL2 where I had to bounce between several hubs to get back to the original base camp where the shared stash and personal stash was based to retrieve gems and items I had stored for later. While this isn't anything major, it did add up to what I felt was a lot of down time between turning monsters into blood stains.However, the expanded features of Torchlight 2 do add several themed areas which are you able to explore to a point (and in some cases contain hidden quests & secret rooms), and probably more important to some - hosted coop. Coop mode is fairly stable and somewhat easy to setup and join when it comes to finding a game. The game provides an in-game text box to allow for people to communicate.The main addition that I find as a huge bonus is the integration of the Steam Workshop, which has enabled several add-on mods and 'fixes' to things you might not like (such as mods which bring back classes that were removed from the original game). In short Torchlight II is worth playing, as it does enough to be different from the first Torchlight (like it or not), and it's one of the more polished dungeon crawler/loot games out there. Have a good look through Steam Workshop to see if there are any additions you'd like to add to the playthrough, and you should be able to create an experience you'll enjoy.			"

												For the sake of this demonstration, I am an Embermage: you are a Varkolyn whelpling, an unarmed and mostly undressed little bat-person sitting up a tree. You've been sitting up that tree for a long time, waiting with your many brothers and sisters for someone to wander past. Suddenly, a stranger approaches! You leap down, snarl, prance about, and are almost immediately annihilated by five blind-fired bolts of magic that leap from my outstretched hands.Let's assume that, in those final moments, time slows to a tiny fraction of its regular speed. This is what you see: half a dozen of your siblings, stumbling into a purple patch of energy that slows them to a crawl. Six columns of flame bursting from the Embermage. A rain of firebolts. A storm contained in a vortex of wind that turns your nearby cousins to ash. Sometimes, when a whelpling dies, they explode into icy bolts that freeze nearby friends. Sometimes, the Embermage gets all its health back for no apparent reason. Sometimes, the ground shakes and a meteor falls from the sky, as if to drive the point home.You want to cry out, as the end approaches, but you can't. You've been magically silenced by a nearby raven, who has eaten an egg and is - temporarily - a crab. The crab-raven then summons a nether imp, five skeleton archers, and a zombie, before flying over and stealing your shoes and your money. The name on the crab-raven's tag is 'George Orwell'.I am gone by the time the first prismatic bolt hits you. The last thing you see is a familiar pattern of lights bursting beyond the treeline: me, doing exactly the same thing to those undead dwarves down the road. The last thing you think is this:""Oh, man. I'm not even special ."" It's fine! It's the good kind of fire!As an action-RPG, the best thing about Torchlight II is the way that loot, skill choice and chance bubbles over into a fountain of light and treasure at the whiff of a right-click, every single time, for as long as you can keep going. As an action-RPG, the worst thing about Torchlight II is the way that loot, skill choice and chance bubbles over into a fountain of light and treasure at the whiff of a right-click, in the exact same way, for as long as you can keep going.After more than 20 hours I've built my Embermage into a machine for the consumption and processing of monsters. My wands cast random spells when I kill an enemy. My armour reflects melee damage. I have a passive ability that randomly teleports attackers further away. My firestorm plants a fire vulnerability on enemies that my columns of flame capitalise on, explosively. Every point of damage I do fills my charge bar, which ultimately reduces the casting cost of all my spells to zero. When this happens I summon a duplicate of myself, just because I can. I've also got this raven. His name's George. I think you've met.As the difficulty rises, it's sometimes necessary to tinker with the machinery: to invest in new skills, or alter the opening moves of my combat rotation. By and large, though, the character I've made worked in act one and she's still working a campaign and a bit later.Your place in Torchlight II's plot is circumstantial: you're a hero, and that's about it. You're chasing down the villainous Alchemist - one of the original game's protagonists - for reasons that nobody in the game sounds especially concerned about. Character emerges as you settle on a playstyle: I'm a stationary death vortex now , but I could have specced differently - a teleporting, sword-wielding warrior mage, perhaps. Her love for skeletons is like a truck.Besides the Embermage, the other predominantly ranged character is the Outlander: a mobile weapons platform specialising in guns, glaives, and debilitating magic. The Berserker channels spirit animals to augment melee attacks, buffing allies and debuffing foes to build an advantage. The Engineer is a tank that can specialise in heavy weapons or sword-and-shield durability, with the option of swapping out for a massive handheld cannon and an army of robotic pets.They're a varied bunch, although the game struggles to communicate precisely how different they are before you start playing. I arrived at the Embermage through a process of experimentation: given the game's hundred levels of character advancement, I recommend you do the same before committing.Levelling grants you points to spend on attribute boosts and new skills. The two are linked: attributes determine the relative power of your weapon and magic damage, for example, impacting the usefulness of the skills you may choose to invest in. Unlike the original Torchlight, you don't need to invest points in a skill tree to unlock its late-game potential. Instead, new skills open up as you level, allowing for greater dabbling as you progress. The system is over reliant, as many action-RPGs are, on incrementing your power by tiny percentages every time you spend a point and each individual level up can feel inconsequential as a result. In the long term, however, there's a lot of scope for cleverness and creativity.Unfortunately, Torchlight II limits your ability to respec to undoing the last three skill decisions you made. This effectively prevents shifts in direction at high levels: even though I've built a character I like, I can't change her - and my skill trees are littered with discarded investments. If I want her to be perfect I either need to start again or wait for the inevitable respec mod, and both feel like a compromise. Certainly, it's a system where decisions have consequences: it's just that those consequences are a needless waste of time. In a year where multiple RPGs have figured out that freedom to change your mind actually results in more interesting decisions, not less, this aspect of Torchlight II's design sticks out as an unwelcome manifestation of its early noughties influences. Certain set pieces mix up the rules: in this section, you have to stay in the light.Other aspects are much more gratefully received. Offline play, six player co-op (both online and over LAN) and full mod support are all present, and Steam Cloud support enables the game to benefit from the best bits of modern online integration.In terms of features, Torchlight II has tremendous scope. The campaign is randomised from the overworld down, remixing environments and sprinkling them with events that keep the pace up even as you go about the busywork of map clearance. You might kill a sprite who drops a golden key, then go looking for the chest it opens. You might kill a phase beast and enter a pocket-sized challenge stage, or stumble across a hidden side quest that stretches across the whole game.When you finish the campaign, you can start over from where you left off or enter the 'Map Room', a nexus where you can use in-game gold to buy access to randomised dungeons with custom rulesets. A full set of difficulty levels are available from the start, along with a hardcore permadeath mode for the committed. The game bends over backwards to give you options, a limbo act that twists the rest of the way and swallows itself with the provision of mod support. This is a game with a long, community-driven future, one that scrawls an infinity symbol over your potential time investment in effortless freehand. Ever feel like a game knows exactly what buttons to push?It's less successful in terms of scale. There's very little sense of escalation to the environments or encounters: you start in a field, pass through a desert, visit a swamp and spend an awful lot of time in caves. You will be fighting level 1 rat-men at level 1 and level 40 bat-men at level 40: although it apes Diablo II's narrative and structure to a comical degree, Torchlight II doesn't up the stakes in the same way. The short fourth act changes the tone but is thin on surprises.The game's stock-in-trade is charm and detail: characterful animations that you'll zoom in to watch, witty item descriptions, the sound			"

												Torchlight II is a game very reminiscent of Diablo II in gameplay.  An action RPG with tons o' loot to go through and just enough playing around with skills and abilities to make a character that works to your liking.  No, it is not a deep or hardcore RPG in any way.  It just does a great job at keeping you entertained and coming back for more.  I got the game on a recent sale for $4.99 and consider it money very well spent.  I'm sure it will be a game that I will continually come back to long after I have beaten it.  Cannot wait to try out some of the content available in the Steam Workshop in the future to see what users have added to the game.  That will have to wait until I beat the game first of course.			"

												Alright, it's about time I give this absolutely amazing game the review it deserves. This game is honestly one of the best, my personal favourite, RPG games ever made. This game has everything that makes it entertaining and enjoyable to play. Just to put this out there, I've put in only over 30+ hours and I still haven't beat the story; so I won't be commenting on that just yet, I will hopefully edit it once I've completed it and give my final thoughts + opinions on it. So, to start off, I'll talk about the art of the game.This game is simply beautiful. Like, really. The locations that you visit are honestly some of the most astounding places I've been able to visit in a video game; and that's just the best feeling I've experienced within a game. The places fit their names perfectly, if the name is something drab and gloomy, the level makes sure to match the atmosphere it's trying to portray. If the name however is something cheery and pleasent, you can certainly expect an amazing looking level with many, many bright colours and just making it a downright beautiful level.The art for enemies is honestly so well done and it makes the game feel that bit more creepy and dark. The enemies all seem like they could fit into any serious and dark horror film. Enemies in this game are made perfectly from an art standpoint, like seriously. I know it sounds like I'm repeating myself but this game would give me nightmares if the enemies used were in a horror movie. They're just like nightmares except personified. The dark enemies can lead to some of the game feeling like an absolute hell, and the bosses are just.. Well, just as great as the normal enemies to be frank.Speaking of bosses, the art on them is absolutely top-notch and cannot be topped. I wish I could talk about the bosses without spoiling anything, but that just won't be possible, so I'm afraid I'll cut that there. Just know that the boss art is actually amazing and once again, using this horror movie bit, could make anything horrifying and downright terrifying. I think that to truly see what the bosses are like in this game, you should 100% get the game just to see the art of the bosses and enemies alone.Now, to talk about something that I adore in this game and something that makes this game seem like it's had years upon years of work put into it; the sheer amount of items in this game. Like, seriously. This game has weapons for everyone. Want a giant hammer to smash your foes? This game's got it! Prefer to use guns to shoot your enemies and inflict massive damage? Check! Want a massive amount of weapons which aren't limited to a certain class and can be used by any class? Well, this game has it! Yes, that's right, there are no class limitations on weapons (mostly!).The weapons in this game are so unique and there's almost no weapon like another. What I mean is, all weapons are somewhat unique compared to any other weapon in this game. The different types of which loot you can get (I mean like common, elemental, rare, etc!) are all a unique way of making sure that every weapon is so different and has it's own stats. Like, maybe it adds some extra fire damage or even some ice damage. Hell, throw some poison onto that bad boy and make it a real powerhouse of damage!Speaking of damage, don't expect all weapons that you get to be super-mega-hyper-ultra OP. Most weapons are actually pretty darn bad from a damage perspective;  but make up for it with an amazing damage OUTPUT. What I mean by that is, the damage may be bad but with the amount of leveling up you can do and the amount of skill points which can be contributed to each skill, you do end up doing more damage than the weapon claims. Say the weapon says that it does 60 damage, you may end up doing somewhere between 200-300 dependant on your skill points and enchantments.Something else this game does is enchantments. Each piece of equipment that you get can be enchanted by a special person in each town. This Racoon-type person will enchant all weapons or armour for a price. The enchantments can be great - or not so great - just because, well, it's an RPG so you can't expect a walk in the park! The enchantments are fairly basic but at the same time can really help you in a major way. From adding fire or electric armour to adding health stolen on hit!So, enough about the art and more about the actual enemies and bosses themselves. Each enemy in this game is unique and unlike the other, mostly. Some of the bosses are downright so enjoyable that I can't wait to fight them again when I start a Newgame+. The game does an excellent job of making you feel like the bosses are tough but beatable, and getting late-game you really start to experience that feeling. Some of the bosses may seem like they're easy at first glance, but damn do they get hard. Don't go to any boss expecting it to be an easy ride.The game allows you to experience it at your own pace, be you a slow player who wants to take it all in and explore all the areas that the game has to offer to you or maybe you want to ignore all the enemies and speedrun the game as fast as you want. The game allows you to play at YOUR pace. Once again, this is good for letting everyone have their own option in how they want to play. You want a game which doesn't hold your hand but somewhat lets you play fast? This game is PERFECT.In conclusion, because I can feel myself droning on and on, this game is honestly turning into one of my favourite games of all time - yes, all time! - This game has so much to offer me as a player and lets me want to play over and over and over. This game is down-right amazing and I cannot wait to keep playing and playing. Thanks for reading, and for sure get this game if you see it on sale - even if it DOESN'T look like your type of game.

												Every once in a while, I love to smash everything and everyone in sight - then I turn to a something like Torchlight II. Hack & Slay is the name of the game, and it feels just as satisfying as the rich booty from those battles. The enemies and surroundings are diverse enough, and some bosses look relatively awesome. I say ""relatively"" because overall, the graphics have not aged well. On the other hand, the music is still excellent. Dialogues are short and do not involve any important decisions or moral dilemmas, which is an advantage because the voice acting is mostly sub-par. Grim Dawn is superior in this regard and managed to create a lot more depth of atmosphere (e.g. the Steampunk setting with fireweapons side by side with swords and maces is more plausible in a post-apocalyptic scenario - Torchlight does not bother with giving you that kind of background). Also, it is four years younger and has better graphics. If in doubt which one you should play, I would prefer Grim Dawn. Nevertheless, Torchlight II is well done, it offers consistently engaging gameplay and character progression as well as several options for you to keep on playing after finishing the main story. The feature that you can use your pet as a connection to town markets is not realistic, but innovative and conveniently saves your hero some annoyingly repetitive errands, which is why I make this honorary mention here. I recommend this game to fans of the genre and give it a 7/10 in this comparison group.			"

												Torchlight II is a worthwhile loot-fueled adventure that will soak up hours of your day without you even noticing.Fantastically designed hack-n-slash RPG.Totally like that the companion pet can now buy potions and scrolls for you in addition to selling your junk, you can stay in the action indefinitely.Fans of the original will be overjoyed to find that most of what they loved is still here, with lots more of it....

												I never played action rpg before this. I have 140+ hours in this game and I still wants to play with it. I bought for 3,74 Euro in Summer Sales, definitely worth it. Steam Workshop such a good idea for this game, you can finish the story in like 10-20 hours( depends on difficulty), but in the workshop I found a lot good mods, like bonus classes( you can play as Dark Alchemist or with the original 3 class from Torchlight 1), bonus maps, bonus weapons class and much more. I recommend the play SynergiesMOD, its a complete balance to the game.I beat the Netherlord( Final boss) 5 five times, and the main story its repetative after completing 2 or 3 times. New Game+ is a good idea, but after New Game++++ the game wont be harder, everything stay at lvl 120. The game could beat you, if you dont know which skill is good, which stats are important for you. This why you play in Multiplayer( up to 6 player) and this make some good comps. I lvl up to 100 1 character yet, an Outlander, but a Berserker in progress atm. Every class has unique items/sets, and legendaries. After 140 hours of gameplay I got 3 legendary( all of them are the best in the class): shield, wand, and sword. My friend got 2 legendary in 80 hours: wand( same as mine) and a greathammer. Conclusion: I rate 10/10, I realy loved it, but lots of people said its a Diablo copy. Yeah, thats true, but the game still awesome. "

												It's made by the brains behind Diablo 1 and 2, and the music is done by the same dude as well. The game is not nearly as dark, but the feel of the game and especially the music has the Diablo vib. Cant say enough about the music. At some times you think you're listening to an unreleased Diablo track, which isn't a bad thing at all. It's something D3 was missing.Overall, imo the game has the Diablo spirit, but isn't as fleshed out content wise, or replayability as Diablo 2. Replay being an understatement, because there are tons of hours to be spent here. Just don't expect 1000s of hours that live up to the D2 experience.Overall the game offers a s*** ton of fun, whether playing sp or mp; tons of fun to be had if you can jam with a few friends.			"

												First of all I want to say that Torchlight II - great action-RPG, I would even say that it has surpassed its parent, Diablo III.Throughout the game, I had a feeling of euphoria, it's all due to a strong gameplay, beautiful picture, made ​​in the style of WoW, great mechanics of the game. The only thing that I was not really impressed - soundtrack. Playing co-op with friends (or strangers if you have no friends * foreveraloneface *) will bring you a lot of pleasure and fun, I checked it on myself. The only minus of the Torchlight II - no PvP mode. But there is one plus - Steam Workshop, it's really nice. In the end, I recommend this game to real fighters mouse and keyboard, for those who want to spend a fun time together with your friends by killing the tons of mobs and working as a team.			"

Posted: March 17, 2016
												First time I played this genre so if you read this: it will be critiqued on the game itself rather than compared to other sources ( like Diablo series )... BASE GAME:  is interesting for a couple of completions on single player with 2 classes maybe test out the other 2 classes then quit... unless grinding for gear is what one seeks- and this game is HEAVY with trash drops to sell to vendor... anyway story is cute and enough- nothing special just decent and predictible so don't play this for the story unless this is the kind of story prefered. It should be noted that one completion of story stops at level 50 before recycling into New Game Plus levels beyond. Diffculty available to choose as they feel: Way too easy- Too easy- Easy- Tough with some OHKOs against user. At the highest levels- Veteran (the one I said felt easy at first) feels more fair since OHKOs don't seem to be a threat. Early in game: Elite feels more fair- until level 80+ when the damage received makes one feel that Enginners are best. Perhaps the biggest problem is that the game never does ephasize how important ""damage reduction"" really is... at level 120 ( Elite ) it becomes tragic if one ( easily ) misses out on farming the ""Eyes of Grell"" or ""Skulls of Limony""- don't forget to find the enchanter who sells sockets... in the mapworks... who MAY randomly spawn in some dungeons. Equipment will work against mobs... not good defense against level 120 Elite bosses- unless one has found ""Boris"" the enchanter who ( randomly ) sells big bonuses into user's gear that helps to max DEXTERITY and VITALITY to get a max of 75% block ( need shield ) and 75% dodge chance... don't forget a couple of special skulls that give 25% missile-deflect chance and a shield that also carries some of that as well... if using an Enginneer- Forcefield is an OP wonder that becomes a necessity- at that level... But none of that really matters- if playing on Veteran or lower- perhaps Elite without going beyond New Game Plus 3... If diffculty and balance are fine: Content becomes the next topic; Tarroch's Tomb only found on New Game Pluses and not availble in the Mapworks ( wish it was ) is the best dungeon ( maybe the only true waves of foe area )- otherwise after beating the story- the only option is to play Mapworks over and over... or farm for better gear- money- boosts. O = = = = = = = O = = = = = = = O If that's all this game was- I wouldn't be playing it that much- except... MODDED GAME: And this is where this game really shines: Synergies- Torchfun- Certain custom classes- Adventure Pack 2- and a soup of mods that help various aspects of this game ( it needs rebalancing for Elite ) or sometimes adds some really fun OP weapons ( Minigun Mod )... that can be fun to figure out how little power is needed to balance... Noddygineering or Brothers-in-arms if one wants some human partners that can wear gear... I mean just almost everything this game normally lacks is usually found among some mods... which do have a slew of problems between some of them- mainly not working well together ( that's another story )... If you manage to find the fun ones that work... they are worth it. However it is worth noting that games like Grim Dawn and Path of Exile will offer a far deeper experience than any Torchlight Mod can offer... nevertheless this is one game that has some impressive mods which will satisfy anyone who likes a decent hack, slash, and loot game.  O = = = = = = = O = = = = = = = O Ultimately I'm still playing this game after 2 years ago because of MODS... and I'm grateful to the modders who ( almost all who do this 'cause they like this game or modding and are students or have families and other work ) continue to make this fun and worthwhile for players like me... so a HUGE thank you to them and Runic for making this.

												I bought first part at GoG and I've enjoyed it so I ware really happy when I won 2nd part at steamgifts platform.It is said that developers team have some people that ware part of Diablo 2 developing team. In some way this game shares many of the Diablo 2 advantages and disadvantages, the whole list would be:Advantages:+ large amount of pets to choose from+ a cartoonish, quite unique and beautiful world + pistols, rifles, cannons next to ""regular RPG gear""+ diablo 2 loot system+ large skill trees+ different skills, resistances of the monsters, each world is quite unique+ alchemy, similar to Diablo 2 Horadric cube+ not using myself, but cooperation multiplayer+ steam workshop+ achievements and trade cards+ low requirements (my Intel build-in card handled this game)+ multiplatform system support+ some soundtracks resemble Diablo 2 soundtracksDisadvantages:- Diablo 2 difficulty challenge, on higher difficulties normal monsters rather easy to beat, while ""big boys"" are ranging from almost impossible to impossible. Taking a bar for hours is not fun and if the monster happened to get regeneration perk it could become invincible.- sometimes player character doesn't exactly act as the player is expecting, going to wrong direction- diablo 2 quest system, successful but not very deep.

												A Diablo style RPG/Action game made by some of the creators of the games Diablo and Fate.  The music is also done by the guy that did the original Diablo music as well.  I am a huge fan of this game, because it is done so well.  It hardly misses the mark on anything and expands the genre very nicely.  Extremely tight action and controls with very few bugs and exceptional multiplayer make it go to one of my  favorites.  Everything has been expanded in the second one from the classes to the levels to the level of detail and if you have played the first one you can jump right in and be fine.  I am a big fan of Diablo 3 as well as this game, so you really can't go wrong with either of those choices.  Overall, if you are looking for a great multiplayer action rpg experience and don't mind not having very many cut scenes or a bioware style story to hold onto this one is very hard to beat.Graphics: 8/10 (Simple, but awesome)Animation: 10/10 (Buttery smooth, never lags ever.)Multiplayer: 10/10 (One of the best)Gameplay: 10/10 (Extremely tight and responds well)Story: 6/10 (Not going to win any awards, but your not playing this for the story)Fun Factor: 10/10 (Wait...what time is it?)Music: 9/10 (Very good and changes on the place or the mood of the area)Sounds: 7/10 (Not a lot of dialogue, but the various weapon sounds and creatures are all good.)Replayability: 9/10 (Has the right recipe to make you want to go back and play again.)Overall: 9/10 (One of the best on Steam, and even higher recommended if you have a couple friends to travel along the way with.)

*Before beginning, I would like to give a special thanks to X Phantom for critiquing this review. Much can be said about the successes of dungeon crawling roleplaying games preceding the Diablo series. Torchlight, however, has lived up to, if not exceeded, the expectations of the genre has set throughout its creation over twenty years ago. What I call ‘colorful Diablo,’ Torchlight II is, as stated, a dungeon crawling roleplaying game set in a fantasy environment with various classes and subsequent styles of play. This title maintains a steampunk theme and a few fan-made overhauls may alter simple displays such as the health meter, but may range to altering the system entirely. I have played this title solo, with friends, and online-though this final occurrence can be rare due to the lack of an overall online community-and can honestly declare that any group size is adequate for play.Here are just a few things that I found of interest in this title:Multiplayer - Though Torchlight II can be played solo, the experience is enhanced greatly through cooperative play; the genre typically requires such. This title allows the player to create sessions for friends or strangers to play online or on a local network. A staple for dungeon crawlers can be seen in this game as enemy mobs become increasingly difficult with each additional player added, which also escalates the amount of loot acquired as well as the rarity of said items. As always, cooperation is key since monsters throughout the overworld become more powerful, adding to the play value of Torchlight II. In summary: garb your friends, or I will gladly play with you if your friends do not own this game.Gameplay - Torchlight II’s combat system is quite simple: click to move and attack, with the Number keys serving as a layout for implementable items and abilities. Other keys can be utilized for certain actions-such as holding down Shift to remain still while attacking-but the core combat retains the simplistic style of the classics. As players gain levels by instilling the ‘f*** up everything in sight’ clause, they gain attribute points which passively improve specific aspects of the character such as Strength and Defense statistics, as well as upgrades to level-specific skills such as the Engineer’s Spider Mines. New items in the form of loot can be obtained from defeated enemies. Said items add to character customization as well as developing a build in which players can utilize their own set of tactics within the game’s limits. The system is actually quite intricate with bonuses influencing the various class skills. Simple fishing holes are also scattered throughout each area, which grant another mini-game and new items to the players.Map Layout - Each area the player treks to has its own theme and general appearance. For example, you can expect the Blightbogs to assume a marshy look and contain enemies that are apparent to the given scene. These settings have simple background pieces that add to the landscape without distracting the players from combat and exploration, while the map itself is entirely nonsymmetrical-this presents a more realistic stage. Quests typical face the player across the massive span of each set-piece; I have found this to be quite entertaining seeing as though I, myself, tend to explore every inch of the map regardless. Secrets such as golden chests-requiring the defeat of a monster with the designated key to open-as well as mysterious portals to bonus stages are strewn throughout the world.TL:DR - I had wanted to mention several other functions of Torchlight II such as its dedicated Steam Workshop contributors and fluid graphics style. I have seen that, as a collective opinion by many of its players, this is one of the few games in which the story is disregarded, yet the game itself is highly enjoyable beyond its writing. I would highly recommend Torchlight II to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers and roleplaying game character building because this game is just more Diable, and there’s nothing wrong with that.

The story is pretty much nonexistent, so don't expect one--just come for the loot and the leveling (both of which are a little slow in coming for my taste).			"

												Runic Games, the developers behind the epic RPG Diablo 2 and it shows. Everything in Torchlight II feels like a Diablo game and that's a good thing.This is a game I spent hundreds of hours playing non-stop. One of the things I like in this game is the ability to create your own custom character. You can mix and match skills, stats, spells and weapons and gears to create your own unique character.Playing in drop-in-drop-out multiplayer is fun and it's more fun to school everyone with your unique character. Though the lobby is not quite as crowded as before you won't have any problems looking for someone to play with.You won't be disappointed with this game, a truly amazing game. A must have!			"

												This is gonna get complicated. Ok, let's get this out of the way: the game is quite good. I've played 75 hours, Steam tells me, and I did enjoy them - at least modded. Unmodded, the record would probably be more like 6. There are some great mods that hugely improve what's already a solid base. The reasons I can't recommend it, though, are complex.First off, it's the feel. I do not like the game's aesthetic. It's very cartoonish and detracts from the feel I'd want. The story is forgettable at best, a confusing afterthought with no thought put into it whatsoever at worst, which I suppose you could expect from an ARPG, but... why? It's a spiritual successor to Diablo, right? Diablo 2 especially had a really interesting story. The setting was great, with Good and Evil both presented as Bad, some cool ideas and history, and even genuine characters! With personality! It was also very good-looking for the time, with a dark, interesting aesthetic, rather than the goofy one here that I personally dislike. Admittedly, that's a matter of taste, but this isn't meant to be objective. And the characters are just... nonexistant. The most interesting thing about the setting are a race that's left their bodies behind and are now just animated suits of armor, basically. Which are never really explored anyway.Modded, though, I'd say it's worth the price except for one thing: the existence of Path of Exile.In a vacuum? Sure, it's fun. $20 of fun, especially if you're looking for a time sink. Compared to Diablo 3? Yeah, certainly buy this. Compared to Path of Exile, which is free, incredibly innovative, gorgeous, dark, actually has an interesting story, and is simply more fun (in my opinion)? Why bother?And, frankly, even today I'd call it as much fun as Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction at best, at least if you care much about story, atmosphere, or aesthetic. If you don't, and just want gameplay and can seriously ignore all that, go for it. If you do, well there's Path of Exile, or... so how much is Diablo 2: LoD now?It should also be mentioned I rather resent the game because I preordered it due to the promise of the toolset, GUTS, being made available ""soon"" (and even, in one instance, ""very soon"") after release. Not relevent to you, dear reader, but it was not. And so my high-fallutin' plans fell to ruin as interest waned, until by the time it was released I was sitting by myself, eating ice cream, sobbing, and plotting my revenge. In addition, it requires you to make a Runic games account to use the online service. Not a huge deal, but the principle of the thing bugs me as it wasn't disclosed. So those are my biases against it. Grain of salt and all that. Hope it helped.			"

  Torchlight II vs Diablo review Nope, you know what? We're not going to go about reviewing this game that way - not because they're not comparable or not in the same genre, but because it's like pitting apples vs oranges, or Star Trek vs Star Wars.  Just because two games, shows, or fruits share a few features doesn't mean you can really place one over the other.So, where to begin...Torchlight II offers so, so much to fans of classic dungeon crawler ARPG's.  It offers 4 dynamic classes with 3 skill trees which allow you to mix and match skills at will; attribute points for stats that are all useful to every character in their own way; secret rooms usually accessed through puzzles; epic boss battles; gigantic world chests that require a key that drops from a specific mob; portals to other dimensions filled with loot; both shared and personal stashes; and - last but not least - pets. Pets are a really unique addition to Torchlight II that satisfy the loot hoarder in each of us.  While out adventuring, your pet will carry all of your unwanted loot back to town.  In addition to this, they will assist you in battle, cast spells, and go shopping for basic supplies.  No feeding necessary!Something else that's both unique and awesome about this game is its mod-friendly attitude.  It offers a very helpful mod kit for any who are interested in expanding Torchlight II's horizons, and actively supports said mods with online play.Speaking of online play, Torchlight II is an  excellent  game to play with your friends!  Don't forget, if you guys are playing a modded version of the game you HAVE to not only be subscribed to the same mods but have the mods in the same load order as well.Torchlight II is fantastic to play solo.  Nearly all of my 200+ hours in this game have been spent alone, tearing through the wilderness of Torchlight.  From level 1 to level 100, gameplay is fresh and challenging.  Difficulty can be changed as needed between 4 difficulty settings, and hardcore characters are an option.Before I end this review, I must add that the music is FANTASTIC.  It is by far some of the best music I've heard from an ARPG's OST.  Even if you decide not to purchase the game, definitely visit YouTube and give its music a listen - although, it is definitely better when experienced in the settings meant for it ;)			"

												The sequel to the game that brought back Hack 'n' Slash, or so I seem to believe. This genre was pretty much dead until the first Torchlight came out. If Torchlight I would have been released as the same time as AAA Hack 'n' Slash, it would never have gotten any attention and there might not have been a Torchligh II. Torchlight I was just an indie, but the lack of any other Hack 'n' Slash led people to praise the game a lot. Rightfully so, original Torchlight was a very unique game while maintaining the atmosphere from Diablo 2. Torchlight II very much picks up from there, it's a sequel that does everything right. Torchlight II is much bigger, has more characters, more loot, more enemies, more levels, more more more. The game also looks a lot better than the original, but has the same art-style to it, that keeps that atmosphere that made the original great. The armosphere will remind you a lot of Diablo 2, since some of the guys who made Lord of Destruction have been working on the Torchlight games. While the art-style is a new thing to the Torchlight games, the music and ambient sounds is what makes this game so similar to Diablo 2.One of the more important additions to Torchlight II was Co-op, which the fans were just screaming for. These type of games are best enjoyed with a cold glass of co-op to be honest, and the original Torchlight suffered from the lack of it. Up to 6 players can now join together and hack and slash together, gather loot, trade items and win epic boss fights. You have 4 classes to choose from instead of 3 from the original Torchlight; Embermage, Berserker, Outlander and Engineer. The Embermage is obviously a mage, the Berserker delivers fast melee combat, the Outlander is range and the Engineer is melee with a lot of damage output - but not as fast as Berserker.Thanks to the already interested fans of the series, the game did surprisingly well even though released just a few months after Blizzard's Diablo III. If the original game didn't do so well, this game would have had really hard to survive. The player base for Torchlight II has stayed strong for long and not until now it starts to disperse. Not sure what Runic Games are doing at the moment, but I am guessing that additional content will be added. A few minor updates have been released since launch, including Steam Workshop support for user-created mods. I would be really surprised if they didn't make a big Expansion Pack for it, considering how well it has sold.Personally I played through the game, not once, not twice but three times for a NG++ and a level 100 Embermage. I just could not stop, it was endless amount of fun, and I wish to return soon, maybe if there is new content. One of the few games that I completed, and so fast too. I am not a huge hack 'n' slash fan either I never enjoyed Diablo 2 for example.I highly recommend picking this up, alone or with friends - does not matter. This game is amazing! "

												Torchlight II was a game I passed over for like a year until this recent Steam Sale.  I remember the old days of Diablo II and this game very much reminds me of that gameplay.  Torchlight II adds a few new things such as fishing activities and pets (which you can send back to town to sell things for you and other things as well)  With the updated graphics (compared to Diablo II days of gaming, newer games as far as graphics go it holds it own but has a ""Cartoon"" look to it.) Install size is small and system demands are on the lower side.  If you like dungeon crawling/RPG style games and can pick this up for a good price, I would say give it a go, I am really enjoying it myself.			"

Great Design for enemies, 4 Unique Classes (with differing skill trees to add further diversity), NG+ features, hard but fair difficulty level, and an amazing endgame dungeon that actually gives good rewards for fighting Super Bosses. Only real complaints is that the story is uninspired and flat, and most quests really just end up having the same method of completion (enter dungeon, loot everything, kill everything etc) except for one or two. Best part though? Full mod support. Buy if all this tickles your fancy.			"

An Underrated Action RPGRunic made huge improvements on the first installation of the series; it's a formidable ARPG in its own right. I got this around the same time as I bought Diablo 3 and ended up playing this way more. I always recommend playing online multiplayer games with friends but even playing with friends on D3 wasn't nearly as much fun. D3 gives off a gothic, eerie tone whereas Torchlight 2 has a lot more charm, the characters are memorable, and the game overall is much more simplistic. In this case, less is more. I also enjoyed doing the quests alone but it was still more engaging to play with friends.It has a Borderlands 2-like mechanic where you can play it again on an even more challenging difficulty with better loot. The story isn't very memorable but the soundtrack is good, the mechanics are fun, and there's plenty of whimsical moments. It's also got the best character customization I've seen in an ARPG with no terrible, stereotypical, and racist tropes like the Chinese wizard dragon lady *cough*Diablo 3*cough*! All the more reason to love this game. I strongly recommend playing this with friends.Be mindful of your skill allocation, especially if you're too lazy to get any mods. I had to start over because I messed up the first time.9/10			"

												Excellent diablo like. The life time is really huge and the challenge really hard if you try to success the hardcore mod mix with the hardest level of difficulty. The game is really well optimized and a medium graphic cards will easily provide a high FPS rate. That's the kind of game you can spend hundreds hours without feel boring to replay levels.			"

												With the new innovations made by Runic Games (full comunity support and the new co-op online) you will spend hours clicking with or without your friends.Variety, longevity, a well balanced difficulty and a very cheap price are the factors that make this game one of the best HnS of these years.

												I'm playing 'blind' with the Synergies Mod (because I read so many good things) so my review is based on the game with that mod, as I've not actually played the Vanilla version.After playing the original Torchlight and hating it due to a massive number of design flaws, I wasn't expecting much for this game. But I am really impressed at the changes made. All of the problems the first game suffered with have now been fixed, and it's a really enjoyable experience.PROS- Fun as heck- Glorious loot!- Levelling system is simple but interesting- Nice and bright (why are ppl complaining about this? It isn't Diablo 3!)NEUTRAL- Combat is repetitive, but I haven't found this ruins the game- Thanks to RNGesus, you sometimes get better loot at the start, and the 'special' loot winds up worthless- Would be nice if your pet had a bit more storageCONS- Sometimes during a mob you CANNOT see your mouse pointer and/or character- Difficulty is weird. It can be too easy and then BAM. You randomly insta-die (RNGesus again?).- The game doesn't pause on inventory or levelling screens (note: I have a sneaky feeling this is the Synergies Mod, I don't know if the Vanilla version does this)Anyway, it's fun. I got it on sale for like £2 during a Humble sale, and honestly I probably would've paid full price for it.			"

												I won't lie; it took me a bit of time to actually get into Torchlight II; I didn't feel like it had a hugely compelling start to the game, the art style felt a little unpolished, the combat seemed a bit dull.  Nothing really jumped out at me, even for 11 levels of gameplay.Imagine my surprise when I actually upped the difficulty from Normal to Veteran, and installed the Synergies Mod.  Now, it's tough to put down!Torchlight II comes highly recommended.  The game itself is really pretty solid, and once you up the difficulty, the gameplay actually becomes compelling and fun.  You'll be on the edge of your seat when the fights get tougher and tougher, and it feels more rewarding.One downside is that the devs seem to have called ""mission accomplished"" on the game and left to start their next project.  Support it, therefore, nearly non-existent.  Fortunately, they released the GUTS tool, which allows modders a great deal of control over the game.  Synergies is one such game that has taken it to a whole new level.  With a total conversion that alters over 16,000 files, adds 3 classes, a new city, and tons of end-game content, it really shows that this game will have great longevity and replay value through the Workshop alone.Pick it up cheap, set it to Veteran or higher, and start playing around with some mods.  You'll rapidly get your money's worth, and then some.			"

												If you like Diablo style games, then you will love the Torchlight franchise.The game play is sound. The mechanics work well and are very well polished throughout.I cannot recall ever having a crash in this game. It's the most stable game I think I have ever played.The only dislike I have is the fact that the danger elements of enchanting items has been removed, so there is no risk anymore. The risk in the first game made enchanting a real gamble, which made it far more satisfying.			"

Torchlight II accomplished everything a sequel should:  it took the original game and made it better in every way possible.  The length of the game, the locations, the story, the combat, the music, etc.  Everything is better in this phenomenal sequel.  Torchlight II is an action/ adventure RPG much like an offline MMO.  Your character levels, you choose talent traits, and you grow in abilities.  This game has figured out everything that was important and mastered them.  I had a blast playing Torchlight II both single player and with friends.  I would give this game a 9/10.			"

												Played on Linux. Stability, not so good. I had to disable a lot of eye candy for the game to not crash in certain areas. Even with graphics set to low there was the occational crash, but it happened for my friends playing on Windows too. Although this is very similar to games like Diablo, it reminds me more of the olden goldie Gauntlet more than anything else. You hack and shoot your way through hordes of lesser enemies and take on stronger bosses. In the process you get loot, XP and fame.The big gripe I have is a common misconception many RPG-type game developers seem to share, that game hours are more important than game content. Levelling up takes too much time. These are not quality game hours of exploring the world or different skill builds, it's boring grinding. The rigid reskilling/reallocation of XP/fame discourages experminenting with builds and the task of levelling up 10-12 characters to level 50 is unappealing, leaving you playing a fraction of the game content (skill trees) the developers put in there. What a waste.			"

												Torchlight II's story follows the events of the first game, although those who come into the game without playing the original will not be missing much. Players create their own hero from one of four new classes, and are tasked with preventing one of the original heroes, who has been corrupted, from bringing ruin to the world. The story serves its purpose of giving players a reason to head off for the next quest goal but for the most part is pretty negligible, with the exception of a few rare quests of interest.The options for character creation are expanded from the original; there are now four classes and each class has options for its gender, hair, and face. Pets also make a return, with a number of new creatures added. The pets are welcome companions, assisting the player by participating in combat, learning spells, being able to summon minions of their own, and even travelling back to town to sell loot and buy potions so the player doesn't have to.Basic gameplay follows the template used by other isometric and top-down action RPGs. Players move using the left mouse buttons and click on enemies to attack. There are a wide number of skills and spells available, with numerous ways to activate them through various hotkeys and on-screen icons. The game allows for a lot of variety in builds and play styles, with each level up providing points to add to attributes and to upgrade and learn skills. Also provided is a lot of variety in equipment with no class restrictions, with the exception of some unique loot, although a number of skills require a certain weapon type. Loot in the game is plentiful, but fortunately the game makes it very easy to compare picked up loot with that currently equipped and to switch it into the pet's inventory so it can be quickly sold. There will always be the occasional pause midway through a dungeon to conduct some inventory management, however, outside of these pauses the pacing is quick and keeps the action going at an engaging level.The dungeons are randomly generated in terms of overall layout, but specific areas like boss arenas are preset. This means that when playing multiplayer or a new game plus, it isn't a matter of simply retreading old routes, and the highly enjoyable exploration experience that the dungeons provide is always there. There is always a danger of such generated dungeons becoming generic and repetitive but it is pleasing to report that the danger has been negated as well as could be hoped for. A number of tougher enemies and special challenge zones litter Torchlight II's areas, providing fairly regular breaks from the usual fodder (who can still pack a punch if players aren't paying attention) and making sure things don't get too repetitive. The player character can become briefly stuck in a crowd that's difficult to maneuver out of, but these situations are rare and typically caused by charging in too wildly rather than through any fault of the game.With the exception of Hardcore mode, where death is permanent, players can respawn without too much consequence. A percentage of gold can be paid in order for the deceased character to reappear either where they died or at the map entrance. Alternatively they can respawn back in town for free. There are four difficulty options to choose from plus a toggle for the aforementioned Hardcore mode. The Normal difficulty is a decent, but not especially challenging, level for newcomers, so experienced Torchlight players will likely want to jump immediately into Veteran.Difficulty in multiplayer is handled well, with monsters increasing in toughness depending on the number of players. While it's certainly not necessarily to enjoy what Torchlight II has to offer, there can be no denying the enjoyment of playing the game with others and it adds a more than welcome dimension to the game. Those afraid of having their loot taken by comrades need not fear, as players get their own sets of loot visible only to them. There is plenty of postgame content for players to sink their teeth into after completing the twenty hour or so main campaign, either by tackling one of the main postgame dungeons or by starting a new game plus, which keeps the player's progress but levels up all the opponents to match. New game plus might disappoint some, as it isn't possible to notch up the difficulty, so those hoping for a greater challenge in the main story will need to start a new character. The game has also been created with the modding community in mind, so even if Runic's postgame options run out there will likely be plenty of fan-made offerings.Visually the game looks great, even on less powerful computers, and for the most part runs very smoothly. The art style is great, the environments are all nicely varied, and the UI is clear and easy to use. Even when hidden behind terrain, it's easy to see where the character is and to click on enemies thanks to a coloured outline that appears for any combatant potentially obscured. Spells and skills are all beautifully animated, and it's incredibly satisfying to see enemies explode upon being finished off with a critical hit. Voice acting is generally rare, but it doesn't feel like the game is missing much without it. The key quest givers and few animated cutscenes are voiced, and it's functional for getting the next task across, but there's not enough of it to have any major effect and can be easily ignored without anything being missed.For me Torchlight II was an immensely enjoyable experience from start to finish. The game is more than welcoming for both fans of the original and newcomers to the series and is high amongst the better gaming experiences I've had this year. It might not bring anything particularly new to the genre, but those who choose to pick it up will be provided with superb value for their money.Highly Recommended "

												Awesome game much better then the first game by leaps and bounds. The Single player is fun, multiplayer with any of your other friends who also have the game. Also lots of mods to add to the game after you have tired of playing it vanilla including new classes, pets, weapons,  armor, and lots of other fun things to add.			"

												I'm always on the lookout for new ARPG's to play and so my quest led me to Torchlight II.I really LIKE this game! There is a nice art style to the game that's quite similar to World of Warcraft. There are plenty of enemies to slaughter and looks great when gibbed. As you would expect this game is full of loot to gather, sell or hoard. When on quests you are not alone, you have a choice of pet companions upon character creation, amongst them a headcrab from Half-Life... a headcrab! There are many references to other games and films, which are nice to see and find. Story is ok to follow but nothing intricate or ground-breaking.This is a great ARPG for the casual gamer. 8/10			"

												That feel when Prussia will never exist again :'^(Prussia was a great amazing place near Germany. In Prussia, you were always happy and everyone always checked their privileges.After Germany lost the Great War to End All Wars, most of Prussia's land was taken by mean, greedy Allies, such as the evil /pol/es. Then, when Hitler and the National Socialist German Workers' Party came to power in 1933, Prussian government was unofficially dissolved and broken.Ok now let's review the game, but just thinking back to my dinner today, It was yummy,Grated potato, onion and egg, all mixed up and then I put it around smoked salmon and baked it,I know, you don't need to cook smoked salmon, but it tastes even better,I think I've found my new favourite dinner.So Torchlight II is in fact ... wait a moment, someone is ringin at the door, but who may it be? It's 2014 people, when you plan to visit CALL FIRST, jeesus. Oh, well, maybe it's the mailman or something. But what if it's a girl ringing for a nice booty call. Yeah, let's check... Oh well, i think it was a prankster, because there is no one at the door right now.The thing with this game is BUT HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥what if it was a ghost???? What if the ghost entered my apartment when I opened the door? But i think ghosts can travel through walls so WHAT IF THERE ARE BILIONS OF GHOSTS IN MY APARTMENT RIGHT NOW WATCHING ME FAPPING??Whoah, i must chill or else I'll have a heart attack.So, back to the review, Torchlight II is			"

												Torchlight 2 is an excellent sequel to an already outstanding game. Runic Games upped the stakes and 3 years after the release of the first game they came out with a more ambitious, more colourful, more varied and more enjoyable sequel.Whilst the game features the same gameplay-style as its predecessor, notable (and brand new) elements are the availability of multiplayer and the extended modding capabilities.Also, the four playable classes introduced in this episode are brand new and those present in the first game do not return. These classes offer the options to create several builds so fully getting to know the characteristics of a class requires multiple walkthroughs. Pets also return (but with more options) and instead of the retirement of our characters we have the newgame+ mode. Also, a hardcore mode for die-hard fanatics.Torchlight 2 is a must for Diablo fans. But do bear in mind that this is similar to Diablo 2 and not to its latest installment.			"

												Although I am not into fast-paced games, I made a rare exception with Torchlight II and its predecessor.Why? Well, I like the cute meets gore aesthetics, the beautiful landscapes (but I prefered the first installment’s ’scapes), the responsiveness, the freedom in designing builds, the replayability (the game is subtly different across classes and levels), the music and sound effects, and the accessibility to non-action players like me.On the other hand, I don’t like the basic storyline, the little mistakes (such as the Mimic and fighting Dessicated Corpse labels a little bigger than they should be), the fishing mini-game, the many useless skills, the sometimes unbalanced fates our characters receive from the RNGod, but those are minor qualms.All in all, a fine Diablo-like game.

												This is top down action role playing at its best.  Its what D3 should of been.  There are 4 classes (more with mods) that are pretty fun to play, and you can play them in various ways.  There is not alot of restrictions on the classes and what they can use.  Each one has 3 skill trees, which you can use any tree as long as your the at the level requirement for it, your not restricted to 1 tree, you can put points anywhere.  The item drops are fun, you get plenty of rare items.  Story, I never follow the story line so I cant comment on that (same for all games).  End Game is either playing through the game again with monsters leveled up, or using maps in the Mapworks.   Maps you can purchase at a vendor and they all have stats, like +% Fire Damage, +% More Gold, and/or +% Damage for Monsters.  I've only played an Embermage lvl 100 NG++, and a 56 Beserker.9/10			"

												If you've played Diablo 3, maybe the level of detail in Torchlight 2 might seem a bit disappointing. However, this wasn't made by Blizzard. The gameplay is very much engaging. A game that sure is worth your time (as I'm guessing a couple of thousand people who reviewed this as overwhelmingly positive would agree). Introduction of more classes would surely help in making it innovative and the story good as it is, can be more elaborate. Nevertheless, this game is a lot of fun and certainly would be one I'd recommend.			"

												Wow, I'm actually genuinely surprised that I have not yet written a review for this wondrous game. Or maybe I should put it wanderous? Yes, I know it's not an actual word, continue on.Torchlight II is a game of deep, enthralling exploration and the subsequent battles for glory, fame, and of course, loot drops that follow throughout this excursion. You must choose a character to harness your abilities from the four available classes: Outlander - Ranged weapons; Embermage - More spells than Harry Potter; Berserker - Right up in your face, meat slicing action; Engineer - A combo of ranged/up-front-and-personal weapons with robots. Each role serves a purpose whether you are in a party of 1 or a whole crew of 4. I personally played with a friend who manned Outlander while I played Engineer.Throughout my journey, I roasted, toasted, grinded, and gibbed more monsters than I can recall and had a blast quite literally. I will mention that I had not played Torchlight I or any other top-down RPG before playing Torchlight II. As an introduction to this fantastic genre, Torchlight II touched all the bases any game should: Engaging and exciting gameplay; balanced classes, enemies, and loot; and content that progresses and evolves to a greater level by the end of the game. Throw in a soundtrack that perfectly matches the ambiance and you've got a smoldering fire of a game.It is important to note that I had a friend to play with during my adventure, so this may influence one's opinion on this game. I am considering going through and playing it again, the only thing holding me back is my circadian rhythm - I'm not quite sure it's ready for a re-run.Final RatingsGameplay: 10/10 - Never was bored, definitely stayed up way too late.Storyline: 7/10 - Not too hard to follow but I probably would've had an easier time had I played Torchlight I.Combat: 7/10 - Not confusing, easy to learn, a multitude of abilities to keep each encounter varied. I blasted through the enemies on Normal on my first run-through. I would recommend playing on Hard as the final boss seemed easier than expected. On Normal it's easy to get hyper-leveled if you love grinding enemies.Scary? Nope - Cartoony sense of funPop-Ups: None, it's top-down silly!Graphics: 7.5/10 - Cartoony and fun100% Achievements: Not easy. Requires multiple playthroughs. Definitely need some luck too for a couple.Singleplayer: N/A - Did not play by myself.Replayability: High replay value, I definitely see myself going through this game at least another time. Not to mention, there are copious amounts of scenarios to do after the main story line.Multiplayer: 10/10 - Wholeheartedly recommend playing with a friend or friends.			"

												All the fun of Diablo 3, but with better lighting, and it's easier on the computer too!The Torchlight franchise is unashamedly a Diablo clone, but, in many ways, it manages to improve on the original; the characters are a bit more flexible, the setting isn't quite so grim and dark, and the pet mechanic (improved and expanded in Torchlight 2) is a workable answer to what to do with all the low level junk you find while diving headlong into another dungeon.

												I'm done with you, Torchlight. The endless grind strain that can last for hundreds of hours if you are going for a 100% completion is exhausting. But actually very much fun! It attacks your inner masochism of loot picking and Korean-level mouse clicking. Torchlight 2 as a cheaper alternative to Diablo III gets you a lot of bang for your buck. You get a finely stylized fantasy/steampunk world, 4 playable classes with quite original skill trees and Matt Uelmen's wonderful Diablo-esque soundtrack though it's not as unique and memorable as the one in the first game. Personally, I found the story of the village of Torchlight with infinite dungeons beneath it more satisfying than the global apocalypse of this sequel though the sheer scope of the story will grant you access to big overworld areas for you to diligently explore. The game itself didn't change much. You can still send your pet to town to sell stuff, now having an option of creating a shopping list of remedies and scrolls for the pet to buy. The form of the game changed satisfyingly enough with scalable UI, customizable character appearance and many new pets. If you have a few hours to spare, this game will satisfy your questing needs with perspective.			"

												Was fun at first, then got repititive fast. Items are too clustered. A legendary/gold item in many cases will be worse than a magic or lower tier item. They need to make each tier weapon stand out more as I'm stuck with loads of legendaries that are useless.Main reason why I do not recommend this game, logged in to main character today and found my shared stash empty. All gone. Checked to see if this was a bug and yep, alot of people have this same thing and nothing will fix my loss of stash.Spent hours collecting and now they're all gone. GG.			"

This game cured my itch and need of Diablo and I have been loosing myself in hours of dungeons and leveling. Torchlight 2 is simple and fun for all ages.			"

												Torchlight II is the top fishing experience of 2012. In each town is a fishing hole where you spend most of your time. For some reason sometimes you get some junk like, a sword or boots rather than a fish. The main game entails searching through different areas to find hidden fishing holes. they have a limited amount of uses per hole and don't really hold any new fish so I guess the enjoyment is supposed to come from just finding these holes. One annoying thing is that weird animals attacks you and try to stop you from reaching fishing holes. It would make sense if they were competitors but they just don't fit in the game at all. You can get through those things easier if you use the junk you get while fishing and there some random abilities your character can learn to help. Another thing is you got this stupid animal following you around that doesn't do anything. All in all 5/10 fishing game that just focuses too much on unnecessary mechanics rather than the core gameplay.			"

												I still often play Diablo III from time to time, and to say that Diablo III and this game are the same genre, their gameplay manages to be different. I found it fine switching between the two games, so no one should refuse to buy Torchlight II because they are already playing a similar game. If you do, you will be missing out on a fantastic title. The only real negative with Torchlight II is it does nothing new to the genre. Even so, Torchlight II is one of the best examples of a dungeon raiding, isometric loot game, and should be in everyone’s Steam list if you even have the slightest urge to play an action RPG.			"

												Excellent ARPG from Runic, this wonderful title can be called the ""spiritual successor"" to the Diablo series.  Don't let the ""cartoony"" graphics fool you, this is one *serious* ARPG.  There's almost more loot than you can handle, wonderful character building, and, most importantly, multiplayer - something the previous Torchlight lacked.  Add on mod support and a low cost and you've got one of my favorite games this year.  Grab a 4-pack and slay monsters with your friends; for the price of one triple-A title you and 3 friends will have almost infinite content to keep you occupied.Pros:LOOT!Mod SupportGreat GamplayGreat SoundtrackCons:No Closed ServerIf you're looking for a closed ladder area without mods or console you'll have to look elsewhere, otherwise this is one fun and addictive gaming experience.

												One would think that after Diablo the ARPG subgenre had little to no improvement. But Torchlight 2 is the living example of the saying ""if its not broken, don´t fix it"".Innovation is not something people usually want. But when its done well, it can be incredibly satisfying. Torchlight takes the usual ARPG tropes and extends them to a mile. It´s as easy or as difficult as you want, but never unfair. Alongside with the amazing character customization makes up for an exquisite experience for veterans and a great start for novicesA game that can enjoy casual and hardcore gamers alike, even of they´re not familliar with Diablo-like titles			"

												One of the biggest problems with these Hack 'n Slash / Dungeon Crawler / Lootpocalypse games is the huge piles of loot that you (or at least I) feel compelled to lug back to town every five minutes of combat to sell. And where Dungeon Siege solved this problem with pack mules in singleplayer and ignored the problem in coop, and where Diablo 3 'solved' it by making all the junk loot worthless (people just like seeing lootsplosions, right? They don't like it for the money its worth, that would be silly!), the Torchlight games solved this with an awesome/adorable ferret with goggles that takes your unwanted gear back to town and sells it for you (and I guess they have other animals that can do the same thing or something).Besides solving the one flaw of the genre, Torchlight 2 does everything else right (or at least right enough): Online or LAN coop, ferrets with goggles, crazy explosive spell effects, ferrets with goggles, tons of cool loot, ferrets with goggles, random dungeon layouts and ferrets with goggles.As if all of that wasn't enough, they also have ferrets with goggles!

												!!! TORCHLIGHT 2 !!!Torchlight II is incredibly polished though I’ve found a few bugs here and there. It’s quite apparent that Runic spent a lot of time making sure that TL2 was ready to ship, something an independent studio has the luxury to do. It shows but there is work to be done to ironed out. To be frank, Torchlight 2 brings very little that's utterly new to the scene. It improves what’s been done before and makes it damned fun to play, definitely a saving grace. The two terrific asides to the notion above is the addition of the Random Dungeon Generator and the modding tools (even thoughThe single biggest and best improvement in Torchlight 2 is the addition of cooperative multiplayer. Runic listened to its fans after the original was released and made sure to include it in the sequel. You can tie your Steam account to your Runic account, choose the Internet option and see a lobby filled with games of all levels. Games can be named and given a password for private play or they can be open for anyone to join. As with most lobby type games, you can create a friends list and even filter games to only see games created by your buddies. In addition, games can be created that only friends can join.Sad to say, but there just inst enough good things to say about Torchlight 2, even with the minor issues it does have. It is one of the most refreshingly fun action RPGs i've played in a very long time. Its predecessor was lots of fun too, But with the addition of multiplayer, the dungeon generator and the modding tools, the series becomes something special, something different on the scene and something worthy of your time and money to play.- XeroSyphon			"

												I still often play Diablo III from time to time, and to say that Diablo III and this game are the same genre, their gameplay manages to be different. I found it fine switching between the two games, so no one should refuse to buy Torchlight II because they are already playing a similar game. If you do, you will be missing out on a fantastic title. The only real negative with Torchlight II is it does nothing new to the genre. Even so, Torchlight II is one of the best examples of a dungeon raiding, isometric loot game, and should be in everyone’s Steam list if you even have the slightest urge to play an action RPG.			"

												In the world of Torchlight 2, everything outside of your friendly camp wants you dead. That rat tribe? Wants you dead. The lizard people of the desert? Want you dead. That blob? It also wants you dead. The world is blighted and has made the monsters rampant - at least, I think that's why everything wants to kill you. Maybe the world of Torchlight 2 is just really dangerous. Maybe you need to be a hero to go down the road for the milk in the morning, to battle all the things that suddenly want you dead. Anyway, the fact that everything is a murderous fiend is great because it simplifies life. Gone are moralistic questions of whether it's OK to take a life. There's no time to think of such things when you're defending yourself against all manner of creature. Just kill! Level up! Gain skills! Torchlight 2 is a great game in the genre of click-and-kill, and adds the ingenous innovation of having a pet that goes to town and sells your stuff for you while you're out doing battle (like the first Torchlight), it's mod-friendly if that's your thing, you can play online, the graphics and style are mwa! (kissable) Way better than Diablo 3 THAT'S RIGHT IT'S WAAAAYYY BETTER! If you enjoyed the first Torchlight, you'll love this.			"

The Alchemist which was one of the main characters from the first game ended up becoming corrupt thanks to the effects of the last game's villain's heart. Now you who will play as a new character will have to hunt him down and save the world from whatever he is planning to. You'll be going through several towns, dungeons and all sorts of terrain to find the Alchemist. The storyline overall is a bit generic but the side stories and side quests and their importance plays a interesting role within the overall game.• Characters: 7/10o Characters from the first game do appear in this game but barely do you interact with them, other than that all the enemies in the game and the characters you meet afterwards are all new but do not hold much substance like other RPGs however the amount of characters especially when it comes to enemy designs is quite huge. The player themselves can also create their own character, choosing the gender, skin color, hair appearance and color amongst other tidbits though you would not probably notice a difference due to the fact the armor you get in the game would make it to where you probably would not care about how you make your character look.• GamePlay: 10/10o Torchlight 2's gameplay is very similar to Torchlight 1's with a few new additions. For one, you have the choice to play as 4 different classes: Berserker which is best for close quarters combat and has insane speed, Mechanic is which best as a support character and as a secondary attacker, Outlander which is best with long range attacks and finally Ember Mage which is the equivalent of a Wizard in TL2 which is pretty much self explanatory. Depending on what you choose for skills and equipment you can build your character up to different builds and uses such as having a offensive ember mage instead of a magic user. The user interface is very similar to TL1 which is heavily inspired by Diablo and World of Warcraft. You have access to different features in towns and throughout different dungeons such as the ability to gamble for items, power up items through enchantments (which do not break or de-enchant anymore), to fuse items. Along with that the usual item shop, weapon/armor shop, and the special item/magic shop as well. There are a lot of side quests along with the story's main quests. One of the biggest additions to the game from its predecessor is Online Multiplayer, many people have anticipated this feature and wanted so much from the first game will now get to enjoy it in this game as up to 6 players can connect to each other on TL2's public servers or make their own private server via LAN. All items are exclusive to each player, no player will see another player's item or treasure (this is to prevent any disputes for loot).• Graphics: 10/10o Torchlight 2's graphical interfaces, environment and character sprites designs are similar to the first game but further improved with using current technologies making it one of the best looking 2Dish helicopter view games ever made.• Sound: 10/10o Torchlight 2 uses voiceovers throughout the majority of the game's main storyline, there will be instances where you will hear voices from other npcs and from yourself during dungeon raids. Torchlight 2's sound effects are both a combination of new effects to the game and uses some effects from the first game. The voiceovers are pretty well done for the characters and the sound effects go nicely with the environment and during the action sequences of cutscenes and battles.• Music: 8/10o Torchlight 2 uses similar style of music that the first game used, calm soothing orchestral type music is used mostly in the game, most of the parts of the game it has that unique Star Wars like epic feeling in the background whenever you travel the terrain or go through a town conversing with the NPCs. The developers were also kind enough to allow players to actually have access to the full OST of the game via the Game's folder on the PC, so enjoy the whole OST of Torchlight 2 on your portable mp3 player.• Length: 10/10o Torchlight 2's length is possibly its second greatest aspect if not the gameplay, the game's main storyline by itself should take you no more than 20 hours and additional 5-10 hours' worth of grinding and side questing on the side. If that isnt enough, you may do multiple playthroughs with friends or with other characters to see the world of Torchlight through different experiences which of course adds massive appealing value to this aspect.• Replay Value: 10/10o One of the best things about most western games is the replay value and TL2 is no exception. The Online multiplayer experience by itself adds great value to the replay value through different experiences and difficulties available for you to choose from. Once you finish the game, you get access to a endless random dungeon which takes you to random environments so you can explore thoroughly for additional treasures and other items. Along with that to add even more value, they added a New Game+ which allows you to play the game all over again using the same character but with a more difficulty twist to the gameplay.• Player Value: 10/10o Overall Torchlight 2 expands over the first one and improves in pretty much in every way, despite some network issues it may have from time to time, players will surely enjoy the multiplayer experiences and if not they can dabble on the single player experience which like the multiplayer can be experienced through different difficulties. You have a pretty decent customization options for your characters and can easily build up any class in any possible way. The graphical details have improved from the game, the sound effects and music are kept the similar to the first game. Pretty much TL2 consists of all the good aspects of TL1 plus more.			"

												I haven't played the first Torchlight, but I have always enjoyed a good dungeon crawler and Torchlight II is so much more! If you ever enjoyed Diablo II, then Torchlight II would be in my eyes its spiritual successor! I never felt during my 80+ hours of gameplay that it was at all too grindy, unlike Diablo III which starts loosing its charm after the first playthrough and item drops (good items) are non-existent. I would thoroughly recommend this game, either as a great Single-Player game, or where it really shines; in co-op.			"

												Torchlight II is a great game, just like its predecessor. I grabbed this game on sale for $5, and would have gladly paid more for this game, it's that good.Coming from Diablo III, Torchlight II blows it out of the water. Torchlight II cost me a fraction of the price of Diablo III, and really sets the bar for the genre. If Diablo and other dungeon crawlers wish to succeed in the future, the Torchlight series is the game to beat.There's plenty to do in Torchlight II, and the random generation of the levels keeps things interesting. Personally, I did not follow the story as closely as one could've thus far, but the gameplay is phenomenal. Aside from bashing in baddies, there's lots of things to do in town. For example, the Gambler, an NPC who sells items that are only revealed to you after your purchase, is something that I sunk all of my money to almost immediately, and is one of the NPCs I make regular visits to so that I can keep trying my luck. Sometimes you get exceptionally rare items, and sometimes you lose thousands of gold, but that's the fun of it.I'd recommend this game to anyone, even at full price. If it's on sale, you have no reason not to pick it up.			"

												This game took me about 27 hours to finish, which is actually a good length. I picked the Outlander and loved her!After you complete an area of the game you can revisit them again, fight the bosses and such, because after you do a few  more dungeons the old dungeons gets rerolled. You could run the same list of dungeons, in order, over and over again if you wanted to gold farm or wanted to level from purely slaughtering stuff.Areas have random named creatures too which are like mini bosses with random abilities and a whole ton of health. When you kill a named monster you get fame which is like a secondary leveling system. Once you level this you get a skill point. Some of the names I enountered were weak while others were quite hard. A few times I faced multiple named things at the same time. Those were some good fights.Loot. Unlike other games Torchlight only has common, enchanted, magic and legendary rarity grades, which is a lot less then some games I've played. I always trashed commons and I don't recall ever using enchanted gear after I progressed a bit. Magical gear can spawn as set items which give bonuses in based off how many you have equiped of said set which is additional perks. All items have randomly rolled stats. I never played the Diablo series personally but everyone says its like that. In my mind I compare it to Borderlands though gear in Torchlight II is not as generated as robust as Borderlands. There is still a lot gear attributes to mix and match plus enchantments on weapons, set bonuses, and augments to your class/ skills. Gear all has their own models too so you will be getting new looks. At the end of the game I looked kinda ridiculous in my get-up. Each piece looked alright by themselves just it didn't go very well together.You also have town serives. Enchanting is a cool one: pay gold to get random rolls, pay gold to strip them off and reroll. Enchanters are also in the wild and offer special types of enchantments like fire or can put 3 enchantments on an item. There is a merchant where you buy items thatare complete gambles. I've gotten some GREAT stuff from him and a lot of rubbish too.Oh! Ya you have a pet and it actually does not suck. My pet was superemely helpful to me. Pets get 3 special pet gear items and 4 spell slots... there's also spells you can learn in addition to your class skills...You know what? I'm rambeling. Look it comes down to this. Torchlight II has a lot of features. A lot of enemies. A lot of areas. Tons of loot. The combat is good, balanced, well done and statisfying. I paid $2.99 for this during the summer sale of 2016 thinking I'd enjoy it some but maaaaaaan I totally understand why this game has an 'overwhelmingly positive' review. Steam points 'games like this' to Borderlands and in an odd way it is completely like that! but top down with randomly generated maps and a horbar.I enjoyed my time so much I will be playing this one again with mods. Porb the best action loot based dungeon crawl I've ever played. This one made it to my favorites list. I give Torchlight II a well deserved 5/5			"

												Absolutely awesome... A frenzied rush for loot and kills in an arcade style much like Baldur's Gate and neverwinter Nights 1 and 2.... the art is beautiful and the action is none stop. The four classes it comes with are great.. but the mods make it 1000x better... Add the Far East mod and you get 12+ balanced and terrific funclasses and new pets. I also added the Lectric Engineer and the Beholder pet mods... ok time to explode some bad guys..			"

												O jogo tem boa atmosfera, boa jogabilidade e muito bom co-op. Além disso, existe uma boa variedade de monstros, itens e habilidades que completam a boa experiência do jogo.Entretanto, a história é um pouco vaga e confusa, a atuação de voz é pobre e, como todo hack'n'slash, o jogo é repetitivo. Basicamente, quem gostou de Diablo 2 DEVE comprar Torchlight 2. Foram praticamente os mesmos desenvolvedores, então o jogo é sim divertido.			"

												I still often play Diablo III from time to time, and to say that Diablo III and this game are the same genre, their gameplay manages to be different. I found it fine switching between the two games, so no one should refuse to buy Torchlight II because they are already playing a similar game. If you do, you will be missing out on a fantastic title. The only real negative with Torchlight II is it does nothing new to the genre. Even so, Torchlight II is one of the best examples of a dungeon raiding, isometric loot game, and should be in everyone’s Steam list if you even have the slightest urge to play an action RPG.			"

												It has been several years since I have finished a game (SP) from start to finish. I typically get bored somewhere along the way and walk away. Not so with Torchlight II. I have just loved this game. And I am not much of a ARPG fan, but this game just clicked for me. The skill trees and leveling system are cool with many options. Although I had no clue what I was doing with them, it was a great time trying to figure it out. The story is okay -- enough to stay engaged -- but the combat system is fun and easy. Just love it. I might even play through again with a new class. Played Engineer class first time through.			"

Posted: July 6, 2016
												Fishing Simulator Steam Sale 2016I wanted to have my first review for something I could write fairly, not too biased, not too unknowing. Torchlight II I think fits this description.There are a few cons to Torchlight II, but they do get overthrown fairly easily with this game. So let's start with the bad.|Cons|Bugs - Yes, bugs. Not the ones you'll be killing in game or transforming your pet into either. For how long this game has been out, I was surprised to have an almost game breaking bug happen in multiplayer whenever I levelled up. My partner I was playing with would be disconnected whenever I would level. This happened for about 25 levels in game. If became a joke about having to save a million times as I was getting closer to leveling up, but it was still extremely annoying. It could've been a mod we have installed, but it has since fixed itself and said mod is still there and hasn't been updated. Pet AI - Not the greatest thing sometimes. Many times have I had a pet get stuck in a corner and not be able to move until I go back and essentially force him to move the opposite direction and then slowly walk around the corner it was getting stuck on. This doesn't happen often, but it still is a bit annoying.Fishing Time - However much I love the fishing, I hate how sometimes I can catch one in less than 3 seconds and other times I have to wait almost 20 for the circle to go grey. It adds a bit to the immersion of fish don't all bite immediately or the same, but it's still a bit of a hassle sometimes, especially to get that covetted cheevo of fishing 1000 times. Voices - I can honestly say, I don't know much about the story of the game because I can't be bothered listening to the bad voice actors of the game. Yes I can read the story, but it's more fun to just click and get back to hitting things with my sword. Truth be told though, I have a really hard time sitting there reading something when they just add massive reverb to everybody important to make them sound like a ghost or the lack of enthusiasm in most of the character's voices. Now for what we really came here for... the good stuff...|Pros|Multiplayer - Yes, it sounds crazy, a dungeon crawler Diabloesque game without multiplayer? It happened... before I bought it... hence why I have it now and not then. Great game to play multiplayer. Loot System - If you're like me and don't like playing single player with dungeon crawler games, then you'll love the loot system. No dashing in to steal everything and then break friendships for life because you Tanked and did all the damage to said boss and friend runs in and grabs your legendary class drop and wont give it to you... FML for all the times that happened. Instead, everybody has their own loot drops. Wonderful system to have and keeping friends together since 2012.Pets - Although the pet AI can stink sometimes, it's great having something to kill with. Great for tanking or ranged DPS, pets can do almost anything you can. Seriously, you can even give them spells that they can cast. It's great. There's a huge variety you can ""transform"" them into as well for times ranging from 5 minutes to inifite. Fishing - Again, I had my hate on for fishing earlier, but only because I have done it so much and spent hours into just sitting there in town and doing the nasty... gutting a half dead fish. 60+ bucks to sell in store or great buffs for you. Can even have your pets transform from them. Giants are a pain to get, only about 1 in 150 fishing, but still great.Mods - THANK GAWD for mods. Makes the game greater than it already is. Not as many as I would like to see, but still a great amount. It's awesome seeing a modding community that's still active with a 4 year old game (at time of posting this review... 2016).|Final Thoughts|This is the game I feel Diablo should try to take over and implement into their already decent system. It's brighter than Diablo, but I think that goes without saying. This is a great game overall and even better with friends. Do I recommend buying it for CAD $21.99? If you have a friend to play with, then yes. If you're alone, I would wait until this puppy goes on sale.|Final Score|Graphics 8.5/10Stability 6/10Sound 9/10Voices 4/10Replay Value 9.5/10Fun 9/10Overall With Voices 7.5/10True Overall 8.5/1010/10 Would fish again			"

												Torchlight II is one of the best ARPG's of its time. It's hours upon hours of hack and slash adventure that will keep you coming back for more. It's great because you can try different characters each time you play to see which one you like the best or maybe just because you want to beat the game with all of them.Multiplayer is also a lot of fun because you actually get to go on adventures together and you can chat while you do it.So, if you like endless skills, adventure, and hack and slash goodness, this game is definitely for you! VERY much worth the money.			"

												My first gaming experience was given by an RPG, back then (1999), a curious 7 year old me didn't know that much about what it was or what it represented, but I liked it and wanted to know more and more about it...why does it die if I click on it ? why does stuff drop from it after it dies ? back then I thought most of them just go to sleep after they stop interacting with you, but after seeing the first blood pool I soon realized that wasn't the case. Growing up with the golden age of '90s cartoon from CN, you start to understand pretty quickly when something is what it is, and not something else, if it doesn't want to be something else that is. Back to the game, I came back to it again and again as the years passed, understanding more and more about it, until one day I got to finish it and said to myself, ""this was nice, but is it the best ? "". A few more years passed and the first news of Torchlight started to appear in gaming magazines and online media, so of course I liked a reimagining of the first game that made me love gaming. This time though, we're talking about Torchlight 2, and how it improved on the initial formula, keeping the main cast from the first game, and making them a part of the story in T2. I personally love this game, and have played it quite a while before buying it on steam. I think everyone should have a go at this game, not because it's fun, not because it's cartoonish, not even because it's a great experience, but because it's that type of game that can really show you the amount of dedication the people who made it managed to put into something that you can't even hold in your hand; from the artwork, to the soundtrack, animations, and even the small things, like fishing and moving boards away to find loot, this game shows that true dedication isn't something only present in the first title, but something that can and is transmuted in time, from one game to the next. That and the fact that I can never get tired of seeing my panda pet get on two legs and start fisticuffing from the largest to the smallest enemy. :)Also the modding community did a great job making the game more diverse and fitting to the likes of everyone.In the end, my initial review for Torchlight 2 still stands, but I just felt like some back story would make it more recognizable to some of you gamers that are like me, and enjoy playing a game that shows of the dedication of some amazing people. So to conclude, T2, great RPG experience form the creators of Diablo 1 and 2. :)			"

												I remember the day when I had bought this game when it was on a Steam sale. I had a couple of dollars left and I wanted to spend the money on something that interested me. I had bought Torchlight II and haven't touched it for quite some time, since I was not an active Steam user back then. When I first played it, I immediately regretted not playing this sooner.Torchlight II is, to put in the simplest words, an amazing game. The product is a highly polished game with many surprises hidden around every corner.  The world is randomly generated every time you start a new character/start New Game+ on an existing character so every experience will be a highly unique one. The game really gets to the point; you can immediately delve into the fun of clicking on monsters and annihilating them with your weapons/skills.As is said in many other reviews, the story is definitely lacking. I had attempted to follow the story when I first started playing but ended up not caring for the story at all. If you are into an RPG with a rich story, this game is not for you.Gameplay-wise, this game tops it all. You'll be mashing your number hotkeys and your mouse trying to rid of the monsters trying to swarm you. There are many random traps and surprises lurking in every dungeon and area you face. The skills for each character are also special and will leave you wanting to upgrade all your skills. As said before, each dungeon and area is randomly generated, providing a unique experience everytime you play. You will feel a great sense of accomplishment as you finally knock out the final boss of the game. This then leads to the Mapworks, which you can buy with your in-game currency and play special dungeons. Or you can start up NG+ and start your whole adventure again, keep all your character stats but buffing all item drops and monsters.All in all, Torchlight II is definitely a game that anyone should check out, even if you do not like RPGs. This game is a must-have on anyone's game list.			"

												I've never been a hard-core fan of this type of games. Sure, I liked playing Diablo for a while (can't even remember if it was the first or the second on the series), but nothing more than that. When Diablo 3 came out, I saw the game and couldn't really figure out what all the fuss was about. Sure, the game looked good, but nothing more. So when a friend tried to convince me to get both the Torchlight games (I & II), I politely dismissed the idea and moved on, thinking that if Diablo 3 didn't get me excited, no other similar games would either. It took me a while to change my mind and try Torchlight 1. Didn't like it much, I suppose because it was already a while after its expiry date for new players. After another cooldown period, I decided I'd give this series another chance, this time with the newer and shinier sequel. I suppose it's pretty obvious by now, that this is where I got pulled in. While I can't compare Torchlight II to Diablo 3 (mainly because I haven't given Diablo 3 a decent chance), I can say that by itself, Torchlight II is a lot of fun to play. The graphics are cool, the animations are clean and smooth, the story and quests are interesting and the controls are very easy and intuitive.The only drawback this game has, in my opinion, is the tedious gear system. While I do enjoy the complexity of it, I feel like it takes up a bigger part of the game than it should have. Sometimes it feels like I'm being spammed with gear and loot, and can't concentrate on anything else.Despite that one disadvantage, I think this game is great. I recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.			"

												This is a very fun game. It similar to Diablo but it a cheaper version of Diablo. The skills are great, the sound effect they did it very well, and the graphic.....well it not that bad. A lot of good loot and there are pets too which also a good thing. And the gameplay is pretty good. This is like a game for anyone who wanna try Diablo but just don't had enough money.			"

												I played Diablo 3 when it first came out and after completing the game it then got very repetitive and it just got boring very quickly, it was my first game as a Hack and Slash style, after searching for games of a similar style i bought Torchlight 2 because it was on sale so I didn't have much to lose. I had the game in my library for a while and only just started playing it but wow it is such a good game, the style of graphics and the gameplay is very addictive and loads of fun and i expect many more hours to come from playing this game			"

												In my opinion, the aspect where Torchlight II really shines is the UI(User Interface), that makes you truly enjoy the experience, making the game feel smooth. Besides that, we can see a mix of: good visual style, large customization options, decent gameplay and decent multiplayer. I definetly recomend it, but i understand why some people dislike it: the core gameplay is just ""click on monsters see them die"" lol, and its really just a matter of ""i like or i dislike that"" . You will have to see it for yourself if you never player a game like this one or Diablo, but its at least worth giving a shot :)			"

												Kill monsters, complete quests, gain levels, fame, gold, and magic items.Torchlight II is a fun ARPG. You have 4 classes available, each class has 3 skill trees.Don't let the cheerful character art fool you. This game is as tactical as any other arpg (think Titan Quest) with skill management and equipment optimization needed for survival. The interface is pretty simple, click to move, click to attack. You can make it more in-depth (and efficient) by utilizing keyboard shortcuts and shift clicks.Leveling up gives attribute points and skill points. Some skills are really only useful for the first point investment. There are plenty of good builds out there. I recommend looking one up so you can build a better character.Your characters gets a pet. It's a decently useful feature. It's almost like Two-Flower's luggage from Color of Magic. It carries stuff and attacks your enemies. You don't have to walk back to town to sell off loot, you can send you pet to do that. You can also teach your pet spells.The main quest can be completed relatively quickly, but even after you finish you can replay on a harder mode. You could also try playing a different class. Also, even after completing the main quest, you do have an option to do some dungeon crawling hack and slash maps.Overall this game is pretty fun.			"

												90% Similar to the popular game series Fate, but this is a good thing! If you like point and click 3rd person view RPG games, then you've come to the right game! 4 main classes to choose from, infinite amount of items, and a lots of quests. Normal is pretty easy to get by so if you're used to RPGs then I would put it at the next highest setting. Haven't tried multiplayer yet nor workshop but I can't wait to! I got this game for $4 and it's so worth the $4. CAUTION: Lots of combat with lesser enemies (basically grinding) involved! Play this game if you have a good few hours to burn!Rating: 8.7/10			"

												I've never been a hard-core fan of this type of games. Sure, I liked playing Diablo for a while (can't even remember if it was the first or the second on the series), but nothing more than that. When Diablo 3 came out, I saw the game and couldn't really figure out what all the fuss was about. Sure, the game looked good, but nothing more. So when a friend tried to convince me to get both the Torchlight games (I & II), I politely dismissed the idea and moved on, thinking that if Diablo 3 didn't get me excited, no other similar games would either. It took me a while to change my mind and try Torchlight 1. Didn't like it much, I suppose because it was already a while after its expiry date for new players. After another cooldown period, I decided I'd give this series another chance, this time with the newer and shinier sequel. I suppose it's pretty obvious by now, that this is where I got pulled in. While I can't compare Torchlight II to Diablo 3 (mainly because I haven't given Diablo 3 a decent chance), I can say that by itself, Torchlight II is a lot of fun to play. The graphics are cool, the animations are clean and smooth, the story and quests are interesting and the controls are very easy and intuitive.The only drawback this game has, in my opinion, is the tedious gear system. While I do enjoy the complexity of it, I feel like it takes up a bigger part of the game than it should have. Sometimes it feels like I'm being spammed with gear and loot, and can't concentrate on anything else.Despite that one disadvantage, I think this game is great. I recommend it to anyone who likes this genre.			"

												Torchlight II takes everything that made the first game so much fun, and basically improves on it in every way. The classes are better, the loot is better, the pets are better, the UI is better, and the entire design of the game world is much better. It has more of a Zelda feel with its overworld and underworld settings, and this brings a much richer, more varied feel to the experience when compared to the first game. If you like this type of game, Torchlight II is one of the best out there. For $20, it's a steal.			"

												Overall it was a fun hack and slash, Diablo style game. Like the borderlands games, I would recommend that you play this game cooperatively with friends. If you played the first Torchlight game, the second is much more polished and fun to play. If it goes on sale, order some pizza and drinks, grab some friends, and pool some money together for the 4-pack and have a good time. Pros:-Good color color pallet choices for the cartoony art style-All classes felt unique and fun, all were very viable in single player and multiplayer (a huge improvement from Torchlight 1) [seriously, this felt like one of the best class balances I've had in a long time]-Compared to Torchlight 1, there was improved UI customizations, runspeed/navigation tweaks, etc. (generally more user friendly and comfortable to do various things)-The music choices were generally decent (though I haven't played in a while and may not remember this aspect the best)Cons:-Storyline was sparse, but was functional/adequate. There weren't nearly as many cutscenes as I thought there would be or would have liked there to be. The written dialogue wasn't very engrossing, but it set the premise for the character actions in the game. -If you liked the darker/grittier visual styles of Diablo, Path of Exile, or The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, the cartoony artstyle may be offputting to you "

												It has been several years since I have finished a game (SP) from start to finish. I typically get bored somewhere along the way and walk away. Not so with Torchlight II. I have just loved this game. And I am not much of a ARPG fan, but this game just clicked for me. The skill trees and leveling system are cool with many options. Although I had no clue what I was doing with them, it was a great time trying to figure it out. The story is okay -- enough to stay engaged -- but the combat system is fun and easy. Just love it. I might even play through again with a new class. Played Engineer class first time through.			"

Posted: July 6, 2016
												Fishing Simulator Steam Sale 2016I wanted to have my first review for something I could write fairly, not too biased, not too unknowing. Torchlight II I think fits this description.There are a few cons to Torchlight II, but they do get overthrown fairly easily with this game. So let's start with the bad.|Cons|Bugs - Yes, bugs. Not the ones you'll be killing in game or transforming your pet into either. For how long this game has been out, I was surprised to have an almost game breaking bug happen in multiplayer whenever I levelled up. My partner I was playing with would be disconnected whenever I would level. This happened for about 25 levels in game. If became a joke about having to save a million times as I was getting closer to leveling up, but it was still extremely annoying. It could've been a mod we have installed, but it has since fixed itself and said mod is still there and hasn't been updated. Pet AI - Not the greatest thing sometimes. Many times have I had a pet get stuck in a corner and not be able to move until I go back and essentially force him to move the opposite direction and then slowly walk around the corner it was getting stuck on. This doesn't happen often, but it still is a bit annoying.Fishing Time - However much I love the fishing, I hate how sometimes I can catch one in less than 3 seconds and other times I have to wait almost 20 for the circle to go grey. It adds a bit to the immersion of fish don't all bite immediately or the same, but it's still a bit of a hassle sometimes, especially to get that covetted cheevo of fishing 1000 times. Voices - I can honestly say, I don't know much about the story of the game because I can't be bothered listening to the bad voice actors of the game. Yes I can read the story, but it's more fun to just click and get back to hitting things with my sword. Truth be told though, I have a really hard time sitting there reading something when they just add massive reverb to everybody important to make them sound like a ghost or the lack of enthusiasm in most of the character's voices. Now for what we really came here for... the good stuff...|Pros|Multiplayer - Yes, it sounds crazy, a dungeon crawler Diabloesque game without multiplayer? It happened... before I bought it... hence why I have it now and not then. Great game to play multiplayer. Loot System - If you're like me and don't like playing single player with dungeon crawler games, then you'll love the loot system. No dashing in to steal everything and then break friendships for life because you Tanked and did all the damage to said boss and friend runs in and grabs your legendary class drop and wont give it to you... FML for all the times that happened. Instead, everybody has their own loot drops. Wonderful system to have and keeping friends together since 2012.Pets - Although the pet AI can stink sometimes, it's great having something to kill with. Great for tanking or ranged DPS, pets can do almost anything you can. Seriously, you can even give them spells that they can cast. It's great. There's a huge variety you can ""transform"" them into as well for times ranging from 5 minutes to inifite. Fishing - Again, I had my hate on for fishing earlier, but only because I have done it so much and spent hours into just sitting there in town and doing the nasty... gutting a half dead fish. 60+ bucks to sell in store or great buffs for you. Can even have your pets transform from them. Giants are a pain to get, only about 1 in 150 fishing, but still great.Mods - THANK GAWD for mods. Makes the game greater than it already is. Not as many as I would like to see, but still a great amount. It's awesome seeing a modding community that's still active with a 4 year old game (at time of posting this review... 2016).|Final Thoughts|This is the game I feel Diablo should try to take over and implement into their already decent system. It's brighter than Diablo, but I think that goes without saying. This is a great game overall and even better with friends. Do I recommend buying it for CAD $21.99? If you have a friend to play with, then yes. If you're alone, I would wait until this puppy goes on sale.|Final Score|Graphics 8.5/10Stability 6/10Sound 9/10Voices 4/10Replay Value 9.5/10Fun 9/10Overall With Voices 7.5/10True Overall 8.5/1010/10 Would fish again			"

It's great because you can try different characters each time you play to see which one you like the best or maybe just because you want to beat the game with all of them.Multiplayer is also a lot of fun because you actually get to go on adventures together and you can chat while you do it.So, if you like endless skills, adventure, and hack and slash goodness, this game is definitely for you!

												This is probably the only game that I had installed since the very beginning and I haven't yet uninstalled, because I keep coming back over and over to this game. Why, you may ask... Well, the reason is simple: MODS. The vanilla version of this game is very enjoyable, runs perfectly, looks good, can last for quite a bit, but what makes this game truly shine is the mod support.Even now, more than 3 years after the release of the game, mods are released and they keep the game refreshing. I am talking about mods that change difficulty, UI, loots, add classes and anything you can imagine in between, making an already great game, even greater.Absolutely recommended, don't let this little gem escape your steam library.

												Torchlight II is one of those ARPGs that comes along and does almost everything right. I don't think I can really sit here and list all the ""quality of life"" improvements added for the sake of streamlined gameplay that doesn't insult the consumer's intelligence. This is a solid game that's going to be relevant for a long time, especially with Salan's Synergies Mod. Seriously, that guy is doing god's work, keeping people coming back for more. Anyway, Torchlight II is your traditional ARPG that brings a lot to the table compared to first installment. All while paralelling Diablo and Diablo II. The original heroes are present in cameos with new classes taking on the mantle in a larger setting across four chapters. Each said class breaks the mold compared to Diablo II with different ability combinations that can make for some interesting builds. Some more viable than others, but you'll rarely see an ""I Win"" build that dominates over all. The pet is still present, allowing you to sell your junk and even pick up supplies for you to keep you focused on the action with minimal town visits. In fact, the pet is a bit more useful with its own equipment and fish you can use to transform it to other creatures, all with different stats and special attacks or simply buffs to compliment your strategy.The settings are more vast this time, taking you across different continents, all with sidequests or hidden dungeons to explore. Socketing, gems, and skulls are still present. This time with a crafting system. You can of course merge like gems together for more powerful ones. But you can also mix/match them to generate random shards/gems with different ability sets within their theme. Plus you can do the same with items and gear, creating different rare armors/weapons, or stronger potions. Most of it is trial and error based, but part of the fun is the expiremntation. Stats and skills are thankfully spelled out in a detailed tooltip. You know what to expect from what you invest in almost down to the modifier that dictates is effectiveness. No more guessing on what stats or gear is essential, but it doesn't hold your hand either as you can play around with what primary stat you want to focus on as a modifier. Vitality is a bit useless if you're not a shield user, sadly, but socketing makes up for it. Combat is fluid, satisfying, and an excellent sense of impact. Whether you're laying waste to everything in your path with spells, sniping things from a range, swinging a giant weapon, or quickly shredding everything one by one with blinding speed, there's a sense of satisfaction to what you're doing and different gauges for each class to reward you for your relentlessness. Online gameplay is going to be hit or miss at this point. The net code is solid, but with modding and vanilla sepparated, it splits the community down the middle. At least from my point of view since I did multiplayer pre-GUTS. Now, you might have trouble finding people online, depending on your time zone. Good thing there's an offline mode too. (Obligatory jab at Diablo III)I highly reccomend Torchlight II. Not only to ARPG fans, but anyone curious about the genre as it's a great place to start. Play alone, play with friends, or make new friends while playing. More than worth the full price easily. Mod it until it crashes.			"

												After the advent of Diablo came the copies and the knock-offs. We all know of them. HOWEVER, I am very happy to announce that Torchlight II is better then any of the Diablo games out there. This can be explained with several things: 1) Torchlight II accomplishes immersion without having to rely on a very dark universe, thus making it more accesible to all types of players2) Torchlight II has some very interesting class design ideas that allow both flexibility and hardcore focus3) The combat is frantic but meaningful, every movement means something ( dodging this spell, zoning this enemy, etc.)4) The items (especially the unique items) provide sustainance for the treasure-hunter hidden deep in all of usI could go on and on... but I wont because I would rather you try Torchlight II out, rather than continue reading a fanboys shameless confession.ENVOY RATED: 10/10			"

												This is probably the only game that I had installed since the very beginning and I haven't yet uninstalled, because I keep coming back over and over to this game. Why, you may ask... Well, the reason is simple: MODS. The vanilla version of this game is very enjoyable, runs perfectly, looks good, can last for quite a bit, but what makes this game truly shine is the mod support.Even now, more than 3 years after the release of the game, mods are released and they keep the game refreshing. I am talking about mods that change difficulty, UI, loots, add classes and anything you can imagine in between, making an already great game, even greater.Absolutely recommended, don't let this little gem escape your steam library.

												Torchlight II is one of those ARPGs that comes along and does almost everything right. I don't think I can really sit here and list all the ""quality of life"" improvements added for the sake of streamlined gameplay that doesn't insult the consumer's intelligence. This is a solid game that's going to be relevant for a long time, especially with Salan's Synergies Mod. Seriously, that guy is doing god's work, keeping people coming back for more. Anyway, Torchlight II is your traditional ARPG that brings a lot to the table compared to first installment. All while paralelling Diablo and Diablo II. The original heroes are present in cameos with new classes taking on the mantle in a larger setting across four chapters. Each said class breaks the mold compared to Diablo II with different ability combinations that can make for some interesting builds. Some more viable than others, but you'll rarely see an ""I Win"" build that dominates over all. The pet is still present, allowing you to sell your junk and even pick up supplies for you to keep you focused on the action with minimal town visits.

												Torchlight II is truly a great ARPG.  The base game contains hundreds of hours of game play.  Then there are challenges galore to seek!  The multiplayer is spot on with low latency game play and tons of loot.  You can have fun playing with friends or total strangers in Torchlight II.  There are randomized maps so the fun never gets stale.  And lots of difficulty mods with the option to reroll your character and start all over again!Then there is full Steam Workshop mod support.  You can alter the game into any fashion that you want.  Want to try a full set of badass armor?  You can enable it.  Want more maps?  It's there!  Want a pet that's not in the base game?  There's a mod for it.  Hell you can create it if you like!  This is truly a great game that should be in your Steam Library.  It has way more content than Diablo 3 developers could dream of in a thousand years because of the dedicated modders out there.  And it all runs seamlessly without bugs.  The code for this game is airtight!What are you waiting for?  Get Torchlight II today!			"

												If you are looking for a super deep, difficult, and story rich ARPG then this isn't the game for you. This game is great for a casual ARPG you can play to relax. The visuals are really nice, they convey this interesting world well, I really like this stylized look. All the classes are pretty interesting, they are similar to what you would expect from these classes but they have a unique twist to them. (with minor exception of the embermage, he's exactly what you expect) I like to play this game when I'm a bit tired of the unrelenting darkness and difficulty of things like grim dawn, but still want a fun ARPG. This game can be a bit difficult at times, don't expect to be able to waltz around and slaughter every enemy easily, but it's not nearly as bad as other games. If you like this genre of games at all then I highly recommend this.			"

As for me, the reason to this is a very user-friendly interface, a lot of ways to make your life easier and comfortable (e.g. a pet, big inventory, etc.) and the great understanding of what makes Diablo-style games so addictive: building your character up.Great game, recommended to every oldschool Diablo fans.

												Builds upon the first Torchlight game in every way.Played on Windows 7, iMac (2009) Yosemite, and Linux Mint 17.3. Runs great on all three OSes.PROS:+4 distinct, versatile, and fun-to-play character classes: Outlander (ranged), Berserker (melee), Ember Mage (mage), and Engineer (heavy weapons and support team).+Wider range of Pets, which will assist in battle, sell off unwanted loot, purchase needed potions, and can be taught spells.+HUGE open world, composed of three main areas and tons of side-quests and unlockable areas.+Looters' paradise. Loot is diverse and plentiful. Loot can also be sold or traded when playing online.+Fun in single player, with alot of replay value beyond the initial playthrough via NG+.+Online co-op with up to 4 other players.+Enemy types are extremely varied, cool looking, and fun to battle.+Gorgeous graphics and an inviting visual aesthetic.+Windows, Mac, and Linux versions available.+Very modest hardware requirements, especially considering the amount of content in TL2.+A steal at only $20, and often on sale for even less.CONS:-Weak story. -Online co-op isn't as streamlined as other online RPGs.

												Well, this review is not for those who like this kind of RPGs. Rather, I would pen it down for those few like me who usually hate top down. Well, I love action RPGs - fallout 3, Fallout New Vegas and Skyrim are the among the best single player experiences I can remember. But when it comes to top down, I just used to have a scorn for the genre.I tried diablo 3, torchlight and torchlight 2 (a torchlight fan) at a friend's house long back. I hated it and never looked towards it for months to come. It is accidentally that I had some $4.00 in my wallet and TL2 was on sale that I purchased it. I wanted to try it again, even though I was 99% sure it won't appeal me.I was wrong. The game is GREAT. But to realize its greatness, there are three things you must keep in mind:- Don't think that you are playing an action game. There is very little skill of swiftness on mouse and keyboard required in this game. So, definitely not an action game.- Play it for at least 15 hours, level up to level 25 and then judge.... things keep on adding, new skills start appearing, interesting scrolls begin dropping out of chests and skilled monsters... it is then that you understand how amazing this game is.- If you are dying more, it is not that you are not able to deliver enough clicks-per-second, it just means that each of the clicks has an ignorantly cascaded set of skills behind it. So, activate the right skills and wear the right armor. I started learning new things about the mechanics when I was 3 hours into the game and am learning totally new things till now (e.g. For torchlight 2 players - sets of armor... the purple thing written in some armor's description... something I learnt at mty 29th hour).I played the game for 15 hours on normal, realized that I was very ignorant about the game's mechanics, deleted my character, started a veteran character and adorned it with better perks this time... continuing with it.... glad that I started the game again..HAPPY GAMING!

Even if you don't like adding anything special to the game, Torchlight 2 has enough to keep you hooked as you play through the Acts trying to get to the ultimate battle and endless dungeons. 3 skills trees in each class allows for diverse builds and you can try them all out making each play through a different feel as one class may be a good tank, but another you may have to kite with to get by, and if you want more classes, just download a mod and go!

												Mechanically, Torchlight II is a fine Diablo 2 clone, and is loads more fun than Diablo 3.  That said, though, it never quite makes enough of an effort to advance the genre, and it sticks a little too close to Diablo 2's formula for comfort.  A little more originality in its storyline, areas, and plot, and this could have been great.  As it stands, it's a decent, unspectacular loot-driven romp.			"

												Now here is a game that hold's truer to the Diablo franchise that many so loved. With the ability to add community mods to your gameplay, Torchlight 2 has many hours of endless play available to any and all who are willing to put the time in. Even if you don't like adding anything special to the game, Torchlight 2 has enough to keep you hooked as you play through the Acts trying to get to the ultimate battle and endless dungeons. 3 skills trees in each class allows for diverse builds and you can try them all out making each play through a different feel as one class may be a good tank, but another you may have to kite with to get by, and if you want more classes, just download a mod and go!

												Mechanically, Torchlight II is a fine Diablo 2 clone, and is loads more fun than Diablo 3.  That said, though, it never quite makes enough of an effort to advance the genre, and it sticks a little too close to Diablo 2's formula for comfort.  A little more originality in its storyline, areas, and plot, and this could have been great.  As it stands, it's a decent, unspectacular loot-driven romp.			"

												Albiet a tad clunky, Torchlight II remains on par with other dungeon crawler-esque games. Fun to play solo or with friends. One of the better aspects of the game include the ability to send the player's pet into town to sell and/or buy items so the hero(ine) can continue the hack-and-slash.			"

												A great RPG that I could recommend to anyone.Torchlight II is an absolutely gigantic game with tons of possibilities. There are 4 different classes which all have their strenghts and weaknesses. Each class has 3 different skill trees which contain both passive and active skills. Most skills require you to be a pretty high level though, so getting your desired skills and have them at a high rank will definitely take you some time.The levels in Torchlight are huge! They are filled with lots of enemies, NPCs and objects that will have you fighting and exploring for a while. After you've completed the game, you have the chance to play a few bonus maps with various buffs and de-buffs or you can decide to play the game over again with the same character, but with the enemies adjusted to your current character level.There's also a big variety of weapons in the game. Melee weapons like staves, spears, axes, swords and ranged weapons like crossbows, guns and wands. Some classes have skills in their skill tree that allows you to increase your proficiency with a certain weapon type. Torchlight II has an added workshop which allows you to make use of the many mods that are made for this game. Mods can add different characters, game mechanics or even more weapons like throwing axes, throwing knives and claws.All of that said, I can definitely recommend Torchlight II to anyone that is into Hack and Slash RPGs. Prepare for hours of fun and tons of achievements to unlock!			"

												This game is just neat - it can be a Sunday hack'n'slash passtime, and it can be a real grinder. I am happy I finally have a computer I can play T2 with ease, as I spend many hours with it's prequel and was quite hyped to play this one.I love the multum of possibilities of seemingly narrow range of heroes, and I'm all about doing those hybrid characters.Two things are a big minus to me: firstly, building a successful summoner class takes quite a lot of time in higher difficulty modes. Secondly, Act III monsters are just cheap (besides the epic boss fights) and take away much of the lore's momentum - so if you feel doubts in Act III, keep pushing until You reach those Dwarven ruins. Either way, I think it's very easy to ommit how wonderful of a universe Torchlight has, with it's little details that can slip your attention if you play too fast. It's a lore very prone to development and alteration, and I'm also happy to see some very lore-friendly mods.Awesome game worth a recommendation!			"

												A Fun action RPG game... If you enjoyed Diablo II, you'll almost certainly enjoy Torchlight as well.The only real con I can think is that it can take a while for your character build to ""come online"". i.e.: it takes a few levels for you to have a good selection of cool skills and gear, but once you do, the game is really very fun for anyone who enjoys the genre. Fortunately, it doesn't take long to level up, specially in the early game.			"

												It is inevitable to compare this game to Blizzard's hack 'n slash RPG. I would say this would be the poor-man's version of Diablo III, but the truth of the matter is Torchlight II holds it's ground and could even be considered a better game overall, depending on what you're looking for.Torchlight II brings better loot, better progressions system, mob variety and arguably a better 'end-game'. The only two thing it lacks, compared to Diablo III, is the graphical fidelity (although since the game is done in a cartoonish art-style, it is not immediately noticable) and story.While Torchlight II manages to win points in the atmosphere department, the story of the Diablo universe offers a much more expanded lore and world to explore. Voice acting, cinematics and sound design are far better than what Torchlight II has. Which is to be expected from a series that started it's roots in indie gaming. Experience sharing in multiplayer could use some tweaking, but loot is instanced for every player and trading is fully functional for all items you find. A big plus for the game is also mod support, something which Diablo III lacks. The Steam Workshop is sure to increase the life-span of the game, and enchance the experience according to your taste buds.Despite some of it's shortcomings, it is still one of the better hack 'n slash RPGs out there. Definitely worth your time!			"

												Torchlight II is a really good game, but not a great game. It has an endearing art-style that's easy on the eyes, and the gameplay is addictive enough to keep you playing 'till the end (I played about 50 hours by the time I beat it). However, there is nothing about this game that is exceptional or raises the bar. The story isn't deep or engaging, and the world lacks depth. Had the developers expanded the towns and added sub characters to strengthen the plot, then this game could have been a bench mark. The loot drops are well-balanced and look decent, the world is visually appealing, even interesting in some places, and the monsters are well-designed. But beyond the relentless grind, there's nothing much motivating you to keep collecting and throwing away loot 'till the next boss fight, except more loot and boss fights, that is. If you're just looking for a game to help you pass the time without being bored, then it does its job well, but don't expect an engaging story to justify the 50+ hours you may waste playing it. In the end, I feel like I got my money's worth, but only based on what I already kind of expected.			"

												Many dungeon crawlers pride themselves on lootporn. Runic Games realises it's nice to also package in an actual game with your Excel sheet, and manages to build an inviting world with a responsive and satisfying combat system.The game's story is one of tragic desperation, told across 4 acts, and while I won't spoil anything I suggest you not play this for its storyline, as it doesn't go far nor deep. Don't mistake this for a lack of charm though, as each of the game's environments are colourful and varied. From bright shining deserts to gloomy forests and snowy ... cold places. My eyes were never bored.The four classes available in the game all have their distinctive styles, but also allow for a large amount of customisation on the player's part. Many different active abilities are available to choose from, which translates to many different ways to play. Within the admittedly limited amount of classes I can almost guarantee anyone will find a build they're comfortable with. A minor point against this is that respeccing is not available in the base game. Modding rectifies this.Which brings me to my next point: The players. This game has an abundance of that whole consumer-friendliness our industry seems to relish in not caring about. You want mod support? It's in there, ranging from the smallest of tweaks to total conversions. Always online DRM? Don't be so daft, play offline if you like and have a lovely experience. What about LAN? Yeah, LAN support is in, go nuts. Also note the apparent lack of any microtransactions or locked-behind-paywalls DLC. The point I'm trying to make is that if you take the direction of the industry into account when you're considering a purchase, this is definitely not the worst option available.Lastly, I should point you to its price. This game doesn't exactly break the bank compared to most other releases of this scope. HowLongToBeat.com lists the average main story completion takes around 20 hours, that's not counting the side quests in the field, extra dungeons, mapworks (endgame dungeons) or New Game Plus mode.So what have we got? A 20ish hour flat story with a pleasing coat of paint, well flowing and varied options for combat, single- online- and LAN play and excellent mod support packed into what is a relatively inexpensive game. If your interest has been piqued I highly recommend you play this game, but if you’re on the fence I suggest having a go with the free demo first.			"

												Yes, yes... This is a good game... I've yet to complete the game but I'll add more comments when I do. There are so many similarities to Diablo but so many other interesting things as well. I've listed them down in the PROS and CONS.TL2 is slightly below Diablo in terms of content quantity... 4 levels are really, really fast to finish.... But for the price, it was worth it.... I am also very annoyed with the creation of another Runic account to link to my Steam account. I would like to be able to transfer my game to another Steam account not the one I bought it with. Another pet peeve (which can't be helped) is the feeling of repetition deeper into TL2. You can see copies of Ratlings, skeletons and Brutes appearing over and over again. They just come back with a different name and different skin.$4.00 SGDPROS1. Great map designQuests and story rolled into one. Not all the quests are in the town, some are hidden away in the map, so it makes you want to explore. However, the downside is that you might miss some of these quests as you don't know where they are. E.g. Zephari Envoy2. SecretsThere are lots of interesting secret areas. One memorable one was ""It puts the lotion in the bucket"" (obvious reference to Silence of the Lambs). I shouldn't spoil how to do it but let's just say it will be interesting to find the lotion.3. Skill treesI like the way you can upgrade your skills and that there are so many skills to work with, per character. Each skill is tiered into T1, T2, T3 with a special upgrade at each tier. There are a lot of way to play your character.4. Semi-Live NPCsThe NPCs give you information on current events which are related to your quests and they don't function purely as lamp posts. I think they could have made it better by making the NPCs come alive even more though.5. Train TravelAlthough a cut-scene, it was cool. I was hoping to interact with the train though. I think that it would be better if we could go onto the train and do stuff on it.6. InteractionQuite a few items but not everything. You can break urns, rocks, explosives and barrels but those are a given. Lighting the braziers to provide light was most innovative. I think having levers or switchs that moved big bridges would be quite cool.7. Knocking creatures offThere are some ways to knock off tiny land creatures, off the terrain and into a pit. Very cool, much better than an invisible ring. Of course, you can be knocked off as well.8. Pack mule / PetI love my pet and the ability to sell items without going back to town. 9. Spider MinesI can't believe there are spider mines that seek out enemies.10. Alternate weaponsPress W. Switch from range to melee. Great move. Change playstyle instantly. *Star star*11. NPC huntingYou can get more NPCs to help out in the town if you go out of your way to do side quests. Again, a potential pitfall as you might miss them totally, but it's okay. The similarity to Suikoden's hero collection is great.CONS1. BugsCan't pick up items that fall onto ledgesCan't shoot creatures who are no more than a few feet above or below you.2. Murder HoboAlmost everything is still mass murder. Kill, kill, kill, kill and more killing for any quest. I'm a mass murderer in this game. I've yet to come across a quest without premeditated murder.3. Stupid thingsYou are face-to-face with an enemy. However, you can't reach him because of a crack that runs through the floor, dividing you and the enemy. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think a jump would be great.4. Runic Account creationMost annoying. I have to create another account just to play online. <------ This here pisses me off.5. Spell keys1,2,3,4 are easy to reach. 5,6,7,8,9,0 extremely hard. Would have been better with 1234QWER.6. RepetitionRatlings, goo, skeletons repeated. Just with a different colour palette and skin.7. FameWhat does this do?8. ContentOnly 4 levels. I breezed through them. It didn't feel like there was enough interesting stuff. Just lots of similar level bashing.NEUTRAL1. Trash dropsI am not so certain about trash drops that just keep on generating a lot of junk for me to sell. Perhaps, something else can be done about trash drops?SUGGESTIONSI saw ladders in the game. Could Runic code an interaction with ladders?			"

												A quick preface:I extremely dislike Perfect World Entertainment. After having worked with them many years as a consumer attempting to enjoy some of their products, I find it difficult to recommend anything that they oversee. This is a word of caution, stranger.With the negativity out of the way...! Torchlight II is a sublime game. Colorful and vivid visuals mesh with professional sound quality and gameplay design features. I have put plenty of time and effort into the game and can easily recommend it to gamers looking for a 'classical' experience.Torchlight II is an action role-playing game not unlike the Diablo franchise. Immerse yourself in a fantasy world rife with conflict and unique people, places, and ideas. Play one of four classes and then embark on a journey to customize your character even further with three skill trees for each of the archetypes. Bring friends along, tackle procedurally generated dungeons, and advance in the engaging storyline as a casual gamer or passionate 'min-maxer'.Torchlight II is an exceptional game that can keep you occupied for hours, if not days.... perhaps weeks!

												Do you like Diablo I & II? This game is true Diablo III. I'm not saying that Blizzard failed to deliver good game, but this one is just as much Diablo-like as you can get. Everything from music to combat mechanics just feel like Diablo. Well, music on its own is beast. You can hear same tones as in diablo I & II. Game itself is quite long and has huge replayability, but combined with full mod support it's nearly unlimited. I recommand using Synergies mode as it makes game a lot more difficult as well as adding many new enemies, locations, items, very hard raids and recreates some of existing classes as well as adds some new. In fact only bad thing in TL2 is that it's not really hard, even on highest difficulty it's bit easier than Diablo II. 11/10, would buy again.			"

												Do you like Christmas?Then you will like Torchlight 2.Because playing Torchlight 2 literally feels like Christmas. The rewards just keeps getting thrown at you, and you never know what loot may be around the next corner. Wandering around and exploring the map almost feels like when you were a little kid and searched your house in hope of finding your hidden presents. Its almost like massage for your greedy ego.And i love Christmas. And whit Torchlight 2, Christmas is only 20 euros away.			"

												Alright so, this game has many pros and 1 con.Check it out:Nice story, one of the playable classes in the first game has turned into the main villian of this game. What a twist. And the general story of this one is pretty interesting.Nice gameplay, Instead of having a few infinite boring dungeons like the first one, this game offers an open world feel where you come across dungeons here and there. Really nice. The vanilla version offers 4 creative classes that you can play in many ways. A LOT of loot to collect and everything is just fun. AND this one has multiplayer where you can get kicked from games by people who don't speak English! I bet you're convinced now. But if the game itself doesn't satisfy you, there are countless of mods through workshop! Nice graphics, looks better than the first one and kind of gives a World of Warcraft art feel. I like it and you don't need an amazing system to run it. If my flea market 50 dollar can run this pretty much lag free, I'm pretty sure you guys can run it.What else is there to cover? Pretty much everything is great about it, one of my favorite dungeon crawlers.oh yeah, the con: 4 of the achievements are unachieveable, they're broken. Runic knows this and refuses to remove them purposely. IN FACT, they are using these broken achievements as a marketing tool. During one of the steam sales they changed the name of these achievements to ""Queued for Removal"" to draw in the completionist to buy this game. But right after the sale ended, you want to know what happened? They changed the name of the achievements right back to ""Unachieveable"". They could easily remove these achievements no problem. Damn you Runic and your..and your gay parties.But yeah that's about it, besides Runic being butt munches, this game is perfect and I'd recommend buying it.TL;DR: GG			"

												I guess people might say this is just more of the same, but in my opinion, it's way better than the first one. Maybe it's because of it's open world nature, or the better loot, I'm not sure. After having played Diablo 3 I can tell you guys I had more fun playing this. The graphics are colorful and dark at the same time, which looks extremely good in motion. There are a lot of sidequests, more diverse and usable loot, fishing (of course), pets, skill trees, secrets, randomly generated levels, you name it. So yes, in a way it's more of the same, but at the same time it's much more polished and has a higher fun factor than the first one, and D3.Finishing everything could take you 20+ hours, but most of us will probably finish it around 14-16 hours. And then there's New Game+...What I basically mean is; Torchlight II equals fun ![Rating: 89/100]			"

												I'll put it simply. Unless you've absolutely hated every hack-n-slash action-rpg from Diablo to Titan Quest, you owe it to yourself to buy this game.While Diablo 3 tried to reinvent the genre with World of Warcraft design philosophies, Torchlight 2 takes an entirely different approach; They have taken all of the elements people loved about previous games in the genre, such as character building, generous piles of loot, and fast action-packed gameplay, perfected those elements and expanded upon them. The result is a true spiritual successor to the games many of us sank countless hours into.Strapped for cash? It's only $20. Lousy internet? There's Offline and LAN play. Crummy computer? It's so well optimized, you could run it on a laptop. Anything you don't like about the game? It FULLY supports modding and the steam workshop.			"

												Torchlight II reminds me of a couple of other typical ""looter"" games such as ""Diablo"" or the latest F2P game ""Path of Exile"". However, a few features ultimately standout from these other games which is why I highly recommend this game over the others. First, you do not have to be a diehard gamer in order to play this game. There are 4 difficulty tiers, and even the second tier (normal) feels relatively easy to an experienced player, even if you have never played another looter-type game. Second, since it is mainly a point-and-click-RPG game, one may believe they would get tired of the game after but a few moments. This is hardly the case as all the little features and nuances work beautifully together to bring you an experience that is immediately rewarding and highly addictive unlike other alternatives. Lastly, while it is a relatively fast-paced game, it seems to be more manageable in the gameplay department across the board for any player in comparison to what I have seen from Path of Exile. This just further demonstrates that just because it is free, does not mean that is better for you in the long run. Oh, and the best part is...I've only been talking about the single player experience. This game also possesses a co-op feature so you can play through the story with several friends, or even random strangers. Player trading is also included, so expect hours to pass by if you play this game with people you enjoy being around and love killing creatures with them. Now Torchlight II does have a few odd in-game features to it I've noticed. For one, the blood animations do not seem even remotely realistic (even by fantasy standards). You could kill an enemy and they would first explode followed by the entire wall being entirely covered in blood...which the wall could be 10 times your size and your enemy's size, so this makes absolutely no sense. Also, the enemies sometimes get stuck in the most random places, which allows you to easily snipe them and pick away at their health continuously if you like utilizing a ranged character and those style tactics. I've already done this with a few mini-bosses and laughed all the while. Lastly, I honestly wish I did not have to click for every attack. I wish there was some auto-attack feature after you have targeted an enemy, but this is just me being nit-picky at this point. If you notice, these are just minor issues as well. I have seen no major problems or adversities to mention from this game so far as you can plainly see as well.Ultimately, Torchlight II provides a unique, personalized, open world experience which gives games such as the Diablo series a run for its money, especially when it is on sale in the steam store. I highly recommend picking this game up when it is on sale, as you will not be disappointed with the many hours you will invest into this game alone or with friends. Now, excuse me as I go bandage up my index finger for the next extensive click-fest that I am about to perform in this game.			"

Product received for free
What Is Torchlight II?Torchlight II is one of those wildly popular Steam games which hardly requires any introduction for fans of isometric-style action RPG's. Developed by Runic Games in 2012 as a more polished and refined version of its previous incarnation (Torchlight), it is widely hailed and beloved by scores of fanatical gamers (well over 3 million+) for its many favorable similarities to the equally popular Diablo series.The true hallmark of this title however, is that the sprawling world it offers to you on a very reasonably priced silver platter is a gorgeously inviting one awaiting to be explored to its fullest....tempting you with countless secrets to uncover & treasures to collect. In fact there is more loot to be found hidden within its myriad of locations than you could possibly wrap your mind around. It's easily one of those gems with which you can sink hundreds of hours into, since it offers level randomization for enhanced replayability inside of its open world system...one which includes weather as well as day/night cycles incidentally.GameplayFeaturing a very tight local + online co-op mode (in addition to solo offline play), you'll soon notice that you will be introduced to a diverse bounty of seemingly never-ending quests & side-quests given to you by those who require your assistance in one way or another. And fortunately, you'll have a ferocious pet by your side to help out in battle as needed, one who even possesses its own inventory!  In addition to the exploration and loot collecting, your primary objective will be to battle against a wide assortment of variously menacing monsters as you gradually level up your character with more skills, gold, and gear during this compelling campaign. Action is very fluid, brisk, and energetic...with a satisfying number of both weapon upgrades and weapon types (including melee & guns) to keep you more than entertained.Both your mana (ie. energy) and health bars will be depleted during combat, and must be replenished as necessary with collected vials which can be used up at any time.Character customization is present, although somewhat limited and basic in scope I felt. It's probably the most glaring aspect of the game which could have been improved further still. Nonetheless, it is still present at least, and you'll have your choice of either male/female characters spread across 4 distinct classes: Embermage, Outlander, Berserker, Engineer.Level design was quite impressive & varied in an overall sense, with some specific areas like the dungeons being especially atmospheric. It was quite a joy for me to explore every single nook & cranny of each individual section traversed as I hunted around for items to collect between waves of enemies....who themselves were sufficiently unique enough throughout the campaign so as to not feel repetitious in any way.There is just so very much to do in the game, and even after investing a few quality hours into it, there was an undeniable feeling that I've still only barely scratched the surface as to what awaits me further into its story.GraphicsWhat I especially appreciated about the presentation, is that this world is surprisingly vibrant in color as opposed to being dreary & muted looking in appearance as some other such similar games are. Which is then reinforced furthermore by the distinctly cartoon-style graphics found here. This in turn is all neatly tied together by a very well-done lighting system which somehow breathes a sense of intriguing realism into this magical place. All in all, it is quite pleasant on the eyes and sports a unique charm to it. And best of all, there are an ample number of graphics options available for fine-tuning your display preferences.AudioVoice acting was definitely above par, and sounded quite slick for the many varied characters present. (Although at times I felt that your character's obsession with his depleted mana levels was a bit overly-repetitive!). Whereas music itself was mellow & symphonic in nature...wonderfully balancing out the mood of each particular scene in an appropriate manner. And finally, sound effects were more than adequate in accomplishing their task of enhancing immersion...especially so with delightful effects such as thunder reverberating through the rainy night, for example. Steamified?It fully is, and includes both trading cards and a whopping 119 achievements to be unlocked.DLCNone available.ModsThe vast collection of available mods via the Steam Workshop is where this game truly shines like no other. There are literally hundreds of them to choose from in every possible category imaginable, and quite honestly you could find pretty much anything your little heart desires here.Verdict - 9/10Torchlight II has to be one of the best values out there in ARPG's...because while it only costs a fraction of what its pricier triple-A competitors do, it nonetheless very much competes as one, and more importantly, feels like one with its overhauled & redesigned user-interface which was a breeze to use. Accessibility is fantastic here as well, showcasing a streamlined and mostly straight-forward character leveling system which I greatly appreciated. Because being hopelessly confused inside of skill trees is not my personal idea of a fun time, and here, they most certainly get it right in steering the focus onto actual gameplay instead. And along with its multiple difficulty settings, just about anyone can enjoy what it has to offer...from the very casual side of the spectrum for those who simply wish to explore its scenery, all the way up to the no-nonsense hardcore setting for those veterans out there who wish to master its more subtle nuances. All in all, Torchlight II has underwent quite a lot of refinement to date, and runs at fantastic framerates even on less than cutting-edge hardware. But most of all, this is an exciting world to step inside of and one which you can very much have a great time with since there is always something interesting to do along with an accompanying sense of accomplishment felt as each goal is successfully completed...and that is why...I'll gladly rate this one a 9/10Pros:- Many hours of fun with lots to do and much to explore- Impressively designed & vast isometric world with vibrantly colorful aesthetics- Wonderfully implemented dynamic zoom camera- Nice selection of weapons + gear- Can play as both male or female- Great value for the purchase price- Rebindable keys- Impressive amount of adjustable graphics options- Local/online co-op + offline single-player - Steam achievements + trading cards- Countless mods available via the Steam WorkshopCons:- Character customization system could be more robust- Some of the character speech is repeated a bit too often For similar reviews and great giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com "

												*This review will be downvoted to hell by fans*Summary:Torchlight II clings to its Diablo series heritage like no other. It tries to be, at the same time, both fresh and familiar to fans of the genre. In the end, It’s just a cartoony Diablo II clone with elaborated gameplay mechanics. Both gives a mixture that seems appetizing but in reality is just stale and plain boring.6/10The Good :- Many, many weapons and items- Pets- Overally polished- Good musicThe Bad :- Very repetitive gameplay, even for hack'n'slash- Bland atmosphere and plot- Feels like cartoony clone of Diablo II- Dated graphicsI did not finish the game. My review follows these situations rarely. Even more rarely, I’m struggling to like something. This time, it’s Torchlight II.As serious as I can be, this fight ensued the moment I started the game and ceased when it ended up in a virtual dump. Don’t get me wrong, I adore hack’n’slash RPG’s.I absolutely loved Diablo I and more so, Diablo II. First part created the genre with gloomy atmosphere and revolutionary gameplay. The sequel had the magic to keep you clicking so many times, one would believe you’re testing mouse manufacturer’s claims of billion click durability. Torchlight II has neither. And here’s why.Right of the bat, Torchlight II shows resemblance to Diablo II. Made by the same author, the music is unmistakable. At first, I was glad because I really enjoy these notes but at the same time it prevents Torchlight to be unique. Several sounds, like opening a teleport, are basically cloned from Diablo II. Even the sequence of worlds and it’s hubs in TL are the same as Diablo II – wilderness, desert, dense forest, hell. And just like in Diablo II, our nemesis is a mysterious traveler that we’re always one step behind from. All of this takes away from Torchlight II. It’s just too familiar to call it a world of its own. It’s a copy with cartoony overlay which makes it neither dark and gloomy, nor light-hearted.As years passed, hack’n’slash games had to mutate it’s formula to remain fresh and attractive to gamers. Happily, Torchlight II has some tweaks and non-standard ideas, one of which is company of your pet. Essentialy, it’s your coop friend. There are several pets to choose from, all of which can pick and store items for you, wear accessories, fight, cast spells and last but totally not list, do a little shoppin while you bash evil’s head. You can also fish for, well, fishes that for reasons unknown, can transform your pet into a killing beast.As It goes for Diablo clones, you have a lot to choose from to do that. Beside leveling, getting a good equipment is the core element of action RPG’s. Torchlight II gives you –collecting sets, enchanting, socketing and putting in gems. Unfortunately, beside collecting and buying spells that can be used by any class, I can’t find anything that discerns Torchlight from other ARPG’s. Speaking of classes, I didn’t play every class. I focused mainly on Engineer. What I found out, is that I played through majority of the game using only 4 out of dozens. I’ve tried more variety but I’ve always ended up coming back to previous skills as they work best. So it all came down to getting the right equipment. Though you’ll encounter or buy many, many stuff it’s not that easy to find an upgrade. I’ve completed 3/4 of the game using just 3 ranged weapons with a single tactic. Single tactic, because even though monsters seem to vary much, the’re all killed the same. On hard difficulty I didn’t though that Tourchlight II is challenging, not even for a wihle)That said, it was hard to not get bored. Accompanied by generic maps, plot that isn’t worth mentioning (which I won’t) and repetitiveness with no challenge, I was struck with remorse while playing Torchlight II. Remorse that told me, that time with Torchlight II could be spent way better or at least on a superior game. Torchlight II is an OK ARPG, that excels in mediocrity. If ARPG’s are your thing, you could bite the bullet, especially that it’s dirt cheap now, but don’t say that I didn’t warn you. "

												After getting to the point where i was forcing myself to play it, just to see how far i could get, i finally decided to take a break from this game.what it get's right, it really gets right. the music is amazing, in these types of games i usually throw on my own music, but i had NO problem listening to this for hours on end. the graphics are stylish, and overall the presentation is pretty great.but i have one major problem, abilities. OH. MY. GOD.in other games of this type (diablo, PoE, Marvel Heroes) there are a plethora of abilities, and each one adds to the game in some way. there may be certain ones that are better than others, but you can work your build into a fun playstyle.this game treats abilities as an after thought. right now ive got an engineer that pretty much just swings his hammer over and over. now it might sound like im nitpicking, but in other games there is usually a variety in combat. there is nothing new here at all. a bubble. flame hammer. electric aoe.my other characters have similar problems, the abilties are flashy, unoriginal, and just plain boring. you will find yourself playing for hours on end, using the same boring moves over and over, and as you level up you don't unlock anything that really gives you that ""now im a badass"" feeling.now this is all personal preferance, but i felt like making a review because i find this game to be so much more boring than any other dungeon crawler ive ever played.get path of exile, it looks good, it's free, and most importantly IT""S FUN.very dissapointed in this promising game.

												Simplesmente muito superior a Diablo 3, Torchlight 2 é muito mais dificil, ambos são ótimos games, tanto Torchlight 2 quanto Diablo 3, mas esse é melhor!  (Simply excellent, Torchlight 2 is much more difficult than Diablo 3, both are great games, Torchlight 2 and Diablo 3, but Torchlight 2 is better! I was more satisfied than when I bought Diablo 3!!)			"

												This game influential is one of the greatest impact on Hack n' Slash action RPG in term of great design and meaningful loots.It has done more than being a great game , Ruinic Games has show how can such a genre can be improved from it's root even more. They are able to justified many positive contents that more than enough make Diablo3 has to make heavily changes on the 2nd expansion (reaper of souls) to be able to call itself a worthy title as Action RPG again.If you are someone that just this type of game. Buy it and show your support to the people that set this genre into better way.			"

												After sitting down for 13 hours straight to complete this game -including all the sidequests-, I've found gameplay to be pretty fun with all the unique skills available. HOWEVER that being said it's evident that the story is short and the endgame content is just simply a grind much like how Diablo 2 functions. The enemies' HP bars just turn into skill-soaking sponges that are only there to delay you for 5-10 seconds just for that 0.1mm xp bar gain. I will comment on the very nice smooth visual aspects of the game, the artwork for the game and the texture quality will not leave your eyes sore after bingle playing it.Runic games did fix the one balance issue I saw from TL1 which was the pet meta where you would just summon everything to kill stuff for you while you just walked around. Gameplay is still lacking a bit because in the endgame you just need to healtank with potions that drop from ♥♥♥♥in everything ALONG WITH the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aegis shield that you could proc which was basically 4x your normal health. Stuff like this leads away from interesting and interactive gameplay because you can just stand in the middle of everything pressing 1-9 and watching the visuals go off until everything around you is dead without much thought, hell near the end I just opened up youtube and watched Dota videos while I grinded maps because it's simply so braindead at times. To be honest the story is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ but thats up for you to decide. Now I know most of you will say that mods make this game better but I can't acknowledge that due to the fact that I never touched mods and even with mods the endgame is still a dead grind.The game is worth the $20 to buy it but it goes on sale so much it's probably worth $10 at most. Runic Games has no plans to release a TL3 which saddens me. I love TL2 but I just don't love it enough to see myself logging on every day to grind for nothing.Game is fun for a period of time. Really though, it just turns into a grind with pretty visuals.  If you're into grindy dungeoncrawlers I suggest you milk all the playability out of this game and move on to Diablo 2.			"

												Another Diablo clone, most people who haven''t actually played the game might say, but once you play it, you can know how polished the game is, it was created by ex-diablo II developers, and it improves on diablo II in a number of ways. The skill tree is now varied and you are not forced to go a specific path. Weapons are not soft limited to a single class, although some specific weapons and items still exists. For those who like D2, they will like TL2, and the surprising feeling is that once we played the game, we don't get the feeling that it is another D2 clone. With a good levelling up system that doesn't require much character grinding, TL2 delivers on what D2 was missing all along. With huge community support, tons of mods and customization, map packs once you finish the main quest, it will keep you enjoyed for long hours.			"

												My first Action RPG game so no comparisons to D3 here. As it stands on its own, it is a pretty solid game. Good graphics, visuals and sounds create an immersive environment. While the story may admittedly be paper thin and i did not feel there was much of a plot besides the standard ""villain threatens the world. save us!"" feel, it was functional.On the gameplay end, i would comment that it is quite enjoyable. Each class has many different styles and weapons and there is immense flexibility. A problem though was that i felt that many of the rare drops could have been more accessible towards the end. this problem though it easily recitified with mods, of which Torchlight 2 is quite friendly towards. There are many mods that range from simple UI tweaks to better loot drops to an entire revamp of the game. Torclight 2 thus becomes what you make of itA solid game on its own with very strong replayibility and customisation with its countless mods			"

												This is perhaps one of the best point-and-click fantasy RPG games I have had the pleasure of playing. Not only are there different difficulties and online, a massive selection of pets, multiplayer servers that host up to six players at a time, but the story line and characters are highly interesting.There are four classes to choose from, a mage, an engineer, a gun-slinger, and the classic bezerker. Each has their own special trait that makes each unique and desirable to different types of players. Choosing a class doesn't limit you to their stereotypical equipment, though! Being a dual axe-weilding Embermage and being questioned about  why  I use axes instead of a staff or wand is just a portion of the fun!I am what I presume to be about one-third of the way through the game judging by level and achievement progress, though I intend to continue playing after I complete the game with my current character. Perhaps the biggest problem I'm facing is my pet hawk being so much more powerful than me. then again, I suppose I am the one that taught it such powerful spells and provided stat-boosting equipment in the form of a collar and tags.One of my most recent side quests had me help a man recover masks in an attempt to bring peace to two warring races, and though I won't spoil all the details, it was a perfect, ""Plot twist!!!"" moment that had me grin and facepalm at my want to help (And need for xp!)  He turned out to be evil and needed the masks to gain power. Whoopsies! Was fun defeating him though~ Overall, I would suggest this game to anyone that enjoys RPG-style games that finds others hard to run due to system requirements. The minor issues I experience are not enough to subtract from the experience and pleasure of this game. A 9.5/10			"

Skill system allows a whole heap of diverse builds.And then theres the modding community... use the Steam Workshop to grab some mods, or if you prefer, make oyur own. End result is almost infinite replayability.Just... if you liked Torchlight 1 or Diablo 2, get into this.			"

												Crowborn's Review of Torchlight II-Ever since I was a boy, and got my hands on Diablo 1, I have been a fan of the hack-n-slash game-genre. Something about the game strung a cord inside of me, and I played it almost non-stop for years. Same with the sequel - it kept me busy through highschool and sane in the awkward years following when I was rampaging through life, trying to figure out what the 'eck I wanted to do. And so arrived the highly anticipated 3rd installment of the Diablo genre - to lackluster reviews. I picked it up immediately of course, but I were never able to enjoy it. It just seemed off to me, seemed strange, like an orange growing on an apple-tree, trying to fit in with the smooth green skinned fellas around it. But for me it failed at the deceit, and I put down the game after playing it for only a few months. Dissapointed and bereft of one of my favourite genres, I started looking around for substitutes. That's when I heard about Torchlight II.I had noticed the series before, but for some reason never gotten around to trying it out. It was supposed to be a fairly good diablo-clone, and while I liked the genre, it wasn't until one of my dear steam-friends gifted me the game, that I actually managed to sit down and play it. I felt obliged to, so to say. And my were I pleasantly surprised!Torchlight II is a really well made game. From the steam-punkish world, cross the interesting skill-sets, to the actio-packed maps - this game just breathes fun game design. Granted, the game is 'very' much a Diablo-clone, and anyone who ever played those games will immediately find everything intimately familiar. But that's not a bad thing. In fact, I find it darned good. I didn't have to read a bible of game-guides before daring to venture out in the the world of Torchlight, and hack and slash my way through the first pack of monsters I came across. It granted me immediate satisfaction and loads of fun.It feels to me like the devs of this game did right, what the guys at Blizz did wrong. Torchlight II follows to a point the tried and true old recipe of hack-n-slash. They don't try to reinvent or alter the genre, but instead stick to what works and 'has' worked for the last two decades. You got your attribute-points, your skill-points, random loot, runes and enchantments to upgrade your gear, rewarding exploration, and a story-line that doesn't distract you from your dungeon-delving fun.The game hearkens back to the good old days, and gives the players exactly what they expected - and a little more. It deserves a top grade, but due to an at times non-transparent stat-system and unbalanced characters, I have to subtract a few points. I give it:8.5/10			"

												This game is a little different than the standard 3rd person action RPG. It takes the best of the genre and puts an original spin on it, giving the player the option of very unique classes and weapons. The universe is very quirky and somewhat irreverent, which is something I absolutely love about this game. The mods available are numerous and help make the replayability extremely high. To top it off, the mechanics, graphics, and menus are all very well done! I highly recommend it!			"

Love the music, love the fast paced gameplay and the fact that this game is not afraid to reward you. There is so much to do in this game, and so many ways to customise your build. This brings me back to Diablo II where you could play however the hell you wanted and not completely gimp yourself, thats build diversity.If you want to play an action packed dungeon crawler, this is it.

Probably the best title $5 can get you with the amount of play time you'll sink into it (and the fun). You can choose to play solo by yourself or online with friends.

I just wish there where less of them. There are too many skills and without the ability to repec I can't try them all without making another character. However; I do like no durability on amor. Unless you're a survival horror game there is no need to put such gold sinks into the game.			"

												I've played a lot of ARPGs which all started with Diablo 2, and I've always craved a similar experience. Recently, or should I say last year, Diablo 3 came out, and to every single Diablo fan, it was an abysmal failure. I won't go into the details but I wasted 200hrs of my life playing that game and hoping it would get better. I eventually moved on and a few months ago picked up Path of Exile, which is another prominent ARPG that actually came out fairly recently. It was great until I started getting to higher difficulties, and whenever I died I lost a TON of experience. All my hard work farming and grinding would go to waste. Additionally, the whole gem skill system was too tedious and required lot of micromanagement to get the skills to work like I wanted them too. Alas, I got back into Torchlight 2 and hoped for a fresh start. This game, initially, made me hesistant because of its cartoony artstyle since I was used to the Dark Fantasy type worlds of POE and D3. But, eventually I started to play  and got over that fact. The gameplay was enjoyable. For example, I enjoyed the fact we could distribute attributes early on and start to specialize in a type of skill set. But what got me hooked on this game was the Loot System and how it was so rewarding to defeat challenging dungeon bosses as well as get great Uniques and Legendaries. Plus, the environment and the side missions, like phase portals, were so unique and everchanging compared to other ARPGs. Also, the end game option like Mapworks and New Game plus adds infinite replayability. This game in essence is what ARPGs should be about. I'm glad I bought this game.			"

The art and gameplay are fantastic, and the story line has been great so far (still working through the game). For those that weren't aware, many of the original Blizzard North developers that worked on Diablo 1 & 2 formed Runic and made this game. The game play feels very reminiscent of both of these classics but much better in my honest opinion.			"

												This game is a fun alternative to Diablo and I really love the cartoonie stile in the game. It's kinda like if you combined Wow and Diablo.It has up to 6 player co-op and all loot drops separately. There are also 4 classes with 3 talent trees each. And all 3 of them are pretty unique, this will make it 12 classes in total. But really you can mix and match how ever you like. Though you may only reset your 3 last points spent in these trees, so be wise with your choices.I recommend playing with friends but it's just fine to play alone.---Rating: 7/10 ""Steves""+ Pretty Graphics+ Fun Game PlayWarning: Mobs have a tendency to *EXPLODE* when ever you do a critical finish.

												A gathering of all lessons and experience gained in the past decade from ARPG's have been implemented in Torchlight 2. It's truly perfection when it comes to the genre, having the tightest, most addicting and satisfying gameplay I've experienced in any hack 'n slash and absolutely amazing itemization, monster variety and settings. With modding tools and thus practically infinite content on the way, there's no reason not to get this jewel for a mere 20 euros compared to the hefty 60 price-tag you pay for certain other ""AAA"" titles with less content and game-breaking microtransactions.

												Torchlight II really succeeds at being a Diablo II clone in that it takes a lot of the good aspects of the game and changes a lot of the old technologies that were annoying way back when. It plays very similarly to Diablo, with some great new mechanics introduced. It has it's own feel and story and the classes have their own uniqueness too. The thing that sets Torchlight II apart from the first one the most is the ability for online multiplayer; a crucial part of what makes this game fun in my opinion.			"

												Torchlight II would be amazing if there was more of an end-game to speak of. The multiplayer is a huge step in the right direction, but Runic's not there just yet. Gimpy PVP is a non-factor and a low item diversity means every character of a given class is shooting for the exact same gear at level 100. Game modifications and saving character files locally is a double-edged sword; while it is nice to have community contributions, it also makes cheating a breeze. Difficulty scaling is rather uneven through New Game Plus 2 and beyond, and characters that have advanced that far are unable to join games or play with those that are not on the same stage of NG+ progression. While I wish there was a broader meta, this is still the best loot-'em-up I've played since Diablo II.			"

												Torchlight II is a very enjoyable game, exspecially if you like games like diablo I/II. Torchlight II has very good multiplayer capabilities, a big plus for gamers who prefer to play games with friends over just playing by themselves. Torchlight II has massive amounts of content and gameplay plus added abilities like helpful immortal pets that help in fights, pet upgrades and abilites, numerous massive gameplay areas, upgradeable weapons and equipment, fishable fishing holes that can offer adventagious items for both you and your pet, many different types of environments, plus much more. this game is well worth purchasing and playing, enjoy.

												I'm VERY impressed with Torchlight 2.  As far as ARPG's go this one is definetly my favorite. The world is huge, there are plenty of monsters to fight and TONS of loot to be had. There are up to 4 classes you can play, You also can have a pet companion or a minion and there are a few to choose from. There are also a fantastic amount of skills you can pick  from to help you along in your slaying. I was sold on the fact that there is offline single player, but you can play multiplayer co-op as well if that suits your fancy. Graphically the game is cartoony but is well done and looks good. The interface works very well and everything is bindable so no problems there either. The music compliments the game very well, adding a good amount of atmosphere. The price is $20 which is incredible for the amount of polished game you get,  so by all means grab this title, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Of course I recommend this game.  I've spent over 1000 hours on it.  Oy!There are two things I love best about this game:Tight, exciting combat.Class flexibility.The combat and loot grind are all that matter in TL2.  Any semblance of a story is just fluff.  The combat, thankfully then, is very fun.  Tons of exciting, satisfying abilities and weapons to throw at your enemies.  Add in multiplayer and it's even better.Being able to create most any character your heart desires really triggers my altoholism.  It even drove me to create a few of my own classes in GUTS for MORE options.  Apparently it drove quite a few people to GUTS, because we have a number of really awesome community-built classes.  Check out the Workshop page.  It's one of the most active on Steam behind Skyrim and Gary's mod and... and I think that's it.			"

Probably the best title $5 can get you with the amount of play time you'll sink into it (and the fun). You can choose to play solo by yourself or online with friends.

												Torchlight II is a great dungeon/critter type game. The different character types suit their roles well but I like the engineer the best :)If you got this game in the on sale then it is a steal but if not it is still a great purchase.			"

												Skill trees, lots of loot, and customization. Torchlight II is everything Diablo III should have been. At only $20, this game is a must for anyone who loved Diablo II. On top of all that, the extensive mod comunity means there's always something new to keep you coming back, even if you've already played through the game with every class.			"

Mindless entertainment!Emphasis on mindless, but it is still entertaining. It can be fun if you want to level up frequently without having to worry about such petty concerns as a challenge. Personally liked tanky engineer; seems indestructable on hardest difficulty (unmodded).Mod selection is pretty good. Some 'must haves' there, but I haven't gone nuts as yet. Reasonable number of extra class mods, but most of them reuse character models and skill icons. It may not bother other people but to me it feels really cheap, and puts me off using them.And yeah I'm doing this largely for the Pillar of the Community badge, but hey I might as well write a half decent review.

												This is a great game that I recommend to all Diablo fans who just couldn't scratch that RPG itch with Diablo 3, you can thank Torchlight 2 for that. Best played with friends Torchlight 2 is a vast vibrant world sprawling with life, which as you will find is not usually friendly. Other than the lack of proper story, but rather a simple plot to encourage you to continue on your monster killing rampage, Torchlight 2 exceeds in all categories, and is in my opinion, a better sequel to Diablo 2 reather than Diablo 3, taking into account the price tag.So if you havn't gotten your hands on this game, now is the time.9.5/10 Green Iguanas			"

												Torchlight II really succeeds at being a Diablo II clone in that it takes a lot of the good aspects of the game and changes a lot of the old technologies that were annoying way back when. It plays very similarly to Diablo, with some great new mechanics introduced. It has it's own feel and story and the classes have their own uniqueness too. The thing that sets Torchlight II apart from the first one the most is the ability for online multiplayer; a crucial part of what makes this game fun in my opinion.			"

												If you liked Diablo 2, you'll love this game. While the story and composition are almost exactly identical to D2, there are a few changes that I absolutely loved. I found the skills very approachable, you can make your build as simple or as complex as you want, and most builds are effective. You can no longer upgrade gems the same way, so you don't need to feel compelled to collect and keep all the gems. They added a limited ability to respec your character, so you have a few levels to play around with skill choices, which I found useful. However, the most notable change (for me) is the independent treasure drops. There is no longer a mad scramble for the best loot if you play multiplayer. You can take all the loot you see, which made multiplayer infinitely more enjoyable for me.			"

The art and gameplay are fantastic, and the story line has been great so far (still working through the game). For those that weren't aware, many of the original Blizzard North developers that worked on Diablo 1 & 2 formed Runic and made this game. The game play feels very reminiscent of both of these classics but much better in my honest opinion.			"

												This game is a fun alternative to Diablo and I really love the cartoonie stile in the game. It's kinda like if you combined Wow and Diablo.It has up to 6 player co-op and all loot drops separately. There are also 4 classes with 3 talent trees each. And all 3 of them are pretty unique, this will make it 12 classes in total. But really you can mix and match how ever you like. Though you may only reset your 3 last points spent in these trees, so be wise with your choices.I recommend playing with friends but it's just fine to play alone.---Rating: 7/10 ""Steves""+ Pretty Graphics+ Fun Game PlayWarning: Mobs have a tendency to *EXPLODE* when ever you do a critical finish.

												I've played a lot of ARPGs which all started with Diablo 2, and I've always craved a similar experience. Recently, or should I say last year, Diablo 3 came out, and to every single Diablo fan, it was an abysmal failure. I won't go into the details but I wasted 200hrs of my life playing that game and hoping it would get better. I eventually moved on and a few months ago picked up Path of Exile, which is another prominent ARPG that actually came out fairly recently. It was great until I started getting to higher difficulties, and whenever I died I lost a TON of experience. All my hard work farming and grinding would go to waste. Additionally, the whole gem skill system was too tedious and required lot of micromanagement to get the skills to work like I wanted them too. Alas, I got back into Torchlight 2 and hoped for a fresh start. This game, initially, made me hesistant because of its cartoony artstyle since I was used to the Dark Fantasy type worlds of POE and D3. But, eventually I started to play  and got over that fact. The gameplay was enjoyable. For example, I enjoyed the fact we could distribute attributes early on and start to specialize in a type of skill set. But what got me hooked on this game was the Loot System and how it was so rewarding to defeat challenging dungeon bosses as well as get great Uniques and Legendaries. Plus, the environment and the side missions, like phase portals, were so unique and everchanging compared to other ARPGs. Also, the end game option like Mapworks and New Game plus adds infinite replayability. This game in essence is what ARPGs should be about. I'm glad I bought this game.			"

While I use to face issues like lags or even crashes with other games, this one runs very fluid, and this with beautiful - tho comiclike -graphics and heavily modded.Well, there is not much more to tell, as else it only slightly differs from other Games of the genre.

												This is one of my favorite games. I love the art style and the combat is very well done, making you feel engaged, and interested. The story line is there if you want it, with the main storyline voiced to you, and the side quest readable if you are interested. The quests feel relevent and aren't to long or to short. The environments are also fun and well made, along with the monsters and creatures within. The diversity of the classes and pets make co-op very fun allowing your friends and you to take certain roles such as tank, damage, or support. There are many ability powers you can gain and they unlock at a good pace. Theres also some very cool looking armor sets and weapons that you can find or purchase. Overall the gameplay is amazing and its price is increadable for what it offers (Developers say that all DLC will be included for free as its released). Hands down the best 20$ game I have ever bought. Gameplay 10/10. Value 10/10.			"

												I enjoyed Torchlight 2.  Its play style is very similar to Blizzard's Diablo 3.  Some reasons I like Torchlight 2 more than Diablo 3:1) no real money auction house circus hyping microtransaction-to-win (I guess even Blizzard conceded how bad that was by finally removing it from D3)2) Your pet has inventory and can be sent to town to sell trash drops and/or buy potions, scrolls, etc..  No need to portal back to town to sell at a vendor every 15 minutes!3) The game supports user designed mods, allowing users to create, experiment with, and, via the Stream Workshop, share their own alterations to the game.4) At full price, Torchlight 2 is only one third the cost Diablo 3 was.  On sale, which is not uncommon, it made Diablo 3 pricing look flat out offensive.If Diablo 3 has an obvious advantage, it's probably their art/story talent and budget, which is what we've come to expect from Blizzard, and would be tough for even the most capable publishers to compete with.I recommend Torchlight 2 to anybody interested in playing this style of action RPG.

												One of the most interesting Hack N' Slash games I have seen in a while. Yes, Diablo pretty much has this style of gaming down. However, I think Torchwood 2 is a fine example that there can be different companies that make great games like the style of Diablo. The colors of this game just really pop out at you. I love the fact that I can have a cat as a companion. The very fact I can have a car to carry stuff around or turn into another animal is just brilliant and I think that is one of the main reasons it is different from Diablo. I love that there is a lot of achievements to this game. It makes me want to not only go for them but it gives the game even more replay value. This is a fun and entertaining game and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Diablo style hack n' slash.			"

												This is a great game and it is a highly addictive experience, whether playing singleplayer or with friends. Thanks to the dozens of hours of replayability made even longer by some really good mods, you will get a lot of bang for your buck.The only negative I can think of is the lack of an online community. If you are looking to buy this title primarily for the online multiplayer then you might be disappointed in that aspect. Unfortunately this game has never garnered the vast online community that all of the Diablo games have been so well known for, so the server list is pretty barren most of the time.I rate Torchlight II a 9/10.

You can also share items between your own characters with the ""shared chest."" The story is alright and there is plenty of inventory management, but it's a joy to play.There is multiplayer available - fight battles together and everyone gets their own loot. However, I much prefer playing alone because I don't like feeling rushed by others wanting to proceed to the next battle before I'm done with inventory management.			"

												Really fun game! This is my first foray into the action-rpg/dungeon genre, and I love it. +The art style is gorgeous, and they've done a great job of making so many armours and weapons not look fugly. -When it gets really hectic it can be difficult to see what's going on through all the bright colours and effects.+The New Game system is cool; you won't be near max level after you finish the story, so you can start NG+and do the areas over again, but with your character at a higher level and all the loot and mosters have been scaled appropriately+Mapworks feature adds some good replayability. Adds many different dungeons with different stats (eg, monsters drop double gold, monsters immune to crits, double exp, double gold, etc)+Having the pet is handy! It has its own inventory, and you can send it to town to sell or pick up certain items. You can also get gear to boost their health and damage, which is nice for ranged builds!+Amazing amount of build versatility. Not limited by your class to any weapon or play style, so there's a tonne of fun to be had in making a ridiculous or strange build and rolling with it.~ Not all builds are viable though, and sometimes you have to remake a character a couple hours in because you've built poorly. (Or, yay respec mods!)-even with many play styles available, the overall gameplay can get repetitve after awhile.+Multiplayer is a lot of fun. Definitely a game I prefer as a multiplayer game to single player. The difficulty scales according to how many party members are around and it's a lof of fun going crazy with your friends,+The ability to switch your character very easily between single player, multiplayer (LAN) and multiplayer (online) is great, other games do do this but I've found Torchlight's simplicity is really helpful.-It can be difficult connecting to online games some times, and lag does happen where your friend freezes on your screen but you can move, but vice versa on theirs. Makes for confusing runs sometimes.This game is a tonne of fun. I picked it up on a suggestion from a friend when it was $5, and it's probably the most I've ever gotten out of five dollars. I'd not hesitate even for the full $20!			"

												Overall: Good value for money.  Decent storyline and plenty of variety in mobs, terrain, weapons and builds. If you liked the first Torchlight or Diablo 2, chances are VERY good that you will like this too. Has both LAN and Online play modes. Great fun with friends.Replay Value: 4 Classes 4 Acts (3 which are reasonably long, last one is a bit short). New game +s introduce higher level mobs and loot, but storyline doesnt change. TONS of mods to mix things up ( but to play online, you need players with the same mods )5 Star Game! Edit: Nominate this for steam awards! :D			"

												Sometimes a game of this type comes along and does so many things right, that it's hard to say anything bad about it. If you like Diablo style fun this game will blow your mind! The Dungeons are fun, the classes are great and the world is fluid and lovingly crafted. Immersion never feels forced in Torchlight 2! You'll find yourself playing this game to realise your characters maximum potential for your chosen style of play/build, and then putting it to the test. Personally I get a giggle every time I send my pet to to town to sell the crap I've laden  it's bag with, such a great feature that, which means you can get on with your killing (if you dare going alone!).  And when you're done, you can get content from the Steam Workshop to extend your game play, and even add 3+ more classes, more dungeons, and even raids! Hell, if you're into content creation and a little know-how, you can get the GUTS tool and make your own!Once you're set up to play on-line you can play your game either on LAN or Internet, and your friends can join you in your adventure, and trade goodies to each other! There is a small hassle setting up an on-line account and linking it to your steam account on the game website, and then add friends so you can play on-line with them. It's nothing hard, but I've heard the picky few complain xD. If you're playing in Mod Mode (Steam workshop addons), you have to make sure your friends are running the same ones, in order to play together, otherwise it's pretty straightforward :DPersonal Rating: Great Game, worthy of any libraryScore Rating: 92% - Nearly a Classic!

												People said this was the more true descendant of Diablo2, which I played for years and still like. I own Diablo3 but stopped playing it some time ago. I played Torchlight2 for 7 hours on the freebie weekend. From what I've seen I believe it is the truer descendant of Diablo2 - if you loved Diablo2, you will most likely prefer TL2 over D3. Even putting aside some of the obvious badness of D3, TL2 still owns it. Even the storyline is more thoughtful in that it gives the prime bad guy motivations more complex than world domination (altho world domination doesn't appear to be off the cards). Every part of it appears to be well considered based on what players enjoy. I did actually prefer the hotkey to mouse system of D2 over this system, but both are good.			"

												One of the most interesting Hack N' Slash games I have seen in a while. Yes, Diablo pretty much has this style of gaming down. However, I think Torchwood 2 is a fine example that there can be different companies that make great games like the style of Diablo. The colors of this game just really pop out at you. I love the fact that I can have a cat as a companion. The very fact I can have a car to carry stuff around or turn into another animal is just brilliant and I think that is one of the main reasons it is different from Diablo. I love that there is a lot of achievements to this game. It makes me want to not only go for them but it gives the game even more replay value. This is a fun and entertaining game and I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Diablo style hack n' slash.			"

												Torchlight II is an incredible action RPG in the top-down, point-and-click style of Diablo. Having played both Diablo III and this game, I must say that I found Torchlight II preferable. Many call it ""Diablo with guns"" but Torchlight II is much more than that. The handy pet system gives you both a battle companion and a courier, carrying your unwanted loot back to town and selling it automatically. The extend of character customization permitted is also much greater than in Diablo. The combat feels much less detached and more engaging, which is a welcome tweak. The greatest advantage of Torchlight II is that you don't have to be constantly connected to the internet to play. You can play solo offline and even play co-op over LAN. In that regard, Torchlight II is much more respectful of you as a customer.			"

												Coming from being a huge Diablo 2 fan I found myself rather dissapointed by Diablo 3 for a variety of reasons.  Luckily for me Torchlight 2 came around and gave the epic Diablo 2 feel I was looking for without any of the problems I had with Diablo 3.  The gameplay of Torchlight 2 fills the comfortable selection of skill points, stat gains, and interesting and epic loot.  While I feel that the trees lack a bit of focus and there is little to force a player to branch out from a few core skills, it beats the system in Diablo 3 which replaces character building with a linear path.  Top this with the Workshop content and this game always has a new class or feature available for it.			"

Love the music, love the fast paced gameplay and the fact that this game is not afraid to reward you. There is so much to do in this game, and so many ways to customise your build. This brings me back to Diablo II where you could play however the hell you wanted and not completely gimp yourself, thats build diversity.If you want to play an action packed dungeon crawler, this is it.

Torchlight 2 carries on the great visual art style of the first game and the smooth controls.  What really makes TL2 the game to own though is it's multiplayer functionality.

												WARNING- I have only played up to part way through act 2 of this game, but I have experience with all classes. I have not played the multiplayer.If you like ARPGs, you have probably already bought this game, so do not need to to recommend it to you. I don't. For what it's worth, Torchlight II is much better than it's predecessor, consisting of better, meatier combat as well as multiplayer and better difficulty. As an ARPG, it is near perfection, but as a game I find it somewhat lacking. Weapons like the shotgun and cannon could be meatier, and fighting with a melee character seems to lack impact. The game attempts to seem open world, but considering that I would have to clear out every area simply to keep up with levels, it misses the point entirely. In my opinion, the point of open world is that things are OPTIONAL- you could explore the nearby cave, or you could not. Removing that basically makes the concept useless. Mobility is done well, with dodging a powerful blow feeling very satisfying and fun, however there are some attacks that simply curve around to hit me again, removing the satisfaction. Bosses are similarly very satisfying, but also very dangerous and difficult to avoid- with a great feeling when you beat them.The skill system is not innovative, but generally well done- nothing more to say here. The dark music provides an interesting contrast to the cartoony art style, but I feel that the story simply isnt dark enough to fully support that contrast. However, most of the problems mentioned before are nitpicking, and the main game is stellar for its genre.If you like ARPGs, you will love this game, but it wont turn you onto the genre if you hate them.

												This game is basically D2 reskinned.  Probably because it was developed by a lot of D2 guys.  The game is fun and fairly easy to understand.  Add friends and it's a very engaging game.  I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a game to burn a lot of time on.			"

It has a very emmersive storyline and world, doesent require a beast of computer, and has steam workshop capabilities extending the awesomeness of this game even further. I highly reccomend this game to you guys. Peace.			"

												This game combines some of my favorite hack and slash RPGs into one superior game. I was a big fan of Fate and Diablo II, but didn't like the repetative dungeon grinding feeling I got from Fate, and disliked the darker elements of Diablo II. this game takes the lighter, more whimsical feeling of fate and gives it the almost open world feel of Diablo II. Also, anything you don't like about this game is easly changed with the user friendly modding system.			"

												Absolute 100% necessary for any RPG lover. And even more for people wanting to get into the world of RPGs. The UI is simple and intuitive, and this is the first RPG that allowed me to figure out what to do and what to use and how to use it on my own. Thats not it, attacks and every kind of thing that happens here has an amazing amount of satisfaction in doing it. Attacks sound great, they have great power while it still being fair. And the most awesome thing is that you get a pet, right from the start.And the last but not the least, this is an RPG for which you pay money ONE TIME. Most RPGs Ive played that tried to imitate the feel of an MMORPG required you to either have a subscription or buy equipment for thousands of euros  to win.			"

												You don't really need much from an ARPG: lots of loot drops, hordes of enemies, and a decent enough difficulty curve that you aren't just mindlessly clicking through the game. Torchlight II definitely fits all of these requirements and then some. Is the storyline weak and threadbare? Oh yeah. But you aren't playing this for deep narrative, are you? No, you're looking for piles of gibbed enemies at the hands of your vicious attack alpaca.			"

												Original Torchlight was a breath of fresh air. It played like Diablo only quicker with a poppier edge. The only problem with it was that it had no multiplayer!Torchlight 2 improves on the original formula by adding coop multiplayer. Most of the mechanics are the same save for a couple small things (can't combine specks/chips/shards into larger gems?). Playing with a group of friends has made this game addicting for me. I can't get enough right now! My only gripe is lack of classes you can be. Four classes just doesn't feel like enough and I feel like it doesn't have enough depth where the characters are concerned (no real customizing, only one role for a couple of the classes). The skill tree can be slightly lacking too, but its got enough to keep me interested.Outside of that, great game, get it!			"

												If you are as devoted of a fan to the Runic team as I am, then this sequel is for you. Great feel and vibe and plays just as great if not better than Torchlight. Also if you are not familiar with Torchlight but loved playing Diablo I and II then both Torchlight games are for you. The only thing thats really changed in this game is the fact that the TP scroll works as a designated waypoint and it makes it to were you do not have to use regular waypoints (Just like in Torchlight and Diablo I & II) to get around quickly, which is convienent because it doesnt go away when you go back through it. However you cannot  place them in Boss chambers/instances. Gold however is not as easily accumulated because its in very small proportions throughout the world but collecting loot and the gold will give you an ample stockpile. With that said, you cannot stash gold like you could in previous Runic developments and Torchlight I, but maybe its a mod that I havent looked into yet for Torclight II. In closing, great game, and multiplayer is fun but its more of game you must have a friend to play with, mainly because the online community is small. If you have $20 extra pick it up, you wont regret it.			"

												Torchlight II: An amazing ARPG that has made significant improvements over the first, and comes along with strong exploration elements. Also, it has multiplayer, which is great.If you ever were a fan of the FATE series or the first Torchlight, this is a must. It's overall gameplay is much better than the first Torchlight, but it still keeps the theme.Combat has been drastically improved. The classes are generally more fun, but a little more unbalanced; the ranged class does very little compared to the berserker, unless you're with a group.Exploration is the strongest point of this game. The visuals are breathtaking for an overhead ARPG. The environments are huge, and the dungeons are menacing.The only noticable downside I see in this game is that the first few hours seemed rather dull to me. When I got later into the game, though, it became very interesting. Also, the environments are static, meaning they aren't procedurally generated. This isn't really a bad thing, it allows for much more detail in the levels, and detail I saw. It just means there isn't as much replay value. So once you beat the game, you might hesitate starting over again.			"

												It lost some of the great functions of the first one, like the gems adding up to being better on the trasmuter, instead now they just turn into blood ember, chaos ember, iron ember or void ember, of the respective level. Although I can get why they did this, so you don't get stuck on farm hunting these gems into despair, they made it easy for you to farm them, so you now can get them progressing through the game.The visuals tend to have a grand variety through the game, as you can have an icy tundra first, then have an hot desert the next. Animations are fluid and creative, but it's sad that for the most part the only thing you see is the slicing of flesh and a splatter of blood covering your screen when it's full of monsters. But they did improve a lot on the different type of monsters on the account of the first, let alone the animations that accompany their entrances into the map, which is a nice feature to not just have them all roaming the map.The gameplay is still as fast as the first, where the only time you have to breath is the time you choose, since you don't have to stop by the town everytime you need to sell your items. The monsters, champions and bosses all present their unique signature attacks, that make you adjust your tactic on how to aproach them. Later on, if you don't play close attention to equip yourself the right way though, you'll have serious problems advancing, which I can say is a delicious meal, since you can't do without the crazy amount of items you get through, be it for any stat you desire. On that note, it's most important to delineate the capacity of builds you can do with each class you choose, you can be literally anything with any class, be it ranged, tank, melee, support, etc, although you do need to figure out the twerks of them first before you can really get to it, because they made it so you can't turn back too much on your skills decision, where you can only go back on 3 skill points, leaving you wonder why did they even put that system in. I guess to prevent some bad missclicks on skills you didn't wish to put skill points in.The multiplayer function is fun and explosive, as creatures invade your screen based on the amount of people that are playing with you. Other than that, it's not rewarding enough for what it does, where the items tend to be the same and the monsters get stronger and stronger, leaving you most of the time dead or pressing the health potion constantly, with no way to go around it, since there are a screen full at theme at every turn.Overall, it's the nicest action rpg out there, promising future installments to overcome each time the Runic Games team decides to go forward, which i wish they do, even if they change the IP, please keep the same action packed RPGs they do.P.S.: I didn't commentate the story, because I don't think they really wanted it to be that gratifying for the experience of the player, so i decided to just focus on what they focused to make the game great.

												This game is amazing and worth a buy. But before I get into that, I need to tell you some things.Back when I was a wee lad (about 5), I stumbled upon a game called FATE, and it was an RPG. I put many hours into this game, then, I never saw it again.Until Torchlight came out.This game is based off of FATE and Diablo, as the creator said. So, I played it. Not only was it much better than fate, but a lot more entertaining.Flash foward to 2012, when this beast of a game came out. The environment is amazing. The music was created by THE ONE THE ONLY MATT GOD DAMN FOKING UELMAN!!!!!!This game is legendary, just like its counterparts, FATE and Torchlight 1. Check them both out. They are good time killer games.THERE ARE 4 FATE GAMES ON STEAM NOW. I BOUGHT ALL OF THEM.			"

												Holy Crap! Torchlight 2 is better than Diablo 3! and a 3rd of the price. The original dev's for diablo know what they are doing. Runic games will be a serious contender for these other huge companies with unlimeted budgets. This game is FAST! Love the speed of the game play. Loot system is awesome! and did I mention CO-OP! I havent tried it yet, but I cannot wait! Highly RECOMMENDED 10 out of 10!			"

												""Oh god, it's got me by the neck!"" Is my impression now of how I started Torchlight 2. The game was immediatley addicting, and rightly fully so. Even though this game can be related to a typical button masher, it sucks up all of your attention with the various quests and side-quests. In all honesty, I played through this game with two friends for my first playthrough ever, and ended up completing it in just two days. The LAN/Internet system is a bit spotty, but otherwise this game is grat if you love this genre og gaming - and if you don't, it is a great game to begin learning how to love it a little more.			"

												No wonder this game has overwhelmingly positive review. I tell you, this game really good, for casual or for serious RPG fan. if you got bored playing alone, don't worry, there is an online button for you to play with other communities or even with your friends. The community is good tho, they are open to newbies and ready to help if newbie need some help.despite many good compliments to this game, but still there is some cons that you can find too.such as some set doesn't have complete items or sometime there is some players exploiting bugs , etc.but that is not serious problems, still fun to be played.my rating for this game is 8/10Q : you said this game really good, so why the fish did you rate it to 8/10? how about the other 2?A : i've reach NG+++, and i felt this game to be repetitive at this point, enough said.

												The game is awesome, but multiplayer system is a bit weird:Lobby with friends is just a server where everyone has their own quests progress and each player sees their own drop.So in order to exchange your drop, you first have to ask all your friends who has what items already and then go through offer->trade->confirm process. This may seem like not an issue, but while you get tons of drop in this game, you have to spend few minutes each time to make a simple drop exchange.			"

												Great co-op game to play as a couple, with friends or strangers :)  It reminds me of a less serious version of Diablo 3 (looting, killing monsters, weapon upgrades, etc.), and you can easily put down a solid 15-20 hours down, depending on how much time you want to commit to each area (and with whom you want to play with). Really fun, easy learning curve, and nice graphics. The downside, however, is that there is a lack of story.. so if you're playing games for story, I would not recommend this. 10/10 would definitely play again!			"

												...let's see - What can I say about Torchlight II with 1.2hrs of gameplay.  First off, I can tell this will end up being one of those games that you ""fall back"" on.  Like for example:You mainly play: World of Warcraft (again, just an example)- getting ganked by your opposing faction over and over = rage quit- level capped, gear decent enough for normal raids however, groups wont take you?! = rage quit (or alt leveling)- pvp pugs aren't comprehending player vs player is a TEAM oriented task to achieve a win... = rage quit- $15 a monthly sub is enough to ... rage quit when it comes to ""WoW"" upon seeing the broken qualities it really has...So now that you have that in mind, you rage quit right?! but you're a nerd like me and you want to continue to sit in front of a computer screen and play a game; something tedious right?! Well this is what I would fall back to once I rage quit.  (...I think I mentioned that WAY too much huh?) mmk, point being this is a simplistic game and I'm pretty much one shotting enemies two-three lvls above me (I know I am not THAT good yet) but all in all the learning curve is beyond basic mechanics... (point and attack) spam a few abilities pop a poition here and there (more like far and in between) Here is my simple line up of likes about this game.- Easy mechanics- Easy tutorial system (allowing new comers to catch on very quickly)- Basic characters with likable unique abilities- NO month subscription... (that's always a plus!)- Feel like you are under GOD MODE when playing this game cause you feel huge and green and ready to smash everything (get it? Hulk Smash?!)- Gear stats are easy to read and understand (if not hover over the stat in your character skills/abilities screens)- No childish community (as far as I have seen, I could be wrong)Would I recommend you dropping the money to purchase the game for ""main entertainment"" probably not so much.  If money is not an issue for you and you are looking for another add to your collection whether it be for any type of playstyle... I would recommend it! I for one, am pretty glad I got it.-- ""may the eagle of the night, guide you to dawns breach!""			"

												10/10 - As a fan of the original Torchlight, I was eager to try out this release and have not been disapointed!  With immersive game play and endless character customisations Torchlight II is highly addictive.  As many other reviews have mentioned, if you are a lover of Diablo II then give this game a shot.My favourite feature in Torchlight is the unique pet system; you chose from a wide selection of strong companions with customisable gears and skills.  These companions are very functional and an important support tool.  They can be fed different food (that you fish yourself from ponds discovered throughout the game) which morph your pet into different creatures that provide various stat bonuses for a limited period of time.Well made, no problems at all with bugs etc.			"

												The multiplayer process is a hassle, and I recommend pacing yourself on side-quests lest you burn out by mid-game, but with the right set of mods and the right friend to play with, this game is darn solid.Be sure not to get too attached to your pet, though, in case you suffer the same glitch as my co-op partner!

												What Diablo 3 should have/could have been.  Better gameplay, great skill trees, engaging gameplay, Torchlight 2 has it all on the money.  If you love the loot grind, want a co-op game, or just enjoy fantasy hack-n-slash, this game is definitely in your wheelhouse.  Much more customization of both your character and your pet is available this round, increasing investment in your creation.  You'll prolly even play the exact same class 2 or 3 or 4 different ways, and have a toon for each.  You'll love it!			"

Instead I wasted money on games like Diablo 3 which I anticipated it's release for years to only be kicked in the gutt by how badly they messed up this excellent and epic franchise.  That's Blizzard for you though.  They've been messing things up for years now with every awesome franchise they've put out.  Can't they just go back to being the good Blizzard instead of this evil Blizzard?  Oh well, their loss since I much rather buy and play games like Torchlight II now.			"

What makes Torchlight superior is all the little details they've built in, in every corner and aspect of the game.  From boss and their animations to secret dungeons found by explorers will to cover the entire map, to pets and fishing.  Well worth the full price and absolute steal on sale.			"

												I would recommend Torchlight 2 before the recent patch and subsequent expansion of Diablo 3. Now I'll do the same not because it's a better game but because of the price and reliability of Steam Workshop. If you want an experience much more bright and somehow less serious this is the game for you! If you like hack-and-slash games you should not miss this one by any means. Hours of fun in Vanilla and possibly another hundred exploring the vast Workshop library wanting new ways to play the game. Some mods offer total immersion, new classes, new weapons and new skills.  The only thing that can ruin the experience is the fact that vanilla characters and mod characters can't interact, but of course for obvious reasons.Go ahead and play it! And if possible buy it with some special discount (seriously steam does that very often).			"

												Best ARPG I've played to date. Why?- Casual gamer Friendly!- Although there is, what may seem at first, a limited number of classes the skill selection makes for at least 3 or 4 different sub-variations for each class. Replay value is great, although leveling is a test of patience. Capping taking roughly 2 complete playthroughs.- Graphics are not as hard on the average CPU that us mortals can afford. I prefer stylized graphics over realistic graphics because they are never out of style or look dated like most other 3D games.- It offers an Endgame consisting of Mapworks, a tool that allows you to run random dungeons of a level of your choosing (up to 105), and Tarroch's Tomb, a relentless 10 wave gauntlet that drops loot every wave you beat but disappears if you die (Wave 1 comprised of lvl 100 enemies and wave 10 of lvl 199 enemies).- The loot system actually feels FAIR!!! *coughs* Diablo III *coughs*- Moddability adds heaps to the game including a difficulty increase and class changes that increase replay value. Downside is modded game saves are different than stock and you can only play with people that have the same mods. Items can not be crossed from modded to unmodded.- If you get bored or just want to test limits you can duplicate items for money or utility by using a stash and save file manuever. You could also use console to spawn items but you will be labeled as a cheater. The ability to do these cheats adds a lot to the experienced of a gamer that is NOT HARDCORE. Casual gamers need to be catered to too.The only real downside I found was the relentlessness when making ability choices. MARK MY WORDS: You cannot respec more than the last 3 abilities you leveled or chose. This means you must level up a character from scratch to try a different build and will probably have to make 2 almost identical characters to fix a stupid choice mistake you made on your first try at a class. Some people love this feature but I believe it would be better if you could just have 2 sub-class slots like you have in WoW or if you could get an option to reset points after completing the game. Just my 2 cents.Please buy this and enjoy.			"

Killing so many enemies with the perfect build is just downright satisfying. Especially them crits. Them crits blow em up. It is definitely a good buy.			"

												Great game for fans of the dungeon crawler genre. Far better game than Diablo 3 for much less money, and the mod support keeps the game with constant fresh content.  New game+ and infinite dungeons ensures plenty of content to play through even in vanilla. Check out Synergies mod, it's one of the best.			"

												Torchlight II was even better than the first game.  The more open world feel gives lots of hours of gameplay and this is definitely a game I will continue playing through multiple times.  More entertaining than any other dungeon crawler I've played in a long time.			"

												This is one of the best to date dungeon crawlers/looters around.  If you were pumped up for Diablo III, but was let down then make sure you give TL2 a try! Don't lose faith in the genre.  Torchlight 2 carries on the great visual art style of the first game and the smooth controls.  What really makes TL2 the game to own though is it's multiplayer functionality.  Think a modern day Diablo 2 and you have Torchlght 2! Must have in my book.			"

												The game is great. Espiecally I love the mods. It has great graphics. Though I feel like there is a lack of classes to select however luckily there are mods that add variety to the game in steam. The game menchanics are great. I feel a little icky on the voice acting and plot but I came to accpet it and plus I really don't pay attention to the story at all.  But rather having fun killing monsters, bosses, building my skill tree, and creating awesome weapons. If it had a decent plot and voice acting I would probably say it was a prefect game. Inconclusion, I highly recommend this game!			"

What makes Torchlight superior is all the little details they've built in, in every corner and aspect of the game.  From boss and their animations to secret dungeons found by explorers will to cover the entire map, to pets and fishing.  Well worth the full price and absolute steal on sale.			"

												This is one game that begs for DLC. Only three classes? You've got to be kidding me. That said, onto the good points. This is like Diablo 2, with a few good ideas tacked on, and placed in a fully 3D world. You'll have to forgive the DIablo comparisons, but this game warrants them: it was made by several ex-Diablo Blizzard crew members, and the polish shows. This is about the most comprehensively fun aRPG I have played since the release of D2. Do I like it better than Grim Dawn? Hell yes. Do I like it better than Path of Exile? Well, kinda. Yes, but the price point on Path sells it better; though in my mind, this is a more polished product. Do I like it better than D2? It follows in the same footsteps, so it is a more modern, updated version at its heart.I must at least add that for the price tag, it is the most fun ""Diablo-like"" I have played in about 5+ years, and could easily handwrestle the latest Blizzard release, Diablo 3 if it had tacked on more DLC. The endgame content on this, unfortunately, shortened my journey somewhat. The story is miles above the first Torchlight, and feel more coherent. Here, I feel a sense of *fighting* baddies, making my journey more meaningful. In the last game, everything seemed like an excuse to slay everything around me. This game  reverses the flow, putting plot first, and then allows the killing to begin in sequence, as the game world opens up. No more swimming for a portal that leads into an ever-downward dungeon. Here, there are separate areas, and new ideas, including some not present in D3, and certainly a better skill system than the latter. The first game was a nice time-waster. This one ties that problem up with a new plot, and several better ideas. I still think there should be DLC packs. This game calls for at least 3 more classes, to add online variety, and inspire players to frequent it more often. The narrative is well-done. The gameplay has a few twists on par with D3's treasure goblins. Visuals and art, check: graphics are top-notch. Audio is sufficient, nothing lacking, plenty of variety, no critical mistakes. Everything has an emphatic and crisp thump to it, and objects and fighting have loud *clangs,* and sound realistic, as well as sufficiently solid. Something Path of Exile lacks, I'm afraid. Collision detection is not finicky, like the latter, either. If anything, the only near miss is that emphatic lack of end-game content, along with replay value; easy levelling up to cap; and the few, uninspiring classes that would have been fixed with a shiny bit of DLC.At the time of release, this would have been a 9.5/10. At this point, I feel safer giving it an 8/10, as it is fun, polished, and has variety. Time will tell whether Torchlight supports an online community, and is willing to expand open its gameplay to more modes and challenges. Not in this release, I'm afraid. One thing is for certain: I will be first in line waiting for Torchlight 3. Let's hope for future news! Cheers. :D			"

The art and gameplay are fantastic, and the story line has been great so far (still working through the game). For those that weren't aware, many of the original Blizzard North developers that worked on Diablo 1 & 2 formed Runic and made this game. The game play feels very reminiscent of both of these classics but much better in my honest opinion.			"

The community is good tho, they are open to newbies and ready to help if newbie need some help.despite many good compliments to this game, but still there is some cons that you can find too.such as some set doesn't have complete items or sometime there is some players exploiting bugs , etc.but that is not serious problems, still fun to be played.my rating for this game is 8/10Q : you said this game really good, so why the fish did you rate it to 8/10? how about the other 2?A : i've reach NG+++, and i felt this game to be repetitive at this point, enough said.

												I have always really enjoyed dungeon-crawling RPG's (diablo and the like) and so I am also a very harsh critic of them. To that point, I HATED Torchlight 1, but I am actually a big fan of Torchlight 2. More so than Diablo 3 (pre-Reaper of souls) and more so than dungeon siege 3.This game really did impress me though. The action is fast-paced and quite consistent as well. Gone is Torchlight 1's horrible scheme of 100 levels of same-dungeon-different-layout; now the game plays in more of an open world, where there are connected regions which have various side dungeons (and 'side-quests') within them. You can fill it all in and search for better drops or you can just move foward with the main questline if you like. I am also quite fond of the skill and ability systems. It is very reminiscent of Diablo 2, more so than the third. You can select which character stats to increase, as well as which skills to level up. You don't really have a skill 'tree' as you are free to select them at your own whim. However, there are 'ranks' for each skill which give you a bonus trait or added effects once you hit certain levels with each ability.All in all this game can be very addicting. The visuals and text can be a little too cartoon-y for my taste, but it is very easy to lose track of time while combing a new map or thrashing your way through a dungeon and it is fun to take the (short amount of) time to build your character. Plus there's multiplayer, so fun with a friend!			"

												Torchlight picks up the story where it left off as some new BBEG arises, and looks totally amazing. I hope he's better than the final boss from the first game.... Anyway.Impossibly better than the first, for once, the only things that changed for the better, is everything. They fixed the inventory system by providing three seperate tabs that automatically sort loot when you add it to your inv. This, in turn, means a much bigger inv system (3x bigger to be exact) and is all-in-all a needed and welcome change.Graphics are graphics and while they are improved, honestly it still could've looked like the first and I'd be cool with it. They changed the loot system so now the naMES OF THE WEAPONS APPEAR ABOVE THEM AND YOU'RE ABLE TO CLICK THEM AND PICK THEM UP THAT WAY.You cannot understand how much of good change this is. Oh my goodness I'd pick up the same weapon billions of times to pick up the one I actually wanted once. Its changes like that, small but simple ones. Like how in Pokemon now, you can just sit there and keep healing your pokemon with many potions at once where before you were taken back to your backpack. Such a waste of time. Not anymore.There are tons of pets to choose some, some sillier than others. I still went with the wolf because dog. There are a few other types of dogs (like, humorously, the papillion. Just....why.) There are also more classes to choose from, like the classics: embermage, knight, and 'outlander'. But there are a few new ones I didn't go for like some type of Engineer type thing. I dunno.New loot, new weapons, the hand cannon is very very fun to use. I was sad to not be able to summon clouds of minions to do my bidding but eh.I also was confused to find the buttons to access the inv were in different places. Style choice sure but couldn'tve you kept them where they were? Either way.If you enjoyed Torchlight like I did, this is a real rise to glory, and is more of the same, so get clicking.10/10/10/10/10/10/10			"

												One of my first games on steam, and one of the greatest I have played. Although the learning curve can be quite intence (e.g. learning which stats to upgrade for which character, which armor to use, what the heck poison defence does, and so on), the gameplay is quite incredible. The amount of classes offers massive amounts of replay-abiltity, and that isn't including the procedurally generated maps. I originally played as ember-mage, the most difficult class; and found it awesome. Within each class, you can custumize your character for virtually any kind of gameplay, whether that be running into the middle and slashing things, or standing back and having minions do the slashing for you. The art style is appealing although graphic intensive (it made my laptop overheat, but then again that isn't hard to do xD). After my first playthrough, I went as Engineer and tried to hunt achievements; as it turned out I had missed 3 quests! The depth of the game seems to have no end. And I got a good 60+ hrs out of it. I have heard that the special effects are so intence you can't see the monsters. While I could understand that with 10+ people, I did not have this problem, I played it by myself.Also the pets are slightly idiotic with thier spells, but who's judging?Overall+ Good Gameplay  + Good artstyle+ Pet xD+ Quests are well structured and designed+ Achievements are not impossible, but not easy+ Very customizable+ Huge amount of replay-ability- Hard to just pick up and play (tough learning curve)One of the best on Steam 9/10 "

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time!  If you enjoy games that are simple yet in-depth, Intense but relaxing, and just an all round good time, then this is the game for you. Torchlight 2 is a dungeon crawler lootfest and it never gets old!  The four main classes are all amazingly put together and balanced, not to mention the countless number of user created classes and mods out there to make your experience even more unique and exciting. I reccomend this game to everyone. The only con i can think of is that it gets a bit grindy in some parts, but that doesnt hold this game back from being great and one of my favorites!			"

												I honestly couldn’t believe it at first, but Torchlight II is indeed a massive improvement over the original. I can’t tell you how it compares to Diablo or other Diablo clones, but I can tell you it’s an action RPG that trounces its predecessor in terms of variety and breadth of content.At its base TII has you doing the same things as in the original Torchlight, but Runic Games seems to have done everything it could to make grinding for look more exciting with more places to go, more interesting classes, and more abilities to unlock.Instead of just running around in one town, one main dungeon, and a bunch of extra random dungeons, TII gives you an actual world to explore, split into several environments, each with a main and side dungeons as well as its own visual identity. The first thing I noticed about TII in videos was probably that it had a distinctly different and livelier color palette than the first game. TII looks fresher and a lot more aesthetically pleasing than the first game pretty much just due to better art direction. The first two areas in particular -- a steppe inhabited by monks, and a snowy mountainside, really helped draw me into the game.All TII’s new classes seem to be interesting departures from the norm. In the original Torchlight I ended up picking the class that felt most familiar to me which was the warrior/tank dude. The closest thing in TII is the Berserker which I ended up enjoying a lot more. Yeah Berserkers still just tank everywhere, but the added focus on critical hits, their berserker meter and weapons like claws instead of swords and shields makes playing the class more interesting in my opinion.TII’s sound design also creates a great sense of tactile feedback. Not only does the impact of landing hits in combat sound satisfying, but even the menu interface feels and sounds better when you’re assigning upgrade points and unlocking abilities. I think it helps drive home a sense of real craftsmanship that reminds you TII was indeed made by professional game developers.The best thing Runic did to help get people into TII was creating its excellent demo, which by itself I found to be pretty addicting. It’s basically the first area -- the steppe, stopping after the completion of the first main quest. And even afterwards you can still just mess around in that area which is what I did for a while before buying the game. Once you do you can carry your progress over.TII also adds a New Game+ in which you loop your old character back through the game with enemies leveled higher. You can do this and have enemies level ever higher five times (for a total of six runs through the game). You can keep looping infinitely after that but enemies won’t get any stronger. TII also has multiplayer but I’ve actually only done solo so far.Lastly, TII has been reported to be able to run on integrated graphics, though I can’t confirm this 100 percent.$20 might be a lot for an indie game, but after learning how much content and variety was packed into TII, $20 feels like an excellent price for it.

												I liked this game and I wish I could play it more with others. I really enjoyed the gameplay and the quests. Some of the things are quirky but beware if you go glass cannon you will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Solo is ok if you just want to grind out a few things but if you been playing with friends it is best to stay at the same spot as everyone else so you can progress together. The difficulty level is fairly good for each level with the higher difficulties making it much harder alone. Also, one flaw is the save data, Back it up regularly while your playing. I've lost more then a few characters for god knows what reasons.			"

												I've played a lot of ARPGs which all started with Diablo 2, and I've always craved a similar experience. Recently, or should I say last year, Diablo 3 came out, and to every single Diablo fan, it was an abysmal failure. I won't go into the details but I wasted 200hrs of my life playing that game and hoping it would get better. I eventually moved on and a few months ago picked up Path of Exile, which is another prominent ARPG that actually came out fairly recently. It was great until I started getting to higher difficulties, and whenever I died I lost a TON of experience. All my hard work farming and grinding would go to waste. Additionally, the whole gem skill system was too tedious and required lot of micromanagement to get the skills to work like I wanted them too. Alas, I got back into Torchlight 2 and hoped for a fresh start. This game, initially, made me hesistant because of its cartoony artstyle since I was used to the Dark Fantasy type worlds of POE and D3. But, eventually I started to play  and got over that fact. The gameplay was enjoyable. For example, I enjoyed the fact we could distribute attributes early on and start to specialize in a type of skill set. But what got me hooked on this game was the Loot System and how it was so rewarding to defeat challenging dungeon bosses as well as get great Uniques and Legendaries. Plus, the environment and the side missions, like phase portals, were so unique and everchanging compared to other ARPGs. Also, the end game option like Mapworks and New Game plus adds infinite replayability. This game in essence is what ARPGs should be about. I'm glad I bought this game.			"

												I would say after 72 hours of playing this game. I may have gotten $20.00 worth. The talents trees being a revamp of diablo 2 is nice for character customization. I just wish there where less of them. There are too many skills and without the ability to repec I can't try them all without making another character. However; I do like no durability on amor. Unless you're a survival horror game there is no need to put such gold sinks into the game.			"

												Torchlight II is the obvious sequel to Torchlight by Runic Games. The major difference between the two is Torchlight II has multiplayer via Lan or Internet and the original is only single player. If you like action RPGs and love Diablo this is a no brainer. Its a point and clickish class base game with 4 classes. each with thier on strengths and weaknesses. you go around huge maps looking for quests, loot,gear, and dungeons much like diablo.I personally like Diablo 2 and 3 better but this is a great game and you can pick this game up much cheaper than both. Diablos story is much more serious than Torchlight. Torchlights graphis are more colorful and more cartoon like than Diablos.Diablo advantages:Seasonal play with ladders (Reaper of Souls)More serious graphicsbetter mechanics as far as toon control (movement flows easier)more classes (Reaper of Souls)Torchlight II advantages:Mod supportPets for all classesPets can be sent to town to sell items and purchase potionsPets can attack with spells (once found and equipped)Torchlight II is a must have for any fan of action RPGs and fans of Diablo			"

												Overall: Good value for money.  Decent storyline and plenty of variety in mobs, terrain, weapons and builds. If you liked the first Torchlight or Diablo 2, chances are VERY good that you will like this too. Has both LAN and Online play modes. Great fun with friends.Replay Value: 4 Classes 4 Acts (3 which are reasonably long, last one is a bit short). New game +s introduce higher level mobs and loot, but storyline doesnt change. TONS of mods to mix things up ( but to play online, you need players with the same mods )5 Star Game! Edit: Nominate this for steam awards! :D			"

												This has been a very fun game and one that I keep coming back to. As of this review I have 90 hrs in the game and still plan on playing for a while longer.  With the mod community this game has you can turn this into what you feel is a better game or just play through un-modded, then later on add mods that interest you to make it more fun. I added Synergies Mod and a couple of other UI mods and it has been a ton of fun. Even at the full price of $20.00 it is well woth it. If you are into this genre of game it would be hard to go wrong with this one.			"

												It lost some of the great functions of the first one, like the gems adding up to being better on the trasmuter, instead now they just turn into blood ember, chaos ember, iron ember or void ember, of the respective level. Although I can get why they did this, so you don't get stuck on farm hunting these gems into despair, they made it easy for you to farm them, so you now can get them progressing through the game.The visuals tend to have a grand variety through the game, as you can have an icy tundra first, then have an hot desert the next. Animations are fluid and creative, but it's sad that for the most part the only thing you see is the slicing of flesh and a splatter of blood covering your screen when it's full of monsters. But they did improve a lot on the different type of monsters on the account of the first, let alone the animations that accompany their entrances into the map, which is a nice feature to not just have them all roaming the map.The gameplay is still as fast as the first, where the only time you have to breath is the time you choose, since you don't have to stop by the town everytime you need to sell your items. The monsters, champions and bosses all present their unique signature attacks, that make you adjust your tactic on how to aproach them. Later on, if you don't play close attention to equip yourself the right way though, you'll have serious problems advancing, which I can say is a delicious meal, since you can't do without the crazy amount of items you get through, be it for any stat you desire. On that note, it's most important to delineate the capacity of builds you can do with each class you choose, you can be literally anything with any class, be it ranged, tank, melee, support, etc, although you do need to figure out the twerks of them first before you can really get to it, because they made it so you can't turn back too much on your skills decision, where you can only go back on 3 skill points, leaving you wonder why did they even put that system in. I guess to prevent some bad missclicks on skills you didn't wish to put skill points in.The multiplayer function is fun and explosive, as creatures invade your screen based on the amount of people that are playing with you. Other than that, it's not rewarding enough for what it does, where the items tend to be the same and the monsters get stronger and stronger, leaving you most of the time dead or pressing the health potion constantly, with no way to go around it, since there are a screen full at theme at every turn.Overall, it's the nicest action rpg out there, promising future installments to overcome each time the Runic Games team decides to go forward, which i wish they do, even if they change the IP, please keep the same action packed RPGs they do.P.S.: I didn't commentate the story, because I don't think they really wanted it to be that gratifying for the experience of the player, so i decided to just focus on what they focused to make the game great.

												This game is amazing and worth a buy. But before I get into that, I need to tell you some things.Back when I was a wee lad (about 5), I stumbled upon a game called FATE, and it was an RPG. I put many hours into this game, then, I never saw it again.Until Torchlight came out.This game is based off of FATE and Diablo, as the creator said. So, I played it. Not only was it much better than fate, but a lot more entertaining.Flash foward to 2012, when this beast of a game came out. The environment is amazing. The music was created by THE ONE THE ONLY MATT GOD DAMN FOKING UELMAN!!!!!!This game is legendary, just like its counterparts, FATE and Torchlight 1. Check them both out. They are good time killer games.THERE ARE 4 FATE GAMES ON STEAM NOW. I BOUGHT ALL OF THEM.			"

												This is an excellent game to play with friends of any level, be it casual or hardcore player. I bought myself a copy as well as a copy for my wife and we enjoyed countless hours of fun playing with eachother and with some friends in a 4 player coop group.The graphics of the game are not GPU intensive. But if you're worried about graphical fidelity, the artistic visual style of the game make up for it. The overall storyline is somewhat forgettable, but most action RPG's are like that. It's mainly about fighting, leveling up, and getting some nice rewarding loot to deck out your character.The biggest flaw I would say in the game is a lack of defined ""endgame"" content. It's primarily running through the game multiple times with different difficulty settings and trying out different builds. There are also randomized dungeons through their Map Room mechanic. However, with that said that is still well worth the amount of money you pay for the game, considering the sheer amount of time that can be spent doing these things.The best aspect of Torchlight 2 is the fun visceral gameplay, as well as the ability to extend the game's replayability through modding. If you're a fan of the action rpg genre then I would highly recommend playing TL2.			"

												If you're into dungeon hack-and-slash games with an isometric perspective, you're going to like this game. The art style may be a turn off for some, as it is cartoonish, so you won't get the same dark and gritty feel compared to other similar games like Diablo 3 or Path of Exile. However, the game is much faster paced than the mentioned games, so you'll rarely feel any sort of slowing of pace when it comes to the action. Personally, I have a hard time sticking to a game for very long, but this game has gotten me hooked on it.			"

												I got this game on sale for less than five bucks.  For that price this is AMAZING.  contolled with Mouse and Key but don't let that scare you away if you are a controller person like me.  The game is really easy to control.  Basic gameplay is thus: you are sent on missions and explore dungeons in a 3/4 top down style of play.  You click the mouse to move or attack people and right click to throw projectiles.  You use the number keys for hotkey actions like taking potions or casting spells.  You have tons of weapons and armor and abilities to customize your character and your pet with.  For the price I can easily see myself sinking 20 or 30 hours into this in the next couple of weeks.  8/10.For Linux Users:  Game runs FLAWLESSLY in Linux Mint 17.1 and I am assuming it will run in any Ubuntu based distro fantastically well.  10/10 for a Tux Score.

												This is perhaps one of the best point-and-click fantasy RPG games I have had the pleasure of playing. Not only are there different difficulties and online, a massive selection of pets, multiplayer servers that host up to six players at a time, but the story line and characters are highly interesting.There are four classes to choose from, a mage, an engineer, a gun-slinger, and the classic bezerker. Each has their own special trait that makes each unique and desirable to different types of players. Choosing a class doesn't limit you to their stereotypical equipment, though! Being a dual axe-weilding Embermage and being questioned about  why  I use axes instead of a staff or wand is just a portion of the fun!I am what I presume to be about one-third of the way through the game judging by level and achievement progress, though I intend to continue playing after I complete the game with my current character. Perhaps the biggest problem I'm facing is my pet hawk being so much more powerful than me. then again, I suppose I am the one that taught it such powerful spells and provided stat-boosting equipment in the form of a collar and tags.One of my most recent side quests had me help a man recover masks in an attempt to bring peace to two warring races, and though I won't spoil all the details, it was a perfect, ""Plot twist!!!"" moment that had me grin and facepalm at my want to help (And need for xp!)  He turned out to be evil and needed the masks to gain power. Whoopsies! Was fun defeating him though~ Overall, I would suggest this game to anyone that enjoys RPG-style games that finds others hard to run due to system requirements. The minor issues I experience are not enough to subtract from the experience and pleasure of this game. A 9.5/10			"

The UI is simple and intuitive, and this is the first RPG that allowed me to figure out what to do and what to use and how to use it on my own. Thats not it, attacks and every kind of thing that happens here has an amazing amount of satisfaction in doing it. Attacks sound great, they have great power while it still being fair. And the most awesome thing is that you get a pet, right from the start.And the last but not the least, this is an RPG for which you pay money ONE TIME.

												I stayed away from TL2 for a long time, fearing that it'd be nothing more than a mindless hack and slash.  In ways that's exactly what it is - it's been called 'what Diablo III should have been', but there is some strategy here.  The choices you make in how to equip your character do matter, and the game itself is enjoyable.There's no sandbox world here, though so far it seems large enough.  Basic gameplay consists of undertaking quests with your hardy pet companion, beating the snot out of whoever gets in your way, stealing their loot and getting rewarded for it.  Overall you're chasing after a bad guy called the 'Alchemist' who I'll assume wants to do bad guy things.  I haven't played Torchlight, which makes me feel like I'm missing a little something of the plot - but not enough to affect my enjoyment of the game.Your pet....is awesome, and probably one of the best companions/allies I've ever had in any RPG ever.  I chose a cat, and he just wades into the thick of the melee.  In the demo version I gave him a spell and he sat back with me fireballing everything that looked at us funny.  Sometimes in battles I'd have to stand back to let my hit points recover.  My cat would literally claw his way out, tearing a hole through the enemies and I swear give me a look that said 'wuss.'Don't expect meaningful plot choices or a hundred subplots (though there are side missions.)  That said, if you want to kill some stress by wading into an army of ratlings/skeletons/spiders/politicians and coming out bloodied but unbowed, this game's for you.			"

												One of my favorite games of all time!  Hours and hours of gameplay, The original classes are well balanced and compliment each other very nicely.  You also have the option to download mods and create or download someone else's idea of a good class.  It is not purely fantasy as the game has a strong influence of steampunk as well.  I like the voice acting and this game runs on just about anything you can imagine hardware wise.  It is also 1/3 the price of other big name dungeon crawlers and none of the hassles of DRM.			"

												Torchlight 2 masterfully did what Diablo 3 could have done. It went above and beyond. This is probably due to the majority of the team who made Diablo 2 also working or Torchlight 2. The pets are refreshingly fun (graphically), and being able to see nearly every piece of gear you wear change as you find new equipment is always a HUGE bonus for me.The story is decent - of course, not many people play grindy games like this for the storyline.

												Torchlight 2 is to Diablo 2 as Torchlight 1 is to Diablo 1. Awesome art, cool monsters, open environments, tons of satisfying loot!!! Great continuation of Torchlight story, though the ending falls a bit flat. Unique combination of classes, each with multiple different playstyles. Great game that doesnt take itself too seriously. Captures the spirit of Diablo better than Diablo 3 IMO.			"

												I have always really enjoyed dungeon-crawling RPG's (diablo and the like) and so I am also a very harsh critic of them. To that point, I HATED Torchlight 1, but I am actually a big fan of Torchlight 2. More so than Diablo 3 (pre-Reaper of souls) and more so than dungeon siege 3.This game really did impress me though. The action is fast-paced and quite consistent as well. Gone is Torchlight 1's horrible scheme of 100 levels of same-dungeon-different-layout; now the game plays in more of an open world, where there are connected regions which have various side dungeons (and 'side-quests') within them. You can fill it all in and search for better drops or you can just move foward with the main questline if you like. I am also quite fond of the skill and ability systems. It is very reminiscent of Diablo 2, more so than the third. You can select which character stats to increase, as well as which skills to level up. You don't really have a skill 'tree' as you are free to select them at your own whim. However, there are 'ranks' for each skill which give you a bonus trait or added effects once you hit certain levels with each ability.All in all this game can be very addicting. The visuals and text can be a little too cartoon-y for my taste, but it is very easy to lose track of time while combing a new map or thrashing your way through a dungeon and it is fun to take the (short amount of) time to build your character. Plus there's multiplayer, so fun with a friend!			"

												Short game,fun to play on the internet with others or if you have a local network as well.It has 3 acts only but you can buy additional maps  (from in game gold not from your steam wallet) once you complete the game and those require higher level like 85 to complete,so if you wanna have fun with friends then those maps will be really fun.talking about combat system,its really simple to use and requires just button smashing.so if you have ever played diablo or path of exile then i'd recommend this game for you.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.My Inventory Is Full.

												It is essentially a less Hell-focused Diablo, with more stylized graphics. The pet choice is great fun, although a little strange that an owl can carry as much as a panda. It is fun to load up an alpaca with spells and let him summon zombies and skeletons to his alpaca heart's content - then you send him to town to sell all the unwanted trash gear you've found, and pick up some health brews while he's at it. Great weapon/armor/gear variety, you are constantly upgrading your character with better gear, socketed embers, and enchantments. It can get a little mindless with the click killing, but you can get sucked in just doing one more little side quest. On normal difficulty, at least the first 5-6 hours are pretty easy, I can stand up to a hoarde of oncoming guys and liquify them with a cannon and even if they get through they don't damage much. Next character will defnitely try harder diffculty.In conclusion, GOOD! Especially for the value on $5 sale!			"

												This is a contender for the worst game in this genre.There's no drive, everything can be cheated/modded. The online play is horrible, you and your friends will most likely get bored after 5 minutes because it takes 10 years to load an area for some reason if the host doesn't go first.Not to mention the severe lack of end-game content in this game, want to get gear? oh just farm gold and reset your shops a bunch of times constantly until you either get what you need or run out of money. And either way you'll just be getting an item only to upgrade it at the shop 5 levels later.At least in Diablo 3(which is a million times higher in quality then this game) you used the Auction House and you knew what you were buying ahead of time rather then just gambling away for hours and hours on ends in Goldlight 2: Vendors Edition.Personally this game should be used as an example of what not to do for your dungeon crawler if you ever wanted to create one. No fun, no build varitey, no reason to play.Wouldn't stand a chance against Diablo 2 or Path of Exile.0/10*Save yourself the time and money and just play Path of Exile(Completely free and far above this game in quality and content).

It doesnt matter on which difficulty you play. The Enemies will get hard to kill but you dont get more EXP it just takes longer and you can make the achievements, also the drop rate doesnt encrease so if you just want to play the story then normal or easy is enough.The Story is just there to fill the breaks between the towns nothing special.ConclusionIt a awesome game with nice graphics and good animations for the skills. The maps can be always new generated so you dont have to move with every class on the same map. But if you want to make all 100 lvls then do it on the easy difficulty.			"

												Cute game, I played with my husband. Its hard to find a co-op we can enjoy . For couples  we mostly have only mmos, mobas and other free to play games that just have no story and only want to squize more money out of you. But with Torchlight we bought it at a discount, enjoyed the simple story and played for a few hours until we finished it, no stress. It sayes it's a co-op but it's not a real co-op like ""Divinity original sin"" or ""Brothers"", if we played toghether or separatly it wouldn't have made much  diffrence, in fact on ocasion we played single since our jobs didn't allow for both of us to play at the same time.  And we often got separated while looting... I would see someting shinhy and run off  or I would just follow him and clean up my share of the loot since we had each our own loot drop.... like I said, not a real co-op, but still fun. And for me the graphics are REALLY important and this is a very nice game to look at.			"

												Much better in a lot of ways than the original, yet somehow not really changing much. It's very much like home if you've played the first one, and that can be good or bad depending on what you're expecting.I played through it once, enjoyed it and probably won't go back to it. Worth the money.			"

												This is the true sequel to Diablo II Lord of Destruction.  It has the adictive ARPG elements you would expect, and everything is extreamly polished.  There is no question about it, if you like ARPG's or just RPG's in general you will not be disapointed by this game.  It is great for experianced vet's of the genre, or new players alike with a very nebie friendly UI and gameplay.  Add to that workshop support and you  have far more than $20 worth of content.			"

												Coming from somebody that did play Diablo 2 back in the day (and wasn't as fond of it as other people), this game takes the typical frustrating aspects of that game and throws them out the window. While it's possible that Diablo 3 does some of these things as well, I'm afraid I haven't played that game yet. First, you can load up your pet with unwanted loot and send it back to town while in the middle of a dungeon to sell for you. Generally returning after two minutes. You can even have it purchase stuff in town for you, like potions or scrolls. It's so nice to not have to constantly port back to town to empty out my inventory. You also don't have to click on gold to pick it up. You just have to walk over it. I may never play Diablo 2 again after getting used to such a nice feature. You get a hotbar for skills. You don't even need to have potions take up space on it because pressing Z or X automatically uses your best healing or mana potion. So I can press 1 for a firestorm, press 2 for fire pillars, press 3 to summon a ghost, etc. It kinda feels like playing an MMO. You can find ambiguous spells on any character that you can have four of equiped at any time, offering some variety into your gameplay. Like a spell that summons a horde of zombies, or a simple fireball, or a passive buff to your EXP and gold earned. The really cool part is that your pet also gets four spell slots and will use any spells automatically when you get into a fight and they're off cooldown. I have my pet set to summon two hordes of zombies AND some skeleton archers, with a passive spell that increases his damage and shortens the time it takes for him to get back from town. There's so much this game does right that it makes me kinda disappointed that the devs have moved on to other projects and don't plan to update Torchlight 2 anymore. But still, the game has easy intigration built in for the modding community. Totally recommended.			"

												I'm VERY impressed with Torchlight 2.  As far as ARPG's go this one is definetly my favorite. The world is huge, there are plenty of monsters to fight and TONS of loot to be had. There are up to 4 classes you can play, You also can have a pet companion or a minion and there are a few to choose from. There are also a fantastic amount of skills you can pick  from to help you along in your slaying. I was sold on the fact that there is offline single player, but you can play multiplayer co-op as well if that suits your fancy. Graphically the game is cartoony but is well done and looks good. The interface works very well and everything is bindable so no problems there either. The music compliments the game very well, adding a good amount of atmosphere. The price is $20 which is incredible for the amount of polished game you get,  so by all means grab this title, you won't be disappointed.			"

 What I really like about Torchlight  Very fast paced combat and progression, abilities are spammable, fights are quick. The visual feedbacks are great (eg. ability effects, gems in weapons = flaming sword). Same applies to atmospheres, they simply rock! Each item has its own model, and there are lots of items - your character could have any appearance you want, let it be a knight outfit, steampunk or voodoo set. Character classes are all exciting and unique, a mage is not simply a 'Right-Click to cast Fireball' cliche. This is kind of subjective, but Torchlight does have a sweet Diablo nostalgia effect. Your character comes with a pet, whom you can customize by teaching spells - yes, you can have a Zombie-raising Alpaca as a side-kick. There is a fun end-game content - which is endless, awesome and random enough to be enjoyable for a long time. Things to consider Overall, I think Torchlight is excellent in the genre and there are no deal breakers other than its cartoonish and sometimes colorful style. My only annoyance is the lack of possibility to fully respec my character (without mods and cheats) when I want to try out other builds with a high level toon or fix early messups in my stat points for example.I totally recommend Torchlight II, especially online with friends!

												Cute game, I played with my husband. Its hard to find a co-op we can enjoy . For couples  we mostly have only mmos, mobas and other free to play games that just have no story and only want to squize more money out of you. But with Torchlight we bought it at a discount, enjoyed the simple story and played for a few hours until we finished it, no stress. It sayes it's a co-op but it's not a real co-op like ""Divinity original sin"" or ""Brothers"", if we played toghether or separatly it wouldn't have made much  diffrence, in fact on ocasion we played single since our jobs didn't allow for both of us to play at the same time.  And we often got separated while looting... I would see someting shinhy and run off  or I would just follow him and clean up my share of the loot since we had each our own loot drop.... like I said, not a real co-op, but still fun. And for me the graphics are REALLY important and this is a very nice game to look at.			"

												Of course I recommend this game.  I've spent over 1000 hours on it.  Oy!There are two things I love best about this game:Tight, exciting combat.Class flexibility.The combat and loot grind are all that matter in TL2.  Any semblance of a story is just fluff.  The combat, thankfully then, is very fun.  Tons of exciting, satisfying abilities and weapons to throw at your enemies.  Add in multiplayer and it's even better.Being able to create most any character your heart desires really triggers my altoholism.  It even drove me to create a few of my own classes in GUTS for MORE options.  Apparently it drove quite a few people to GUTS, because we have a number of really awesome community-built classes.  Check out the Workshop page.  It's one of the most active on Steam behind Skyrim and Gary's mod and... and I think that's it.			"

I cannot say anything bad about it. On top of how great it is, it has steam workshop with mods available. The only downfall with mods is that the game is launched two different ways: launch with mods or launch without mods. If you pick up the game and start playing with the normal game launch, you cannot use your current files with the mods. I also haven't tried to see if I can copy files over though.10/10 hope there is a third one11/10 with rice!			"

If you enjoy games that are simple yet in-depth, Intense but relaxing, and just an all round good time, then this is the game for you. Torchlight 2 is a dungeon crawler lootfest and it never gets old!  The four main classes are all amazingly put together and balanced, not to mention the countless number of user created classes and mods out there to make your experience even more unique and exciting. I reccomend this game to everyone. The only con i can think of is that it gets a bit grindy in some parts, but that doesnt hold this game back from being great and one of my favorites!			"

												I honestly couldn’t believe it at first, but Torchlight II is indeed a massive improvement over the original. I can’t tell you how it compares to Diablo or other Diablo clones, but I can tell you it’s an action RPG that trounces its predecessor in terms of variety and breadth of content.At its base TII has you doing the same things as in the original Torchlight, but Runic Games seems to have done everything it could to make grinding for look more exciting with more places to go, more interesting classes, and more abilities to unlock.Instead of just running around in one town, one main dungeon, and a bunch of extra random dungeons, TII gives you an actual world to explore, split into several environments, each with a main and side dungeons as well as its own visual identity. The first thing I noticed about TII in videos was probably that it had a distinctly different and livelier color palette than the first game. TII looks fresher and a lot more aesthetically pleasing than the first game pretty much just due to better art direction. The first two areas in particular -- a steppe inhabited by monks, and a snowy mountainside, really helped draw me into the game.All TII’s new classes seem to be interesting departures from the norm. In the original Torchlight I ended up picking the class that felt most familiar to me which was the warrior/tank dude. The closest thing in TII is the Berserker which I ended up enjoying a lot more. Yeah Berserkers still just tank everywhere, but the added focus on critical hits, their berserker meter and weapons like claws instead of swords and shields makes playing the class more interesting in my opinion.TII’s sound design also creates a great sense of tactile feedback. Not only does the impact of landing hits in combat sound satisfying, but even the menu interface feels and sounds better when you’re assigning upgrade points and unlocking abilities. I think it helps drive home a sense of real craftsmanship that reminds you TII was indeed made by professional game developers.The best thing Runic did to help get people into TII was creating its excellent demo, which by itself I found to be pretty addicting. It’s basically the first area -- the steppe, stopping after the completion of the first main quest. And even afterwards you can still just mess around in that area which is what I did for a while before buying the game. Once you do you can carry your progress over.TII also adds a New Game+ in which you loop your old character back through the game with enemies leveled higher. You can do this and have enemies level ever higher five times (for a total of six runs through the game). You can keep looping infinitely after that but enemies won’t get any stronger. TII also has multiplayer but I’ve actually only done solo so far.Lastly, TII has been reported to be able to run on integrated graphics, though I can’t confirm this 100 percent.$20 might be a lot for an indie game, but after learning how much content and variety was packed into TII, $20 feels like an excellent price for it.

												I liked this game and I wish I could play it more with others. I really enjoyed the gameplay and the quests. Some of the things are quirky but beware if you go glass cannon you will be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Solo is ok if you just want to grind out a few things but if you been playing with friends it is best to stay at the same spot as everyone else so you can progress together. The difficulty level is fairly good for each level with the higher difficulties making it much harder alone. Also, one flaw is the save data, Back it up regularly while your playing. I've lost more then a few characters for god knows what reasons.			"

												I've played a lot of ARPGs which all started with Diablo 2, and I've always craved a similar experience. Recently, or should I say last year, Diablo 3 came out, and to every single Diablo fan, it was an abysmal failure. I won't go into the details but I wasted 200hrs of my life playing that game and hoping it would get better. I eventually moved on and a few months ago picked up Path of Exile, which is another prominent ARPG that actually came out fairly recently. It was great until I started getting to higher difficulties, and whenever I died I lost a TON of experience. All my hard work farming and grinding would go to waste. Additionally, the whole gem skill system was too tedious and required lot of micromanagement to get the skills to work like I wanted them too. Alas, I got back into Torchlight 2 and hoped for a fresh start. This game, initially, made me hesistant because of its cartoony artstyle since I was used to the Dark Fantasy type worlds of POE and D3. But, eventually I started to play  and got over that fact. The gameplay was enjoyable. For example, I enjoyed the fact we could distribute attributes early on and start to specialize in a type of skill set. But what got me hooked on this game was the Loot System and how it was so rewarding to defeat challenging dungeon bosses as well as get great Uniques and Legendaries. Plus, the environment and the side missions, like phase portals, were so unique and everchanging compared to other ARPGs. Also, the end game option like Mapworks and New Game plus adds infinite replayability. This game in essence is what ARPGs should be about. I'm glad I bought this game.			"

												If you're into dungeon hack-and-slash games with an isometric perspective, you're going to like this game. The art style may be a turn off for some, as it is cartoonish, so you won't get the same dark and gritty feel compared to other similar games like Diablo 3 or Path of Exile. However, the game is much faster paced than the mentioned games, so you'll rarely feel any sort of slowing of pace when it comes to the action. Personally, I have a hard time sticking to a game for very long, but this game has gotten me hooked on it.			"

												I got this game on sale for less than five bucks.  For that price this is AMAZING.  contolled with Mouse and Key but don't let that scare you away if you are a controller person like me.  The game is really easy to control.  Basic gameplay is thus: you are sent on missions and explore dungeons in a 3/4 top down style of play.  You click the mouse to move or attack people and right click to throw projectiles.  You use the number keys for hotkey actions like taking potions or casting spells.  You have tons of weapons and armor and abilities to customize your character and your pet with.  For the price I can easily see myself sinking 20 or 30 hours into this in the next couple of weeks.  8/10.For Linux Users:  Game runs FLAWLESSLY in Linux Mint 17.1 and I am assuming it will run in any Ubuntu based distro fantastically well.  10/10 for a Tux Score.

The game keeps me coming back for more.I would defintely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good action RPG.			"

												Coming from somebody that did play Diablo 2 back in the day (and wasn't as fond of it as other people), this game takes the typical frustrating aspects of that game and throws them out the window. While it's possible that Diablo 3 does some of these things as well, I'm afraid I haven't played that game yet. First, you can load up your pet with unwanted loot and send it back to town while in the middle of a dungeon to sell for you. Generally returning after two minutes. You can even have it purchase stuff in town for you, like potions or scrolls. It's so nice to not have to constantly port back to town to empty out my inventory. You also don't have to click on gold to pick it up. You just have to walk over it. I may never play Diablo 2 again after getting used to such a nice feature. You get a hotbar for skills. You don't even need to have potions take up space on it because pressing Z or X automatically uses your best healing or mana potion. So I can press 1 for a firestorm, press 2 for fire pillars, press 3 to summon a ghost, etc. It kinda feels like playing an MMO. You can find ambiguous spells on any character that you can have four of equiped at any time, offering some variety into your gameplay. Like a spell that summons a horde of zombies, or a simple fireball, or a passive buff to your EXP and gold earned. The really cool part is that your pet also gets four spell slots and will use any spells automatically when you get into a fight and they're off cooldown. I have my pet set to summon two hordes of zombies AND some skeleton archers, with a passive spell that increases his damage and shortens the time it takes for him to get back from town. There's so much this game does right that it makes me kinda disappointed that the devs have moved on to other projects and don't plan to update Torchlight 2 anymore. But still, the game has easy intigration built in for the modding community. Totally recommended.			"

You know, that one that spent countless hours dungeon crawling through with you guild and friends.  This is the game that brings what was once lost back to us with gusto!  This have multiple options that make it a real bonus among the Diablo set, because not only do you a great game with a great story, but you also get probably one the best sets of expandable content through steam.  Setting up you account for online access through Runic Games is a little odd, but once done, you have access to all your friends on steam and many different options to play.  If you looking for replayability, this is the game for you, well worth your money to pick this up! RUNIC games did an outstanding job creating what reallly outdoes anything they have done before.

												This is one of my favorite games. I love the art style and the combat is very well done, making you feel engaged, and interested. The story line is there if you want it, with the main storyline voiced to you, and the side quest readable if you are interested. The quests feel relevent and aren't to long or to short. The environments are also fun and well made, along with the monsters and creatures within. The diversity of the classes and pets make co-op very fun allowing your friends and you to take certain roles such as tank, damage, or support. There are many ability powers you can gain and they unlock at a good pace. Theres also some very cool looking armor sets and weapons that you can find or purchase. Overall the gameplay is amazing and its price is increadable for what it offers (Developers say that all DLC will be included for free as its released). Hands down the best 20$ game I have ever bought. Gameplay 10/10. Value 10/10.			"

												10/10 - As a fan of the original Torchlight, I was eager to try out this release and have not been disapointed!  With immersive game play and endless character customisations Torchlight II is highly addictive.  As many other reviews have mentioned, if you are a lover of Diablo II then give this game a shot.My favourite feature in Torchlight is the unique pet system; you chose from a wide selection of strong companions with customisable gears and skills.  These companions are very functional and an important support tool.  They can be fed different food (that you fish yourself from ponds discovered throughout the game) which morph your pet into different creatures that provide various stat bonuses for a limited period of time.Well made, no problems at all with bugs etc.			"

												Take Diablo, think it through to the end and add whatever you think is missing. What you get is Torchlight 2.The settings are more colorful and so are the characters. You play either as mage, berserk, ranger or - and that's something you don't see often - engineer. Which is giving the whole story some nice steam-punk elements.The engineer uses handheld cannons, heavy weapons and builds robots, which means that he is pretty much the modern take on your good-old necromancer (minus the romance and plus the sledgehammer).The story itself is pretty simple. The ""alchemist"" (the hero you played in Torchlight 1) turns mad, BBQs his former allies and seeks world domination the unfriendly way. Meaning: he doesn't really believe in free-speech or elections.You are sent after him to make him reconsider.Which makes Torchlight 2 basically a Diablo 2 with better graphics minus Lucifer and plus Steam-Punk. Also with pets, multiplayer support and Steam workshop.Do you REALLY need anything else to feel convinced?Okay, fine! It also contains the option to have a head-crab as a pet and the ability to catch mutated fish that turn your pet head-crab into an angry treasure chest, trying to eat you. There!			"

												After sitting down for 13 hours straight to complete this game -including all the sidequests-, I've found gameplay to be pretty fun with all the unique skills available. HOWEVER that being said it's evident that the story is short and the endgame content is just simply a grind much like how Diablo 2 functions. The enemies' HP bars just turn into skill-soaking sponges that are only there to delay you for 5-10 seconds just for that 0.1mm xp bar gain. I will comment on the very nice smooth visual aspects of the game, the artwork for the game and the texture quality will not leave your eyes sore after bingle playing it.Runic games did fix the one balance issue I saw from TL1 which was the pet meta where you would just summon everything to kill stuff for you while you just walked around. Gameplay is still lacking a bit because in the endgame you just need to healtank with potions that drop from ♥♥♥♥in everything ALONG WITH the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t aegis shield that you could proc which was basically 4x your normal health. Stuff like this leads away from interesting and interactive gameplay because you can just stand in the middle of everything pressing 1-9 and watching the visuals go off until everything around you is dead without much thought, hell near the end I just opened up youtube and watched Dota videos while I grinded maps because it's simply so braindead at times. To be honest the story is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥ but thats up for you to decide. Now I know most of you will say that mods make this game better but I can't acknowledge that due to the fact that I never touched mods and even with mods the endgame is still a dead grind.The game is worth the $20 to buy it but it goes on sale so much it's probably worth $10 at most. Runic Games has no plans to release a TL3 which saddens me. I love TL2 but I just don't love it enough to see myself logging on every day to grind for nothing.Game is fun for a period of time. Really though, it just turns into a grind with pretty visuals.  If you're into grindy dungeoncrawlers I suggest you milk all the playability out of this game and move on to Diablo 2.			"

												Torchlight II would be amazing if there was more of an end-game to speak of. The multiplayer is a huge step in the right direction, but Runic's not there just yet. Gimpy PVP is a non-factor and a low item diversity means every character of a given class is shooting for the exact same gear at level 100. Game modifications and saving character files locally is a double-edged sword; while it is nice to have community contributions, it also makes cheating a breeze. Difficulty scaling is rather uneven through New Game Plus 2 and beyond, and characters that have advanced that far are unable to join games or play with those that are not on the same stage of NG+ progression. While I wish there was a broader meta, this is still the best loot-'em-up I've played since Diablo II.			"

												FULL REVIEW:Gameplay: 10/10Torchlight II, by Runic Games, expands the Torchlight universe from where it first started in the original game. Torchlight II is an improvement in pretty much every way. For people who say that this game is a Diablo copy, it's not. Diablo doesn't have companions that fight for you, sell your stuff, and look adorable. There are four classes, and you can pretty much build them however you want. Levelling up your skills is easy and you can master some sick combos. There's really no wrong way to play Torchlight, which is what sets it apart from most ARPGs where you're expected to stick to some meta that the devs make for you.Monsters are challenging, bosses and side quests are VERY rewarding, and you can really feel like a (good) marauder in the deserts or swamps of Torchlight.Story: 4/10Well, it's an ARPG...don't expect much if you're looking for story. The story is very generic and there's no real characters that you side with or feel bad for. It's the classic chaotic-evil robot dude trying to wreck humanity with lots of baddies along the way.Other: 9/10Torchlight II can be modded, and Runic Games even made a mod creator so that you can mod the game for yourself! Additionally, you can play in local co-op, which in my opinion is where the replayability comes from. The few flaws in this game are just some minor crashes and that you end up having too many abilities for your own good. Someone should make a mod where you get another action bar. Seriously.Final verdict: 8.5/10Torchlight II is probably the best ARPG dungeon crawler on Steam. The art style is wonderful, the gameplay is exhilarating, and you'll always find yourself crawling back to try out new classes that people made online or going on hardcore mode with friends. The flaws are minimal, and overall it's a close to perfect game with plenty of fun to offer.			"

												Experience of playing as 2-handed engy on Veteran Act III: ""wtf just hit me I'm dead""This game is good. From the soothing string music to humorous weapon descriptions, there is a lot to see and play.  Loot drops rate are just right. Game mechanics are tight and well done (aside from the armor system) You don't have to go crazy on grinding for a proper weapon. Unique-tier weapons look pretty cool and have great descriptions to boot. Their damage and stats also fit your requirements for reasonably long, unlike that one FPS where your purple-rarity gun does♥♥♥♥♥♥damage 2-3 levels later. Apples to oranges. I don't care.The inclusion of ""Arcane Stats"", where you can see your actual damage output, proc chances, actual armor after bonuses factor in, etc, is really, really useful. This helps a lot in planning your build, and you don't have to do convoluted calculations to find your optimum loadout, and try to figure out whether a particular bonus is additive, multiplicative, applied post-multiplication, blahblah.The UI is very well built, comparing gear is easy, organizing items is easy, weapon damage is listed in DPS (honestly, why the hell not).However, when it comes to the really-high difficulties (NG+ Veteran, NG Elite, Mapworks), the armor system starts to show some bad problems if you play a tanking class. Armor damage reduction is calculated point-by-point rather as a percentage. Meaning if you have 800 armor, you will reduce an incoming attack by 800 damage. To play a serious build during Elite NG++ levels, you will have to farm for damage reduction socketables if you plan on consistently not dying when a mob so much as breathes on you.To quote Cthon from the TL2 forums:""Armor is basically meaningless. Not only is it badly outscaled by monster damage, but its effectiveness is also reduced by any damage reduction you have. To be as charitable as possible to armor, it's reasonably effective early on before monster damage scaling really gets going. A player who only did the first playthrough and did not do mapworks or NG+ might not encounter very many situations where no feasible amount of armor makes a meaningful difference.""^This applies to anything above normal difficulty.Again, nobody cares about the story. Play on veteran mode if you've played RPGs before, normal is kinda easy.			"

												This game is a great one, that as some others have mentioned plays a lot like Diablo.  It's cool that you can replay levels and the weapons / armor get progressively better as you move through the game and level up.  My only wish is that you could carry more stuff at a time because it gets annoying to keep having to send your pet back to town to sell things.  I got this game on sale and it was a terrific buy.

With the mod community this game has you can turn this into what you feel is a better game or just play through un-modded, then later on add mods that interest you to make it more fun. I added Synergies Mod and a couple of other UI mods and it has been a ton of fun. Even at the full price of $20.00 it is well woth it. If you are into this genre of game it would be hard to go wrong with this one.			"

												Enough of the Diablo 2 comparisons - the genre has evolved enough to......wait....ha ha who the hell am I kidding. Torchlight 2 is something like Antje Traue; it's silently risen to the apex of its genre (or in Traue's case, she's climbed over the plastic American bimbos from Hollywood and has become the most attractive woman in the universe). I was never too interested in the first TL game, but this was mostly because I was ingesting too much morphine and I had a serious porn addiction. What immediately grabbed me about its sequel, however, was its foundation in the Steamworks system. It's so simple to download and install mods, and while it's technically limited to ten active at any one time, it's quite easy to combine mods in the GUTS editor. As of the end of 2013, I really have no idea why any developer wouldn't want this implemented in their gaming environment. It extends playability by an infinite margin, and the only excuse I could think of from ""big-time"" publishers is that they really couldn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥if people play their game - they only care about sales. (Insert TORtanic joke here.) But okay, enough soapboxing. Is it worth buying? If you're even remotely intrigued by the isometric hack-n-slash model, this game is a godsend (remark about religion). It's visceral, bloody, fast-paced, and there are so many different ways to play. I don't remember how many vanilla classes there are, but if you get off your soggy♥♥♥♥♥for two seconds you can find about twenty new classes in the workshop. There is so much to offer in this package, and you should buy it. 10/10 would play again			"

												(I try to be 100% honest in my reviews. Enjoy!)Torchlight II is an action/RPG/hack n' slash game set in an extremely colorful and fictional world. I played the first game on the Xbox and absolutely loved it, and in many ways, Torchlight II picks up the slack where the first game didn't.In terms of story, both gams are lacking. MINOR SPOILER: In the first game, one of the allies you make in the game injects himself with Ember and becomes the main bad guy. (I believe his name is the Alchemist.) In the sequel, the Alchemist returns and burns Torchlight, so you have to go and defeat him again. Along the way, you will find sidequests and bosses to fight that will help you level up so you can defeat the next boss, level up, defeat the next boss, etc. While this main seem boring and repetitive, in the eight hours I've played the game Torchlight II has never felt tedious or exhausting. (Only recently it has become slightly annoying due to enemies called Sandrats that are SO HARD TO KILL.) Other than that, the bosses always offer up a new spin and are just enough to keep you on your toes.Where Torchlight II shines from its predecessor is the revamped menus. It's so easy to find loot and determine if it's better than yours or not, find if weapons do more damage than the one you have, etc. You also have the ability to have two sets of weapons. (I prefer having a ranged set and a melee set, but do whatever you want if you buy this.) The customization of characters is fairly extensive, especially with the added pets you can have to help you. And I must say, the pets are EXTREMELY helpful.Other small fixes include better warning systems on Trapped Chests. (Fans of the first game will get what I mean,) as well as more mana abilites that will allow you to take out several enemies at once, and also some very wide open areas where you can free people from slave caravans, take on monsters, and if you're lucky, find a Phase Beast that will give you a Phase Portal. (Warning: Entering a Phase Portal will take you to a fairly challenging arena battle, but the loot is incredible.)My only complaint about Torchlight II, and this may just be a glitch for me, but recently I have been collecting loot that is WAY out of my level range. I don't know if I missed a couple of sidequests that would have pushed me to a higher level to get better equipment. I wouldn't think they would make the sidequests necessary for leveling up in the main quests, because they are supposed to be bonus things for XP and so on.10/10Better Than TorchlightFun And ChallengingMay Get RepetitiveMinor Leveling IssuesI hope this review helps you make your decision!

												I started playing action RPGs with the original Diablo.  For my money, this is the best game I've experienced in the genre, and with all the mod content out there the replayability is through the roof.  I've most recently been playing through with the Far East Expansions, the Essentials, and most of the Synergies stuff, and I did a hardcore normal-difficulty vanilla engineer run that... ended sooner than I had hoped.  But I keep coming back to it after other games have grown stale, so there's obviously something still releasing the reward chemicals in my monkey brain.			"

												Torchlight picks up the story where it left off as some new BBEG arises, and looks totally amazing. I hope he's better than the final boss from the first game.... Anyway.Impossibly better than the first, for once, the only things that changed for the better, is everything. They fixed the inventory system by providing three seperate tabs that automatically sort loot when you add it to your inv. This, in turn, means a much bigger inv system (3x bigger to be exact) and is all-in-all a needed and welcome change.Graphics are graphics and while they are improved, honestly it still could've looked like the first and I'd be cool with it. They changed the loot system so now the naMES OF THE WEAPONS APPEAR ABOVE THEM AND YOU'RE ABLE TO CLICK THEM AND PICK THEM UP THAT WAY.You cannot understand how much of good change this is. Oh my goodness I'd pick up the same weapon billions of times to pick up the one I actually wanted once. Its changes like that, small but simple ones. Like how in Pokemon now, you can just sit there and keep healing your pokemon with many potions at once where before you were taken back to your backpack. Such a waste of time. Not anymore.There are tons of pets to choose some, some sillier than others. I still went with the wolf because dog. There are a few other types of dogs (like, humorously, the papillion. Just....why.) There are also more classes to choose from, like the classics: embermage, knight, and 'outlander'. But there are a few new ones I didn't go for like some type of Engineer type thing. I dunno.New loot, new weapons, the hand cannon is very very fun to use. I was sad to not be able to summon clouds of minions to do my bidding but eh.I also was confused to find the buttons to access the inv were in different places. Style choice sure but couldn'tve you kept them where they were? Either way.If you enjoyed Torchlight like I did, this is a real rise to glory, and is more of the same, so get clicking.10/10/10/10/10/10/10			"

												Great game, Diablo style.Pros: Great adventure, decent story, great multiplayer experience, great variety in playstyle & items and last but not least GREAT mod support.Cons: Game gets stale (I explain that more under this message), clicking the right enemy can get quite hard, when trying to run I often attack an enemy instead of moving.Game gets stale explained: When I play the game what I find happening is that I start getting underleveled. The enemies get much higher level than I do, and the game just goes on a chugging potions spree. A purple colored boss can usually for 5 potions. This makes me feel like I am cheesing the game, and the constant potion chugging makes it so an archer can literally tank a huge boss by just drinking potions non-stop.The game is EXTREMELY good the first 2 hours, but when you get further into the game it gets kinda repetetive too.Although I make it sound harsh it is a game that I strongly encourage everyone to get, and it is a game that I feel I can play lots and lots without getting bored.7/10			"

The UI is simple and intuitive, and this is the first RPG that allowed me to figure out what to do and what to use and how to use it on my own. Thats not it, attacks and every kind of thing that happens here has an amazing amount of satisfaction in doing it. Attacks sound great, they have great power while it still being fair. And the most awesome thing is that you get a pet, right from the start.And the last but not the least, this is an RPG for which you pay money ONE TIME.

I feel a little icky on the voice acting and plot but I came to accpet it and plus I really don't pay attention to the story at all.  But rather having fun killing monsters, bosses, building my skill tree, and creating awesome weapons. If it had a decent plot and voice acting I would probably say it was a prefect game.

												gameplay has been a great but it seems too kiddy. The washed out colors at times blinds the player. Having played Titan Quest( which I love) in the past has helped me adapte ery well to the mechanics of this game. Wish the colors werent so vibrant and more detail added. Overall this Game to me is a must buy if you like this type of game play			"

The skillsets are indepth and interesting. I like using my Berserker's abilities. One of the skills reminds me of the charge attack of the Vanguard from Mass Effect. :)So, all in all, I would give this a 9/10 in my book.

												Did you enjoy the first Diablo and Diablo II? Do you revel in the wholesale slaughter of anything in your way? Have you ever wondered what happens when you cross WoW-esque graphics with Diablo's grimdark setting?If you answered yes to any or all of these, I highly suggest you check out Torchlight II. As you can expect, this is the sequal to Torchlight, and basically the hero from the previous story ended up going slightly... umm... well, he needs to be stopped now. So please exterminate with extreme prejeduce and... oh, right, please don't go nuts yourself so we have to send someone else after you next. Sound familiar? Well, it probably should, since a good chunk of the team that did D2 left Blizzard and worked on this game. I personally feel that it is a more natural successor to D2 than D3 was, but that's a more personal opinion. So, enough gushing, let's get down to the brass tacks. You've got four classes: Embermage (glass canon caster), Outlander (think Ranger), Berserker (melee brute class), and Engineer (Tankiest tank that ever tanked). Each class has their own skill trees that you can progress down. Skill resets are rare and come in the form of potions that cannot be purchased, they must be found by killing extremely powerful opponents. You can, however, reset your last choice fairly easily, if you made a mistake on that one skill selection. However, honestly... there are no *bad* choices, only a matter of what you want to do.There are no class-restricted weapons or armor (barring class-specific legendaries), so you can have an Engineer dual-wielding pistols or wielding a staff if you want. However, certain class skills only function with certain weapon classes or gear combinations. Typically, you plan out a 'build', or find one online that you think you might like, and work toward it. Or you can do what I do and just play around with the skills until you find something that fits your play style. There are several difficulty settings, and the game is generally forgiving of mistakes. Unless you choose Hardcore mode, death is a very minor inconvenience, leading to a game which is very accepting of a casual playstyle. Your pet is another topic I would like to touch on. Not simply additional damage like your Merc was in D2, it has its own inventory and can cary trash loot and even run it back to sell for you while you continue on slaughtering things. You very rarely ever need to 'town portal' back because your pet handles all necessary transactions. In addition, your pet can learn spells that it will then cast appropriately. Yes, your pet can learn a Silence spell which it will then spam when it is in combat. Your pet's sell mechanic and the 'Charge' system both strongly encourage a 'forward momentum' style of playing, encouraging you to charge bravely forward rather than hesitating and hanging back, rewarding players for heroically charging into the thick of things. Oh, one last thing. It's now SteamOS compatible, meaning Linux compatible, for all those penguins who are looking to get their Diablo fix in without having to use WINE or PlayOnLinux. Personally, I love it. Even with the color palette that it uses, it still keeps that grimdark atmosphere and isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. There's also tons of easter eggs to find that will keep any true nerd laughting until dawn. But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. Worst case, you spent money you might have used to go get a cup of coffee. Best case, you find the game as entertaining as I do.			"

												I have always really enjoyed dungeon-crawling RPG's (diablo and the like) and so I am also a very harsh critic of them. To that point, I HATED Torchlight 1, but I am actually a big fan of Torchlight 2. More so than Diablo 3 (pre-Reaper of souls) and more so than dungeon siege 3.This game really did impress me though. The action is fast-paced and quite consistent as well. Gone is Torchlight 1's horrible scheme of 100 levels of same-dungeon-different-layout; now the game plays in more of an open world, where there are connected regions which have various side dungeons (and 'side-quests') within them. You can fill it all in and search for better drops or you can just move foward with the main questline if you like. I am also quite fond of the skill and ability systems. It is very reminiscent of Diablo 2, more so than the third. You can select which character stats to increase, as well as which skills to level up. You don't really have a skill 'tree' as you are free to select them at your own whim. However, there are 'ranks' for each skill which give you a bonus trait or added effects once you hit certain levels with each ability.All in all this game can be very addicting. The visuals and text can be a little too cartoon-y for my taste, but it is very easy to lose track of time while combing a new map or thrashing your way through a dungeon and it is fun to take the (short amount of) time to build your character. Plus there's multiplayer, so fun with a friend!			"

												I joined late into Diablo III and it never really clicked for me. I ended up getting this game on sale and figured I would never play it, but playing this game with friends brought back all fun I used to have as a kid playing Diable II. If you were a fan of Diablo II and have some friends to join you I would heavily suggest this game.			"

												The game has so much to it, you can discover so many ability combos, which makes the game so much more fun. One of the best RPG games there is. Also if you're interested in challenging achievements, this game has one of the craziest achievements to get. Some of them are really difficult to get.I highly recommend Torchlight 2, one of my favourite RPG games.			"

												Adequate, but not exceptional Diablo-esque.  While the first torchlight was diablo inspired, this is more like diablo 2, done softcore.  There are moments that will give you flashbacks to D2: fetishes in a jungle (no joke), (seemingly) endless deserts and sewers, and a barely-there plot.  Unfortunately, they toned down some of the best things about D2 and left some of the worst.  If you like this genre, it's definitely worth a go.The good:+ There are no bad skills.  Although there are absolutely a few exceptional skills for each class that are much better than the rest, all of the skills will get you through the game just fine.  There are typically two skills that you start with that will take you through the first playthrough.  Then there's a ""better"" skill that unlocks at 48, which will take you further.  Most of the middle skills are, well, middling.+ Classes are balanced.  I played through with all the classes, Beserker was the surprise favorite (great mobility, great damage, great damage mitigation, great healing, best endgame set, no obvious downside).  The engineer and embermage lag a bit, but not much.  Outlander is solid.  All classes were very viable, even if they played mostly the same (same utility skills in the same spots in the trees).+ Lots of fun little flourishes in some of the art.  Witches appear from a swirl of bats.  Werewolves hang from the rafters and drop down to say hi.+ Enchanting system is much better than T1, skull/eye/gems mimic D2's runes, gambling is actually fun.+ Pacing is mostly good.  A few slow parts, but overall fine.+ Mod scene has produced some very good things.  Not my thing, but it could be yours.+ Lots of achievements.The cons:- Loot.  You'd think this would be a plus; it's not.  Loot progression is fine for the first 20 levels (Act 1) with upgrades reasonably frequent and meaningful, then it hits a wall.  After 20, gear no longer really improves outside of the weapons getting bigger DPS numbers.  Most of the endgame sets don't even bother to have stats - seriously.  My first playthrough, I wore almost the same gear from act 2 till the end.  It's seriously that bad.  The problem is that there's a ton of useless modifiers (armor of all types), and only two or three modifiers that do anything...and those are mostly the +stat options.  Uniques are mostly mediocre; set bonuses are good in a couple cases, but mostly yawn-worthly; even the legendaries aren't that good.- You will only use one or two skills for any character.  Even the engineer - who you'd expect would be busy managing their creations - is just a hold-and-click.- The respec system is terrible.  You can refund your last three skills, except to test out a skill you typically need to put in 5-10 points to see how it behaves at different unlock levels.  The one saving grace is there are multiple respect mods and utilities which correct this without penalty (and you should plan on using one of them because they are essential to having any fun with this game).- Draw distance is far too close.  It's especially bad for ranged characters -- your shots will go much further than the edge of the screen, but won't actually hit anything because those mobs haven't been spawned in.- The luminous area in Act 2 can go eat a bag of.  It's the only area that resets if you die and res to town. (tip: don't res in town, res in the dungeon so you don't have to start over)The rest:* The Acts are not of uniform quality.  Act 2 is awful (endless dessert), Act 3 is quite good (best art, interesting quests), Act 1 is in-between, Act 4 feels tacked on but you can rush through it.* You can just res-get-two-hits-in-die-and-repeat to beat things (aka no hard gear/skill checks).TL;DR: it's no D2, but it's still kinda fun.  Don't expect the world from it and you'll have a good time.  The negative reviews are mostly spot on if you're on the fence.  I'd give it a 8/10 for the first playthrough or for someone new to the genre, 6/10 if you're a genre vet looking for something meaty (and honestly you'd probably be better off with POE).			"

												It is essentially a less Hell-focused Diablo, with more stylized graphics. The pet choice is great fun, although a little strange that an owl can carry as much as a panda. It is fun to load up an alpaca with spells and let him summon zombies and skeletons to his alpaca heart's content - then you send him to town to sell all the unwanted trash gear you've found, and pick up some health brews while he's at it. Great weapon/armor/gear variety, you are constantly upgrading your character with better gear, socketed embers, and enchantments. It can get a little mindless with the click killing, but you can get sucked in just doing one more little side quest. On normal difficulty, at least the first 5-6 hours are pretty easy, I can stand up to a hoarde of oncoming guys and liquify them with a cannon and even if they get through they don't damage much. Next character will defnitely try harder diffculty.In conclusion, GOOD! Especially for the value on $5 sale!			"

												This is by far one of the greatest games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. There is an infinite amount of replayability with or without mods. Now that I've mentioned mods, I guess this is a better time than any to discuss that topic. Torchlight 2's fantastic workshop mods make the game ten times better than it already was. Now don't get me wrong, this game can be enjoyed without mods, but you can unleash the game's full potential by slapping a few addons into the game through the workshop. To ANYONE reading this, I very highly recommend that you buy this game.			"

												I'd recommend this game to anyone looking for a Diablo-style adventure RPG game. The graphics are good quality, a bit more cartoony than its Diablo counterpart but they still set a good atmosphere with the level layouts and the music in particular is well done and will remind you of Diablo if you had played it. There are only 4 character classes, but you can select either gender and even better you get to choose a pet, and of those there are a lot to choose from - if you ever wanted to fight monsters with an alpaca or ferret by your side, well now you can!

												Torchlight 2 consumes hours on end of your life with its unique design and interesting animation! Combat is a thrill when you are able to pummel your enemies with spells and abilities. It's always simple to tell when there is room to improve your character! Unlike what blizzard has to offer in its newest Diablo game (Diablo 3), TL2 requires YOU to do the math with dynamic gameplay. The game has a more advanced feeling when you are required to compare items and weigh your decision carefully (ie; When to socket, What to use, Which enchantments, and so forth). The classes are amazing and what really makes the game is the lack of limit unlike in previous dungeon crawlers. Torchlight 2 is one of my favorites now, and i highly recommend to anybody that has the courage to face a new ARPG!			"

												One of my favorite ARPG games.  Both Torchlight and Torchlight II filled the void after Diablo II and before Dialbo III.  Though there are many ARPGs you can now play, Victor Vran, Van Helsing, and many others, this game still holds up and is enjoyable to play at any time.  The other games are much more Story based, but hey, we are here to whack some monsters and steal their loot.The only annoyance I found was that I had to constantly send my pet back with all my loot for extra gold.  Though that makes this game loot heavy which isn't a bad thing.  Sending your pet back is still much better than opening a portal and going back to the village.  I will take that any day.The pet mechanic in this game had me always looking out for a nice fishing hole in hopes of good pet food.  As a preferred ranged player, having the solid pet can be a great asset and definitely adds to some strategy/planning.			"

												I enjoy the genre, having played Diablo, Diablo II, Diablo III, and the prior torchlight.The game stays pretty true to the formula and is a good addition.  However I will note that the storyline is a bit soft, which is unfortunate but still a solid purchase overall.			"

												One of my favorite ARPG games.  Both Torchlight and Torchlight II filled the void after Diablo II and before Dialbo III.  Though there are many ARPGs you can now play, Victor Vran, Van Helsing, and many others, this game still holds up and is enjoyable to play at any time.  The other games are much more Story based, but hey, we are here to whack some monsters and steal their loot.The only annoyance I found was that I had to constantly send my pet back with all my loot for extra gold.  Though that makes this game loot heavy which isn't a bad thing.  Sending your pet back is still much better than opening a portal and going back to the village.  I will take that any day.The pet mechanic in this game had me always looking out for a nice fishing hole in hopes of good pet food.  As a preferred ranged player, having the solid pet can be a great asset and definitely adds to some strategy/planning.			"

												I've got one huge complaint with Torchlight II, and lately with the genre in general, and that is the fact that they made Act II take place in a mother ♥♥♥♥ing desert. I think we can all agree that Diablo II was one of, if not *the* best mouse destroying action-rpg of all time, but do we seriously need to keep setting our second act in a ♥♥♥♥ing sand castle? I laughed when Diablo III put it's second act in the dunes like its predecessor did, but now I just have to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If Act III is in a swamp, I am going to♥♥♥♥♥♥myself in anger. That's what angry people do, right?♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves?BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. This is not a 20 dollar game, it's totally worth the price of a AAA title.			"

												Phenominal game it plays like diablo 2 with less of a dark atmosphere yet still very creepy. The combat is very satisfying and IMO better than diablo 2 and 3. The characters are all very unique and play differently they are all a ton of fun to play in their own way and make the game very replayable. The game is also quite long and packed to the brim with content.			"

												Adequate, but not exceptional Diablo-esque.  While the first torchlight was diablo inspired, this is more like diablo 2, done softcore.  There are moments that will give you flashbacks to D2: fetishes in a jungle (no joke), (seemingly) endless deserts and sewers, and a barely-there plot.  Unfortunately, they toned down some of the best things about D2 and left some of the worst.  If you like this genre, it's definitely worth a go.The good:+ There are no bad skills.  Although there are absolutely a few exceptional skills for each class that are much better than the rest, all of the skills will get you through the game just fine.  There are typically two skills that you start with that will take you through the first playthrough.  Then there's a ""better"" skill that unlocks at 48, which will take you further.  Most of the middle skills are, well, middling.+ Classes are balanced.  I played through with all the classes, Beserker was the surprise favorite (great mobility, great damage, great damage mitigation, great healing, best endgame set, no obvious downside).  The engineer and embermage lag a bit, but not much.  Outlander is solid.  All classes were very viable, even if they played mostly the same (same utility skills in the same spots in the trees).+ Lots of fun little flourishes in some of the art.  Witches appear from a swirl of bats.  Werewolves hang from the rafters and drop down to say hi.+ Enchanting system is much better than T1, skull/eye/gems mimic D2's runes, gambling is actually fun.+ Pacing is mostly good.  A few slow parts, but overall fine.+ Mod scene has produced some very good things.  Not my thing, but it could be yours.+ Lots of achievements.The cons:- Loot.  You'd think this would be a plus; it's not.  Loot progression is fine for the first 20 levels (Act 1) with upgrades reasonably frequent and meaningful, then it hits a wall.  After 20, gear no longer really improves outside of the weapons getting bigger DPS numbers.  Most of the endgame sets don't even bother to have stats - seriously.  My first playthrough, I wore almost the same gear from act 2 till the end.  It's seriously that bad.  The problem is that there's a ton of useless modifiers (armor of all types), and only two or three modifiers that do anything...and those are mostly the +stat options.  Uniques are mostly mediocre; set bonuses are good in a couple cases, but mostly yawn-worthly; even the legendaries aren't that good.- You will only use one or two skills for any character.  Even the engineer - who you'd expect would be busy managing their creations - is just a hold-and-click.- The respec system is terrible.  You can refund your last three skills, except to test out a skill you typically need to put in 5-10 points to see how it behaves at different unlock levels.  The one saving grace is there are multiple respect mods and utilities which correct this without penalty (and you should plan on using one of them because they are essential to having any fun with this game).- Draw distance is far too close.  It's especially bad for ranged characters -- your shots will go much further than the edge of the screen, but won't actually hit anything because those mobs haven't been spawned in.- The luminous area in Act 2 can go eat a bag of.  It's the only area that resets if you die and res to town. (tip: don't res in town, res in the dungeon so you don't have to start over)The rest:* The Acts are not of uniform quality.  Act 2 is awful (endless dessert), Act 3 is quite good (best art, interesting quests), Act 1 is in-between, Act 4 feels tacked on but you can rush through it.* You can just res-get-two-hits-in-die-and-repeat to beat things (aka no hard gear/skill checks).TL;DR: it's no D2, but it's still kinda fun.  Don't expect the world from it and you'll have a good time.  The negative reviews are mostly spot on if you're on the fence.  I'd give it a 8/10 for the first playthrough or for someone new to the genre, 6/10 if you're a genre vet looking for something meaty (and honestly you'd probably be better off with POE).			"

												It is essentially a less Hell-focused Diablo, with more stylized graphics. The pet choice is great fun, although a little strange that an owl can carry as much as a panda. It is fun to load up an alpaca with spells and let him summon zombies and skeletons to his alpaca heart's content - then you send him to town to sell all the unwanted trash gear you've found, and pick up some health brews while he's at it. Great weapon/armor/gear variety, you are constantly upgrading your character with better gear, socketed embers, and enchantments. It can get a little mindless with the click killing, but you can get sucked in just doing one more little side quest. On normal difficulty, at least the first 5-6 hours are pretty easy, I can stand up to a hoarde of oncoming guys and liquify them with a cannon and even if they get through they don't damage much. Next character will defnitely try harder diffculty.In conclusion, GOOD! Especially for the value on $5 sale!			"

												This is by far one of the greatest games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. There is an infinite amount of replayability with or without mods. Now that I've mentioned mods, I guess this is a better time than any to discuss that topic. Torchlight 2's fantastic workshop mods make the game ten times better than it already was. Now don't get me wrong, this game can be enjoyed without mods, but you can unleash the game's full potential by slapping a few addons into the game through the workshop. To ANYONE reading this, I very highly recommend that you buy this game.			"

												Torchlight II is a fun little Diablo clone. And when I say ""Diablo clone"" I really mean it. I came into the game expecting some fresh and interesting gameplay during co-op, but quickly laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off when I discovered just how similar almost everything was. This was made even better by my friend who claims to dislike diablo loving this game. What the hell, dude?Gameplay is generally a slaughterfest, and depending on the difficulty one side or the other will be doing the slaughtering. After a little while on normal, I just couldn't stand this game. So, I rolled a new character and jacked it up to ""Epic"" difficulty. Much better.You get pets too. You can have a variety including wolves, dragon-thingies, panthers, house cats, two types of domestic dogs... and a ferret. A freakin' ferret. Ferrets are officially the most awesome animal ever, and you can make one run to the store to sell your junk before purchasing some potions. Not sure how the hell a ferret does that, though...			"

Also there is no auction house (which is big plus for me). And anyone who would complain to me on graphics that is ""too cartonny"" there is gore in it too but that art style is simply Torchlights charm. And Torchlight 2 is well worth buying it I dont remember i had that much fun with some game, in my book this game is worth much more then 20 euros!			"

												Well now, I was a huge fan of Diablo I II & III. One thing they all lacked was visuals of body armor dont get me wrong they looked decent but they had different armor with different names BUT multiple different names looked the same just different stats. The thing I love about Torchlight II is that each piece of your armor is different looking so if you mixed matched it looks amazing sometimes or goofy but the fact is they actually took the time to design every piece of armor. GREAT GAME! I got it when it was on sale for 5 bucks. COMPLETELY worth it.			"

												A point and click dungeon crawler to rival Diablo 3. In many ways its better than Diablo 3 (capable of being played offline being a big one). Skill points, great item drops, randomized maps and dungeons, even randomized quests. Each class offers many viable builds that become very satisfying. Great art style. The story is not necessarily engaging, but the main draw is building a character and unleashing your unique build against hordes of monsters. Best played with friends, but fun as a single player experience.			"

												Quick Summary: Torchlight 2 is a fun action RPG with gameplay very similar to Diablo 2 or the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. There is built in mod support for which you can download mods from the Steam workshop, and a ton of “end game” things like New Game + and Mapworks.After the events of the first Torchlight game, the Alchemist (one of the heroes) has been corrupted by an artifact he took from the first game’s villain, and is planning to do all sorts of awful stuff. It’s up to 4 new heroes to follow and stop him before he unleashes a demonic invasion. It’s a pretty generic story (very similar to Diablo 2) with a few cartoony cutscenes. Most of the plot comes from conversations with quest giver NPCs, as you’d expect in an action RPG.As mentioned earlier, the game is very similar in gameplay to Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing. You play in a third person isometric view and use your mouse buttons for attack/spell casting on hordes of monsters. Each class of character has 3 skill “tabs” but they aren’t conventional skill “trees” meaning none of the skills have prerequisites. You can also find scrolls that can be used to learn additional skills like healing or summoning spells. Interestingly, these scrolls can be used to teach skills to your “pet” (similar to like Katarina in the Van Helsing games). The pet can also be sent back to town to sell excess items, and provides a small presence in combat. Don’t count on the pet to do any real killing or tanking though (unlike Katarina). Anyone familiar with ARPG games will know how the randomly generated loot and levels work, and just like the first Torchlight game, there is a lot of socketable “ember” to be found. Ember is like the gems in Diablo 2, and can be added to equipment with sockets to provide bonuses like + damage or +% resistance (depending on if it goes into a weapon or an armor). There are a number of “unique” or “set” loot items as well as “legendaries” which are uber rare and can take a hundred hours of grinding to find. Your inventory stash is rather limited, but you do have the option to share items between characters.Pros:+Multiplayer co-op for the campaign, and the loot is individualized so don’t worry about someone stealing your item drops.+The game is pretty long (about 16 hours) and there is a lot to do, even after you beat the story. You can play the New Game + (start the game over with all your items and skills) or you can play the Mapworks, which randomly generates levels. You can only find the legendary items in New Game +.+For a game with so much content, the download size is remarkably small. It’s also not very hardware intensive, but the graphics are still pretty good.  You can also download player made mods from the steam workshop to mix things up even more.Cons:-The game can get very grindy, especially if you’re going for some of the Steam achievements.  Some of them (like selling 50k items to merchants) will likely take hundreds of hours playing. -The respec system is very limited. You can only reset the last 3 skill points you put in, so if you want to try different builds, you need to start a new character. You can use console commands to fully respec, but that marks your character as a cheater in online play.Overall the game is very good but by the time you finish the first playthrough you probably will want to take a break. I played the rather overpowered spell caster character and my fingers hurt by the end of the game. I didn’t really feel like going into New Game +. I can only imagine what it would be like playing through with a melee fighter that has to sit there swinging at each enemy. In comparison, I played through the Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing back to back with all 3 character classes (though that game was significantly shorter).  "

												Torchlight II, what more can be said? Its a fantastic, fantasy RPG game! Although i must say this review will be biast as im an RPG fanboy, growing up and playing every Final Fantasey game out there (ok i lied i didnt play FFXIII, like who dosnt know how bad the story was)Basically Torchlight II is for the people that played the first Torchlight :P and for the fans of Diablo, the Sacred series, the Gothic series, the Dungeon Seige series and Titan Quest. Its a game like that but with its own intuitive story great character and a lengthy repetative game, with the 4 vanilla classes. There are many amazing mods out there, lots of famouse ones too like Synergies mod, so u can have a great time altering your game with more classes or even make the enviroment look more HD and life like. Its a well worth game, with multiplayer added to this game the possibilities are endless. Now able to share the fun experiance with upto 5 firends!! The game has never been better, the vanilla game has 4 new great classes (changed from the original Torchlight) and up 12 new pets to choose from to follow you in your adventures and with a massive Steam workshop integration the game is just fun to play!!!!A game worth 10/10 ^^			"

												Torchlight 2 is very similar to Diablo, including lots of clicking and taking out the bad guys.  It is not a dark game like Diablo, interms of story and environment.  I actually prefer it to Diablo 3 for some of these reasons.  One fun aspect of Torchlight 2 (and the original Torchlight) is the ability to have a pet for each character.  There is a good variety of unique pets, and the pets serve several important functions in the game, such as carrying extra loot, selling loot at the store while you are in a mission, and fighting alongside you (including the use of spells you can teach them).Torchlight 2 is a very fun game that took me more than 20 hours to beat by myself on normal difficulty.  One of the perks I didn't mention above is that it is cheap--especially when compared with Diablo 3!			"

The classes are not standard archtypes and some of their talent trees can completely change their original template. Fun stuff. And looks great in 3D. ;-)			"

												If you like Diablo II but were let down by Diablo III, this is the perfect game for you. With gear you can actually wear dropping frequently (and nont just from bosses). The game is made with such good mechanics that it seems completely fluid and debugged. May seem cartoonish in the beginning and a bit silly at times but it grows on you very fast. Definitely recommend it! (You can even have a pet Alpaca or Headcrab from Half Life.... tell me that's not awesome)			"

												Torchlight II is a spectical. Sent out as a response to the evergrowing Diablo III, Torchlight II not only improves on its predacessor, but comes to the forefront in the hack and slash adventure. Though, like EVERY game, it is not perfect. Torchlight  II suffers from issues that could have vastly improved the game.When you get into the universe of Torchligh, you are welcomed to a rather beautiful steampunk and ""cartoony"" world (as much  as I hate describing an art style with that word). When I use my abilities in a blaze of assorted colors, it is wonderful. The art style in this game contrasts a lot hack and slash / dungeon crawlers out there, like Diablo II, Diablo III and Path of Exile. There are four playable classes in the game, all with dynamic and unique abilites. However, there is not much room for experimentation with skill trees, mostly due to the fact that you have to use an exploit to get around this feature. WIth all the  skills usable in this game, it is a damn shame you can't have more freedom. Another feature is the pet system, which is essentially your ♥♥♥♥♥. Put a ton of stuff in his inventory to sell, or send him on a shopping spree! The loot tables in the game are also great. Torchlight II disregards the grindyness of Diablo III, and makes you want to get to the next level, or get new loot! The amount of great stuff that drops is spectacular, and I am so pleased when I defeat a boss to chant, ""LOOT! LOOT! LOOT!"" Not to mention, the end game is pretty good, with an option to go to the Mapworks, an area in which you can purchase dungeons, and go adventuring through them. OR, you can continue your experience with NG+. However, I did not care whatsoever for the story of Torchlight II. Generic, mythical story with uninteresting characters. Enough said. And honestly, who cares? That is not what you play the game for. Torchlight II is a real spectical - a great change to the formula of Diablo III. Torchlight strays away from making these games a job, and rather a fun game with enough strategy to be challenging. Not only that, but levels are interesting, varied, and creative. Beyond that, Torchlight II is available at $20, where as Diablo III is priced at $60! You will never get a deal like this anywhere else. Did I also mention if you don't like game mechanics, textures, etc, there is a great modding community? That should be enough of a steal for gamers.  "

												I've got one huge complaint with Torchlight II, and lately with the genre in general, and that is the fact that they made Act II take place in a mother ♥♥♥♥ing desert. I think we can all agree that Diablo II was one of, if not *the* best mouse destroying action-rpg of all time, but do we seriously need to keep setting our second act in a ♥♥♥♥ing sand castle? I laughed when Diablo III put it's second act in the dunes like its predecessor did, but now I just have to call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. If Act III is in a swamp, I am going to♥♥♥♥♥♥myself in anger. That's what angry people do, right?♥♥♥♥♥♥themselves?BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. This is not a 20 dollar game, it's totally worth the price of a AAA title.			"

The gameplay is pretty much the same, but tweaked. As someone that loved playing through Diablo III, this game has me more hooked so far and I've made less than 2 hours progress in so far.Great game, the sound design is a little dull so far though. That's really my only minor gripe. I'm glad this has a windowed option as I've been playing and watching seasons of TV while playing.			"

												Diablo. My first thought when I played this game. It reminded me a lot of Diablo 2. Now im sure your saying well duh, but honestly, that in itself made me happy. Now I played this game for a good amount of time as a Outlander, and I loved it! Its a great game, and I got a four pack to share in the fun with my friends, which made it even better. From it having a amazing combat system, with a nice looting and upgrading system, to a ok skill tree system, it was still a good game. I feel like the skill tree left more to be desired, as in more skills and less time getting to them, but that is just a personal preference. Torchlight 2 adressed a lot of little problems that made me very happy. You can dump all your loot on your poor pet and have him go sell it in town. Oh look, almost out of potions! Fido, go get me 50 health potions! It cuts out a lot of the boring parts of RPG games, and made it super fun. Never again shall you have to decide which piece of valuable loot to leave behind. I would recommend getting this game, its good for single player, and even better with friends!			"

												Adequate, but not exceptional Diablo-esque.  While the first torchlight was diablo inspired, this is more like diablo 2, done softcore.  There are moments that will give you flashbacks to D2: fetishes in a jungle (no joke), (seemingly) endless deserts and sewers, and a barely-there plot.  Unfortunately, they toned down some of the best things about D2 and left some of the worst.  If you like this genre, it's definitely worth a go.The good:+ There are no bad skills.  Although there are absolutely a few exceptional skills for each class that are much better than the rest, all of the skills will get you through the game just fine.  There are typically two skills that you start with that will take you through the first playthrough.  Then there's a ""better"" skill that unlocks at 48, which will take you further.  Most of the middle skills are, well, middling.+ Classes are balanced.  I played through with all the classes, Beserker was the surprise favorite (great mobility, great damage, great damage mitigation, great healing, best endgame set, no obvious downside).  The engineer and embermage lag a bit, but not much.  Outlander is solid.  All classes were very viable, even if they played mostly the same (same utility skills in the same spots in the trees).+ Lots of fun little flourishes in some of the art.  Witches appear from a swirl of bats.  Werewolves hang from the rafters and drop down to say hi.+ Enchanting system is much better than T1, skull/eye/gems mimic D2's runes, gambling is actually fun.+ Pacing is mostly good.  A few slow parts, but overall fine.+ Mod scene has produced some very good things.  Not my thing, but it could be yours.+ Lots of achievements.The cons:- Loot.  You'd think this would be a plus; it's not.  Loot progression is fine for the first 20 levels (Act 1) with upgrades reasonably frequent and meaningful, then it hits a wall.  After 20, gear no longer really improves outside of the weapons getting bigger DPS numbers.  Most of the endgame sets don't even bother to have stats - seriously.  My first playthrough, I wore almost the same gear from act 2 till the end.  It's seriously that bad.  The problem is that there's a ton of useless modifiers (armor of all types), and only two or three modifiers that do anything...and those are mostly the +stat options.  Uniques are mostly mediocre; set bonuses are good in a couple cases, but mostly yawn-worthly; even the legendaries aren't that good.- You will only use one or two skills for any character.  Even the engineer - who you'd expect would be busy managing their creations - is just a hold-and-click.- The respec system is terrible.  You can refund your last three skills, except to test out a skill you typically need to put in 5-10 points to see how it behaves at different unlock levels.  The one saving grace is there are multiple respect mods and utilities which correct this without penalty (and you should plan on using one of them because they are essential to having any fun with this game).- Draw distance is far too close.  It's especially bad for ranged characters -- your shots will go much further than the edge of the screen, but won't actually hit anything because those mobs haven't been spawned in.- The luminous area in Act 2 can go eat a bag of.  It's the only area that resets if you die and res to town. (tip: don't res in town, res in the dungeon so you don't have to start over)The rest:* The Acts are not of uniform quality.  Act 2 is awful (endless dessert), Act 3 is quite good (best art, interesting quests), Act 1 is in-between, Act 4 feels tacked on but you can rush through it.* You can just res-get-two-hits-in-die-and-repeat to beat things (aka no hard gear/skill checks).TL;DR: it's no D2, but it's still kinda fun.  Don't expect the world from it and you'll have a good time.  The negative reviews are mostly spot on if you're on the fence.  I'd give it a 8/10 for the first playthrough or for someone new to the genre, 6/10 if you're a genre vet looking for something meaty (and honestly you'd probably be better off with POE).			"

												Torchlight II, what more can be said? Its a fantastic, fantasy RPG game! Although i must say this review will be biast as im an RPG fanboy, growing up and playing every Final Fantasey game out there (ok i lied i didnt play FFXIII, like who dosnt know how bad the story was)Basically Torchlight II is for the people that played the first Torchlight :P and for the fans of Diablo, the Sacred series, the Gothic series, the Dungeon Seige series and Titan Quest. Its a game like that but with its own intuitive story great character and a lengthy repetative game, with the 4 vanilla classes. There are many amazing mods out there, lots of famouse ones too like Synergies mod, so u can have a great time altering your game with more classes or even make the enviroment look more HD and life like. Its a well worth game, with multiplayer added to this game the possibilities are endless. Now able to share the fun experiance with upto 5 firends!! The game has never been better, the vanilla game has 4 new great classes (changed from the original Torchlight) and up 12 new pets to choose from to follow you in your adventures and with a massive Steam workshop integration the game is just fun to play!!!!A game worth 10/10 ^^			"

												One of the best H`n`S avaiable on PC... with workshop support!!! If you want a total dungeon run experience, just install some incredible mods and go... go NOW! + Low system requirements+ Workshop Support (what is equal to TONS of new items/pets/classes/skills etc.) + Pets! + PRICE! + Cool graphics style!+ Awesome special effects. Sometimes you dont know what`s happening on screen :)+/- Maybe difficulty level (too easy), but with SyngeriesMOD (MUST HAVE FOR TORCHLIGH2!) it will be significantly harder experience. Especially on Veteran or Elite difficulty.+ It is necessary to tell: that game is casual-friendly as well as hardcore-friendly. Even your kids can play, but disable blood first ;) Yes, there is blood there! Not so kiddy isn`t it?PROTIP: If you want to play Torchlight 2, play with mods. Vanilla version is just... poor when you compare it to the modded one. Recommended mods:- Xev`s Pets (added tons of pets)- RnFs Skill Spells (after install EVERY ingame spell could drop as scroll! EXTREME usefull for pets! You can make support, casters or even summoners!)- DrawDistance (Monsters draw range increades significantly)- SyngeriesMOD (>>> MUST HAVE<<<) - Minimalistic loot borders (make interface more clear) 9+/10 !

												Torchlight II is a fun little Diablo clone. And when I say ""Diablo clone"" I really mean it. I came into the game expecting some fresh and interesting gameplay during co-op, but quickly laughed my♥♥♥♥♥off when I discovered just how similar almost everything was. This was made even better by my friend who claims to dislike diablo loving this game. What the hell, dude?Gameplay is generally a slaughterfest, and depending on the difficulty one side or the other will be doing the slaughtering. After a little while on normal, I just couldn't stand this game. So, I rolled a new character and jacked it up to ""Epic"" difficulty. Much better.You get pets too. You can have a variety including wolves, dragon-thingies, panthers, house cats, two types of domestic dogs... and a ferret. A freakin' ferret. Ferrets are officially the most awesome animal ever, and you can make one run to the store to sell your junk before purchasing some potions. Not sure how the hell a ferret does that, though...			"

												This game is like a funner version of Diablo 3.  Kinda easy though.  But whatever, get it.  Or don't.  But you should.  I think you should.  Maybe we can play together if you do.  But if you don't then we can't.			"

												rivals diablo 3 at a third of the price. A must have game with steam workshop and countless hours of gameplay(Edit as of 9/17/2016)While I still recommend this game I should point out that unfortunetly Torchlight 2 developers Runic Games chose to let the community make the future content for the game instead of doing it themselves. While blizzard (developers of diablo 3) has since added many changes to diablo 3, including 1 expansion and seasonal leaderboards that reward players with new items and cosmetics added every couple of months.Thus the shear difference in quality is very obvious.

												If you've ever played games like Diablo, this is pretty much that. Good graphics, combat is smooth and satisfying, awesome community and multiplayer. All the splendor of Diablo 3, with the skill/spell system of Diablo 2, and without the stupidity of Activision.			"
