 Fix has been found; woo! (Outdated review)This review is a tad obsoletepps: Some people are still reporting it not working. Idek at this point. Just be cautious.-WARNING/GAME HAS BEEN BROKEN-PLEASE UPVOTE THIS TO WARN OTHER PLAYERSThere is no point in buying this game anymore, it has been broken and Rockstar couldnt give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about it.You guys remember GFWL right?The pimple on your forehead that showed up out of nowhere and proclaimed 'YEAH GUYS PC GAMING IS THE BEST WOO AM I RITE?!' ?Well its dead now.Problem is rockstar refuses to patch this game.You can save games anymore because it asks for a GFWL login - but the servers are dead so you cant log in ergo you cant save.But what about multip-no.Thats dead too. GFWL took to its grave the chaos and hilarity that was gta iv multiplayer.My friend just bought this and got ripped off because he wasnt aware of this.Please save other gamers money.EDIT: There is a multiplayer-less workaround now. If you're fine throwing this much money for the single player experience go ahead.It seems quite inconsistent too; many are having this game just flat out not work, while for others it works perfectly.

												The best way to play this game is to ignore all outlets offering the product for purchase legitimately. Heres what you do. Close this page, go to google, and torrent it. The game does not work on newer systems without an amazingly complicated process of messing with some simple directories. The game is broken. If a game won't work legitimately, remove it from the market or patch the issue. If Rockstar thinks that we don't know how simple and cheap it would be to fix, then they're lying to themselves and deserve to lose sales to piracy. Simple as that. Pirate it, you'll have no problems. Pay to not play.			"

												To those with Games for Windows Live issues or who are whining that the game is broken and shouldn't be sold due to this: There is no issue. You simply have to create an offline account, which is clearly stated when you start the game. I have personally done this. I installed the game, created an offline account, completed the first mission and saved. I restarted the game and guess what? I started off from the saved point.To those whiners: Please take the time to confirm if a game is broken or not before writing some non-sense review to scare people off. Save yourself the embarrassment of being proven to be both wrong and ignorant.			"

												TL;DRHaving a legitimate copy of game was never so unfavorable. ♥♥♥♥ games for windows.On windows 8/10 run with parameters: -availablevidmem 60 -norestrictions -nomemrestrictSo where do I start first?When I tried launching the game nothing was happening, just icon flashing for a while on taskbar.Apparently I had to download myself GFWL from Microsoft website, which was not included in the game.Later I had to verify my game through Rockstar Social Club or something which didn't activate at first, but after several tries it worked.Game launched at 800x600 with everything on low, because game detected only 23MB of video ram.After some searching i had to modify a bit launching parameters (-nomemrestrict).Then when I finally got into game had to create an GFWL account to let me save my ♥♥♥♥ing progress in game (they don't store your progress on cloud, they just want you to log in for ""achievements"").Clicked play after sitting in front of loading screen for 5 minutes I realised something is wrong.After MORE research i had to modify again launch parameters to -availablevidmem 60 -norestrictions -nomemrestrict.Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥ is that? You pay for a game that you need to tweak half an hour after searching some info on the internet? Why is this still on shop unpached without any information about it being unable to launch without this mess??The game itself is okay in my opinion, but they should pay more attention to games they still are selling.

												ALL GTA IV AND GTA IV EPISODES FROM LIBERTY CITY FIXES!!!This is a fix review for GTA IV and GTA IV Episodes From Liberty City, on whether you should buy these games.The short answer is NO! and here is why...First off, I loved the story of GTA IV and GTA IV Episodes From Liberty City, in my eyes I had just as much fun with them as any other GTA game. The reason why I am not recommending them however is because of the shear number of Port Issues these 2 games have.Now, I am going to tell you all the issues and how to fix them but even so, the reason I do NOT recommend them is because Rockstar have done nothing in years to fix these bugs and even beyond that the Online is completly broken and yet they do NOT specify this or any fixes on the Steam Page.1) FIRST BUG - Graphics Card- Ok so basically if you have a Graphics Card that has a video RAM of over 2GB, (I have a 4GB GTX 970 myself) both games do NOT allow you to adjust any of the graphics options!This is crazy and so surprised Rockstar have not fixed this :( But to do so, on Steam go to your Library, right click over either GTA IV game and then go to Set Launch Options and enter this without the brackets (-nomemrestrict -norestrictions). Once you ok that you can start up the game ane edit your graphics options like normal :)2) SECOND BUG - Game Not Starting- Ok so this is the biggest one and it seems to be happening a lot to people with Windows 10 like myself. So when you sign into the Rockstar Social Club it either says failed or password not correct (even when it is), something along those lines yeah. Well if you go to the hard drive on your computer where the game is stored and find either Steam>Steamapps>Common>(Then either GTA IV game) or Rockstar Games>(Then either GTA IV game) and find inside either folder these 3 files ""gtaencoder"",""gta4browser"",""gtaiv"" for Grand Theft Auto IV and these 3 files ""eflc"",""gta4browser"",""gtaencoder"" for Grand Theft Auto IV Episodes From Liberty City; then right click on every file and choose Properties>Compatibility and then choose Windows Vista Service Pack 2>Apply>Ok.Now that you have done those steps you should be able to launch the game, Rockstar Social Club pop up, choose Offline and the game actually start up :)3) THIRD BUG - Games For Windows Live- Well we can all agree that this has ruined games...lol!But basically in order for you to be able to sign in to LIVE, you need to go to go here...http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient...and download this software and install it. You don't need to start it up, just so long as it is on your machine. Once you have done that you will be able to sign into LIVE via the game and start at least earning Achievements until Rockstar fix the Online.4) FOURTH BUG - Online Broken- Sadly at this stage I can't specify a fix for the Online as I have looked at many forums and Rockstar's Website :( I guess only time will tell, but if there is a fix in the future I will be sure to update this section here :)Cheers Guys, please pass on and share as I just want people to enjoy the games :)James.

 it is literally perfect. Episodes from Liberty City is more like a big expansion pack than ""DLC."" You get two completely new campaigns for an absurdly low price. Lots of new weapons, new vehicles, new helicopters, new cutscenes, new characters, and more explosive.Endless hours of entertainment with this game weather you choose to do missions, or just cause TERROR on the streets of Liberty City. Of course the more missions you complete, the more you're going to have options as far as weapons and newer exotic vehicles to steal. Software itself is well rendered and the modelling within the game is superb. Spectacular graphics with settings maxed out- well worth the upgrade of your video card if required.			"

""45 YEARS OLD AND I GET MY KICKS DOING BLOW WITH 17 YEAR OLD KIDS WHOSE ONLY CLAIM TO FAME IS THAT PEOPLE KNOW BETTER WHAT THEIR ♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOOKS LIKE THAN THEIR FACE. I SHOULD BE SENT TO PRISON, SHOULDN'T I?""Rockstar is one of those companies, whose DLC's and EXPANSIONS are really in right meaning of the word. If I don't mind, how they changed their DLC's policy in GTA V which by the time will step into regular EA bulls*it. Don't get me wrong, but Rockstar is starting to make stupid Cars/Skins/Weapons DLC's but at least for free, and I believe they'll fall into darkness of DLC gaming market model sooner or later. Back to the game.As I said before, oficially this game is expansion to GTA IV, but everyone who played it, raise the hands up for me, that this seems (and is) truly standard and actual game. Story is gripping and longer than stories of 90% nowadays games if not more. GTA IV, TBoGT (The Ballad of Gay Tony) and TLaD (The Lost and Damned) makes the universe. All three stories are connected with logical connection, and what happened in GTA IV has affect on these two stories (EFLC - Episodes From Liberty City). Or let's say it has affect on it. It's not like it has some real affect, but it was made to have the affect on it. And it has.Both expansions shows something of both worlds. TBoGT is showing classy high & luxurious style of life while TLaD is showing underground, real side of America. In overall I do like TBoGT more, but Johnny was truly awesome in TLaD.There's also one mission where all 3 characters meets up but now shhh about it. Same with intro. For the price you see at Store Page, you will get two precise full games not just expensions as they are called. Also they're BETTER OPTIMALIZED than GTA IV. So you don't have to worry about your hardware as much as you had to back then with IV.Bonus Point: Lenght & OptimalizationRating: 9/10(for both)			"

												--- The Lost and Damned ---I'd heard that TLAD was mediocre and paled in comparison to the base game and The Ballad of Gay Tony, but I actually liked it a lot more than the base game.+ Johnny handles motorcycles way better than Niko handles cars+ There aren't any really bad bikes (while most of the cars are terrible)+ You can get bikes for free and guns at a discount whenever you want by calling your gang members+ At the end of an early mission, the game tries to make you think it's gonna go all San Andreas and let your gang get pushed around by a couple of corrupt cops, but you just go kill them in the next mission+ You don't get called to go do things with your friends all the time+ This game introduces the sawn-off shotgun, which is the most hilariously overpowered gun to use on a motorcycle+ Also introduces a few more guns that are more interesting than anything in GTA IV: An automatic pistol, a street sweeper shotgun and a grenade launcher+ I enjoy playing as bikers in games and Johnny has a sweet jacket/ The story is still generally joyless/ The story is short, but there are a lot of side jobs, gang wars and races to do as well/ Johnny flipping his ♥♥♥♥ in combat for little reason can be alternately hilarious and annoying. ""F*** YOU! F*** YOU! F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU!"" (this is all one line)- Only 2 safehouses, both very close together, and you can only use one or the other for most of the plot- Johnny runs slower than Niko and Luis if he's holding a weapon- The bike handling is still iffy, and the 4-wheeled vehicle handling is iffy at best- The death metal station has like 8 songs on it so if you listen to it a lot it will repeat all the time- No character customizationTLAD is still no San Andreas or Vice City but it's a pretty good game.

												Episodes from Liberty City puts you in the shoes of other people trying to make something of themselves in this world. Unlike Niko however, Luis and Johnny have been in this city for a long time; they know what's going on.Episodes from Liberty City brings you two stories, the story of Luis, The Ballad of Gay Tony, pretty self explanatory. And Johnny's story, one of the bikers in the Lost and Damned.In my opinion, Episodes from Liberty City is a much stronger and touching story; even though it does not contain as much sad parts and engaging as Niko's storyline. Sometimes sad stories are not a free pass for a good story.It depends on one's perspective, but to me, GTA 4 and all three of its main storyline, is based on a $2,000,000 worth of diamond(s), and the game just puts you in the shoes of one of the people who are chasing after this diamond. The moral of the story is, we all have a dream, but someone already owns that dream. Sometimes there's people with the exact same dream as you, they're also chasing it. And if you don't make friends with them, bad things are going to happen. In the end, no one achieves that dream, because we all killed each other; but in the end, that dream is given to those who deserve it. And a new chapter of the book begins....			"

												I love GTA IV, so I should probably recommend this. However, after a few hours it has become obvious that this game was never meant to be played.First the game ran fine. On the lowest graphics. I'm not allowed to change graphical settings. With some launch codes, I can! High graphics! Now the game crashes on start-up. Re-install game. Still crashing. Check the time. Yes, this game is still 4 years old. I consult Rockstar Support. They suck. So I google for a while and discover that Games For Windows Live is the problem. Reinstall that. Game runs! ""Please login to GFWL"" Okay. Okay... OKAY. Can't login to Games For Windows Live, because why the ♥♥♥♥ not? Uninstall, not recommending. It's been four years and we still have to deal with this kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. GTA V is almost here. We must hold on.			"

												Copy-pasted from my IV review. This is a review of both GTA IV and EFLC.Honestly one of the best games I have ever played. Compared to V, I think there are some things that IV does better, euphoria physics, vehicle handling, story, realism in general; It's nice if that's the kind of thing you're looking for. V improved in certain areas, and included a lot of things that IV was lacking. I don't think either is better than the other, but I personally prefer IV. The game runs OK, specs:Intel Core i5-3570 3.40GHz8gb RAMAMD HD 7950 (OC)I did some tweaking and I feel like it runs best at these settings:1680x1050 60 Hz (Native)Texture Quality: HighReflection Resolution: Very HighWater Quality: Very HighShadow Quality: HighNight Shadows: OffTexture Filter: Anisotropic x8View Distance: 25Detail Distance: 40Vehicle Density: 100Definition: OffVSync: OffFraps Benchmark: 5 minutes, 21682 framesMin: 47, Max: 102, Avg: 72.23I have the latest patches on both games. Everything is vanilla except for the Visual IV Mod. If you don't have it, you might as well install it. It makes the game look a lot better and apparently includes a ""fixed rendering code"" to make playing smoother.I run EFLC on the same settings and results were pretty much identical. Everyone is aware that GTA IV is a ♥♥♥♥ port, but I think I've managed to get a somewhat consistent framerate. It still drops to >30 for a few seconds, occasionally. This happens no matter what I do. It's still completely playable and doesn't annoy me at all, but it's something I noticed; It's still miles ahead of the console version. If anyone is able to get a constant 60+ in this game, let me know what you are doing. R* Social club isn't a big deal. GFWL is useless and I don't like it, but it hasn't caused me any trouble so far. Over all, my experience with this game has been really good. The only thing that would make it better is if multiplayer wasn't dead, would've made a nice mod-friendly alternative to GTA: Online.Edit:I felt inclined to update this review after finding out a little more about the graphics settings for this game. GTA IV is not necessarily meant to be maxed out on current hardware, the intention of the developers was that the higher graphical settings would be for future use, and when GTA IV was released on PC back in 2008 there was a disclaimer of some sort that advised players to use medium settings. I'm just learning this now and I had purchased GTA IV in 2012. People are criticizing the game for being a terrible port and having framerate issues because they believe they should be able to max out a 7 year old game. In most cases they would not be wrong in assuming that, but gta iv does have higher minimum requirements than pretty much any other game. Now, with current patches, as long as you have this game configured correctly it will run beautifully.AUTO CONFIGURE IS YOUR FRIEND.Use it when you are tweaking your graphics. If you have a decent rig, most of the settings will be automatically set to high/very high, except for VD, DD, and Vehicle Density. If you want to push it further, I would increase the vehicle density, which has the lowest impact on framerate, and you will be all right leaving everything else alone. Hope this helps anyone thats having trouble running this game.			"

The Lost and DamnedThis episode focuses on motorcycles, as you would expect from a game that revolves around a biker gang. If GTA4 wasn't gritty enough for you, this one's even grittier. Storywise, it's about the same level of grittiness as GTA4, if not more, If you like riding bikes, you'll like this episode; Johnny Klebitz has mastered the delicate art of not flying off his bike when clipping a lamp post at 20 miles an hour. Though he's not as good of a driver as Niko, and you'll definitely notice that if and when you get behind the wheel. There's more content in general, including an exclusive set of weapons to play with, including an autopistol, a sawed-off shotgun, and a grenade launcher. You get all three of these pretty damn early in the game; the sawed-off is Johnny's starter weapon and he can fire it while riding! Worth playing if you want to follow a parallel, equally if not more gritty story to Niko's.Lost MC! Lost MC!The Ballad of Gay TonyThis episode takes a leap away from GTA4's usual brand of grittiness; it's more colorful, has lots of new fun guns to play with (P90 SMG, advanced sniper rifle, M249 light machine gun, AA-12 shotgun with explosive rounds...), parachutes, upgraded police units, and a whackier tone to compete with its new nemesis, Saints Row 2. This one focuses a bit more on helicopters, so this episode may be good practice for the awful PC controls for the helicopters. Or it may frustrate you a bit. Once you finish the story, you can go back and replay any mission you want. There's a score system for missions this time around, but who cares? I actually find this episode to be more fun than GTA4 just because of all the fun stuff it adds. There's nothing like screwing up everyone's commute in Star Junction with stickybombs and an explosive shotgun. What's that? The police are coming? Pfft. They ain't got ♥♥♥♥ on my APC.You'll have a good time. And as always, mods only increase the fun.			"

												A MUST have addition to GTA IV. It basically retells the story of Libertiy City on the same time era as NIko from additional two different perspectives. A lot of events and mission end up tying between the three protagonists (Niko, Johnny, and Luis).The Lost and Damned (TLaD)Summary: American 60's biker drama (greasers, junkie girlfriend, running with the politic and mafia, pushers, internal dispute, etc.) There are lot of interesting gameplay mechanics introduced since you are now in bike club. Eg: You get to roll with your brothers (that's what they call each other); with each successful mission (and them not dying), they will receive 'EXP' to upgrade their survivability and weaponry. (Note: noobs brother tend to die easily, but main story brothers won't die unless the story tells so) The Ballad of Gay Tony (TBoGT)Spoiler: Actually not gay. Lots of booty calls (note: NOT from dudes). Dude who you are working for (Tony Prince, AKA Gay Tony) is the one who's gay; dude runs clubs in town with some 'business' partners. I played TBoGT a long time ago; frankly I don't remember any new interesting things thrown in except for booty calls. I do recall sweet ♥♥♥ helicopter (an upgrade from Annihilator) from rich ♥♥♥ racist Arab. You can replay missions though since each mission has this 'additional objectives' in order for you to get the 100%/ gold medal ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and make yourself feel less terrible.Pros:+ Don't need to own GTA IV (But highly recommended to finish the main game first; this game assumes player has experienced base game. A lot of references are thrown here and there as story progresses)+ A lot of new arsenals introduced. They are exclusive to each stories (and are more OP in some cases)+ Complete different atmospheres with some new mechanics+ Feels more optimised than the base gameCons:- Takes another 16 GB of files even if you own GTA IV (since Episodes from Liberty City is considered a separate game). It is such a waste of space, considering 90% of the game files are recycled- Generic missions, with some minor bugs here and there- They RIP APART Vladivostok FM into pop dance club ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t FM. GIVE ME BACK Кино́'s Группа крови!Overall, if you or your friends are thinking of picking up GTA IV, get the Episodes from LIberty City as well.			"

												In Episodes From Liberty City (EFLC), we play as 2 of the characters that cross paths with Niko Bellic and each other a  few times during Niko's story and learn mode details about the diamonds, secondary characters, and the city itself.All the pros and cons of Vanilla GTA IV apply to the expansions as well, so I'll only mention the differences.JUST LIKE THE VANILLA GTA IV, THE X.LIVE.LESS MOD IS ALMOST OBLIGATORY TO REMOVE GFLW, AND BE ABLE TO PLAY IT LIKE IT SHOULD BE PLAYEDThe Lost and DamnedWe play as Johnny Klebitz, the vice president of The Lost Motorcycle Club, as the Club struggles to stay dominant and alive in the gang wars of LC+ Improved motorcycle handling, now it's harder to fall off the bike (Sometimes unrealistically harder)+ New vehicles added (Mostly bikes)+ Darker tone and very interesting story+ New locations and activities, mostly MC related+ New weapons,also fitting the MC theme ( and the ability to use more weapons while riding, like the baseball bat and the sawed off shotgun)+ New songs and new TV/radio shows (Even more rock!)- Lack of more safehouses- No character customization- The new vehicles, locations, and weapons are not accessible on the vanilla GTA IVThe Ballad of Gay TonyWe play as Luiz Lopez, a security guard, and friend of Gay tony, a very rich nightclub owner.+ Get to experience the more ""glamorous"" side of Liberty City+ More Vehicles added (mostly luxury, also we get an attack helicopter and an APC)+ Parachuting is back!+ Very fun missions (If you liked those more over-the-top missions from previous games, You'll like the ones here)+ New activities and locations, mostly nightclub related+ New TV/Radio shows, songs and a new radio station (80's!) - Only one safehouse- The new vehicles, locations, and weapons are not accessible on the vanilla GTA IVThis is one of the best expansion packs I've ever seen, it has a lot of content and is completely stand-alone from the main GTA IVThis is how DLC should me made, this is a must have if you liked GTA IV			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is an expansion pass for GTA 4 where you have to DLC packs which both expand on the story of GTA 4. I will review both as separate games so let's get into it.Grand Theft Auto Lost and Damned:This expansion pass follows on the biker gang Lost and Damned who are old school gang in Liberty City. The story follows on Johny Klebitz as he tries his best to keep his chapter under falling out.This expansion is really good, for story, but not so much for missions. Now I know that I should have expected this, from an expansion that follows on Bikers, but I didn't really like how much of the entire expansion follows on bike rides. But the story missions were fun and challenging.Music wise I enjoyed the rock music in this game, it's a very fitting choice of music for this expansion and it works well.The entire expansion overall is still better than the entirety of GTA 4, I enjoyed the story and action based missions, but hated all the bike stuff, because of how bikes control in GTA 4 overall.Next up is Grand Theft Auto The Ballad of Gay Tony:This expansion is better than Lost and Damned and GTA 4.This expansion follows on Luis a bodyguard who works on a business man Gay Tony. The entire expansion takes place after the Three Leaf Clover mission in GTA 4 and is all about Luis trying to save Tony's dying business by taking up different business ventures.This expansion is incredibly fun and I had tons of fun playing through it. A lot of the missions are really fun action packed missions and it fixes a lot of the problems that Lost and Damned and GTA 4 had.The overall atmosphere is also not as dark and lightens the tone. It's also incredibly funny, the characters are funny and it's all really fun. Lightening the tone also helps a lot, cause GTA 4 being way too serious made the game kind of boring to play. This expansion also paves the way to GTA 5 like the medals in missions and multiple characters.Overall this expansion is a great addition and is overall better than the main game, but I still suggest playing all three games.Pros:+ Funny and cleverly written stories+ Missions are action packed so it never gets boring to play+ Soundtracks which fit the overall atmosphere of the expansionsCons:- Gameplay and Car physics aren't that good- Gun gameplay is incredibly stiffFinal Rating:9/10			"

												As I write this, the release date for GTA V is fast approaching. Hard to believe it's been 5 years since GTA4 was released.GTA: Episodes from Liberty City (EFLC) moves the base GTA4 game forward nicely. There's two smaller storylines, each about 12-16 hours of gameplay. Both stories are interwoven with the main GTA4 storyline. Niko Bellic and other characters make appearances in these games, and certain loose ends are tied up in these episodes.The stories are strong, the supporting characters are interesting, and the protagonists are fun to play. Luis Lopez, the main character in The Ballad of Gay Tony, is my new favorite GTA protagonist - even better than Vice City's Tommy Vercetti. These two smaller games are much more interesting to me than Niko Bellic's story.EFLC delivers some technical fixes and gameplay improvements to the base game.  Most notably, we now have mid-mission checkpoints, so if you fail a mission, you can pick up part-way through. This really decreases the frustration level of the game. Less notably, but important to me: traffic is more realistic. And, motorcycles are easier to control.The Ballad of Gay Tony is the standout episode. It brings back the over-the-top flavor of Vice City and San Andreas. The missions are crazy fun, including a shootout on top of the Empire State Building, hijacking a subway car, helicopter duels, and a race around Manhattan -- excuse me, ""Algonquin"" -- involving parachutes, speedboats and fast cars. There's a new cage-fighting mini-game, and everywhere you turn in this one, there's fast cars to boost. And, as mentioned, parachuting! There's 20 optional missions involving base jumping and parachuting skills. Excellent fun. The Ballad of Gay Tony pulls out all the stops to show off what this game engine is capable of delivering. And maybe, hopefully, it shows that Rockstar hasn't forgotten how to have fun. If you need a GTA fix before GTA V appears and you skipped these episodes, you should definitely take a second look.

												Overall a great game, got it working on Windows 10 too.Last time I played was in Windows 7 and it worked fine, but getting it working in Windows 10 was kind of a pain. I could always play it in Windows 7 by putting GFWL on offline mode, but this time there doesn't seem to be an offline option.First of all, install ""Games For Windows Marketplace"" (google it, should be the first result, xbox.com page), set up an account if you don't have one. The game may automatically direct you to the download link upon trying to launch it for the first time, it did for me. You may get a prompt from Windows 10 that it's not compatible, but install it anyway. Without Games For Windows Live/Marketplace installed, the game won't launch at all.Make sure you put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" (without quotes of course) in the game's launch options (right click it in Steam library, select Properties). If you don't, the game won't let you change resolution or any graphics settings.From the main menu, pick the LIVE option and sign in. It may take a while, maybe not, but just be patient if it seems to take a while. At some point it will also ask for your game key. Don't try to close the GFWL overlay in the game while it's signing in either, I did and the whole thing became unresponsive.It may ask you to update GFWL, I updated but it may not be necessary. If you choose to update, it will ask you to exit and re-launch the game, just sign in again from the main menu using the LIVE option. When I tried to sign in when prompted while starting a new game, it crashed. So using the LIVE option from the main menu was necessary for me. It will also download your ""Profile"" this may also take a bit, again just be patient.Once you're signed into LIVE go ahead and start a new game, it should work without any problems.It's been a while since I played this game and it was a pain to get it working this time, but so far it was worth it. I almost gave up at one point, was gonna chalk it up to the game being incompatible with Windows 10. It actually works fine under Windows 10, it's just this Games For Windows Live/Marketplace stuff that gets in the way.TL;DRTo get EFLC working in Windows 10:1) Install Games For Windows Marketplace, sign up for an account if you don't have one.2) Put ""-nomemrestrict -norestrictions"" (without quotes) in launch options for game.3) Launch game, set up graphics, sign into GFWL using the ""LIVE"" option in the main menu. It may take a while, be patient. It may ask for the game key, just put it in and it will work.4) Start a new game.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City*In this review, I'll be covering TLaD and TBoGTStory (TBoGT) - I loved it, full of action. Last mission was really cool. But some missions could be better. 9/10Story (TLaD) - It was alright, it had many awesome moments, but at the same time the game felt really dark. 8/10Storyline Length (TBoGT) - Around 3 hours or so. Maybe a bit more.Storyline Length (TLaD) - Again, around 3 hours or so, or even more.AI (Both games) - Just like in GTA IV, easy to kill, fun to interact with. with your car. Just, brilliant. But they are a tiny bit stupid. 9/10Experience (TBoGT) - You'll have an amazing time playing this! Great intro, great ending, great freemode. 10/10Experience (TLaD) - It's a bit dark, but fun. It had an ok intro, brilliant and satisfying ending, good freemode. 8/10Graphics (TBoGT) - Very nice and full of colour. Very detailed. Loved it. 10/10Graphics (TLaD) - I'd say it had more detail than TBoGT, but it certainly lacked the colour that TBoGT and GTA IV had. I'm not saying it's black and white, it just doesn't have as much colour. Like, the sky is almost always cloudy, the yellow taxis aren't AS yellow. But it's still ok. 7/10Sounds / Voice Acting (TBoGT) - Very nice, the voice acting was brilliant, the car sounds were good, many different radio stations for different radio types. My favourite is Electro Choc. Gun sounds are quite good aswell. 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting (TLaD) - Just like TBoGT, voice acting is great, bike sounds are good, a lot of radio stations, and I think there are other guns which have awesome sounds. 10/10Controls (Both games) - Takes a while to get used to the helicopter, but everything else is just great! 10/10Overall (TBoGT) - 10/10Overall (TLaD) - 9/10These are great games, and I recommend you try it if you haven't already! Isn't much to say here, as I said everything up there. Erm... Enjoy the game, I guess xD			"

												This is pretty much GTA IV on steroids. TLaD expands the base game a bit, especially by adding many new bikes.TBoGT feels like a true evolution (something like Vice City compared to GTA III). There is a quite significant amount of new vehicles (which reappear in GTA V), fun weapons and other minor details, like base jumping. The majority of missions involves doing rather crazy stuff, especially in comparison to the base game. In fact, to me it felt like a bridge between GTA IV and V.The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that GTA IV's campaign was longer. The EFLC's ones are rather short, despite the existence of repetetive side missions.Still, fun-wise, TBoGT is the greatest thing since San Andreas (I'm not counting GTA V because I haven't played it yet).

												Beware of buying GTA 4 and GTA Episodes Of Liberty City.They do not run correctly. I've tried all the commandline fixes and made an account with Rockstar Social Club like one user mentioned. The game runs like poop. Even though I am getting 46fps. Theres texture pop ins and it's not smooth at all, just massive nasty lag. If I turn off vsync there is massive screen tearing. Thousands of users have problems with these games just by browsing the many message boards of the internet on possible fixes. I really want my money back to ,but I don't see any customer support section for steam. These games were a total rip off and they should not be sold.system specs?AMD 965 black edition 3.7GHZCorsair Vengeance 16GB running at 1600mhz750 watt Thermaltake EVO power supply256 Gb Crucial SSD M550 with speeds of 500mb Read and 450mb writeGTX 660 TI 2GBThere is a file called contig that you can get which is a defragmenter meant to defragment a specific set of files for GTA which in turn makes it run like butter. But, as you can see I have a solid state drive and I'm not about to break it for this aweful game. Which in fact did work better when I had a HD 4890 1GB and the game was not on steam. Worked well except it would crash my pc if the settings were not just right. Now it's just total garbage. How can steam sell this crap? Don't they have a reputation to uphold?			"

But some missions could be better. 9/10Story (TLaD) - It was alright, it had many awesome moments, but at the same time the game felt really dark. 8/10Storyline Length (TBoGT) - Around 3 hours or so. Maybe a bit more.Storyline Length (TLaD) - Again, around 3 hours or so, or even more.AI (Both games) - Just like in GTA IV, easy to kill, fun to interact with. with your car. Just, brilliant. But they are a tiny bit stupid. 9/10Experience (TBoGT) - You'll have an amazing time playing this! Great intro, great ending, great freemode. 10/10Experience (TLaD) - It's a bit dark, but fun. It had an ok intro, brilliant and satisfying ending, good freemode. 8/10Graphics (TBoGT) - Very nice and full of colour. Very detailed. Loved it. 10/10Graphics (TLaD) - I'd say it had more detail than TBoGT, but it certainly lacked the colour that TBoGT and GTA IV had. I'm not saying it's black and white, it just doesn't have as much colour. Like, the sky is almost always cloudy, the yellow taxis aren't AS yellow. But it's still ok. 7/10Sounds / Voice Acting (TBoGT) - Very nice, the voice acting was brilliant, the car sounds were good, many different radio stations for different radio types. My favourite is Electro Choc. Gun sounds are quite good aswell. 10/10Sounds / Voice Acting (TLaD) - Just like TBoGT, voice acting is great, bike sounds are good, a lot of radio stations, and I think there are other guns which have awesome sounds. 10/10Controls (Both games) - Takes a while to get used to the helicopter, but everything else is just great! 10/10Overall (TBoGT) - 10/10Overall (TLaD) - 9/10These are great games, and I recommend you try it if you haven't already! Isn't much to say here, as I said everything up there. Erm... Enjoy the game, I guess xD			"

												Once upon a time, there was a brave thief who decided to buy a new dagger. That dagger looked good, was $7, and came in a bundle of 3 daggers for the price of one. The thief bought and opened the bundle and found that the daggers needed to be blessed since it was cursed. Games for Windows Live cursed those daggers and the thief thought of giving up since the creator of these daggers left no cure. Then he came across a blacksmith who looked promising and asked ""How do I remove the curse on these daggers?"" The blacksmith looked at the thief with a smile on her face and said "" Here, use this water. It's called X_Liveless. It should allow you to use those daggers after you placed the water on them."" The thief did as the blacksmith said to do. Several minutes later, the thief was able to wield any of the three daggers. Legend says that he who conquers the curse would be able to enjoy the use of weapons. Simply said, Rockstar should have cleaned GTA IV complete edition for Steam to sell. Don't get me wrong, I like the game. It's just that Rockstar should have made a patch, so Steam could take over instead of Games for Windows Live.			"

												DLC-pack for GTA IV with two separate stories : The lost and the Damned - The ballad of Gay Tony. Looking at the play time....is it a DLC ?Installation : unlike with GTA III, Liberty City, San Andreas and GTA IV, installation went smoothly.However, do install GFWL (recent version) yourself.It's a stand-alone pack so no need to have GTA IV installed.Save games : If you have GTA IV installed be aware that the DLC is using the same standard save-game directory as GTA IV and overwrites the GTA IV save games.Story-line : It has references / connections / cameo's of GTA IV characters so best to play GTA IV first.Game quality : simply a top game just like....GTA IV (story-line, characters, graphs, sound, music, humor), what a vibrant lively open world.Maps : same as in GTA IV so Liberty City with Alderney, Broker and AlgonquinBugs : nopeEnd credits of both missions : don't skip them.....contains some fun to watch drone video views about ingame missions like the bank robbery.LOST AND THE DAMNED (LD)Main story : clash of two biker gangs (The lost and the Damned versus The angels of Death) and the internal rival between the members of the LD.Side missions :Races (12) : located across Liberty City, driving a motor bike is challenging and needs some excercise. Equipped with a baseball bat, you can knock other racers from their bike and vice versa.   -> Fun to do and more challenging then the car races in GTAIVGang Wars (25) : located across Liberty City, find and kill all gang members (The angels of Death members or Russians) at a certain map location. Difficulty increases by taking on more missions. You have help from NPC club bike members but don't rely on them........their AI is not that smart. What to think about a gang member throwing a grenade at me or stepping in my line of fire. -> So so, generic missionsBike Thefts (10) : steal bikes and bring them back to your gang club for money-> So so, easy missionsRandom Characters (3) and  their short stories : are displayed on the map with a white icon.-> Fun to doSeagulls (50) : find and kill the sea gulls (no icons on the map)-> Boring brainless excercise, skipped that one. Without a walktrough, it will takeages to find them.Something else : two new standup comedian shows, the mini games 'air hockey' and 'arm wrestling', new radio stations (heavy metal and rock)BALLAD OF GAY TONY (BT) :Main story : You are the bodyguard Vince of Gay Tony, owner of two discotheques and he is in serious debts with the mafia. Did you like :* Brucie in GTA IV, well then you never met his brother Mori* Roman in GTA IV, well it can get worse, meet Arab money Yusuf Amir, loser number one* CJ in GTA San Andreas, you will be playing Vince escaped his hood but sometimes catches up with his homies Henrique and Armando to go on drug  wars* Gay Bernie Crane in GTA IV, please to meet Gay Tony and his coke head lover boy EvanSide missions :Races (3) : A combination of paragliding, steering a speed boat and driving a car-> Fun to doRandom mission (5) : Funny and hilarious encounters, simply enjoyableSeagulls (50) : As in LD, skipped it, pfff, impossible to find them all without help.......Drug wars (25) : Steal the drugs from another gang, drive to the place, kill everyone together with your friends Henrique and Armando, pick up the drugs package, get in a vehicle and drive back to the offload point in car or boat chase style -> so, so  generic missionsBase jumping (15) : Jump from a helicopter or building and paraglide through air checkpoints and land on a ground target or paraglide directly on to a fixed or moving target (boat / truck). Do it the Assassin's creed away -> fun to do.Cage Fighting : Win six rounds, each consisting of three battles against (un)armed opponentsSomething else : doing some surveillance in the discotheque, champagne drinking contest, dancing with the lllladieezzz, drinking shots and going out with friends..

												Might as well make it detailed.Grand Theft Auto: Episodes From Liberty City is bugged, hacked and modded, and it will ALWAYS stay like that. You can't go in a server without getting missing textures, spammed by bullets and explosives, and get modded and crash. The community for EFLC got screwed up, the servers are filled with people with carmods, people fighting cops, people killing each other for no actual reason (in Free Mode, not Deathmatch), and of course, good ol' crashers. If you want to buy it for Multiplayer, get Multi Theft Auto for San Andreas or wait for GTA V PC.Single player, both of the stories are good, but very short, it feels like the game ended really quickly. So if you like GTA because of it's stories, This might not be what you want.So, The game is short, Multiplayer becomes annoying when you see your damn desktop every five minutes, bugs everywhere... Rockstar needs to fix the game (Spoiler Alert: They won't), so, if you buy this game, you should know you'll experience a short story, crashing, and A LOT of rage in Multiplayer.			"

It's like playing GTA 4.5. Both episodes provide more backstory on events in GTA 4. The Ballad Of Gay Tony is my favorite with its over the top action missions involving boats, tanks, and chopters. You can also replaying any of the missions once the story is complete, a new feature of GTA-series that will make it into GTA 5. Overall a really solid game, get it now.			"

												Liberty City is a one crazy, messed up place with lots of opportunities. EFLC gives GTA IV a revisit in 2 other protagonists' perspective. The characters you play with really distinguish themselves from their peers and they people they work with.While this game is not a big step up from IV, it backs itself up well for being a standalone game (and not a mere DLC). Multiple additions to cars, guns, and recreational activities are just part of the game's added value.Here are the things I liked and disliked about each episode:TLaD+ Biker life - gang wars, hot bikes, gambling, club+ New guns (imagine shooting a sawed-off while riding on a motorcycle)+ New bikes (of course!)- No territorial progression (raiding rival clubhouses and owning them, etc.)- Not enough biker gangs (you have 1 archrival)- Your biker members are all idiots (the AI sucks)- No dating life; lasting relationships purely within the brotherhoodBoGT+ Nightlife and everything nice - clubbing, gay clubs, golden helicopters, golden guns+ New cars (and some of them, fancy!)+ Base jumping+ Gay Tony and Yusuf Amir+ Finally, a tank! (you use it in only 1 mission)- Handling of some cars is a little annoying- Hookups only, dating life nonexistentHere are some of the things I expected, but didn't get, in the game:- Stealth ops (more disguises, suppressed guns)- Winter season (it snows in NY, right?)- The military chasing you at 6 stars- Smarter drivers - they randomly change lanes, do not use their turn lights before doing so. This was a problem in GTA IV that I hoped they were able to solve. I can't believe how many times I failed a mission because of an idiot that decided to change lanes in front of me.			"

												EFLC has new features that GTA IV doesn't have like parachuting, motorcycle racing, gang wars and  new weapons, vehicles and places to visit like nightclubs. The characters in EFLC are interesting. The game is a great complement to the GTA IV story. Though you need to run it with Game for Windows Live which is very annoying and quite difficult to setup. You'll need to tweak the game in order to run it on Windows 8.1 but it works fine on Windows 7.			"

												A relatively short yet interesting expansion of the original GTA IV, this pack actually comprises of 2 storyline games, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, in which you can either play as the biker Johnny Klebitz, or the prestigious Luis Fernando Lopez, respectively.While EFLC is much shorter than the original game, it still shows Liberty City from two completely different perspectives, with one of them being the lifestyle of bikers (bikes, booze, drugs, rock 'n' roll and babes) and the other being the modern, night club lifestyle (fancy sports cars, dancing, pop, booze and babes too).The only cons of the PC version are the inclusion of the obsolete Windows gaming services, which are completely useless and even at times disrupting for the players, and the poor job with the port, which requires you to own a beefy PC to play it on higher settings.Overall, it's a damn fine expansion and I completely recommend it if you're a fan of open world and third person shooter games.

												GTA: Episodes from Liberty City is an expandalone (Standalone Expansion Pack) of GTA IV. They are a two-in-one game, with two sides of one story.On one hand you have The Lost biker gang having gang and family issues, and on the other hand you are Luis Lopez, a part-time bodyguard at Maisonette 9, one of the biggest nightclubs in Liberty City.I will be covering The Ballad of Gay Tony first, as I found it most enjoyable.TBoGT has the most enjoyable missions in any GTA game ever, in my opinion. They are all action packed, interesting and never some sort of escort mission, or ""drive there and come back"" type of mission. If you've ever played GTA:SA then think of the mission where you board the cargo plane, ""Stowaway"". Now, multiply that mission about 30 times and you have TBoGT in a nutshell.You get to own interesting and very fun weapons and vehicles such as huge capacity machineguns and... actually I won't spoil any more, I will just say that you will have fun, GUARANTEED, if you have one of those weapons equipped, or you are driving/piloting any of the special, new vehicles. Most of the new vehicles, if not all of them have been copy and pasted into GTA V, as they were too much fun!The story of TBoGT is a bit lacking, but it's enough there to keep you going. The characters in the story, though, are the most crazy and insane in any GTA game ever! There is not one main story cutscene that doesn't involve someone really high on drugs, half-naked or drunk as ♥♥♥♥. You just can't hold in a laugh every time a cutscene rolls!Buuut, here comes the sad and disappointing part of the pack... The Lost and Damned.Now, this might be a bit of a swayed opinion, but The Lost and Damned was just too boring for me. The first initial missions involve you riding with your gang, informing the player about who is who. The leader of the gang just got out of jail and you are picking up his custom bike from the shop. That's the intro, really, and it's a boring, long intro of just driving. The dialogue kinda made up for it, as it was semi-interesting. It is nice to hear the bikers talk to each other when they are in proximity.You still get some extra weapons that you don't get to use in TBoGT, and even some vehicles, but nothing really stands out. There's a sawed-off double barrel shotgun that is incredibly useful at knocking off enemy bikers, as it only needs one pellet to do so, but it's inaccurate as hell and requires you to be at point blank range. I find melee to be more fun at that time. TBoGT has set the bar for that sort of stuff, and TLaD is nowhere near reaching it.If you really enjoyed GTA IV's narrative and atmosphere, you might enjoy TLaD because it is much more slow and story-driven.In the end, it's weird that it was packaged with a much more ""mindless fun"" type of game as TBoGT.I will rate both parts of the expansions separately, but the game is so cheap now you might as well just buy it for one and have the other as a sort of nice bonus.TLaD: 5/10 - Generally boring, uninteresting, but has its good bits, and come on it's still a GTA game!TBoGT: 9/10 - Definitely takes the cake as it never gets boring until the end of the story.(I have not touched upon the technical issues such as GFWL and such, but there is a mod called x_live_less (remove ""_"", Steam censors the name for some reason) that removes GFWL and may help you with any issues. I managed to play the game start to finish with GFWL installed and updated no problem, but this may be different for you. Keep in mind Steam refunds are a thing, and do not let this sway you from the purchase of this amazing expandalone!)			"

Some missions are even harder than those in the original game. Of course, it had the Rockstar Social Club with a partially bugged login, and also has Games for Windows Live, but once you've logged in to it, you will be able to feel the real Liberty City energy once again.

												Both of these games are really fun, each narrative has it's advantages and disadvantages, and each one has it's own set of vehicles, characters, cameos and easter eggs. They are both fun 10 hour expansions to the game however I would recommend this soully for the Ballad of Gay Tony DLC.The vehicles and missions are more interesting, there are better side missions and recurring jobs and multiplayer is so much better on account of the cars. The ballad of gay tony has excellent replayability, and is generally hella good fun. The one bad point is even on modern hardware these games are really damn unoptimised on modern hardware and there is nothing we can do about that. On a decent rig expect 60 fps but no more. Even after 8 years however the graphics on these games are stunning.			"

Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a third-person open-world adventure shooter. Play either as Johnny Klebitz, the VP of The Lost biker club, or Luis Fernando Lopez, henchman of Gay Tony, as you strive through the criminal underworld of Liberty City.Pros: This is two full campaigns for Grand Theft Auto IV but doesn't require the original game to run. These are characters that crossed Niko Bellic's path in the original campaign, but their stories happen in parallel to it, allowing you to see who they were, deal with their troubles on their end, giving you a chance to understand events that happened behind the curtains of crimes Niko was involved in. Both are full-fledged story lines of their own, with its own lot of unique characters you come across and gameplay elements. Your new friends brings new perks of their own, and new locations.Cons: You don't have the same feeling of discovery in this game as it's the one as Grand Theft Auto IV, with some locations or stores no longer available. You have a lot less mini-games and side quests, and much if the character customization is gone. There is no major change to the city.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youIt's more of the same, so it's all up to you. If you didn't enjoy Grand Theft Auto IV that much, there is no reason to buy this. However, if you did like GTA4 and wished you could play more campaign mode in Liberty City, these will deliver!—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												The expansions to Grand Theft Auto IV do nothing to remedy the issues of the original game (see my recommendation for that title). If anything, they are steps downward from the original; they are repetitive, and the characters are difficult to enjoy. The main character from The Lost and the Damned is particularly unlikeable. In sum, these don't add much. They go on sale from time to time for a very affordable price; if you're going to buy them, then buy them at that reduced price.			"

												While the game is still burdened with the same DRM and bad port job as GTA IV, the addition of checkpoints to the missions makes the game play a lot smoother and less annoying. It makes me wonder why they didn't just go back and add them to IV - it would be a quick fix.The plot isn't as good as in GTA IV. Nico as a protagonist really grows on you and the main character just isn't as interesting. But otherwise, it works well as a continuation of GTA IV.			"

												A fantastic expansion for GTA4. GTA4 on its own is already a great game, but it was lacking some of the older GTA things that made the series fun. The added some of that into this stand alone expansion pack. The story on both episodes is pretty solid and the missions are fun. The better of the 2 is The Ballad of Gay Tony. It is arguably better than GTA4 in all areas. The missions are more diverse and they even add some of the older GTA missions, for example there is a mission where you get to skydive. These episodes are on sale all the time so I hightly recommend them, I give these episodes a 9/10, lots of extra GTA fun.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episode from Liberty City is an Action/Adventure/Open-World game that contains the 2 DLC of Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned. The Ballad of Gay Tony follows the story of the protagonist: Luis Lopez who is the henchman of Gay Tony in a difficult time for the U.S. economy. The Lost and Damned follows the story of the protagonist: Johnny Klebitz who is the Vice-President of the motorcycle club: The Lost. Now let's talk about the multiplayer! The multiplayer of the TLAD is completly dead. If you want to have fun in multiplayer in EFLC, TBOGT is consider as the best multilayer of all the GTA IV games. To play multiplayer you will need: Xbox Live Account (Gold is not required) and a Rockstar Game Social Club Account. For more fun you will need: Simple Native Trainer 6.5 (link below) and ASI loader. Hope this review will help you to make a choice!Links: RGSC: http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/Register to Xbox Live: Xbox.comSimple Native Trainer 6.5: http://www.gta4-mods.com/script/simple-trainer-version-65-f2115ASI Loader: http://www.gta4-mods.com/tools/gta-iv-asi-loader-v1020b-f1976 "

												WOW, What a game(s) both being the same but different gameplay mechanics implemented, felt really different of each one.I started with TBOGT, I hated it when the flying missions started and I though they will never end! But I loved them because I'm not going to lie I SUCKED AT FLYING HELICOPTERS! Now I can thanks to this missions! :-D , the Objective Score looks like it was implemented on GTA V after this, that was cool, felt like fresh old optional objectives, really cool tho. I really don't recomend it to people that are really sensitive to terrorism topics, because this ""Episode"" has a lot of Terrorism on it. TRY AT YOUR OWN RISK (This is only for those kind of people, for the rest you'll enjoy it), the story was filled with a lot of funny moments and how they connect to the base game GTA IV really explains all the events happened that was clever!Then I played TLAD, I really HATED IT at first because you need to follow your gang It was like ""caged"" because you don't like maybe get orders from a major command? (when you already get them with the missions lol?), anyways I liked the crew system XCOM-like but the best part for me was the CREW HELP! WOAH, I felt really special! because sometimes I really needed help and they where just a call away and I never felt alone, BROTHERS FOREVER! this episode was not funny on the same way as TBOGT, but was SUPER FILLED with action, WARS and SHOOTINGS EVERYWHERE so CRAZEEEEE! was really cool in that aspect. The Objective Score was not in this ""Episode"", and the bikes where superb but I don't know it felt more shorter for me than TBOGT, maybe because I mostly didn't stopped playing it because it was so good. Both Episodes are brutal and I really enjoyed them, hope to see more like this content on future GTA Titles.Mods used: - RealityIV- Real Gunshots Sounds- Realistic Driving EFLC- Flashlight 4 Weapons- ColAccel- ScriptHook .NET- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥If you are getting stuck on ""No. 3"" Mission (TBOGT) after you are going to pull down the cars and after the race cinematics just skip them to avoid freezing on loading, if doesn't load the mission at all enable Vsync or limit the framerate via command line.If you are falling through the ground in TLAD when starting the game and you are using ""ColAccel"" just delete or rename ""colCache.dat"" and start the game again.Hope you enjoy it as I did!

												Grand theft auto 4, what can i say that has not already been said? This game (and its 2 expansions) are works of video game art. The entire story and cinimatic parts of the gameplay play out like they are a movie rather than a game though, not on the level of Konami's Metal Gear franchise. The story follows Niko Bellic, a immagrant from (most likely) Yugoslavia or Ukraine looking to fufill the ""American dream"" with his cousin Roman. As the story gets deeper and you encounter more of Niko's old, and new, enemies you see that niko's dream to live the american dream turns into a nightmare.

												The game itself is quite nice. Especially since it features one of the very few openly gay videogame characters. The problem with it is, that it still needs Windows live to run, if you want to save games. A service wich is no longer supported by microsoft itself and never really was by any player. If you want to play online you also have to sign in into the ""Rockstar Social Club"". So if you want to run this game as intended you need to be signed in into three online platformes at once. Two of them are only there to make sure you bought the game. And in the case of Windows live to annoy you. So no thanks. Until they at least cut out this Windows live crap, this game is going into my libary limbo. What a shame.			"

												So I recently reinstalled this game since I've been watching Son's of Anarcy and wanted a similiar experience to the tv show.  So once I've installed and launched it requires me to sign into Windows Live, and it wouldn't let me save untill I do.  Because of the simple fact I can't even progress though the game I say ♥♥♥♥ this game.  This is sad though because even though this game is good, although maybe not the best GTA game, it was still good.			"

												Two stories for the price of one!First story is about Billy Grey, club president of the Lost MC in Alderney that is finally released from a court-ordered rehab after being arrested for narcotics possession. His vice-president, Johnny is not too happy about his return, after having spent the past year as the club's acting president all while dealing with its financial troubles, mainly caused by Billy's nefarious leadership, and maintaining a truce with the Lost's rivals, The Angels of Death, in order for the Lost to run their drug and gun running operations more freely throughout Liberty City. Following his release, Billy quickly breaks the truce with the Angels before instigating a war with them, causing tensions between him and Johnny to quickly grow, with the latter more interested in keeping the club's business running smoothly than engaging in fights with the Angels.Second story talks about Luis Fernando Lopez after witnessing the heist of the Bank of Liberty. Luis enters the loft of his employer, owner of successful clubs Maisonette 9 and Hercules: Gay Tony Prince. Tony is in serious financial trouble, having taken out massive loans from the Ancelotti crime family and Mori Kibbutz in order to keep his clubs running. He asks Luis to work for Mori and Rocco Pelosi, an Ancelotti gangster, in order to satisfy his debts. Luis soon becomes acquainted with Yusuf Amir, an Emirati real estate developer who is interested in purchasing and franchising one of Tony's clubs, and Ray Bulgarin, a Russian crime lord he met in the club. Tony also plans to buy two million dollars worth of diamonds in order to sell them at a higher price, but members of The Lost Motorcycle Club, led by Johnny, intervene the trading and steal them, resulting in the death of Tony's boyfriend Evan Moss.

												I imagine it would be an amazing game, you know, if it worked at all on Windows 8.I purchased GTA IV and EFLC in a pack. GTA IV works fine (after a bit of tweaking), EFLC simply does not want to work, I suggest you wait for this game to fall in price (sales) before buying it just in case.			"

												Summary: Overall The Ballad of Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned are great standalones with slight improvements to the original GTA 4. Each one offers roughly 5-9 hours of gameplay and new elements such as parachuting, base jumping, mini-games, weapons, and vehicles. 4.5/5.Packaged together, Episodes from Liberty City offer two standalone games that take on very different approaches to the original gameplay in GTA 4. Both offer their own single-player campaigns with roughly 5 hours of missions, mini-games, and a variety of new weapons and vehicles to spice up your experience. The stories, just like the original, are well-written and interweaves with Niko Bellic. Playing the original and then through the episodes will give a second perspective on who did what, where the diamonds came from, and so on. They aren't heavily dependent on knowing the original plot, but they can be better appreciated if you've played through it.The Lost and Damned takes the perspective of Johnny Klebitz, the vice-president of The Lost Motorcycle Club (TLMC). As you would expect, you primarily travel by motorcycle and much of the storyline is around the MC and their conflict with the police, rival gangs, and eventually the mafia.  There is a healthy heaping of new music revolving around the 1% culture, weapons such as the sawn-off shotgun and grenade launcher, and mini-games in the clubhouse such as arm-wrestling and air hockey. One of the big improvements, at least in my eyes, is the use of mid-mission respawns. If you die or fail a mission, restarting it via phone will no longer pull you to the very beginning of the mission. You will probably respawn before the segment where you failed, started. This cuts down on the amount of needless driving when you fail a mission and makes it less of a hassle restarting.The second episode is the Ballad of Gay Tony, which doesn't take you from the perspective of the flamboyantly gay Tony Prince (whom you may have noticed in Niko's story), but his bodyguard and partner Luis Lopez. If TLAD focused on motorcycles, it's safe to say that TBGT focused on helicopters, base jumping, parachuting, and night clubs. Again, TBGT's plot is interwoven into the original plot and fleshes out much of the why's and how's of that story. As with TLAD, there's almost a good half-dozen new mini-games, such as golf, dancing, drinking, parachuting, and races. If you had a hard time with the helicopter controls, then bad news, about 1/4 of the missions require piloting a helicopter at some point. Generally the storyline is well-written, the characters are great with Yusuf, the playboy millionaire Arab, Mori, the bodybuilding dwarf with a God complex, and Bulgarin, the Russian mobster collecting American rock memoribilia. The characters drive the storyline well and leaves the game with a satisfying conclusion.Overall the game improves on a few issues from the original, but there are still a few things that hamper your gaming experience. Controls are still finicky, with driving still painful (you'll come to hate motorcycles on the final TBGT mission), flight controls difficult, and shooting still frustrating at times. It'll put a smile on your face when you see an NPC struggle to get in and out of a vehicle, but make you cringe when your characters' pathing causes him to dart back-and-forth around a vehicle. Mission restart has been improved, maybe some way of fast-travel would make driving less of a burden but I'm sure they want the playtime to be buffed higher by needless traveling. In summary, it's a strong buy and I highly recommend the game, I think that if you especially like the original then you'll find enjoyment with the episodes. 4.5/5.			"

												A fantastic expansion for GTA4. GTA4 on its own is already a great game, but it was lacking some of the older GTA things that made the series fun. The added some of that into this stand alone expansion pack. The story on both episodes is pretty solid and the missions are fun. The better of the 2 is The Ballad of Gay Tony. It is arguably better than GTA4 in all areas. The missions are more diverse and they even add some of the older GTA missions, for example there is a mission where you get to skydive. These episodes are on sale all the time so I hightly recommend them, I give these episodes a 9/10, lots of extra GTA fun.			"

Of course the more missions you complete, the more you're going to have options as far as weapons and newer exotic vehicles to steal.

												GTA Episodes from Liberty City is a collection of the 2 GTA 4 expansions: ""The Lost and Damned"" and ""The Ballad of Gay Tony"". Almost everything i had to say about the original GTA 4 also applies here, since the expansion are basically additional story missions with 2 new protagonists and some new additions. The story of the episodes has the same quality as the original, and they interwine in a cohesive way. TLAD is bike-focused, and TBoGT has new mechanics that will remind you of San Andreas. The missions are more varied too. The map is the same, but the soundtrack is new. It is shorter, but i enjoyed it more than the original. And TBoGT finally introduces a replay mission feature, with optional objectives to complete. The PC related issues are also the same.

												Wow. Just realized I had not reviewed this yet.. Pro's. Great addition to the GTA family. Based on what I ve seen of GTA V might be the last of the game play style that made GTA what it was. Of course, being a bit older now, the graphics are typical of the time, but fun and good to run with. The games both, have good story lines, but more important.. the ability to still be a total moron or not and just do what you want.. TBoGT being the best ever IMO. I love the ability to meet a girl in a club.. ' hit it ' in the bathroom of said club, then maybe or maybe not ever call her again... ah... just like RL. BEST PART OF THE GAMES:LCPDFR If your a cop fan. If you just want to occasionally play as a cop.. you need this and LCPDFR.. I ve not finished nor put in more than 20-25 hours of the games.. the rest is all playing the character of Officer Jeorg, 13 year vet, often suspended and no understanding as to the why of it.. along with his usual partner.. Marty.LCPDFR is still a totally free Mod, and it still has additions etc being created. LSPDFR is moving along.. but has slowed d/t all the cheating ( EXCUSE ME ) d/t the way they are trying to address the 'modders' corrupting GTA V.

												Double the story, double the fun! This DLC actually contains two stories: you play as Johnny and also as Luis. Both stories take place in Liberty City and should be launched separately. Lost of The Damned felt a bit boring as the game put too much emphasis on the use of motorbikes. So, after a while I hated I couldn't really get into a car but Luis's story compensated me for that.There isn't much to say about these two stories. Everything is identical to the things we got used to in GTA IV. Perhaps, many of the missions seems a bit more over the top but it only increased the fun for me.Putting the bad optimisation aside this is a damn fine DLC. If you liked the original game you'll like this one, too.			"

												I do not recommend GTA IV or GTA EFLC now that GFWL is non-functional. Let me be clear: The game is a great game! The developers did a great job, but Rockstar leadership failed by not removing GFWL after it's shut-down.As of summer 2014, there is no multiplayer AND no saving! If you want to play GTA IV, enjoy playing the first mission over and over just to get free roam. With only a pistol, and no armor. Every time you start up the game.			"

												I used to really enjoy this game back when it came out, so when it came out on sale again I decided to buy it before committing to the new GTA5. What a mistake I made, if I said the game was terribly bugging, especially with the addition of having to use windows live I would be making an understatement. What's more than enjoyable is the hour or two you'll find yourself in trying to set up game files, searching through every avenue of support pages, and the many attemtps at ""possible"" fixes.  If you computer has a video card with over 1GB of ram this game wont run on anything except the minimal  graphics, no exceptions. Unless you have the day off work, are pretty computer savvy, and have a tremedous amount of patience. Also I will not be buying the new GTA5 because of this.			"

												been playing video games since the 80s, and for me this is clearly (along with GTAIV) the best game in history. the level or detail and realism is just beyond imagination. been playing it for years and i keep discovering new things, new places .. i play EFLC TBOGT with Niko mod because in TBoGT you have clubs, taxi and opened islands since the beginning. EFLC have also more vehicles. honestly, if there wasn't a good Niko mod out there, i'm not sure i would have rated the same. i think i would have not rated and rated IV instead. the game graphics are still excellent, and with the modding you get an endless gaming experience. there are always nice mods coming out. from maps, to functionnality (scripts) , and of course vehicles. about the EFLC game itself, it's splitted into 2 games. one TBoGT where main character is an associate nightclubs owner, and the other TLaD where the character is a bikers gang member. TBoGT's atmosphere is dance music oriented, but missions are awful. i mean 80% of TBoGT missions are totally unrealistic (destroy a huge crane in city center, destroy a yacht 2 km from the coast, steal a subway with an helo..). in TLaD, atmosphere is metal rock, metamphet sh### and broken showers.if you encounter problems with the game launching, it's most of the time caused by obsolete Games for Windows thing. search on the net a tutorial that explains how to install things and in which order, and it should work fine			"

												Definitely a lot better than GTAIV. Most annoying things has been fixed: steering, physics, combat, even radios has been improved. Both ""The Lost and Damned"" and ""Ballad of Gay Tony"" have more interesting stories, more diverse gameplay (attack helicopters, sky diving, and combined vehicle races). Interesting side activities are back while NOBODY calls you up for a bowling every 2 minutes.Before playing Episodes from Libery City I haven't got high hopes for GTAV, now I've changed my mind. The only problem with this DLC is that is standalone and all the changes are not implemented into GTAIV itselfP.S. GTA SA is still the bestest. "

												There’s no contesting how good a game it is. My grievance however, is with the painfully annoying social club, drm, crap optimisation and bugs. My god the bugs!I’ve bought enough Rockstar games to know unequivocally, of their complete contempt for the pc community. It’s a rather hard learned lesson, but I’ll never give Rockstar another cent for their cynical shovelware. If I want to play a future Rockstar game, I’ll either pick up a console port or, better yet, just torrent it. "

												WOW! there is no other words to describe this game the story for both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony are fantastic instead of going through the game as Niko Bellic this time you play as two new characters that were seen in the normal GTA IV game but not playable the two new characters Luis Lopez and Johnny Klebitz stories in the game are very interesting and will hook people in immediately. Still retaining the features from GTA IV The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony both add new features in the game that can only be used when playing EFLC for example The Ballad of Gay Toy adds parachutes to the game so now you can go and jump off the empire state building and not die when you hit the ground. Like in GTA IV you still explore Liberty City just this time you can access places that could not be accessed in GTA IV. Like I said the story for both games really will hook you in like GTA IV's story hooked me in when I first played the game both games adds up to about 80 hours of gameplay which will keep people entertained throughout both games. So if you're looking to buy a GTA game I really really recommend you get GTA IV and GTA EFLC they are both very enjoyable games and they will both blow you away without a doubt!.			"

												Rockstar has recently, with no warning, forcibly taken out content from one of their bigger games (GTA San Andreas): it's now missing music and video options it had before, plus all the savefiles were broken and mods turned uncompatible; it also introduced a lot of bugs, so some consumers can't even play the game anymore. It's definitely an illegal practice under any country's consumer laws, and that's why I can't, in good mind, recommend any of their games anymore, as there's no warranty that they won't be doing this to their other games.If you want better open-world, sandbox games, look for Saints Row 3 or 4, Just Cause 2 and Sleeping Dogs - besides being better games, their developers never stole content from their customers.

Saints Row is a far superior choice... spend your money on that, kids.Looking back, I figured I should elaborate a bit more.  Saints Row kind of picked up where GTA: San Andreas left off.  More fun, less serious.  I didn't care for GTA 4 at all, especially forcing you to hang out with your ""friends"" and do mundane activities.

												I recommend the game but Rockstar's Social Club launcher for gta 4 is the most annoying thing I've encountered. Much more annoying than all the most annoying video game characters in the world. If anything, the ""Social Club login failed."" problem is more annoying to me than my games freezing or crashing after hours of play without saving.Rockstar, you make great games.

Over all very fun Ballad of Gay Tony was probably the most fun out of the GTA IV Ballad added fun and ridiculous missions while Lost and the damned was a little lack luster.

												As a GTA fan since GTA3 came out for PC... I originally owned and played this one on xbox 360 shortly after it came out and then bought it again here on sale after finally building a capable enough PC. I've heard many people say bad things about the PC port of this and, while it could be improved, I can honestly say it still looks much better on PC with the graphics settings cranked up. Having the keyboard and mouse in addition to a 360 controller is great. What I love best though is the modding abilities. I've already played through the game and it's been a lot of fun going back and now playing with some mods I've found as well as trying out making my own mods.			"

												Ok, Rockstar you released this game nearly 5 years ago and when this game was first announced i ♥♥♥♥ my pants i couldnt believe that i could not only return to liberty city but also could play two different stories as gta 4 was a little lame.., it still had its charm though ,but i digress, this game is awesome, why? well not only are graphics better (well sorta) but has a way better story arch, new weapons and some returning weapons from gta 4 ,way better missions and better characters. Each story represents the different difficulties for instance GTA: TLAD is for more beginner types whereas GTA: TBOGT is for more experienced players the missions are far more difficult and provides plenty of challenge..., as for gameplay its overall the same as GTA IV accept the addition of new running animations of the characters and a few new vehicles however theres one particular vehicle and weapon that tops them all of course ill let you find out but its awesome,,,now for the mods..oh my, there are hundrends upon thousands of free mods for this game and not to mention there are so many modding websites dedicated to this game but my final verdict for this game is a 8/10 the game could have had a higher score if rockstar didnt use the same formula from GTA IV and added new gameplay styles like being arrested which is in fact a long awaited feature....you know?

												I think by now everyone knows the GTA series.It's open world at it's best, the game has so much going on you can run around for hours before even starting the campaign.I was a little wary about buying the game after the latest reviews about how the game was broken due to Games For Windows Live (GFWL).Running the game for the first time involved a few steps, but I got it running, so leaving here the steps I had to take.-Setup a Rockstar Social Club (RSC) account and a GFWL account before hand. (if you don't have one yet, if you do, check if you can log in to each one)-Ran the game the first time, had an error missing GFWL, downloaded and installed the client for GFWL, ran game again, signed in to both RSC and GFWL, it worked. (helps if you set GFWL to auto sign in, or game might restart a couple times before you log in)-Had a problem with the game not detecting a 3GB RAM vid card, so the graphics were ""locked"" at 800x600 with all settings set to low, had to go to the Steam entry for the game in your library under properties and launch options, add the commands: -norestrictions -availablevidmem 100-Game still started in 800x600, but now the graphics options were unlocked and correctly reads 3GB memory, so just set graphics to max and all set!Of course I can't guarantee this will work for everyone, but did for me.Have fun!

												If you ever decide to buy a Grand Theft Auto game for modibality, this should be your first choice. You are all probably familiar with Grand Theft Auto, shoot stuff, run over people, kill police officers and perfrom other violent, sadistic fun actions. This game does have a plot which crosses over with Grand Theft Auto 4, so some things may be unclear if you have not played it. Aside from all that, the amount of mods for this game, good God! You can get legitimate real life cars, have more traffic diversity, get an entirely new map, be a police officer, the sky is the limit. If you ever finish the game or get bored of going on rampages while taking countless lives, then the mods will increase your play time, there are so many! The excellent modability is what makes this game truly worthwhile, the money you will pay is a small price to pay for the endless gameplay capability. There are a few compatibility issues with Windows 8, and you need a nuclear powered computer to run this game with full graphics and all the mods, but frankly I have an adequate computer and I am able to run the LCPDFR mod and a couple car mods at medium settings quite well. In the end, this game is fantastic not only because of the mods, but because of its good plot, and wide lively envirnoment. "

												It's hard to NOT reccomend EFLC. I mean yes, it still has some glaring issues from its brother, GTA 4, such as the just rather grey and depressing Liberty City (and TLaD doesn't do much to fix this, especially when it adds that grainy filter), the PC port (which I'll talk about more later) is still random, sometimes it will run great, other times it's like playing a slide show, and all of it varies from PC to PC. I've seen fixes that helped improve performance for some by 20 frames, and then when I try it it does nothing to the performance. But overall, you're getting a very solid package with EFLC.TLaD:This expansion in my opinion has the stronger story of the two, but the weaker world. You are ""Johnny the Jew"" part of a biker gang that has been on the fall since its peak in the 60s. The leader of your bike gang begins to go crazy with power, and starts a war with the AoD (Angels of Death), and as you can imagine, chaos ensues. I'm going to leave the story off from that since as I said it really is quite the ride, and if you liked GTA 4's story you'll really enjoy TLaD as Rockstar really managed to combine the stories quite well with several crossovers from Niko. This was the first game in a long time that I sat down and beat the story in one sitting, it really is that good in my opinion.However, if you DON'T like GTA 4's focus on story and grim approach, TLaD probably isn't for you. Now, that's not to say if you didn't like Niko's story you won't like Johnny's, as they are quite different, but Johnny's story is still very grim compared to other GTA stories (not to say it doesn't have its share of laugh out loud moments and some absurdity thrown in there). But if you're expecting this to bring the insanity of GTA:SA combined with a ton of unique side missions, TLaD is not for you. The only notable side missions include a new race mode with bikes and you now have the option to hit oppenents with bats to throw them off course, and a ""gang wars"" side mission which is cool on paper, with X-COM style mechanics in the sense that the more you use a gang memeber with out them dying the better they become in battle, but when they die that's it, they're dead and you have to start all over again with a new memeber. But the AI is just not good enough to make it worth your time, and often my team mates would die from a bomb I threw at a car that my team mates are trying to ram, no matter how hard I try to get them to get away. Also there are only like 5 scenarios that just repeat through out the 25 side missions, and only a few lines of dialogue that the characters just repeat over and over again. You do get some guns from doing it, but if you've already beaten the story, chances are you have a ton of ammo for these guns already.Overall I give TLaD a 8/10:Pros:Great StoryGreat mechanicsSome fun new toysOverall solid expereinceGreat Voice ActingCons:World feels lackingGrainy filter makes the game look ugly and even more washed outTBoGT:This expansion without a shadow of a doubt is one that every fan of the GTA series should play. The story, while not as strong as TLaD, wraps up many, if not all lose ends from GTA 4 and TLaD. The world is great fun with loads of side missions that will keep you busy for hours and hours. And you get some fantastic toys that brings back some of that absurdity many loved from GTA:SA.You are Luis Lopez, a former criminal who was involved with a lot of drug dealing in Northern Algonquin, but has since moved to Downtown Algonquin and changed his life around. He's now making a lot more money, works night clubs, and is the body guard of Tony Prince (Gay Tony) a once big shot going through a mid-life crisis, threatened by the closing of his night clubs under a new law in Liberty City, and he owes money to just about every major gang in Liberty City...I think you see where this is going. So through a 6-8 hours long story you'll go from blowing up cranes, highjacking trains, and riding planes. It truly is a fun time with some of the best missions in the GTA 4 trilogy. Also, the start of this expansion is in my opinion the best of the series. TBoGT also has a fantastic world, and in my opinion is more engaging than even GTA 4's. You have fight night matches, an awesome racing mode that has you jump out of a helicopter, land in a boat, then drive to a car, and race in the cars which also have nitrous, it really is fun. On top of that you have club managment which is...so-so it's rather boring as you just watch over the crowd for a few minutes but every time you do it you get a mission from some celeberity at the end of your shift, this ranges from simply escorting them from paparazzi to spraying people down with a fire truck, it feels very familiar to the wackiness in Saints Row 2, which is definitly not a bad thing. You also get base jumping side missions, which are really fun. You'll be jumping out of helicopters, off of buildings, and off of motorcycles mid-air, and it feels very similar to GTA:SA. And finally, you get some ""Drug War"" missions, which are very similar to the ""Gang Wars"" from TLaD, the only difference being they got rid of the X-COM mechanics and instead of just killing everyone, you normally have a goal to steal the ""product"" and cash and get it to a safe location without it blowing up or you dying. It's fun for the first few times, but just like the gang wars  it's really just like 5 scenarios repeated and the dialogue begins repeating.TBoGT will pretty much appeal to anyone that has liked a GTA game in the past, and in my opinion that's fantastic.Overall I give TBoGT a 10/10. Must play.The overall package is fantastic, and well worth your money. Rockstar did it again. PC PERFORMANCE:Yeah, so I'm going to be frank here, if you don't have a decent PC in TODAY standards, you may want to consider getting this on console. Now-a-days the game is so cheap on both platforms it's worth getting the PC version anyways just to mess around with mods, even if the game doesn't run so hot for you. But on my 660 and i5-3470 rig this game runs very poor, especially for its age and the visuals. The frame-drops in the game are just really strange, I've gone from 140fps in one second to 30 in the next, it's just all over the place, and I STRONGLY reccomend putting V-sync on to stop this, even though V-sync locks the fps at 55...seriously what the heck were you thinking Rockstar? Oh yeah, and the benchmark is pointless, unlike other games like Metro: LL where the benchmark pushes your PC to the limit and you'll never encounter that heavy of a load in game, the benchmark is really easy on your PC and I get almost double the fps average in the benchmark than I do in game... There are some fixes out there that are worth a try but I couldn't find one that worked for me. Also if you have more than 2GB of Vram the game won't let you change the settings (there are some fixes to this, just google it). And on top of it all, this game uses not ONE, not TWO, but THREE DRM services...including GFWL...yeah.So the PC port is pretty abysmal I must say, and I hope Rockstar treats the PC version of GTA V with more care (they better, considering how long we've waited). That being said, if you have the PC to run it well, this is WAY better looking than the console version, especially now that the shadows actually look like shadows and not blobs! And there are some cool PC exclusive features like your own radio station that plays your own songs, some improved animations, and the ability to save video clips and edit them together. Also, if you're like me and had a XBL account GFWL isn't all bad, as you can still get into private chats with people using the XB1 and 360, so that's sorta neat.			"

												Chased a helicopter carrying a tank.  Shot the chains holding the tank.  Then went on a rampage with said tank.10/10 would play again....In all honesty, this is the way to experience GTA4.  While the base game takes on a dark and all-too-serious mood (as does The Lost and Damned), The Ballad of Gay Tony strives to bring back some of the madcap energy of Vice City and San Andreas.  Many of the missions are completely off the wall, in the best way possible.  Most of the supporting cast are in the vein of the crazies you may have worked for in VC and SA.  And it may just be me, but the city seems more bright and colorful in TBoGT, as opposed to the washed-out look of the base game and TLAD.The Lost and Damned is worth a play, tho.  While not as high-energy as TBoGT, it sports some interesting features and a solid story.  The changes to motorcycle driving are very welcome, as is the ability to call for (and cruise with) backup.  Cruising in formation with Liberty Rock Radio in the background is a soulful experience.But TBoGT takes the cake.  More supercars, skydiving, a rocket-spitting attack helicopter and a tank make for a great after-story sandbox of urban chaos.  And then you get to use all of those in multiplayer.If you wanna get ready for the PC release of GTAV, The Ballad of Gay Tony is the way to go.			"

												Overall a good wrap up to GTA V, the story wraps up loose ends and gives a different view of the plot.  The lost and the damned is an excellent expansion, almost all the missions are fun, motorcycles become cool to use.  It's flat out fantastic, the plot is great and I'm not into choppers!  Sadly, the Ballad of Gay Tony is the weakest of the 3 and the last to be played.  While the plot is interesting and you'll want to know how it ends, the missions in this one are very difficult and extremely frustrating!  It's as if they said, ""Hey? how can we possibly make this scenario pack really hard?  We'll just include TONS of missions with helicopters that are really difficult to drive!  You need to fly it with the number pad, the w key, the shift key, AND the mouse to fire weapons!  But don't press A, you'll instantly jump out of the chopper.  One of these missions made me so mad I punched the couch!  Anyway, overall it's totally worth it if you've beaten GTA IV.			"

												So on the third or 4th mission, you steal an attack helicopter (scout style) with missiles and a mini gun) from a huge yacht and then you blow the yacth up with the helicopter you stole. There is more action in 1 hour of playing this game than 10 hours of playing vanilla GTAIV.Anyways, it's cool how they copied half life like blue shift and opposing force did (the same story line, but from a different point of view)I traded 4 tf2 keys for it so it was worth it for me. (free)Not sure how I feel about the ""gay"" theme on the entire game, but the ""latin"" dude luis you play as certainly has his ♥♥♥♥ together and in always on point...funny how he always claims to be off drugs though...yeah right! Anyways, pretty good game so far. I'm not too far into yet, I don't think anyway. I wonder how long it will be too.			"

												As a GTA fan since GTA3 came out for PC... I originally owned and played this one on xbox 360 shortly after it came out and then bought it again here on sale after finally building a capable enough PC. I've heard many people say bad things about the PC port of this and, while it could be improved, I can honestly say it still looks much better on PC with the graphics settings cranked up. Having the keyboard and mouse in addition to a 360 controller is great. What I love best though is the modding abilities. I've already played through the game and it's been a lot of fun going back and now playing with some mods I've found as well as trying out making my own mods.			"

												I played through the Ballad of Gay Tony. If you've played GTAIV you kinda know the basics of a GTA game and yeah this has them. But if you were picking this up as an expansion on GTAIV's story; probably not worth it.  The story was kind of lack-luster, sometimes it was there, sometimes it just plain wasn't. The gameplay during missions was often more stressful than fun, having to retry things over and over again because your precision aim catching the guy you just chucked out of the helicopter wasn't quite right, or you did something slightly wrong.. It's a very unforgiving game, to say the least, and if you want to play the story for fun this probably isn't the game for you to be honest.			"

												Episodes from Liberty City uses the same map and graphic engine as GTA IV; but adds two new stories to the franchise.  The Lost and the Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony.  As always, if you are conservative, you will probably have an allergic reaction to this game.GTA is about anarchy, doing what you want, and having absolutely no respect for any authority figure ever.   Every politican is either corrupt and on the take, or naive and going nowhere.  Every cop is either a low-IQ semi-functional 'special' person, or a corrupt psychopathic killer; usually both.  Every drug dealer has a soft side, ever murderer has a story, every bad deed goes rewarded.   I remain ever surprised at the popularity of this amazing franchise.  It is at the same time, the most American gaming franchise ever made, and the most jarringly mocking of American 'values'.This game features profanity, positive views of drug use, murder, murder, murder, violent music, questionably pragmatic ethics, robbery, lots of robbery, vengeance, wreckless driving, anti-capitalist values, pro-capitalist values, and foreigners.Enjoy.

												The gameplay of TBOGT is much better than the original game. You get crazy weapons, a ridicolously fun assault helicopter and   the missions are all very entertaining, right from the first one! Unlike GTA IV, here, the whole action starts right from the beginning. Overall, I find TBOGT better than GTA IV in any aspect, although the story of Nico is deeper. Personally, I didn't like The Lost and Damned too much, but it was okay.			"

												Episodes from Liberty City uses the same map and graphic engine as GTA IV; but adds two new stories to the franchise.  The Lost and the Damned, and The Ballad of Gay Tony.  As always, if you are conservative, you will probably have an allergic reaction to this game.GTA is about anarchy, doing what you want, and having absolutely no respect for any authority figure ever.   Every politican is either corrupt and on the take, or naive and going nowhere.  Every cop is either a low-IQ semi-functional 'special' person, or a corrupt psychopathic killer; usually both.  Every drug dealer has a soft side, ever murderer has a story, every bad deed goes rewarded.   I remain ever surprised at the popularity of this amazing franchise.  It is at the same time, the most American gaming franchise ever made, and the most jarringly mocking of American 'values'.This game features profanity, positive views of drug use, murder, murder, murder, violent music, questionably pragmatic ethics, robbery, lots of robbery, vengeance, wreckless driving, anti-capitalist values, pro-capitalist values, and foreigners.Enjoy.

I still love the game 3 years later however it's vbery hard to get running correctly it's sad that rockstar dropped all support for it but if you look around hard enough there are fixes available.

												I have always loved GTA. Since I was a little kid going over to my friends house playing San Andreas and useing cheates for stuff and how I thought what you could do was unlimited. But now that I have gotten into actualy playing the game and not just messing around with it and have sat down and played the older GTA's and beaten most of them I think I would be able to say what I think of this game and how it dose with entertaning gamers.  What I think of this game is kinda a downgrad of what was set by the older game's. The feeling of no limitles was removed from this game. In SA you could roam and see all the sights and have a blast and feel like you could do anything. In this game it is about story more than open world stuff. While it is open world the standers set by SA have not been reached in here. While it has a really good story it felt like you could do nothing after you compleated the game. All you could do was just roam and cause distuction. While that's fun and all it was all you could really do with out having mods installed. And all the money you collected you could spend it on nothing. No car mods no houses  nothing. All you could use that money for was to buy some new clothing. Dose this make it a bad game? No, not at all. I still recommend it. But don't expect all the fun and hours of enjoyment you would get from the older games. Still for any old time fans of the GTA series it's still a good buy. Just don't expect it to be like GTA 5 or SA. Those are the best in the series in my oppenion.			"

												--- The Lost and Damned ---I'd heard that TLAD was mediocre and paled in comparison to the base game and The Ballad of Gay Tony, but I actually liked it a lot more than the base game.+ Johnny handles motorcycles way better than Niko handles cars+ There aren't any really bad bikes (while most of the cars are terrible)+ You can get bikes for free and guns at a discount whenever you want by calling your gang members+ At the end of an early mission, + You don't get called to go do things with your friends all the time+ This game introduces the sawn-off shotgun, which is the most hilariously overpowered gun to use on a motorcycle+ Also introduces a few more guns that are more interesting than anything in GTA IV: An automatic pistol, a street sweeper shotgun and a grenade launcher+ I enjoy playing as bikers in games and Johnny has a sweet jacket/ The story is still generally joyless/ The story is short, but there are a lot of side jobs, gang wars and races to do as well/ Johnny flipping his ♥♥♥♥ in combat for little reason can be alternately hilarious and annoying. ""F*** YOU! F*** YOU! F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU F*** YOU!"" (this is all one line)- Only 2 safehouses, both very close together, and you can only use one or the other for most of the plot- Johnny runs slower than Niko and Luis if he's holding a weapon- The bike handling is still iffy, and the 4-wheeled vehicle handling is iffy at best- The death metal station has like 8 songs on it so if you listen to it a lot it will repeat all the time- No character customizationTLAD is still no San Andreas or Vice City but it's a pretty good game..

												Ive always loved this game, but I am giving this a negative review only because recently it has stopped working. It forces you to sign into the stupid Rockstar Social Club that NO ONE in the entire world gives a damn about and for some reason it wont let me sign it. I wouldnt care if it would let me play offline..but it wont. If you still have a PS3 or Xbox 360 buy it for that. I doubt theyll ever fix this, Rockstar's too busy NOT updating GTAV.			"

												Developers, take note. This is how you create DLC. Two episodes that span around 15 hours of gameplay (more if you're going to do everything). It feels like a whole new game. Yes, the city is still the same, but the stories aren't and the missions are quite diverse. One thing I really liked was the fact that all important characters are in a way part of the other characters' stories. The graphics and details are still awesome to this day (and the faces could still use some work). The missions from The Lost And Damned (and the story itself) aren't as much fun when compared to The Ballad Of Gay Tony. The missions in Gay Tony range from racing to stealing and basejumping. There's also a few helicopter missions. Flying a helicopter is a pain in the ♥♥♥ though, and it's one of the things I really hate. But that can be overlooked. This game is great ! Recommended ![Rating: 92/100]			"

												While I hated GTA4, Episodes was actually WAY better.The controls, driving, and some of the visuals are still crap, as well as the car limit and being infected with GFWL, but there were actually some improvements in a few areas.Both extra campaigns each added some new and improved weapons, which added to the fun factor.The Lost and Damned was focused around being a biker, and as a result made the game a lot more interesting. The choppers are some of the better handing vehicles in the game, and there was almost always at least one around, and so you never had to drive one of those 4 wheeled icy marshmellows commonly known as 'cars' in GTA4 unless you REALLY wanted to.In addition to having your trusty gang deliver a bike to you whenever you wanted, you could also call them for backup, either just for fun, or to help you out on a difficult mission. Successfully completing missions leveled your gang members up, actually making them even more useful.Lost was definitely the most enjoyable version of GTA4 for me. Probably because it felt a little more like Saints Row.The Ballad of Gay Tony wasn't quite as good as Lost, mostly because you were back to reliance on cars for most of your traveling and didn't have the option of backup whenever you wanted. But it DID have the explosive shotgun.And dancing. Don't ask me why the dancing was so fun. Maybe because the rest of the gameplay was so meh.Getting a dance-off going at the Hercules was probably the best part of the episode.Each episode was around 10 hours for mostly the story missions, but they felt a lot more fun overall. While you still got calls to hang out every so often, it wasn't nearly as bad as GTA4.There also weren't as many difficult missions as there were in GTA4, and there were much more plentiful checkpoints in the ones that were difficult.While Episodes still shares a lot of problems with GTA4, if you REALLY want to play a GTA4 game, I'd recommend just playing Episodes from Liberty City. There will be a few plot holes, but who's playing a GTA game for plot?			"

												It's GTA IV, but with more fluid game mechanics. What you probably want to hear is whether it's worth getting, whether it fills the gap until GTA 5 hits the shelves. So in a word, yes. In two words, sort of.The game engine is still the GTA IV engine, of course; don't expect any dramatic changes between GTA IV and Episodes From Liberty City (EFLC). The only discernible differences are better driving (motorbikes! yay!) and cover taking mechanics, as well as slightly better AI and new radio content. The graphics are still the same ones that taxed the hell outta all our PC's back when IV was released; this old engine seems to have been optimized quite a bit since then, even if the physics are still a bit buggy in large scale explosions or bridge traffic pileups (yup, they still periodically do that weird stacking thing on the bridge). The AI as mentioned before has better cover taking, especially when in a firefight with allies. But, when ♥♥♥♥ gets real, you'll quickly realise that the AI can't handle certain things. There were moments in my playthrough where i'd be in a firefight and just move myself behind a solid object that i could still fire over or around, and find myself then being able to systematically slaughter any bot that had the temerity to walk into my fireline. The soundtrack to the game is pretty decent. The LC Rock station with Iggy Pop in particular was to my mind the best thing about the Radio stations. There's a fair few gems in the limited new content the radio stations get, but after a while you'll probably find yourself adding your own music just to keep things fresh.The storyline is alright; it fills in gaps between key events in Niko Bellic's story. In terms of the quality of the storytelling it's more or less your usual GTA fare. Lots of violence, swearing, racism, homophobia and misogyny coupled with explosions, gun fights and chase sequences. EFLC is just as cheesy, offensive and satirical as GTA has ever been, so if that's your bag you're in for a fun, nostalgic ride through that familiar virtual cesspit that is Liberty City.To summarise, there's nothing really *new* here, and whilst it's certainly a lot of fun revisiting LC through the eyes of two very different characters, after the 30 or so hours of gameplay it takes to rinse through it all, you can't help but feel like it was fun, but you've done it all before. You'll almost certainly find yourself very quickly forgetting the characters and their stories, but at least you'll have enjoyed the process.Overall: 3.5/5 Audio: 3/5Graphics: 3/5Gameplay: 4/5Nothing groundbreaking, revisits a lot of old ground, but it's still an exciting sojourn through a living, breathing city.

												I most enjoyed this title even though it was on the same map as GTA4 it had so much to offer!!PROS:✔ Sick story telling with huge amounts of humor. Man I will never get bored of some of the hilarious moments during dialogues and cinematics while doing quests.✔ They kept the radio stations interesting. Indeed they did! Loved the talkshows. Loved the commercials. Loved that they kept the independence radio station system. And totally loved the hilariousness included in each dialogue, comment or ad in them as should be in a predecessor of the GTA cult!✔ Interesting script. Especially loved the The Ballad of Gay Tony. I first played the tBoGT and afterwards I played tLaD campaign. I enjoyed it. And I totally loved how nicely they both blend in the exact same world in the exact same timing.✔ Loved the little crossovers here and there with Niko from GTA4.✔ Absolutely awesome quality and quantity of weapons!✔ Insane attention to details by the devs. From the graphical effects of dust and dirt on surfaces down to pedestrian AIs and material and texture design. The city looks live and real. Hell, even the music and sound effects are more realistic! Even braking the glass of a car's window affects the music volume from the car radio!!✔ Awesome voice acting as expected from a GTA game.✔ Awesome water and sea dynamics. It felt so natural and relaxing driving a boat, even if it was a really slow one.CONS:✖ Terrible follower AI. Their combat tactics and driving skills were a complete disaster. They kept getting in the way many times during battles. They drive like freakin psychopaths on crack even if you drive like a 70yo lady.✖ I was expecting a way better lip sync.✖ Inexcusable rendering mistakes from various city locations. Invisible walls or flooring and pavement textures. They are not many. But they shouldn't really exist. I mean they did put down so much detail in so many other things and some of the graphical bugs are so hard to miss it makes you think they were too bored to care fixing them.✖ WHY THE HELL DO YOU FORCE US TO PUT UP WITH THAT PIECE OF SH*T GAMES FOR WINDOWS LIVE INTERFACE? F*cking Hell it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off all the time!! App runs like a freakin faulty spyware! Can't get rid of it, eating up space and bandwidth. Kept disconnecting all the freakin time and totally bugged out 90% of my checkpoint auto-save games (it actually kept informing me that I already had the checkpoint savegames from quests I was doing for the first time!). WTH dudes?!? Is't the Rockstar Games Social Club app enough for middleware launch and you also had to add the buggy as f*ck Games For Windows Live interface too? WHY?Heard that GTA5 won't be having it.... Thank God!MIXED:☢ Some face expressions needed a bit work done. They made a great effort bringing realism in all characters plain NPC citizents included. But then you get to see some hideous face expressions from women when dancing with them at the club. Or seeing yoru character having the same angry face expression through the game even if all the action is hours (ingame) past the moment.☢ I really wish we could dive underwater...☢ I needed more collectibles.FINAL VERDICT:I enjoyed the game a whole lot, so much that I was able to put aside all the negatives or mixed feelings during gameplay that I would totally recommend this game.I'm giving it a 8/10. For me personally it could had been higher if it wasn't for the irritating Games For Windows Live interface.it's a good enjoyable game worth spending time on. If your PC can handle it and haven't played it yet please do.Totally worth buying on special offers.			"

												GTA: EFLC is more of a game pack that consists of 2 games, GTA: The Lost and Damned, and GTA: The Ballad of Gay Tony.GTA: TLADYou play as a biker called Johnny, and the game has many interesting activities/missions, activities like Arm Wrestling, Pool (I think), Darts and more. The multiplayer has some gamemodes that might be more interesting than Free Roam (will talk more about it on TBOGT), yet I haven't played them because the multiplayer is dead pretty much.GTA:TBOGTYou play as Luis Lopez, a guy who works for a man named Tony (Nickname: Gay Tony). The game is generally better in terms of visuals and more fun things to do. In terms of visuals, TBOGT did a good job of removing the annoying color thing that makes the game more grey like in GTA IV. TBOGT has activities, just like TLAD, but there's one that isn't seen in other GTA games (I think). Cage fighting. It's basically you fighting against some people, or you can spectate and bet your money on who you think is gonna win. When you fight, each round you fight against 3 different people, there's 5-6 rounds in total. And now the Multiplayer. It's a pretty fun experience, Free Roam and the other gamemodes maybe too. I like Free Roam, because it lets you do atleast one activity that you can't do in other GTA IV games (normal IV and TLAD), that's parachuting. It's fun if you find a way to do stuff like:Actual parachutingDying in the best way possibleStart the sky diving thing, fall and have a low chance of living (from the top of a building), it also has uses for free running, too. Free running is pretty fun if you find the places to do so. They are commonly found near parachuting locations, or other buildings in the game (Lots of them are enterable, and I think most of them can give access to a rooftop). Now, you might be wondering, how can sky diving possibly help? Here's the answer. Without a parachute on, you couldn't really jump far. While with one on, you could start the sky diving which lets you travel further distances, for example that one stair case that's in the opposite building.

												TLAD: Really good with great radio stations, fun story, minigames, soundtrack, cool characters and basically everything. (THis is the reason I've reccomended EFLC it cause it's so awsome.TBOGT: ♥♥♥♥ THIS PIECE OF CR*AP. I JUST USED THIS TO EXPERIMENT WITH MODDING SO IF I BROKE IT I WOULDN'T GIVE A ♥♥♥♥ CAUSE IT'S $HITE.Note: It's annoying what they've done with this game, they knew TLAD wouldn'te do too well on it's own cause, well let's face it- most people are pop and rap aka. shi*te loving wan*ker chavs so they had to go to the very opposite end of the spectram and do TBOGT so it'd sell.

												Where should I even start?Graphics:If you enjoy only playing at 800x600 with everything set on low, this is for you.  I cannot for the life of me change the resolution in the graphics settingControls:If I move my mouse too slow in the main menu, it just simply doesn't register.  Also, trying to play the very first mission in Lost and Damned (you know, driving the bike to the church), when I would try to make a turn, the bike would spin out.  Over and over.  I've play GTA IV and it doesn't do this.Features:First you have the Steam overlay.  Which is fine.  Then you have GFWL.  OK.  Then you have the Rockstar social club.  Seriously?  Why do I need 3 different ""features"" with GFWL the most annoying.  I don't know about anyone else but I was able to login, even after GFWL was supposed to disapear.I thought GTA IV was bad.  This is seriously the worse.  Why am I not able to adjust anything in the graphics settings?  What's up with the mouse movements in menu?  Why do I have to look into 3rd parties to figure out how to fix this game?  WHY?  This makes me question if I should even buy GTA V PC on release date.  I don't want to end up buying a broken game like this hunk of crap.			"

												This game should absolutely not be for sale in it's current state. Here is a list of steps that I had to take to run the game once. (Since quitting that one session I have been unable to load the game a second time.) Once installed, clicking 'play' did nothing. No GTA, no error messages either. Upon consulting Google, I downloaded and installed Games for Windows Live. (Hasn't this been discontinued? Why is this even still available?) After installing and attempting to launch the game, I was presented with an error message. Progress! Error 'Seculauncher failed to start application [2000].' After more Googling, running the .exe as an administrator solved this problem. I'm finally in the game! Oh, the resolution is stuck at 800x600. I'll just change that. I can't. Great. After more Googling, I have to create a text file (commandline.txt) in the game directory and add the following parameters: '-nomemrestrict -norestrictions'. Apparently this is because I have TOO MUCH video memory on my laptop. I can't add these as launch parameters within Steam because I'm having to launch the game as an administrator from the game directory each time. Holy crap, I managed to change the resolution! And I'm in the game! Awesome! Time for a break. I'll just close this game and reopen it later. Okay, I'm back. GTA, here I come! Oh, now the loading screen just loops infinitely. Wonderful. Back to Google. Apparently this problem is also related to having too much video memory. Except the launch parameters I added should have already solved it. I give up.Stay away from this. It's a wreck. "

I have tried downloading patches, messing around with the game files, and other solutions but nothing has worked. At least I got GTA 4 to work at 10 FPS but this, I have no idea why it won't even try to load the game.			"

												Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV. Created by Rockstar North in the United Kingdom, it contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc.[1] It was released alongside the DLC release of The Ballad of Gay Tony on 29 October, 2009 for the Xbox 360 and released on 13 April, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3.Unlike the downloadable versions of the episodes, the compilation does not require a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV to play, nor is an Xbox Live or PlayStation Network account necessary (except for multiplayer). The content is also played straight from the disc, and does not need to be installed on a hard drive to play, like various other disc-based expansions for other Xbox 360 games that have been released in the past. Available exclusively on the Episodes from Liberty City disc are three new in-game radio stations – Vice City FM, RamJam FM and Self-Actualization FM.			"

												Word of Caution: You have to tweak with a file or 2 to get the game to run well. Besides that, currently on this day Dec 2 2016, they updated the game a few days ago which helped with the social club login. You can now play multiplayer again by linking your xbox account to your social club by using the games for windows live. You can play single player and multiplayer now! Only caveat is not many people play multiplayer that much anymore because of the problems in the past that lasted years. If you have a few friends with this game I think it is safe to say you can jump right back on this game with some buddies and have some good old fun.			"

												I can't recommend this game for the same reasons I can't recommend GTA IV.  Here's a link to that one if you're interested.  I'm in no way endorsing or encouraging piracy, and I think everyone should support worthwhile developers by purchasing their games and products. That's just a disclaimer because what I'm about to say may actually get me banned. Pirates literally have an easier time playing these games (and other select titles from Rockstar) due to GFWL's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DRM. If you have a Live account and want to be able to play your saved games WHENEVER YOU WANT, just like you would be able to with the console versions of this game, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck. You'll have to make an offline profile to do that, which means you won't be able to play with your friends or show off your achievements to them, but I guess you can't have everything with Rockstar. If you were expecting save files to work the way they should, that is, saved locally and available to you WHENEVER, AT ANY TIME, EVEN WHEN YOU'RE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET, you should look elsewhere, because you won't find any of that common sense here. When your game, through sheer always-online DRM ♥♥♥♥ery, makes it easier for pirates to play the game than PAYING ♥♥♥♥ING CUSTOMERS WHO DOLED OUT THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY EXPECTING A PRODUCT THAT JUST ♥♥♥♥ING WORKS THE WAY IT SHOULD IN RETURN, you have FAILED. Failed MISERABLY, in fact. And that save file ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to GFWL's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It isn't just Rockstar games, either. Any game that uses GFWL is full of issues that are usually directly caused by it. A good general rule of thumb is to just avoid any game that has, or has ever had, GFWL integrated into it. You'll be setting yourself up for failure and disappointment, not necessarily in that order.			"

												Famous Night Club manager and ♥♥♥♥ fiddler Carlton Banks had it all. Money. Power. ♥♥♥♥ Fiddles. But when former bum-buddy Will Smith returns to the scene to settle some old scores, Carlton must find it with himself to stand up for what's right, and ruthlessly slaughter as many pedestrians as he can in hilarious automobile accidents. Along the way he will make sarcastic remarks as zany, over-the-top and downright racist depictions of characters do stereotypical things until you can no longer bleed them dry of money. You will experience utter bliss as you use virgin-tight  shooting controls to kill the same korean character model over and over and over. You can also experience Ground Zero for the first major gainaxing of a hairy erect ♥♥♥♥ in a video game.Oh and theres also a Sons of Anarchy mode but thats for limpdicked middle-aged men from Connecticut with daddy issues and sociopathic tendencies.

												I seriously can't believe I'm doing this, I'm giving a bad rate to a Grand Theft Auto game... I love the serie, I really do, but this PC version is just terrible! The game is a masterpiece, I've played it a million times on my Xbox 360, but this PC version is a just one of the worst ports I ever seen...The issue with this game is basically just one: Performance.The performance of this game is atrocious, the optimization is really bad. I have a medium-end PC that, according with the system requirements, would run it almost on the maximum performance. Guess what? I had to put the lowest game options on everything, no shadows, no anti-aliasing, minimum distance-view, no V-sync, and still only achieved 10 fps, lot of crashes, etc...Basically, this game is only playable in highest end PCs, and even on those the performance isn't really good.Until this game is properly optimized (which is never), I can't recomend this to anyone. Its really a shame, it's an imensely good game, but unplayble... Consider buying the consoles version.			"

												Rockstar Games made a great job on this game for Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3,but on PC I simply cannot get through the start up where I enter my social club account,I enter and it crashes.Rockstar I think gave up on this game the second GTA V came out and said, :F :U :C :K it to this game and just left it,multiple complaints and not a response let alone an update from them.I bought GTA IV the complete pack with Niko,Johnny and Luis stories and not working one bit,R* you need to come back and fix it,when you make something you have to let alone fix it so your fans don't think you broke it for a reason,Sure GTA IV is out of commission when it comes to your games but you still need to fix it for your fans and players of the games and make sure its 100% runable.Now if you have a home console (Xbox 360/Playstation 3) I would prefer you buy it from their and not waste your hard earned money on the PC,cause if you do make sure it works.The story is good overall,but i recommend you buy GTA IV before these games so it makes sence a little if your new.This is my first down for rockstar and I will try to get my money that i spent back.

												GRAND THEFT AUTO: EPISODES FROM LIBERTY CITYThe Lost and DamnedSupplement about Jewish biker johnny. went out earlier, so with him and begin. Our main hero — the Vice-President office of the brotherhood of the Lost in liberty city. He calmly and judiciously conducts business of the organization, one does not give offense to and all that. A real goodie, although in the course of action a will release caustic jokes about its origin. Anyway, while the President of the section — Billy gray — rehabilitated from heroin addiction, johnny earned a reputation and proved himself a good leader. And then one happy day the leader returned from work and immediately began imposing a new order.Apparently, during treatment, and much Billy thought hard about the softness of the seat under your own ♥♥♥, so his first action on the outside was the war with another gang called Angels of Death. Moreover, the reasons for this newly issued Chapter has chosen not the most successful — lies, deception, incitement and slander. For example, the daughter of Mikhail Faustin contacted the biker of the Lost — we killed it in the role of Niko. This situation without a trial Billy gray dumped for a rival group and with hoots led the brothers to destroy their headquarters. Actually the reason for the attack was heroin, which the President later again and tied. Johnny stands at the head of the gang... and it's time to figure out what you can do in liberty city, when fighting on the shoulders of the leather jacket, in the hand of the evil gun, and at his back a powerful rumbling chopper.The Ballad of Gay Tony""Ballad"" should be taken only after The Lost and Damned. Otherwise you will be disappointed: additions are so different in execution, I can't believe the story of a biker at least some relation to the glitz and glamour of night life. This, of course, not about the appearance of the main characters.Despite the name, we will not be in the role of Tony (it would probably have caused a rejection from the audience), and in the skin of his best friend, companion and just a great man Luis Lopez. He's a regular guy, without protruding ambitions and, frankly, not particularly clever. But sincere and honest, calm and considerate, sensitive and loyal friend, but if you really ♥♥♥♥ him off...

												Great game indeed, love the story, gameplay, graphics (at the time of release).But really... Create Rockstar Account, create Games for Windows Live Account, enter serial, graphics stuck at 800xsomething in Windows 10...Gazillion hurdles to overcome to play - forget it. NOT RECOMMENDED.			"

												So i bought this game on Steam because i knew it was a fun game since i have it on my xbox 360, and knew I would evantually run into a few problems but thought solving them would be worth it. So the first problem was after i  downloaded the game for 5 hours i go to lauch it and it fails to lauch. So i download the latest version of windows live for windows 10 from the microsoft website and lauch the game, that took me an hour to do. Then after i launch the game and start it up the  quality of the graphics was horrendus so i open up the menu and go to set the game to run at a higher resolution and guess what i cant... So i looked up a video and typed in some commands and was able to change the resolution. Then i get back on the game with no problem. Then i wanted to play online and i try to and it tells me I have to log into Social Club, so i quit the game and went to log into Social Club and i type in the CORRECT PASSWORD AND USERNAME THAT I HAD JUST RESTET  and try to click play but no there was the next problem it says ""Social Club login failed , please try again"" so i gave up, i have NEVER had such a bad experince with a steam game.

I Installed that POS, but I STILL couldn't play it because of some random error.SOMEHOW, I got it working by gonig through its files... started the campaign... the game asks me to create a GFWL account (even an offline one), in order to same my progress. I sigh, but, wanting to play, I press ""Yes"", in order to create one... AND IT CRASHES, EVERY TIME I DO IT.Everyone says PC gaming is sooo great, because you can play all past games, without issue. That is a load of bull****. Guess what? The pirated version works like a charm :)			"

												[**Contains pr*fanity, if you are sensitive to words and can see through asterisks, this review may not be for you**]I'm sure the game is great (I liked GTA IV a lot on 360 but never got around to playing the expansions).That being said, f*ck Games for WIndows Live. First, I can't run the game without crashing, then I finally get GFWL working (the step I missed when giving up on Dark Souls months ago (which I still haven't played) was apparently restarting my computer after installing the correct version of GFWL which had to be obtained manually online (why microsoft made an operating system that doesn't work properly out of the box with the stupid stupid GFWL thing that they created (and should be ashamed of) is beyond me).So, some number of days ago I got the stupid GFWL thing working so that I could play the game, what's this I see immediately? 'Sign in to some special ""Rockstar social club"" thing to play online'... um... ok... sure, I mean I didn't have to do any of this stupid pointless stuff when I played on console... but sure...So I make the account and think, well at least it's not like that stupid thing in Dark Souls (which I ran once to see if it worked) where I had to create a windows live profile to even save the game (foreshadowing... creepy).So I start up the expansion and, about 10 seconds in, realize that the keyboard controls are unplayable, at least from what I'm used to, I honestly don't know how anyone could play this with a keyboard, but whatever, I've needed a better controller for a while now so I ordered a 360 knockoff from ebay and forgot about GTA for a while.So the controller comes in and I get around to playing GTA, first, somewhat of an aside, I go to the graphics section and see a benchmark. Oh neat! I think to myself, I can run a benchmark and see if I want to try and push any of the recomended settings a bit higher, good deal. The benchmark runs to completion and then...PC : EFLC.exe has stopped working. Me: Oh well, it was a nice thought while it lasted.Anyway, I forget the benchmark and start the game, seems pretty good so far, kind of a long winded intro and they introduce a follow the leader mechanic which looks like it's going to be kind of annoying, oh look a safehouse... that's cool, look at all of the things I can do, I'll have to check that out...Game: Autosave feature has failed, you need to sign in to a LIVE-enabled account to saveMe: Of course, I knew expecting there to only be one account that I need to play this game was too much to ask for... nevermind the fact that I never needed to sign in to live when playing on the console, and nevermind that I'm just trying to SAVE MY GAME IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME MODE WITHOUT SIGNING INTO AN ONLINE SERVICE. Whatever, you win this round M$.Naturally I can't be bothered to remember what e-mails I've used for various Live accounts in the past (i've had several) so I decide to make a new one from scratch.Wait, let me back up. You see, before I can get a Live account, I first need a Microsoft account for it to make the Live account from. OK, I'll bite:Name: 	First: F*kYouAsswh*lesIJustWantToF*kingPlayGTA	Last: ThisIsSoF*kingStupidF*kEveryOneOfYou[Note: asterisks added for this public review, the misspellings are because, apparently, if you're name contains profanity it can't be used for a M$ account, even though it's a required field.]Username: f*ckGamesForWindowsLiveWith@BigRusty.Pole[again the asterisk is mine, the correct spelling of the word this time is also not a typo]Password: *****[I guess I'll keep this one to myself for posterity, but, fun fact, originally it contained the word f**k, which was also set as the first name at the time (my form went through many revisions), the first error on trying to submit a form I saw was 'password cannot contain your name... hmm...

'♥♥♥♥♥♥' is a bad word?] them off, I'm not entirely sure how or what they were going to use for my username, but I ended up with the account ID/name: TendedFever6 which I guess is cute, but I digress.So I go back to GTA, and I enter in the oh-so-wonderful e-mail address and type in my password and enter in the key that Steam gave me (that it finally decided to ask for) and blah blah blah and what's this, did it work? am I done?Live: LIVE needs an update!Me: God, of course, whatever, just shut up and do it, I don't care, just have your way with me if you must, just please, don't hurt me again.Live: Live is updating, this may require restarting your computer.Me: You better not restart my f*cking computer you piece of sh*tLive: Do do do, I am updating, do do doMe: I swear to god, if you restart my f*cking computer...Live: Guess what! you need to restart this game for the update thingy to work, so do that because we hate you.Me: You realize I haven't saved? The game took me like 15 min in until it showed the first safehouse before prompting the autosave (or showing a bed) and I can't save now because you won't let me until I sign in, and immediately after you let me sign in you told me that there was an update that I needed or I would be signed out, and then I said OK update and so you updated and need to close my game, which I haven't saved.So I resign myself to go back to the game, turn off the autosave feature because I'm soft-locked with it enabled, make one last attempt to find some way to manually save even though I know it's futile, and then I close the game.Then Microsoft does it's stupid update on it's stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of software that's just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ after the update as it was beforehand.And then I launch the game. And then I sign into my profile, and then I'm logged in and it seems to work. I start up the expansion, it starts to load... and then I press Alt+F4 because I'm not in the mood to replay the 10-15 minutes that I lost, because I'm not in the mood to look at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GFWL game right now, and I feel dirty after what I've just had to do to be able to save a single player campaign.GTA is a great franchise, GFWL is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. Unfortunately they used that piece of ♥♥♥♥ to port this game, so ♥♥♥♥ it and ♥♥♥♥ Microsoft for making it the most appealing option.If you run Windows 8 (I'm not proud, the PC came with it, but that's another rant) be ready for a potential headache if you haven't already figured out the whole 'getting games like Dark Souls and GTA IV to run because GFWL likes to error and fail by default'. Also, if you're like me and don't want to create yet another mostly-legitimate account for something you don't have any plan to use for much anything else at any time in the near future (but who doesn't have an XBox, right? maybe people who had the system die on them and didn't bother to get a replacement because there's other consoles out there that don't have a stupid high RROD fail rate? nah, that's crazy talk).Again, I hear the expansions are great, but get 'em on PS3 or something, this is the type of thing that should just not be encouraged.Anyway, I had a fun waste of an evening and decided to waste even more time making this wonderful rant of a post. To anyone who made it this far, congrats and have a nice day.Edit: Formatting.			"

It was a bit too short in my opinion though. 7.5/10TBoGT: I wish that either Tony or Louis came to Los Santos in GTA V. The story was great and enjoyable to play. I think that Bulgarin's character development was lacking components. Other than that, it was enjoyable as hell. 8.5/10ALSO, the diamonds in all three parts of GTA IV still needs some explaining to do...			"

I installed this trash again after some time,and I was like bored and wanted to finish gay Tony part wich I played a little bit. First of all I can't login to social club... Ok,I made new social club account. Then I run damn game,oh,now I have to login to Live account. Well it worked before... I try to login with my Hotmail account,and it says that my password is wrong... How the hell can my password be wrong on account that I login to almost every day?! I just unistalled game and was so frustrated that I punched my screen... I will most definitely never again try to play some stupid Rock Star game again. Beside tons of bugs and other stuff,Niko and Lost have interesting story,but thats all that is good with this game.			"

												TLAD: Makes me realize why Kibbutz was killed in GTA V. He was a prick to begin with. Other than that, you understand what the hell went down in the Lost chapter in Alderney. It was a bit too short in my opinion though. 7.5/10TBoGT: I wish that either Tony or Louis came to Los Santos in GTA V. The story was great and enjoyable to play. I think that Bulgarin's character development was lacking components. Other than that, it was enjoyable as hell. 8.5/10ALSO, the diamonds in all three parts of GTA IV still needs some explaining to do...			"

												[**Contains pr*fanity, if you are sensitive to words and can see through asterisks, this review may not be for you**]I'm sure the game is great (I liked GTA IV a lot on 360 but never got around to playing the expansions).That being said, f*ck Games for WIndows Live. First, I can't run the game without crashing, then I finally get GFWL working (the step I missed when giving up on Dark Souls months ago (which I still haven't played) was apparently restarting my computer after installing the correct version of GFWL which had to be obtained manually online (why microsoft made an operating system that doesn't work properly out of the box with the stupid stupid GFWL thing that they created (and should be ashamed of) is beyond me).So, some number of days ago I got the stupid GFWL thing working so that I could play the game, what's this I see immediately? 'Sign in to some special ""Rockstar social club"" thing to play online'... um... ok... sure, I mean I didn't have to do any of this stupid pointless stuff when I played on console... but sure...So I make the account and think, well at least it's not like that stupid thing in Dark Souls (which I ran once to see if it worked) where I had to create a windows live profile to even save the game (foreshadowing... creepy).So I start up the expansion and, about 10 seconds in, realize that the keyboard controls are unplayable, at least from what I'm used to, I honestly don't know how anyone could play this with a keyboard, but whatever, I've needed a better controller for a while now so I ordered a 360 knockoff from ebay and forgot about GTA for a while.So the controller comes in and I get around to playing GTA, first, somewhat of an aside, I go to the graphics section and see a benchmark. Oh neat! I think to myself, I can run a benchmark and see if I want to try and push any of the recomended settings a bit higher, good deal. The benchmark runs to completion and then...PC : EFLC.exe has stopped working. Me: Oh well, it was a nice thought while it lasted.Anyway, I forget the benchmark and start the game, seems pretty good so far, kind of a long winded intro and they introduce a follow the leader mechanic which looks like it's going to be kind of annoying, oh look a safehouse... that's cool, look at all of the things I can do, I'll have to check that out...Game: Autosave feature has failed, you need to sign in to a LIVE-enabled account to saveMe: Of course, I knew expecting there to only be one account that I need to play this game was too much to ask for... nevermind the fact that I never needed to sign in to live when playing on the console, and nevermind that I'm just trying to SAVE MY GAME IN A SINGLE PLAYER GAME MODE WITHOUT SIGNING INTO AN ONLINE SERVICE. Whatever, you win this round M$.Naturally I can't be bothered to remember what e-mails I've used for various Live accounts in the past (i've had several) so I decide to make a new one from scratch.Wait, let me back up.

Also, if you're like me and don't want to create yet another mostly-legitimate account for something you don't have any plan to use for much anything else at any time in the near future (but who doesn't have an XBox, right? maybe people who had the system die on them and didn't bother to get a replacement because there's other consoles out there that don't have a stupid high RROD fail rate? nah, that's crazy talk).Again, I hear the expansions are great, but get 'em on PS3 or something, this is the type of thing that should just not be encouraged.Anyway, I had a fun waste of an evening and decided to waste even more time making this wonderful rant of a post.

												Great game compared to what people say. Even though it was a step back from GTA San Andreas on some points, like the removal of planes, it took GTA to the next era by adding Online modes like freemode (Which was a lot of fun back in the day) and improving the graphics. It improved on GTA IV by adding 2 new characters with their only seperate and unique stories and added new features like parachutes (Which for whatever reason are only in The Ballad of Gay Tony and not in The Lost and Damned which is a bit strange) and new vechicles and strangely enough the vechicles that appear in each story, don't appear in the other one which doesn't really make sense. Both stories and characters are unique and completely different from eachother.  Would recommend for fans of GTA. It is a game worth getting.			"

												Did you know, Sleeping Dogs still runs on a windows 10 PC without any problem.So does Saint's Row 3 & 4.Both games are better than anything Rockstar gave us after San Andreas.Not in size, detail and production value. No, who could beat RS on that subject?But they tell better stories and provide interesting and in case of SR 4 genius spins on thegameplay formular.Coolest sandbox, still the newest GTA your machine can handle or still can handle -whatever, is GTA.I did recommend the game WHEN it worked (which might be a cr****d version) but today at least tripple check if your computer is in the unlikely spot where it could run GTA IV & DLCS			"

												This addition to the GTA series is a welcome installment and a prime example of excellence in the field of storytelling and innovation. I may even venture to say that I enjoyed this more than GTA V's campaign, and that's saying something. Go ahead and pick this up if you haven't already. If you're up for it, the modding community on this title is very active and welcoming to newcomers. It can breathe life into the title after completion.			"

												Requires xBox or Social Club account and constant internet connection.  Have both xBox live and Rockstar accounts - none of them worked with Liberty City but worked with other games.  Created another xBox live account to play.I am fed up with this required internet connectivity and DRM's.As for the game - if your bike is ruined during combat - loose mission.If your homy's bike is ruined during combat - loose mission.I found it somewhat unorthodox to arrive at the mission point, and then spend time to repark my stupid homies' bikes, while running in line of fire, trying not to die.Very finese piece this one is.FAIL.

												A great add on to GTA IV. This is how DLC should be done (even though it is technically not dlc since you don't need the base game to play it). It's like a brand new game. A ♥♥♥♥ton of more wepons and addons that GTA IV should of came with. Parachutes, AA12's (with explosive ammo), gernade launcher, sticky bombs, new cars and so much more. The story of both TLAD and TBOGT are both good and actually have effort put into them. Personally, I think TBOGT has a better and more intresting storyline but they're both great. This would be the ultimate bargain if Rockstar would of not of ditched GTA IV and EFLC once GTA V came out since this game(s) still have the cancerous tumor which is GFWL attached on it like a blood sucking leech. Also, the multiplayer is a lost cause at this point. Since Rockstar completely abandoned GTA IV multiplayer, it is a broken mess and if you do get it working after configuring the game's files, close to nobody is even on multiplayer. (atleast in my experience)Overall, I would recommend EFLC in a heart beat. ♥♥♥♥, If this game was price at $60 i'd still buy it just for BOGT since it's such an amazing improvement over GTA IV.

												It's fun to see the stories from GTA 4 and Episodes crossing like this. Up till now I've finished Ballad of Gay Tony and one thing I have to say is that it fixes some issues I had with the base GTA 4 - namely, when restarting the missions, they start from the point in time when the mission really begins, leaving out driving to the place, etc. Also, there are checkpoints in longer missions. Because of that I didn't notice what seemed like a bug in the main game - that even though the mission is restarted, you don't get back ammo and armour. It's shorter, of course, and funny, which is also a nice change after the main story.			"

												           It's Grand Theft Auto, so yes it's fun. But in order to save your game at all you need a Windows LIve account.I made one a while back to play Dead Rising 2 on steam, and I can't sign in to play this and it's really fustrating to make an account for Windows Live. I don't like restarting the game every time I exit. I also wouldn't recommend the Episodes from Liberty City, I would suggest the original game. These are just short stories basically, In one episode your a bike gang, in the other your a clubber who is in the gang again. But since it's Grand Theft Auto it has free play, so thats fun right off the bat. There is multiplayer but like I said in the beginning you need a Windows Live account, I would rate this game 4/10.

												           It's Grand Theft Auto, so yes it's fun. But in order to save your game at all you need a Windows LIve account.I made one a while back to play Dead Rising 2 on steam, and I can't sign in to play this and it's really fustrating to make an account for Windows Live. I don't like restarting the game every time I exit. I also wouldn't recommend the Episodes from Liberty City, I would suggest the original game. These are just short stories basically, In one episode your a bike gang, in the other your a clubber who is in the gang again. But since it's Grand Theft Auto it has free play, so thats fun right off the bat. There is multiplayer but like I said in the beginning you need a Windows Live account, I would rate this game 4/10.
