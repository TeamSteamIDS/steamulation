												F.E.A.R 3 is the last game in the F.E.A.R  series thus far, releasing in mid 2011 on PC, Xbox360 and PS3 being developed by Day 1 Studios, the same guys which developed the first F.E.A.R on PS3 and Xbox360. The bulk of the gameplay is the same as the previous titles with a few minor changes.  The main one being a change to how the cover system work. In the previous games you used to be able to tilt your character’s head around corners in order to shoot, F.E.A.R 3 adds a peeking system, where you can hug up against any sort of cover and drop your headup and down whilst also moving side to side in order to shoot from cover. This for me felt a lot easier to handle than the previous version and is a really nice change.  The rest of the game play is very much the same, I was a little bit let down by the gun mechanics however, I praised the first game heavily due to how the gun play feels so fluid and responsive, sadly in 3 I had a lot of trouble aiming whilst looking down the sight and spent the majority of the time shooting from the hip. This was mainly because the hit detection on the bullets is quite a bit off, you can sometimes get a direct hit on an enemies head and nothing happens.  There is only one new weapon to be introduced in the game too, a freezing gun which you obtain by overcoming one of the many fights with the same boss throughout the single player campaign mode. Graphically, F.E.A.R 3 looks OK. It is 4 years old at this point and you can tell it is part of the last generation of gaming, but it still holds it’s own compared to games released around that time. The texture quality is just bog standard OK again, where the F.E.A.R series does well, is the animation of the characters, they all have a very good ragdoll effect to them, meaning death animations are all on point and can result in some unique positions. F.E.A.R 3 isn’t hard when playing on the medium settings; FPS vetrans need to bump it up to hard mode for it to be even slightly challenging; I don’t think I died more than two times throughout the whole game which is something to be said given the amount of bosses you have to fight.  Some levels are actually made significantly easier since they give you a mech suit to use which whilst it is absolutely satisfying to blow up enemies at point blank range with missiles, it does make the level seem somewhat pointless as there is no challenge and just feels more like a time block than anything else. Unlike the previous games; the levels in F.E.A.R 3 are very linear and leave very little for the player to explore and find secrets/collectables. There is one collectable on each level which is randomly placed every time you play, but there isn’t extra bits of lore/plot to be found from hacking computers, or finding documents;  something which I did miss as the story in this game is actually somewhat interesting compared to the last games. A single play through this game took me just under four hours; where you will get the majority of your replay ability from F.E.A.R 3 is the co-op mode and challenge system. This is the first F.E.A.R game to have any sort of co-op mode in and it does it very well. The multiplayer missions feel very much like Killing Floor, so if you enjoyed that, you will get some enjoyment out of the F.E.A.R 3 multiplayer too. I only had one technical issue whilst playing, and that was when playing with more than on screen, your mouse will sometimes exit the screen you are playing on and when you click to shoot, you’ll minimize to your desktop as it has roamed onto another screen – this became a real annoyance on the latter levels when you have very little time to react to things. I was unable to find a fix for this online so be warned! To sum up, F.E.A.R 3 is definitely not as good as the previous two games, but it does offer something a bit different. The price on Steam of £12,99 is a bit steep given the shortness of the single player, but you can pick up the entire F.E.A.R collection from Bundle Stars for a mere £3.26 - https://www.bundlestars.com/en/bundle/fear-bundle  meaning you can’t really go wrong with picking the title up there.  Going off that, I am only going to recommend F.E.A.R 3 when it is on sale.

												FEAR 3 represents what is wrong with many 'modernization' processes of games. It takes everything that people liked about the first few games in the series and just replaces or modifies them to work with current trends, such as in this case regenerating health, co-op, perks... However, I would also argue FEAR 3 is not a bad game. If you're looking for a game akin to FEAR 1 or 2, this unfortunately is not it. It also is pretty lacking in the horror department. It's not scary, or even really atmospheric, though it attempts to be. What it is though, is a pretty fun multiplayer experience.The story will probably ♥♥♥♥-off long-time fans. Without going too deep into spoilers, the story basically focuses mostly on Fettel, the antagonist from the first game. The story's already kind of in a mess from the get-go, as we have things from psychic powers, clones, the fact our two main characters are the sons of the series main antagonist Alma, and just other plot elements that just scream they're so bad. But it's not badly written to be fair, and if you kind of turn off your brain it's kind of stupid entertainment. But you really shouldn't be playing this game for the story.The campaign should last for about 5-7 hours, with some highs and lows, but that in no way compares to the previous two games. The co-op helps make it a bit more fun, for better or worse. The two brothers play completely differently though, with Pointman basically being your typical action hero with the guns and the slide-kicks, and Fettel being actually surprisingly rather fresh, being a psychic man who can levitate enemies, possess them, shoot energy blasts, and more. Honestly, both are pretty fun, but I have to hand it to Fettel as for a game with very little inspiration behind it, his gameplay is actually rather original for this sort of game and fun.But it's not the campaign you should be buying FEAR 3 for, as weird as that might sound. I find most people never delve into the multiplayer modes in this game. And it's sensible, as the campaign is disappointing and usually multiplayer modes are tagged on without much thought or effort, so it's probably nothing special, right?Well, that's wrong, as it turns out the multiplayer modes in this game are actually the best part of the game.I can't even count how many friends who got FEAR 3 that ended up loving the multiplayer modes and hating the campaign. Let me explain; The campaign lacks tension, and often is a bit repetitive, on-top of the fact it just feels rather uninspired most of the time, its horror elements fail, and its action sequences aren't particularly great. But something FEAR 3 does surprisingly well is understand the fun elements of multiplayer shooters. Hell, some of the multiplayer modes are even far more tense and more horror-like than anything in the campaign.Multiplayer is split into four modes, and all four are pretty fun for up to four-players either locally or online. Each mode has different maps. One mode has you all as ghost phantoms who possess bodies and try to kill other enemies and your friends to collect souls, most souls at the end of a wave wins the round, and at the end of all waves, person with the most rounds won wins. Another mode has you in an open arena with multiple areas to station yourself in as you and friends fight hordes of enemies that come in waves, boarding up windows and between waves going out to collect supplies. It's a sort of rip-off of Zombie mode from CoD, but it has some interesting twists, such as Alma, who you should not look at as she'll cause randomized effects against you, ranging from just downing you to making you see your friends as enemies, making the screen go black, or teleporting you to another random point on the map. Or a fog, that gets thicker and thicker as the waves go on, and an unseen red-light monster lurks in the deeper parts of the fog... And in yet another mode, you and up to three friends run away from a giant wall of death. Really challenging, frantic, tense, panic-worthy, but a lot of fun as a lot of enemies get tossed your way and you only get small breathers to quickly recollect supplies before the wall is out it again. A race from death and survival that is both primal but also strategic and fun.The game also looks pretty good, and the PC port is well-done. Music works, but nothing outside of the credits song sticks as being particularly memorable.FEAR 3 is against most everything the FEAR series stands for, but if you can look over that and a disappointing campaign, I guarantee you there's some multiplayer fun here that may be worth experiencing.

												I have to agree with some of the other reviews I've read here since playing the game. The FEAR series started off as a game that was truly it's own genre; paranormal FPS. It stood proudly amongst it's predecessors like DOOM and Castle Wolfenstien.  The scare element was in the fact that you had all the firepower in the world, but it amounted to nothing to what was truly terrfying; a psychic ghost that is Alma, who seems hellbent on either scaring you to death, or burning you, whichever comes first. The first game really playing into lighting, textures and sound; right at the cusp of when the gaming world was really experimenting and playing with those elements. The enviroment was great, the gameplay was pretty smooth for its time. The combat was fun (slow-mo done right), the story was intriguing with just the right touch of spooky mystery, and the scare moments were downright terrifying. Had more than a few moments where I had to save and quit simply because my overly beating heart couldn't take anymore. Overall a very solid horror game that was quite a few years ahead of it's time. 9/10FEAR 2 brought in more of a balance between the combat and the scare moments. The combat was much much smoother compared to FEAR, and the graphics were amazing compared to other games of it's time. You still played a silent protaginist, which was odd considering that you don't officially play as Pointman, but overall the story was very tight and the scare moments were still pretty scary and fairly unpredictable. Overall an improvement in some subtle ways, but there were a few moments where it seemed a little TOO combat heavy. A for effort though, and I have to say I enjoyed playing it across the board. 7/10And then FEAR 3...changed developers, which can be either really good or really bad for a game mid/end series, and right during the COD craze being at it's peak. And by God did it show. Restricted to 2 weapons, majority of the weapons vanilla and mediocre. Over half the special weapons gone, and the really fun ones (Nail gun and laser gun I'm looking at you two) were only given sparcely during the end and really had next to no screen time. The scare moments were also next to non-existent, despite a few gems of those moments being hidden here and there, and the combat was so heavy and pointless it felt like I was playing more of a crappy, cheap horror rendition of a Call of Duty game than a horror FPS. And since a lot of the expansions from the first two games was rendered non-canon, the story had a ton of plot holes and the ending was just crap with it being so open ended. I was vastly disappointed with how a wonderful game series that I had grown to love had crashed and burned so horribly. If you're looking to simply finish the story, if you can even call it that it's so bad, from the previous games that is virtually the only semi-good reason to buy this game. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it at all. 2-3/10			"

												Well, well, well. Another shooter has fallen to the subscriptions of substandard Call-of-Duty-esque gaming.F.E.A.R. 3 is a game in which you (assuming you play as Point Man, the long-time protagonist of the series.) and your dead, cannibal brother, whom you killed, team up to... Uhmmm. Do something? It involves Alma's baby. That's all that's really made apparent.Firstly, the ""dramatic story-line"" they boast about on the store page has little relation to the actual game. The story-line was little more than a rail for you to follow from shooty-segment to shooty-segment. In fact, since Point Man is completely mute, they never really elaborate on why exactly he wants Alma's baby. Maybe it's to shoot it? But that contradicts the ending... I dunno.Secondly, the game is named FEAR. Shouldn't actual fear be it's main and central focus? Well, it's not. In fact, the FEAR franchise has gotten less and less scary as time's gone on. Sure, there'll be the creepy black figure running across a gate every once in a while, but it all falls flat when you perform a psychic link on a random corpse for ""Rank Points"" and it gets plastered all over your screen in the middle of the supposed horror that you ""HAVE RANKED UP TO LEVEL __""Lastly, however, the co-op is fun. Not exactly difficult, even in the hardest difficulty, a friend of mine was able to pick the game up and immediately demolish everything. But nonetheless, it was fun. However, it continues to take away from the percieved horror of the game. No matter what game it is, cooperative horror doesn't work. When you have a friend singing ""Fireball"" on the mic, any horror in the scene tends to be lost.So, if you played the original F.E.A.R. and are looking for a second dose of the thrilling horror that was in the first game, go buy the original Dead Space. If you're looking for a great story plot with lots of depth and heart-wrenching moments, then go buy The Walking Dead Seasons 1 & 2. If you're looking for a mediocre cooperative experience to share with your friends for about 5 hours of game-time, however, then you've come to the right place.TL;DR: Not scary, not deep in story, not good single player, not difficult, but a nice little 5 hour time-sink for you and a friend.I do not recommend this game,»ZCC« Zombie Chicken			"

												The first F.E.A.R. was an outstanding masterpiece. The two following expansion packs were so so.F.E.A.R. 2 was great in my opinion. The game had a crappy story although the pacing of the game was good, it also featured a smart AI, it had amazing visuals (fire effect, smoke, explosion, close combat, firefights, etc), some great scares and a convincing atmosphere, etc.F.E.A.R 3 features an even smarter AI. The enemy soldiers are quick to take cover, switch positions, retreat, suppress you, throw grenades, flank you and charge you when they can. There's also plenty of enemy chatter that you can hear which allows you to anticipate some of your enemies' movements. They will also call you out if you are hiding for too long.Needless to say, the AI as advanced as it is in Killzone 2,3 which features the smartest FPS AI to date. In fact, the AI is sometimes so smart, it becomes punishing. Plus there's no blind fire option, you make peek out of your cover and unleash small burst but you will almost certainly get return fire. Your screen WILL stay red for an extended period of time after being shot at. You may also chose to stay in cover until the red screen goes away, but sometimes you can get approached by a guy with a shotgun who will blow you away.Your flashlight will also expose you to your enemies just like in the first game. However, I tested this further and found out that the enemies will react to your flashlight even IF they do not face you, meaning they react to your flashlight being turned on, they don't react to the flashlight necessarily because the AI field of vision picks it up.The cover system is outstanding and I can only wish that most if not all FPS featured this kind of cover system. The Killzone franchise invented this realistic cover system first though.When you take cover, you do not get the chance to view yourself in the third person perspective nor will you be able to magically see everything that is going on around you. This time, the only way for you to view your surroundings is to peek from a cover. It is too bad there's no leaning option, but you can lean easily when in cover.The bullet time is back and it works the same way it did in F.E.A.R 2, although it drains slightly faster, at first at least.Oh and also, Paxton Fettel is back! Damn did I miss his voice. ""They all deserve to die..."" Although, if you want to play single player, you can only play as Point Man. Your co-op buddy therefore can play as Fettel. This time around, Alma won't shred your enemies as often. You'll have to rely on Fettel more to do the job. Although you yourself have some psychotelepathic skills. Fettel's abilities are slightly overpowered but he makes for an awesome anti-hero.However, F.E.A.R has always been a franchise about the single-player experience. The co-op campaign might be slightly unfounded here. Fettel's occasional remarks do not ruin the immersion of the game, but they do ruin the time when you immerse yourself enough to believe that you are the only one fighting the enemy - all by yourself. He is always there somehow, watching your every step, so you never really feel alone. Ultimately, the co-op is a great add-on, I'm just not sure if the F.E.A.R. franchise really needed it. There are some games out there that scream co-op but don't have any, such as Clive Barker's Jericho for instance.There's also a horde mode, reminiscent of the Call of Duty Zombie mode. You still build barricades and get better weapons but this time you are fighting the smart AI that is assaulting your position instead of shooting brain dead zombies.In general, the game play is extremely rewarding. The guns feel real, although shotgun looks quite idiotic.The firefights are realistic enough: the recoil, the smoking barrel,the destructible environments, the matrix-looking like bullet movement in slow mo, the human-like AI - it's all there. You can also slide over cover just like in Brink.In general, the controls are pretty fluid except for when you push the button to take cover and then if you need to desperately displace, you will need to push the button again to exit cover and sometimes that will get you killed, unless you keep pushing ""S"" but forget about exiting cover any other way but by pressing the cover button. Switching cover is also very fluid - something that Killzone did not introduce.Another huge positive note is that you can actually see your legs! how awesome is that? You don't get to see that too often. However, you do not cast a shadow all the time, just in some places. Also, one of the most satisfying things in F.E.A.R. is throwing a grenade at a couple of guys, shooting a couple of guys in slo-mo and finally kicking the last standing guy in the face therefore destroying the entire squad in seconds.The graphics are satisfying to say the least, there's also Directx11 (IGN's gripe about the supposedly outdated graphics while reviewing the game on PS3 is therefore unwarranted; the AI issue is also redundant because the AI is insanely smart). The story is enough to keep you playing although the cheap Alma scare tactics can give you slight jumps even though some of them are cliche and predictable. The atmosphere is solid, there are some major set pieces.On the negative side, those mech robots are back and man do I hate those stages. I prefer a great tactical FPS as opposed to silly arcade mech warrior shoot-ups. I'm disappointed they brought these mechs stages over from F.E.A.R. 2. because these frustrating levels are unnecessary.The game gives you plenty of opportunity to sneak on enemies and take out one or two before others react, but the game does not give you the opportunity to silently kill the two and have the ability to shoot the rest in a quick fashion.Also, the melee kills should be worked out. It feels sluggish and consolish because the melee kills are auto aimed for you. Sometimes you get to kill your enemies instantly with a knife if the knife slices their head. Sometimes, you have to slash them several times for them to die, not only that, they often have the balls to fight back as you keep slashing their face.Ultimately there's not that many negatives, as far as the solid gameplay is concerned anyway, F.E.A.R. 3 is a solid shooter.

												Fear 3 is the weakest link of the Fear series and it doesn't feel like a true FEAR game. It changes so many things that didn't need any changes and introduced some new things to the franchise that are not compatible with a horror shooter. But the worst thing about this game is that it is a console port with console game mechanics.+ Graphics are nice+ Sound is good+ Some characters of the franchise are in the game+ Co-op campaign- Weapon variety is reduced. Also, after every mission you lose your weapons again, which isn't that immersive.- The plotline is a mess.- Linear and small console maps. Even objects that are not high can't always be jumped over.. - Health regeneration was introduced. This doesn't fit into a horror game.- This game is such a horror game that you can earn skills and even pick up Alma dolls. :P- The final chapter is anti-climaticFear 3 is an average fps, but a bad Fear game. I can't recommend buying this game except if you are a die-hard FEAR fan and want to play this game despite its faults.Replay value: Only with a friend or if you want to play as FettelRating: 6.5/10Recommendation: No for a Fear game, neutral for a fps			"

 If you like shooters it's okay. If you like F.E.A.R. it's bad. This game should have never been called fear. I say this not just for the spurious representation of the classic fear games, but for the fact the game is not scary. The original fear is in my option a revolutionary game, the level of detail and thought put into it was tremendous. This game however has little to none to connect this to the original fear.   The Replicants are gone. The invisible assassins are gone. This does not seem to be a fear game, and that is a good way to put it as this game seems more like another. Call of duty clone is not a term that should be used likely but the similarities are far too obvious, nearly all of the original mechanics of fear(health/armor, specialized weapons) have been torn out to put in call of duty mechanics(health regeneration, riot shield, flash grenades.).The first level says it all for me. I start crawling through the jail not sure what going to happen when I realized. It's too bright. The first “scare” was little more than an special effect and Alma saying hello. Next a power failure, finally some scary scenes. However before one jump scare the lights come back on. Finally, I as the middle of a firefight when I see an enemy above me on a catwalk. My thoughts went as follows. “Crud, im going to have to walk around to get at him.. wait, this a fear game, there quality games, I should be able to shoot through the floor!” this is when I realized this is no fear game.   And it really isn’t a fear game. Like the other fear games, it was not made on the LithTech engine. This engine gave fear so much more than other games. I already notice several missing refinements. The levels where sloppy. In the first you knew what way to go. It gave you plenty of lighting hints movements and other cues to push you in the right direction. I got lost many times in this one.  Lastly the story, to be honest, If you did not play Fear 2 you would not care about 70% of this story. Truthfully If point man where to just walk away the same ending would have happened.  There are many issues with the story that I could argue but I think the main issue I had was Alma. All the way through the fear games Alma has been set as a boogeyman. And even though a new creep one was created for this she is still this silent super being, beging in the shadows in the first game was okay. This was the story of the story, but now that we have reached the end her character barely develops from being a bump in the night.			"

												Remember F.E.A.R. when it first came out and you wanted to play it even though your system couldn't even handle it?  Perhaps, that was not the case for you, but it was for me.  Eventually, I was able to run it with decent hardware and I never looked back.F.E.A.R. stepped into the seen in slow-mo and then it took the first-person shooter genre by storm, tailored to shooter and survival-horror fans.  F.E.A.R. 3, while the weaker follow-up to the F.E.A.R. series still holds up as an atmospheric game with solid gunplay and an interestingly shocking ending like its predecessor.  Some may complain that the formula is becoming boring and stale, but it is still a perfectly decent addition to the franchise.As a fan of the Dead Space series, I found F.E.A.R. 3 to have a commanding presence when it comes to atmosphere.  I would argue that F.E.A.R. 3 nails the atmosphere and overall eerie-filled environments better than Dead Space 3. The attentional to detail is more adequate in some areas than others, but it has enough going in that department to earn a ribbon.  The gunplay is rock-solid, which makes gameplay worthwhile.  Along with the cover system that lets you peek while in cover, quickly lean to the opposite side and aim, it nails the cover-system just right.  For those that are looking for a more conventional F.E.A.R. 3 tactic and approach to gameplay, it is still all there and nothing much has changed if you want to use slow-mo and the run-and-gun variety.  Even on the easiest difficulty, F.E.A.R. 3 can present some difficulty spikes.  A franchise that basically expects a player to run-and-gun using the slow-mo function, you could be taken down quickly on normal difficulty.  It asks you to be tactical while using slow-mo.  It is slightly different from F.E.A.R. 1 in that you are not only running into singular rooms, using slow-mo, and unloading.  There are plenty of cover usage so you will need to run from one cover to another while using slow-mo.  Think of it as a Chinese action film with lots of gun-fighting.  It can be quite satisifying at times, but the variation comes in with using cover to get to where you need to go without dying outright.  I hear it is a common complaint among the series' fans, but I did not find a major issue with it.F.E.A.R. 3 is far from great and it is worth noting that it is not spectacular as the original F.E.A.R.  Either way, it manages to be a perfectly decent addition to the series without presenting any major quams.  It is successful at being a solid first-person shooter with the well-known F.E.A.R. elements.  While I cannot comment on the co-operative play because I have no experience in it, F.E.A.R. 3 offers enough there to warrant a purchase on a decent sale.  I paid $5 for it and I thought that it was worth it.  I cannot say for sure if it would have been worth $10 though.  It's a rock-solid game to the series.  Just do not expect another F.E.A.R. 1 and you will enjoy it for what it offers.  Game on,ElannRating: 7 out of 10			"

												The history of F.E.A.R's development has swapped hands through practically every expansion and installment and which each one, a new take on the franchise was created. Most, if nearly all, fans of the series consider the first F.E.A.R to be the 'best' due to its thick, tense atmosphere and and engaging combat and I agree to a point. F.E.A.R 1 still out plays most shooters and horror games today! So with that legacy and high standard already set from the get go, it'd cetainly be a challenge to meet it again, especially in the hands of a different developer! As a result, many people tend to look down on F.E.A.R 3 as being a 'generic' CoD clone and this couldn't be more of a lie!F.E.A.R 3 is certainly different to its predecessor in terms of pace, atmosphere and horror. It's not what I'd call a horror game and that may be a turn off for most. But what it lacks in creepy it certainly MORE than makes up for in fun and replayability! The standard of combat is very much maintained despite the (shock horror) regenerating health and cover systems. The guns have a very engaging feel to them, enemies being gibbed and pinned to the wall or heads popping to the lined up headshot let you know you're in a F.E.A.R game! Regenerating health seems more fitting to the title as the levels are not as big and large scale combat happens a lot more frequently, not giving you time to look for those hidden health boosts in previous games. Cover system can be taken or left, it's simply another option of play style which leads to another staple feature of F.E.A.R 3. Pointman? Fettel? or both? You can now play as the big bad lil' brother in F.E.A.R, who comes with his own unique playstyle of possessing enemies and harassing them with supernatural powers. This can lead to great gameplay choices like choosing who to possess based on position, type of enemy or weapon they're carrying. Pointman's slow mo reflexes and neo martial arts return also adding more choices to how you take out your enemies. While either character is a blast to play with, the real fun and where the game truly shines comes when both monsters are on the field together in the form of co-op. The whole game can be played together where the two brothers tackle the campaign in a ironically funny way. Pointman can slow down time to help Fettel with his possessions or Fettel can quickly take out a strong enemy harassing pointman by either suspending him in midway for Pointman to finish or for Fettel to possess! There's a rewarding and competitive points system in each playthrough to decide who ultimately is the favourite son! Some actions can be performed where you greedily obtain all the points of a situation or share them with your brother depending on the bond with your 'brother' (after all this a game about the strength of 'family' :P) Seeing Alma subtely appear through out levels is a nice nod to her freaky apperances in previous F.E.A.R games and it was always a cool thing to find! Some level designs and moments can lead to an eerie feeling, but nothing you'd expect from 1, still it's nice to have it there, it doesn't feel like some tacked on thing to a shooter. Multiplayer is surprisingly engaging, with fun unique game modes like 'JUST F**KING RUN' where you and your team are being chased by a fog of screaming death and your goal is to just keep running towards the goal while taking out enemy obstacles in your path! Though you can't get held up for too long and the fog is ever approaching! Contractions revolves around your team mates stock piling crates found in the map that provide you with weapons and ammo. You repair barricades to doors and windows and together you must hold out against waves of ever strengthening opponents! But be careful! As Alma stalks the rooms and streets and if she catches you staring at her, you're in for a terrible time...All in all I was so pleasantly surprised to know that the F,E,A,R legacy (despite the popular cries) was kept in tact whie Day One Studios added their own interpretation to the series and it worked! F.E.A.R 3 is a more than solid shooter that, for me, is still fun and replayable after already 6 playthroughs. The game is short enough for one playthrough with a buddy, take a lll 10 minute break then go straight back, swapping roles and doing it again which is exactly what me and my girlfriend did! It keeps the campaign lean and eventful, nothing tacked on to try and trick you that your getting you money's worth simply because it was so and so many hours long. The game is fun by itself but ultimately, F.E.A.R 3 is best played with a 'brother'. Whether your experience will be about brotherly love or sibling rivalry will depend on you!			"

												First problem is that they changed developers, Monolith did not create this game because Day 1 Studios did. So if you are wondering why it doesn't feel like a F.E.A.R. game then that might have something to do with it. Second problem is that the atmosphere did not have the same feeling at all compared to the first and second F.E.A.R. titles. It's as if they changed it from a vengeful spirit sort of thing to people being possessed by demons.Third problem is why is the mysterious ""point man"" and Fettel being haunted by the spirit of their father? I didn't get the impression from the first game that Harlan would have had such an impact on them out of nowhere. The gameplay was alright for a shooter but seemed horrible for a FEAR title. The cover mechanic was cool but the weapons are practically garbage on what they were like in the previous two titles. They removed the HP bar and the Armor bar, they took the ridiculous Battlefield & Call of Duty route with the HP. HP is much lower than it used to be and it regenerates itself, not a good thing to change in my opinion. Armacam looks different again. Overall it is fun to play if you didn't care for the main games or if you can overlook the fact they changed developers. If you really enjoyed FEAR for what it was for the first and second installments then you might be disappointed. I am certainly upset that they went from Monolith to Day 1 Studios.			"

												Yes, it's true, this game doesn't start new plotlines, it doesn't present new characters and there's no radical change in gameplay if compared to the previous games of the series. And it's great because this game, in fact, is an epilogue and as an epilogue it does an amazing job tying up loose ends and resolving all the matters. This final instalment to the franchise is the perfect conclusion of the outstanding horror story, thrilling and dramatic denouement of the confrontation between the brothers. Definitely worth getting, at least for the priceless opportunity to play as Paxton Fettel.			"

												I don't see why all the hatred for this game. Sure, it seems like a generic shooter, sure, it's not as good as the past games, sure, it's not scary at all (Hell, not even the ""scary"" parts were remotely close to being scary to me), but still, I enjoyed this game.It's pretty much mindless, dumb fun, not supposed to be taken seriously (Which I know that past games were supposed to be like that), and co-op isn't that bad, to be fair. Of course, playing this game on Co-op makes this game anything BUT scary. Mostly because you can't split up. Co-op horror games are creepy when you are forced to split up. This game doesn't make you do that, hell, you can't even move far away from your partner because (If you are playing as Fettel) you will be immediatly teleported to your nearest Pointman. Combat can get a bit monotonous at times, fight soldiers here, destroy mechs over there, slay a few anarchy zombies, and use a giant robot yourself! With an exploit, it seems. If you are about to die and you leave the mech and get back inside as quickly as you can, your health will be fully restored. That made the bridge level MUCH easier. I dunno if mechs count, I dunno if the phase guys in giant suits count, hell, I dunno if the power generator you gotta shot count as bosses. For me, there was only one boss, the final boss. Which....Can be killed in a couple of minutes, which in turn is a huge dissapointment. BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER, DANZIG AT THE END CREDITS! Of course, the game is pretty damn short, I finished it in less than 4 hours, which is kind of a dissapointment. That's my only complaint about this game. If you are a die hard fan of the series, I wouldn't really recommend this. If you are just a fan of the series, sure, go ahead. If you are a lover of mindless shooters that can be plain and perhaps a bit repetitive at times, it's a must buy!			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is an average, and unremarkable, horror first person shooter.  If you have ever played a fps then you'll be familiar will everything that F.E.A.R. 3 has to offer, if you have never played a fps before... well that kind of odd and remarkable, and you probably shouldn't have your first fps experience with F.E.A.R. 3. This isn't to suggest that F.E.A.R. 3 is a bad game, but more to the fact that the game lacks polish. It has some nice things going for it, the campaign gameplay varies enough to stay fresh, there is co-op (which I didn't get to experience since none of my friends have this game), and the two playable characters feel slightly different from each other. However, the game has significant things going against it. For starters, it isn't scary, which is a problem, considering that it is a horror fps. Second, the campaign itself drags on for way too long and often feels like it is stretching things out, just to fully use an environment (a la, if we spent months making a haunted department store, then the player is going to see every freaking room in it). And lastly, the game's story is very narrow and straight to the point, so if you haven't played the previous games in the series, you'll not going to understand everything that is going on, and even if you did, you're still not going to understand everything.If you play this game under ideal conditions (co-op with a good friend that scares easily) then I would image that this game would be great, however, that isn't going to happen for the vast majority of people, so this game is not worth it.

												Summary:If you are looking for a FPS, buy this.If you are looking for a F.E.A.R game, don't buy this.Positive:-The gameplay mechanics are fluid and crisp. -Enjoyable combat.-Graphics are amiable for a modern day game.-Cheesy lines from enemies. (I like it).-Will catch you up on the story if you havn't played the first 2 installments (Extraction Point and Perseus Mandate excluded).Negative:-The graphics seem a backward step from F.E.A.R 2.-The story is contradictory and dissapointing. -It tries to be scary and falls short unlike previous installments.-Much easier than past 2 installments by taking on a generic health system (I'M LOOKING AT YOU COD), you recover health instead of trying to scavenge it and armour.-I don't know who thought it would be a good idea to introduce a point based challenge system in order to 'level up'.-'A lot' of reiteration of previous F.E.A.R story points.-Do not understand the Replicas' 'deal' this game.-Alma?

Although this game isn't much long, it's really enjoyable to play. Find a friend to play with and ffight the fear together! If you have more than 1 friend who wants to play, there are 4 players coop missions, which are also interesting and reminded me kinda Killing floor.

												F.E.A.R. 1 was an eery, brilliant experience that basically brought horror movies like ""The Ring"" to life (kind of) and mixed it with a good shooter.F.E.A.R. 2 kinda fumbled the atmosphere of the first part (which was made great to begin with by short bursts of violence and shock and then left alone completely) but replaced it with some of the best jump scares and intimidating level design I've ever seen. Plus, it was a good shooter with some neat additions.F.E.A.R. 3 fails at both. It's not scary. It's not eery. It's a mediocre shooter that forces a mediocre coop-system down everybody's throat who wanted to play the game for its own sake, for the story, for whatever. The story's conclusion is uninspired and it doesn't even take you too long to get there. Play the first two games and then forget part 3 exists.			"

												If you have any experience at all with the first two  games and DLC, this is not the game for you. An atmospheric series with great graphics, decent AI, solid combat, and an actual plot (!) has been made into something a great deal more generic with weak story and no horror.Being biased towards co-op play, repetitive areas, and NPCs constantly reacting to you with horror even when you have done nothing but hide behind cover for a few minutes were enough to drive me from a series I have played and replayed for years. Hearing a surviving soldier screaming ""did you SEE that?!"" every thirty seconds made me sad for a series that was able to creep me out and scare me with more than just the occassional startle. Do yourself a favor and play (or replay as the case may be) the first two games, as they continue to hold up - much better than this cynical cash grab.			"

												I consider this the worst FEAR game in the series... the story is not engaging, it is not scary, and the gameplay is not innovative, it is just a ""Go from point A to point B"" shooter.If you are playing Co-op, then it might be interesting because one player will be playing with very different mechanics, which end up getting repetitive and boring after some time.

												As a major fan of the F.E.A.R. Franchise and playing all the games, it hurts me to say that this game is likely the worst of the entire franchise. WB games made a LOT of bad choices with this one. The thing that made F.E.A.R. and its expansion packs scary was sometimes, you don't know if what you are experiencing is a hallucination or the real thing until the end. ""Was that person who walked down that corridor real?"" You would ask yourself, you would then go down that hallway to help that person to just find a bloodfilled deadend with a healthpack, you would then turn around to see that person you saw stand right in front of you, horribly mutilated before fading into ashes.F.E.A.R. 2 Was scary but not in the same way as the first, almost everything paranormal or scary you saw was real, not a hallucination which kind of kills the mood. You can tell F.E.A.R. 2 was more focused on combat and some levels were even more Linear than F.E.A.R. F.E.A.R. at least let you explore for health boosters or reflex boosters, or even different guns. F.E.A.R. 2 however only rewarded you with reflex boosters or intel laying out in the open.This release, F.E.A.R. 3 had a lot of incoming hype but was ultimately, WB games' futile attempt to close the F.E.A.R. story. It seems that this one was focused entirely on combat though there is not a lot of variation to the enemies. The Co-op option doesnt make my opineon of the game better either, just a way for WB to continue jumping the shark. It may not even as well be CALLED Co-op as it seems to be a competitive shooter to see who can kill more bad guys, who can do more of their special maneuvers and who can ♥♥♥♥ eachother over more by stealing a psychic link behind your partner's back. This isnt the game for you if you want a shooter with occasional scares like the last 2 F.E.A.R.s, ultimately, major F.E.A.R. fans will be disappointed. If you wish to close the F.E.A.R story and dont give a crap about scares, go right ahead. On the other hand, if you want an experience that was in years of development and delivers a ton of scares, this one you can definently skip.			"

												So, so many things wrong with this game, but in short: they forgot to think while designing it, and threw out so many good, already working ideas through the windows.We got back Point Man, the mute hero from the first game, but in F3AR we have multiple awkward third-person cutscenes where people talk to him, and he just stares angrily like a neanderthal.The combat features ""evolutionary slow-mo modes"" that's apparently still revolutionary, 6 years, 2 games and 3 expansions later. Also the combat is strictly cover-based shooter with iron sights, auto-healing,  bad granade-throwing physics and bad AI, ocassionally a mech section. Also it has about 4 different types of enemy if we don't count the different weapons on them.*edit: and a sneak peek into AI: I crossed a corridor and got hidden behind the corner, and the enemy started having radio chatter about how did I vanished, impossible, and started to repeatedly look after me in a 2m*2m room without them realizing that I can not be there.The gameplay has close to no horror elements, just sh*tloads of gore because apparently blood paintings = horror. The game ignored the second game's story and Fettel is still just a spirit, despite him having a new body (so a gimmicky coop can work), and changed the storyline so Alma, who was multiple times stated went straight-out crazy (and murderous) around 6 YO, was actually a misunderstood child who never wanted to hurt anyone but ""her demons"" were drawing out the evil in her.  The whole game just... changed from dark and threatening and manipulative into teenage horror movie props and save the little girl themes... and also don't forget the levelup and xp system that makes so many xp popups on the screen during playing that it's severely distracting.Add the abysmal looking graphics to this - it looks like someone smeared vaseline over the screen, everything is blurry that's more than 4 metres far... I can't believe that Fear 1 and 2 looks so, so much better than this game.The only positive thing I could point out that's the coop campaign because it's really rare that it's present in games, but uninspired cookie-cutter covershooter with slapped on FEAR story and bad graphics doesn't make me want to relive the campaign ever again. It was well enough once.			"

												Even for an avid fan of the series, this was hard to get through.  The duck-and-cover nature of the engine is poorly suited to the type of game F.E.A.R. is and the execution was good, but it just didn't fit.  Shuffling game studios hurt the franchise more than helped it, and I would much rather play the first game over the second or third.  The story becomes a bit farfetched at this point--even by F.E.A.R. standards--and the map design made chokepoints predictable and the levels tedious to get through.  The alternate play style of Paxton Fettel didn't add much to the game, and definitely not enough to redeem it.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.The first F.E.A.R. was an outstanding masterpiece. The two following expansion packs were so so.F.E.A.R 3 features an even smarter AI. The enemy soldiers are quick to take cover, switch positions, retreat, suppress you, throw grenades, flank you and charge you when they can. There's also plenty of enemy chatter that you can hear which allows you to anticipate some of your enemies' movements. They will also call you out if you are hiding for too long.There's also a horde mode, reminiscent of the Call of Duty Zombie mode. You still build barricades and get better weapons but this time you are fighting the smart AI that is assaulting your position instead of shooting brain dead zombies.Ultimately there are not that many negatives, as far as the solid gameplay is concerned.Overall: F.E.A.R. 3 is a solid shooter.

												What an atrocity...FEAR 1 and 2 were absolutely fantastic games that were unrivaled in the fusion of Horror and FPS, and still are, to this day. Eventually FEAR 3 came along to complete the trilogy. FEAR 1 had atmosphere, difficulty, great story and great gameplay. FEAR 2 had more of the same, but with a more streamlined approach to the story, but it didn't have as many open ended levels.FEAR 3 ditched the horror, the good writing and ended up adding COOP to follow the COOP craze. The game was not difficult, the horror elements were completely removed, and the story was so out of wack, incongruent and just horribly written. Both the first 2 FEAR games had incredible AI that provided difficulty. Here, they might as well just be standing still. The level design is horribly linear, with no options of going in a different way. Do yourselves a favor and stay away from this atrocity. If you were a fan of the first 2 games, this game will do nothing but sour your memory of the series. Avoid this like the plague!			"

												The single-player mode in this game is rubbish -- but that's alright. If you play through the campaign with a friend, much like Resident Evil 6 and Kane & Lynch, this becomes a much different and much better game. It's fun to react to what your friend is experiencing and go through the over-the-top, ridiculous story together. The gunplay is, much like F.E.A.R. 2, very solid and enjoyable.Similarly, the multiplayer is amazing with modes like ""♥♥♥♥ing Run"" that bring a fresh coat of paint to what would have otherwise been mediocre multiplayer. Unfortunately, nobody plays online anymore really. Buy it on a sale and share it with a friend. You won't regret it.			"

												This doesn't even deserve the title ""FEAR"".It's a series of shooting galleries loosely themed to the game. You enter an area, kill a few dozen enemies, then they unlock the door to the next area. This pattern repeats to the end of the game. There are no interesting places, no interesting gameplay - its literally just one big shooting gallery with COD-esque gameplay and a points and ranking system. The plot can basically be summed up as ""Fettel is resurrected and competes with Point Man for Alma's attention"", which in my personal opinion completely ruins both characters. Even Beckett, from the god-awful FEAR 2, was ruined by framing him as some sort of weakling who'd be an alcoholic if he weren't in such dire circumstances.Every single positive point to the series was removed in favor of this ridiculous shooting gallery gameplay. At least the AI is able to do something other than stand out in the open - sometimes.			"

Excuse me, is there scare?F.E.A.R. 3 suprises. Luckily, to a large extent it is a positive surprise, because the rivalry of two brothers equipped with supernatural abilities has brought to the gameplay freshness. Also the length of the campaign is not that big downside, because you want to return to it, not only to find all the secrets and improve the records, but most of all, to see how you can murder with the other character. Unfortunately, along with the freshness and efficiency, mood of horror has vanished somewhere. Alma is still able to jump out suddenly or bash the cabinet with her hand, but it does not go beyond the already ripped to the pain motives, at which we just shudder our arms out of habit.As a horror single player F.E.A.R. 3 falls pale. However, if you have at hand someone who is willing to spend a few evenings in the common butchery, then go ahead and buy it.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is nothing like the previous F.E.A.R. games: gone are the horror elements, med-kits, upgrade pick-ups, multiple paths to out flank enemies and intelligent AI. Instead, F.E.A.R. 3 has taken a page out of the popular Call of Duty games and gives the player regenerating health and points to level up their profile when completing challenges within the game. If you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. series it may be worth playing just to see where the confusing and spotty story ends up or if you're looking for a shooter this game has some potential but it's nothing like the previous games which are way superior to this one.

												This is a mixed bag, leaned more towards the negative side due to history. I recommend this game if you want a quick time killer with a friend or more, as this is a good generic shooter. As a F.E.A.R. game, it is nothing but disappointment all around, and it's not just because of the lack of scares like a lot of people say, it involves many other things. Single PlayerThe way the story is told is underwhelming, there is no more mystery and atmosphere, hardly any suspense, or anything to look out for in order to aid your knowledge on what is going on. They blatantly killed off almost every single character from the previous games, without any logic or explanation; they were either forgotten, or cut off from the story. Makes me surprised they even brought Jin Sun-Kwon back, but not characters like Holiday, Betters, Aristide, among many others. The gameplay is functional, don't get me wrong, but like almost everything in this, it no longer feels like F.E.A.R., the only essence left there is the slow-motion, certain melee attacks, and very few weapons.I'd say it's like Call of Duty with a cover system no one cares about. The amazing soundtrack the series contained simply disappeared here, and was replaced by a lackluster and utterly forgettable one. The only redeeming quality of a F.E.A.R. game this has in my opinion, is Paxton Fettel himself, who while looks different and has abilities that feel uninspired and limited, retained not only his voice actor, but also his character and cold behavior. Another complaint is that the game is extremely short, you can finish it in under 4 hours.MultiplayerThe multiplayer is nothing like the previous' games. It tends to be co-op focused, even though 2 of the 4 game modes are competitive (Soul King and Soul Survivor). Contractions' core mechanics remind me of Call of Duty's Zombies mode, which while not necessarily bad, lacks originality. Good game mode, regardless. In ♥♥♥♥ing Run the players have to push through waves of enemies while running from Alma's 'wall of death', a very interesting concept that works nicely. Soul King is the one truly competitive game mode, in which no player cooperates with each other at all, since the objective is to eliminate everyone in sight and collect the dropped souls. Soul Survivor is similar, but only one player is selected as a spectre at the beginning of a round, whose objective is to kill the other players and turn them into spectres before the time runs out. All game modes are solid and work well, but will get repetitive after a small amount of time due to the fact that there is only a small selection of maps. I was also turned off by the removal of game modes such as Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, Slow-Mo Team Death Match, and others.ConclusionThe verdict is split. The game for someone who doesn't care for the series is likely to be solid, because the gameplay can be fun if you play it with friends and mess around in the multiplayer. However, as a huge fan of the series I say avoid it at all costs, unless you love Fettel like a fangirl. As a game alone it gets a 6.8/10.0. As a F.E.A.R. game, 1.6/10.0. "

												While the game is hardly scary at all, at least compared to it's predecessors, it is quite enjoyable. The gameplay is solid and polished, and it has a really nice feel to it. I have seen a lot of people who hate the game for not being ""as good"" as the previous installments, I had a great time with it. Then again, I played F.E.A.R 3 before I played the previous installments, so these are just my impression of the game as a game and not as a sequel. And since I played the games out of order I felt really lost in the story, but from what I can gather the Lore wasn't really a big part of the game.Anyway, it's a good shooter, however not a scary one and the lore isn't that immersive. 7/10			"

												Everyone is like ""This is the worst game ever, dont buy it"" FEAR 3 is by no means a bad game. It is actually a fantastic and entertaining shooter. People have just been spoiled by how incredible the first FEAR was. FEAR 3 modernized the franchise and simplified a ton of the aspects of the gameplay, but it is 100 times better than FEAR 2. It is also better than most shooters today and has some awesome moments and great voice acting. The AI is not as good as the original FEAR, but it is way better than FEAR 2. To me, FEAR 3 feels like a modern version of the original FEAR. There is regenrating health, the graphics arn't blurry (im talking to you FEAR 2), you can only hold two weapons, there is a cover system that you dont even have to use if u dont want to... Sure, the story went a bit off road compared to the rest of the games, but Its a great game, give it a try.			"

												OK, I played this game twice, first time solo in a single player and second time in a coop and it was a blast both times.Thogh it might seem dated nowadays (jees, did 5 years really passed by already?), it has good design, solid gameplay and great story.I have to admit, I have a thing for a Fear series and the univers and I love both the setting and a story, so I really loved playing all of this stuff and seing familiar locations and familiar characters.While this whole stuff might not be interesting enough to play the game, the most important fact about F3AR is that it is co-op shooter which was primarily designed as such with assymetric gameplay, two different characters with completely separate skill trees and combat mechanics and a story line tied to the coop gameplay.Co-op games are are rare breed and good coop shooters are virtually non existing and if you are looking for this kind of game you should definitely give it a try.

												And I thought F.E.A.R. 2 was a good game, this one is even better.After finishing and enjoying F.E.A.R. 2 I got started on playing F.3.A.R. pretty much straightaway and I was at first not as impressed with the game compared to the previous one. Just a couple of silly things like how they changed the combat and removed health packs and armour but I soon got used to using the radial red/blood onscreen to know when to hide and when to push forward into combat. The story with this one was really, really good and the cutscenes were superbly done. I would've said this game was about as good as 2 but no better, that was until I completed the game as Pointman and unlocked Fettel.  Oh boy. Playing as Fettel elevated this game above F.E.A.R. 2 instantly. I played it through to completion again with Fettel and it didn't feel stale in any way because Fettel is just the most ridiculous fun you can have in a game. I can't use any more superlatives and you should probably buy this series of games and enjoy them.I recommend this game more than I recommended 2 in my review for that. Massive fun on both play throughs but the Fettel one is best. Get this game!			"

												This game is absolutely terrible. The devs turned this once awesome horror series into an action oriented co-op shooter.First off the ""horror"" parts in this game are neither creepy nor frightening, they're simply annoying. FEAR and Project Origin did their job far better in this regard. In addition to describe the A.I. as weak in this game would be an understatement. It was a huge step backwards from the previous games.If you don't play this game in co-op be prepared for very unfair fights. How about fighting a mech with little to no cover or possibilities to avoid damage and your opponent having a huge amount of health and hitting like a truck? Sounds fun doesn't it? (not to me) - The ""boss fights"" are not really what I'd call challenging as they don't require that much thinking. It's just kill them faster than they can kill you.The story is just a mess. Characters from the previous games don't make any sense and there are plotholes all over the place.Finally from what I saw the multiplayer was dead on arrival. There was only these gauntlet like missions and no real player vs player action. But even in these co-op missions you have to compete against your teammates. If you are to slow or not good enough you will be left behind or have a negative influence on the overall performance. I don't know who designed it, but it wasn't thought out very well.			"

												I guess this game had a pretty large focus on multiplayer, both co-op and competitive, but no one else is playing it so I can only review the single player, which, at it's heart, is a mediocre shooter.  It tries to spice things up with a first person cover mechanic, but it doesn't add very much in terms of usefulness.  In fact, it's a bit wonky and often times hinders you.  There were several times I was hit while ""in cover"" without being able to see the enemy in front of me.  Fetel's possession and psychic mechanics seemed fun, but you need to complete missions as point man first to unlock him.  I only played him for a few missions.Spooks are pretty half-hearted and sparse in this last installment of the FEAR series.  A big part of that coming from not really interacting with Alma at all.  Nearly all dialogue is given to you through your bro. who is disturbing, but not really scary.  Alma was center stage for FEAR 2, and it's what made for great spooks.  Here you barely feel her presence at all and her personality is nonexistant.  Some sections of the game look very dated graphically.  Much more so than FEAR 2(as I remember it).  Some approaching FEAR 1 levels of meh.  This usually isn't a concern for me, but it has me scratching my head on how much of a graphical downgrade they seem to have had between sequels.The sound design is pretty terrible.  FEAR never really had satisfying gun sounds, but sometimes there will be something that happens in a scripted scene, like a head exploding, and there will be no sound effect paired with it at all.  Pretty immersion breaking.Overall an OK shooter with tepid spooks.4/10			"

												I went into this game expecting nothing, since I heard it didn't hold up against FEAR 1.  Truth is it doesn't, but that didn't stop me from having a great time anyway!FEAR 3 is a pretty standard corridor shooter, at least if you play it as a single player game like I did.  The sound design is great, guns and explosions feels satifyingly punchy.  In one part of the campaign had your character go temporarily deaf due to an explosion for about 5 minutes, at first I thought it was a bug but it works great for the scene, very memorable.  The music is great as well, it really enhances some of the spooky bits.Some of the environments are downright inspired, level 2 where you're fighting cultists in a costco TV electronics section that looks like a hall of mirrors is a standout moment.  Making your way through crashed train cars on a collapsing bridge was another great scene.  The level where you're fighting your way through cultist martial law suburbia is like a dark take on Modern Warefare 2's levels in the same setting.  Whoever put the shower jumpscare in the game, congrats, that one got me good.The difficulty is definitely skewed for consoles, play on the hardest difficulty and it's fun.    Didn't run into any bugs on my playthrough, although a few sections were next to impossible to complete without abusing the AI.  The enemies are dumb cannon fodder in this game, nothing like FEAR 1.  Playthrough took maybe 7-8 hours.In short, it's a fairly standard shooter with some brilliant environments.  I'd give it a shot if you enjoy single player fps games and can get it for cheap.			"

												Every time I see FEAR 3 on sale I see people bashing it as the worst in the series, but the meta score is actually not too bad 74/100. Unlike the first 2 FEAR games, FEAR 3 has one of those regenerating health systems where you just hide under cover for a few seconds and you recover back to full health. No need to scrounge for med kits or armor. Also, the game seems built around 2 player co-op, which I like in first person shooter games (when I have someone to play with).*Spoilers ahead*FEAR 3 takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events of FEAR 2. Alma is pregnant and getting ready to give birth, as a result her psychic power is tearing up the city (possibly the world). Again the main opposition is the private military contractor Armacham, who seems to have become 100x more powerful than they were in the first games. Even without their clone super soldiers from the first games, Armacham seems capable of overrunning and occupying entire cities with soldiers, aircraft, and power armor. You play the Point Man protagonist from the first FEAR game (the guy you play in FEAR 2 also shows up briefly) but this time you have an “imaginary” friend Paxton Fettel (Bad guy from the first game). Your primary goal this time around is to reach Alma before she gives birth and deal with her once and for all. Unfortunately for you, Alma’s psychic pain has summoned nightmare creatures and twisted the surviving civilian population into crazed psychos.Unlike the previous FEAR games, FEAR 3 is broken down into missions or “levels” with each mission giving you a point score at the end. You gain points by finding collectables, killing enemies, and completing “challenges.” The challenges are similar to the “Skill shots” in Bulletstorm, where it’s basically just using various methods of killing. For example, 2000 points for killing enemies with a specific weapon, or 1000 points for getting 25 headshots, or 2000 points for getting 3 backstabs. The points aren’t just for show, by the way. You “level up” when you gain enough points and each level gives you some kind of perk, such as +10% health or +bullet capacity. You can replay levels as many times as you want to “grind” for points. This means that the game will get easier over time as you replay it. You might notice that when you first start the game, it seems far more difficult than the previous ones, well this changes as you level up and get stronger. The regenerating health means you can charge groups of enemies and just duck for cover when your screen is almost completely red (near death). Healing is free unlike FEAR 1 and 2 which had limited med kits.As I mentioned earlier, the game is built with 2 player co-op in mind. At the end of each mission there is a ranking between the 2 players to see who scored highest in several categories. The game’s ending depends on which of the two characters “won” the most missions. Of course if you’re playing single player the character you’re playing (Fettel or Point Man) will “win” every level you complete. Point Man’s gameplay is the same as the previous games (standard shooter with Slow-Mo power), But Fettel is a psychic commander. This means he can possess enemies and use them to fight (he doesn’t have slow-mo). Every time he takes over a new body he gets the weapons of the possessed enemy, so you can’t hoard powerful weapons or grenades the way Point Man does. You can only hold 2 weapons now, unlike 3 weapons in FEAR 1 and 4 weapons in FEAR 2. Possession also means you won’t be able to use the awesome power armors because the possessed body won’t last long enough. Pros:+Excellent graphics and visuals. Large variety of weapons available.+Some cool new enemies, particular the Phase Commander and Phase Caster.+A lot of replay value. I just finished the game and immediately restarted as Fettel. +2 player co-op available. Also a bunch of various multiplayer game modes I haven’t tried.Cons:-The game is very short, about 6 hours to beat the first time. Replay is strongly encouraged though.-The story is weaker than the first FEAR games. There’re a lot of unnecessary “dream sequences” that don’t seem to add much. You just walk forward about 15 seconds with someone talking in voice over and it ends.-I get the feeling that the enemies are much “dumber” than FEAR 1 enemies. They tend to stick behind the same piece of cover and just pop their heads out to shoot from there.Overall I think the game is well worth playing for fans of First Person Shooters and people who want to see how the FEAR story ends. Once you finish a mission in single player, the Fettel character is unlocked so you can try playing him for that particular level. The way to see the Fettel game ending is by playing through the game a second time (or play the game in co-op and Fettel has the highest score every mission). One thing I noticed is that the game’s Steam achievements seem to be half for multiplayer, and not many people are playing the multiplayer. This isn’t surprising since the game has been out for a few years. I’ll probably only be able to get about 45% completion for the game achievements by myself.			"

												""How the mighty have fallen"", said Pius Augustus to Mantorok. I think the same applies here. The first FEAR was a ""visceral"" FPS, offering an honest challenge and a great atmosphere. FEAR2 was much less horror, more streamlined, but still OK.Alas, a common plague in the video game industry is the need to make trilogies, when it's uncalled for or there is not enough substance for it- or both. F3AR falls in this category. Sure, the fate of Alma was still hanging after the end of the previous game, but this one has nothing to tell. Story has not to be the strong point of a FPS, but when it's that shallow, it impacts the game itself.F3AR is very short (5 to six hours) with only 8 levels, two of wich are fillers (the store after the first crash, the bridge after the second crash) and the last is an dream-like stage, glorified string of mini-cutscenes culminating with the destruction of Harlan Wade (wich, of course, is a giant abomination with a glowing weak point). So the only goal is to rejoin Alma whose psychic contractions are bringing doom to Fairport and its surroundings. F3AR fails what I like to call the Teleportation Test : when a story can be resolved with just the protagonist(s) being teleported to a certain location. And it's exactly the case with F3AR. There is no need for character development, nothing to seek or activate, nothing to accomplish really, just go see Mother. Jin (who, because Plot, is now dear to Pointman's heart ?) is just needed to pinpoint a certain location and is discaded afterwards. Now, of course, all this could be forgiven with brilliant gameplay. No such luck here. Using Pointman's slow-mo power is still fun, but kinda loses its edge after two games. Weaponry doesn't have anything outstanding, apart maybe for the impaler thingie, and even using mechas is not as fun as it could be. The level-design is dull and makes for a very, very linear progression. Of course you gather ammo, otherwise, the only things to seek are corpses to ""consume""... For points. Doing certain feats (headshots...) also grant you points, and every now and then you will ""level-up"" to gain new skills (that you can't choose, of course). If you play in co-op, points also determine who will be the favorite son, hence deciding the ending. The first player is Pointman, the other one is Fettel, who can blast psychic rays and possess people, giving a bit more fun. This co-op option is a good thing, because I sincerely think it's the only way to get some real enjoyment from the game. As far as I tried, multiplayer is dead and the campaign has little to no replay value. My advice ? If you want a few laughs, wait for a -75% discount, find a friend to play it with during a rainy afternoon and call it a day. Of, and course, even if the game tries to be creepy, forget about the horror feeling of the first game. Here, it's mainly Doomsday mixed with mad men, some gore and demons.			"

												Oh F.E.A.R. 3 oh how I wish you were absolutely perfect. Let's go ahead and get this review started! I'm going to recommend this game, BUT only if it is on sale. It's definitely not worth $20, and I luckily got it while it was 75% off. I played through the campaign with a friend of mine, and we beat it in under five hours. The game is extremely short! There are a few jump scares here and there, but nothing to have nightmares about. The graphics are alright for a game that was released back in 2011. Besides a few issues, the game was pretty fun. I liked the combat, and the story was very intriguing!Again, don't buy F.E.A.R. 3 unless it is on sale. I really wish the campaign was twenty hours instead of five because I was really enjoying the suspense, blood, and all those jolly things. To wrap this review up, the game is worth $5 and no more than that. If you like interesting stories full of gore and are fans of previous F.E.A.R. games then I recommend you get this immediately. Also, if you play with a friend it is probably 100x the fun compared to playing by yourself. If I were to rate this game, it'd probably be a solid 7/10. Could have been worse, could have been better.			"

												I loved the first two games in the F.E.A.R. franchise. I loved the insane action, slow-motion roundhouse kicks and bodies exploding into Jell-O(tm) when you pumped a shell into them. I loved the freaky-deaky story, the mysterious protagonist(s) and the occasional flirt with enigmatic storytelling, the screeching, violin-falling-down-the-stairs soundtrack that worked in all its beautiful discordance and hair-raising abruptness. The scripted scares wove ladders, hallways, doors and windows into shockingly intricate little spookouts that contrasted with the bombastic shootouts that framed them, and it all just worked out so WELL. Hell, even the ending of the second game was pretty good in my eyes.And then this game. Oh boy.I hardly know what to say about it, and I hardly have the energy- even now- to summon a full-blown rant on this marvelous marvelous deconstruction of a once-great shooter franchise. The scares? Gone. The lonesome eeriness? Gone. Hope you like playing co-operatively with your psychic *** brother who has lost all of his charm now that you can see how he works and he's always trotting along beside you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doberman. The Half-Life-esque presentation that kept you in the protagonist's perspective constantly and almost never thrust you into immersion-punching cutscenes? Hope you didn't like them, because apparently neither did WB. Did I mention that this game isn't scary?It gets most of the action from previous titles right, but it's more than just lacking in the horror department. The game called... CALLED... 'Fear'? It doesn't even try to be scary. At all.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a First Person Horror Shooter.It continues the story line of F.E.A.R. 1 and 2 but here you are again the protagonist from the first game.The Point Man, one of Almas childs. And actually you can play 2 characters, the other one being Paxton Fettel, the other son of Alma, but only when you have finished the game once. There are 2 different endings. The first, which is probably the ""real"" ending is the good one of the Point Man and the other one is the Evil end of Paxton Fettel.The Story itself is easy explained. You have to reach Alma because she is giving birth to her new child.But this is a hard and stony way especially because you have to escape from a prison first but because both brothers working together it works. Working together more or less. But beside you are hunted by your bad memories of your childhood which feature Harlan Wade, the ""father"" of Alma. Saying father is this case is an insult because he is a real ****, well you know what I mean. You have to forget your memories of Harlan Wade.On your way you pass many levels and especially different ones! No level looks the same and this is actually what was really amazing! Never saw so much variety and nice design in the levels. Pretty much the best from all F.E.A.R. games but this is probably the only aspect thats better compared to other games, sadly.The game implemented a new Health system what I like to call CoD illness. Really annoying and I missed the Medipacks and armor. It wasnt that bad after all but seriously, why did you have to add this feature to a F.E.A.R. game?There is also a new level system which I like to call CoD level illness. You get XP for getting Kill rewards or collecting things. Never liked it but to be honest its not that bad implemented here. With ""ranking"" up you also get new Skills or upgrades. While playing this game I noticed that this game is pretty much build up for Multiplayer or Coop. Annoyed me a bit to be honest, I hate games where Singleplayer campaigns doesnt feel like Singleplayer campaigns.For me this game was a little bit difficult sometimes, I played on Normal difficulty. But this difficulty was more because of the damn bloodscreen. I hate this and it makes the game hectic.The scare level is a little bit less I have to say but there were still some nice level parts which scared me. Not as many as before though. You are not hunted by Alma in this game anyway. Alma got nearly friendly, I really like how the developers changed Alma. For me she was never that evil anyway, I even liked her. She had just a bad history.[SPOILER!] (I try to let them out but in this case I have to say it because its a bad thing for me about the game)But what really made me sad is the fact that Alma dies in the end anyway, why letting the main character die like this? If you play the game you know what I mean. A really stupid and wasted death for Alma. I hope her child can offer us a similar experience in F.E.A.R. 4, if it will be ever released. Cant tell actually. Maybe this was the final game. Also Becket dies in a poor and questionable way... WHY? This didnt even make any sense. Especially how they made Becket. I mean the 1-2 minutes he actually appears in a cutscene. Yeah, the character was silent in F.E.A.R. 2 but here they just made him like a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ which wants to end his miserable life. Couldnt they make something more interesting like he teamed up with Alma or something? Its his child after all... Bad decision. They could have made the story so much better.The graphics of the game are ok but nothing special. Similar to F.E.A.R. 2s graphics.It has to be said that this game was developed by another studio, not Monolith.Monolith just provided some help. The main developer was Day 1 Studios.Noticeable concerning the changes but wasnt that bad for a indie sort of developer.I had time to play the campaign in coop with my girlfriend.It was actually a little bit more enjoyable in coop, especially playing with Fettel.First time I played with him and it was a completely different gameplay.You can actually move into enemies bodies and control them. This is only for a limited time though. But you can extend it with collecting their souls after they die.When you are not inside of an enemy you can shoot some sort of projectiles from your hand.You can also grab your enemies from far away. I actually had quite some fun playing in Coop.In the end there is a comparison of the statistics of both players and who actually wins the playthrough. This characters ending is played then. I personally felt like Fettel was more powerful than the Pointman. Unbalanced maybe, no clue.This is where the game actually proper shines in my opinion.And this is actually the only reason for me to replay it sometimes...Never the less, Singleplayer is just mediocre.Postitive:- Nice variety of environments in levels- Solid shooter gameplay, little bit similar to F.E.A.R. 2s.- Some scares, not as many as before- Good Coop- Fettel is a interesting gameplay characterNegative:- Too... Much... CoD...- Levels/Ranks useless beside of Coop- Questionable story decisions- Singleplayer is kinda boring, made for Coop...- 5 Hour campaign- Graphics outdated (2011)- Soundtrack is different and worse- Probably the last F.E.A.R. ever... F.E.A.R. Online just made it worse.Replayability: Only for CoopWell, thats everything that needs to be said I think.F.E.A.R. 3 was a good game for me but with a little bitter taste, especially at the end.It didnt feel like a proper F.E.A.R. anymore. Only replayable for Coop.The story is actually kind of disappointing. The devs totally wasted a lot of potencial here.Why did Monolith give this game away to another developer? Seriously? Actually I feel like they killed the franchise with this action. Or maybe it was WB who wanted to milk the franchise to death?I hope you take responsibility for this Monolith or WB. This is how you NOT do it.Well, the devs of F.E.A.R. 3 still did somewhat a solid job, even if the end product is far away from the quality of the first 2 F.E.A.R.s.My rating would be 6.5/10 points.The other games, except the addons/dlcs got always better ratings.I think this is a fair score and I cant give more without feeling to overrate it.

												My mark for this game is not negative just because this is F.E.A.R. The first part of this game had an outstanding graphics for the date of its release, it had a lot of moments which would make you turn grey. But here you can see no particular graphics (but i should say that it is not too awful). No real moments that are to scare you, just some nervous screams will put you out for a moment. The plot is rather interesting, but it could be better, The first part was even more technological than this one, excepting an ability to use battle robo machines. If you like challenge (i had an ability to trace it there) and a rain of bullets - this game is for you. Still I would advise you to take this game while it is on sale - the price is too high for its presentation.			"

												If F.E.A.R. 3 injects a bit of originality in the approach to the franchise, certain ideas fall flat. Indeed, having capitalized on a ""scoring"" aspect, the developers have even more attenuated clean visceral quality to the first episode. This change, in the line of the FEAR 2 and coupled with a still good AI, has the merit to bring a lot of dynamism to the gunfights. In addition, his Coop and Multiplayer, limited to 4 players but original, eventually lengthen the lifespan. Ultimately, immersion is lost what is gained in intensity. Some like it, some not, but difficult to point the finger only the final result on the bases of a first, and to some extent a second episode, thought differently. Unfortunate that the end is so random.			"

												So i have beat this on console and bought it on sale to play some of the co-op with my friend when it was 75% off. The co-op is fun but virtually any game that isn’t flat awful or broken is pretty fun with friends. There are two characters with different game play, the series original Point Man and Paxton Fettel. Here are the pros and cons of the PC version.Pros- Paxton Fettel is really fun to play as with unique and fun interesting paranormal abilities like possession.- Has a Co-op campaign- A nice achievement and upgrade system- You have a nice set of customizable controls with secondary bindings for all functions- Nice sound options with multiple slidersCons- Simple console like FPS cover based shooting. Press Q then arrows to pop out from cover shoot use bullet time to change cover repeat- Instead of mildly tactical squad based combat you push through a crowed, fight a hoard, push through crowd again. - Fairly linear with much less alternative routes then the two predecessors- The bullet time for point man is essentially useless and just thrown in because it is part of the series- Not a great port with some bad low res textures and limited graphics options- Super unbalanced Riot shield, find it, win- for the price a little too short. Took me almost 7 hours on console to beat- Multiplayer is pretty much dead and was tacked on anyway- Simple contrived plot- Adds nothing to the story of the franchise and in fact is kind of an insult to fans not that the other two had great ones, but it doesn’t fit into the universe (if you don’t care about story like me though that doesn’t matter much)- Horrible main character ,rugged, scruffy, boring, robotic, bad ♥♥♥, action hero template number 4 instead of the silent protagonist (again you can get past that easily but if that stuff matters to you it will probably disappoint)My verdictGeneric and not worth your time; It is another drop in the sea of mediocrity. Play F.E.A.R or F.E.A.R 2 instead, they are both much better games in every aspect. Unless you get it on a good sale to mess around with as Paxton Fettel it isn’t worth your time or money.			"

												If you are the type of person that doesn’t like to read a long review, then I will provide you with a short description which properly conveys the message of my full-review. DON’T BUY THIS GAME expecting the same type of game play as the previous F.E.A.R installments. HOWEVER IF YOU LIKE THROWING AWAY MONEY AND PLAYING A BADLY PORTED COD STYLE FPS FOR P_SSIES THAT LIKE TO HIDE BEHIND COVER 90% OF THE TIME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. OK, now that this is said, I shall begin with my full-review of the game. First off, I would like to point out that I have played both F.E.A.R and F.E.A.R 2 and had a blast of a time while playing them. I really loved the style of the games, and I would say that F.E.A.R. 1 is the best out of the entire series.Now onto F.E.A.R 3 …The game starts with some nice cut-scenes that manage to get me all hyped up to play another F.E.A.R.  game. As soon as these cut-scenes end I get the mission to escape from a prison. At that point I could already tell that the game has a different feel to it, like it wasn’t as dark as the previous games.  But I didn’t care about that and continue playing. So after walking out of my prison cell the game starts explaining the controls and after killing a guard I get my first gun.  Now I am ready to once again become a bad 4ss MOF0 and bust some caps, or so I thought…NOPE NOPE NOPE.jpeg; As soon as the action starts and I end up in my first shootout the game explains that you need to use Q to hide.  Now.. hiding isn’t that bad I mean it’s logical to hide to avoid ending up like Swiss cheese.  But this game brings it to a whole new level, the being a little p_ssy level.  The map is obviously designed so you have to hide behind every other f_cking box. And as soon as you get shot, you lose an unknown amount of health and you can simply regenerate it by hiding for 5 f_cking seconds.  So where is the challenge to managing your health by using the med kits like in the previous games?  And why are we hiding all the f_cking time, point man used to be a bad 4ss.  OK this is also the moment I start to feel like the game wasn’t developed for the PC and is actually a cheap port. So even with all of that going on I continue my escape from prison whilst encountering several shootouts and getting annoyed about the whole continuously hiding behind boxes and having the unnatural feeling of playing a bad port.  This goes on for a while and I finally decide that this game is a piece of sh!t.. and I got better games to play.So how did the fear series end up with this piece of sh!t? It’s because this game wasn’t even developed by the same company that developed the initial fear games.  NOPE not developed by Monolith but by Day 1 Studios. Anyhow thank the seven gods that I bought this game in a steam sale and did not have to pay full price. Because after just about 15 minutes of play time I decided it was a piece of sh_t and uninstalled the game. And I didn’t even get to die once.. So I guess you are practically immortal in this game as long as you hide behind boxes.			"

												As an FPS, it's decent. As a F.E.A.R. game, it's garbage. The atmospheric tension and spookiness of the first game is completely gone, favoring more traditional jump and grotesque scares. The long and short of it? The game isn't scary in the slightest. If you're looking for a co-op FPS at a decent price, I'm sure you could get something out of this. If you're a fan of the FEAR series and you're looking for more of what made the first game great, you will be disappointed.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a FPS game that has more action and less horror than the previous F.E.A.R. games. The main campaign can be played solo or co-op and you can choose between 2 different characters, each with their own unique abilities. The main campaign is pretty short (less than 10 hours), but you can replay it as a different character. There are also additional Co-op and VS modes that can add hours of gameplay.Overall, I give F.E.A.R. 3 a rating of 7.5/10.			"

												This game is really fun in co-op. Fun to play as Fettel or Pointman, each with their own specific powers. The horror is mostly gone from the previous games and it is more Call Of Duty like, with regenerating health. So this game is maybe not for everyone. But there's a lot of fun to be had getting all challenges and high scores on each interval done. Raking up all the specific kills with each gun, or kills after mantling an object etc.For those that only play it once for story it may feel disappointing but there's a lot of replayability playing as Fettel, or solo/co-op. All F.E.A.R. games have been amazing in my opinion.			"

												What to say about this game... it's pretty and all that, but it's rather disappointing. It's nowhere near as memorable as the previous game in the series. The campaign story is confusing and uninteresting. Scary events aren't really scary. There's co-op mode around this time though, which helps. There's also four different multiplayer modes, which I haven't played much, but they feel slapped on. I'd say they are okay, but nothing more. I'm not sure what else to say. Not a particularly good game, but an ok co-op shooter. I'm leaning more towards the negative side than the positive side, so it's a thumbs down from me. Consider getting it if it's cheap.			"

												This game showed me true horror - because someone incompetent inheriting a great franchise and turning it into... THIS, now that's what I call terror.Nothing to do with F.E.A.R. series. It's a budget-tier mix of CoD and Painkiller. No atmosphere, no suspense, 2 weapons limit, so corridor-ish it's not even funny. Shooting itself was always a strong point of F.E.A.R., here it feels bland and unsatisfying. There's the autoregen instead of hitpoints, which I could tolerate if this wasn't supposed to be a horror game. Also someone thought it needs some Cool&Hip (tm) pseudo RPG elements, so you gain points for stuff like picking up ammo and recieve bonuses, i.e. a bigger ammo limit.I really warn you against this game, there are indie shooters much better than this ""blockbuster"".

												Pure and utter garbage.F.E.A.R 3 Ultima Ascension of the FEAR franchise. After but 5 minutes the plot collapses in on itself and twists and turns a previous tactical shooter into a CoD clone for 10 year olds. The Gameplay is average. Gone is still the uber shotgun from FEAR 1 and so is the enemy AI. The game is so easy on next to hardest difficulty Fearless, and the hardest one being Insane which is locked until you finish the game at least once. No effort was required of me as I blasted enemies to dust and only died when I was either stupid or engaged in honorable melee with the enemy.The levels are boring and repetitive, and the level transition will leave you confused. At an early point in the game, you are trying to flee the city, and get shot down while doing so, and after crashing you immediately return to the city. What!? Oh, also, Point Man crashes, explodes and falls from mortal heights and still survives, It's a cliché nowadays but it's still complete garbage to look at. Levels consists of open areas with enemies spawning around a small map. Kill enemies, proceed through a corridor to the next big area, and repeat. It's also that annoying kind of map that won't allow you to jump over things the devs don't want you to jump over! Want to jump over this couch? Can't do that. Want to crouch under this railing? Can't do that. But you can only crouch under the only thing that will continue the on rail shooting segments. The pacing is ♥♥♥♥ as well, there is no time for you to breath out between battles, no puzzles of any kind exists other then, press button, open door kind. Not like you'll ever get worked up playing this PoS since the scary/creepy parts are all but gone. If this game didn't have FEAR in the name I would never have associated it with the series att all.Story collapsed in on itself after about 5 minutes. Why answer questions like: Where are we? Why am I here? What am I suppose to do? Point Man apparently has character now, which is funny since he's a silent MP, so It's stupid. Also Fettel now apparently thinks family is super important and now wants to help you/you help him to get you to mother. Why is he there? Is another question I asked myself since you did put a bullet in his head in the first game. And now he is ghost, or, something, but still needs to walk through doors. I don't care anymore, why should I when the devs didn't care either. Also dead characters are alive as well that died in FEAR Extraction Point expansion for the first game but I guess, RETCON! Didn't happen, character is alive now, hurray! Or the expansion simply weren't canon, but FEAR 2's dlc was! Cuz Fettel.Kuk fitt spel. One of the worst sequels I've played, it fails on every level, and It's not even fun on a terribad level. Just bad all around and makes you sad that It's a part of a far greater series.			"

												Just beat F.E.A.R. 3, making me beat every single F.E.A.R. game, okay review time, this game, while not bad, was good in aspects and bad at everything else. let alone, as a fan of the series, this game was kinda a let down too me. I enjoyed the fast pace combat, but it took out all stragity that made the first and second games a hard deal, you actual had to plan out your combat route, know when to use slow-mo, and keep ur wits on guard, Playing as paxton can be pretty fun aswell, as it's a diffrent kinda play to the Series. slo-mo in F.E.A.R. 3 had sometimes almost no propose because by time u use it, its gone already, F.E.A.R. 3 compared to the others had minimum to no horror aspect, no dark atmosphere, and quite frankly, the story line was poor and kinda boring. they tried to escalate the matter of the situation, without telling us why it's happening. Taking out the replica forces made NO sense to me, and they never Evan explain why there not there, i mean they were in 2, and still being controlled, so why not in 3, and why the ♥♥♥♥ is point man in captivity when at the end of F.E.A.R. 1 he escaped with his team. F.E.A.R. 3 has beautiful graphics, smooth game play, brutal combat, and an interesting Ranking system. As for story line, atmosphere, tone, and excitability, it was a huge let down, i have to say by far F.E.A.R. 2 was the best in the series. F.E.A.R. 3 just feels more like call of duty when it trys to be creepy. this is a great stand alone game, esp for FPS fans, but for personal fans of the F.E.A.R. Series as a whole, this is just a disappointment. hopefully, if they make another game, they will try to make it less ""Call of dutyish"" and return to the Dark, disturbing, amazing storyline that F.E.A.R. use to be. What they gained in making fast paced action game play, made it less horror, and less stragidy and more just shoot shoot shoot. and where are my martial arts melee attacks that were so fun to pull off. like i said though, good standalone game, but with the F.E.A.R. logo, its a let downStandalone game: 7/10F.E.A.R.

												Before you will sit down at game, it is necessary to reconcile to one fact: name F.E.A.R. for the game Day 1 Studios — not a native name, and a pseudonym. Others surname entered in the passport by adoptive parents — publishers that it was simpler to push the offspring in society. That F.E.A.R. from which blood ran cold six years ago, didn't return. Day 1 Studios so were fond of idea ""to refresh"" a series that as a result made absolutely independent game. Well or brought to logical end the transformation which has begun still in the second part unique in own way a horror in a banal shooter ""with elements"". The idea to rely on a multiplayer as a whole and cooperative in particular seemed to us rotten from the moment of the game announcement — it all the same that to turn Silent Hill into a network shooter. F.E.A.R. always I was famous for a single with its oppressive, frightening atmosphere. Single where the player remained in private with the fears where in each dark corner the monster seemed and the finger itself involuntarily reaped on a ♥♥♥♥ in response to the creaked floor. (This my opinion and it can not coincide with yours).			"

												I always heard bad things about F.E.A.R. 3 and the first few hours of me playing it gave me all I need to make my own opinion about the game. If you're a fan of the original F.E.A.R. you turn back right now, otherwise you'll most likely loose your admiration for this franchise. To be honest I didn't really liked F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin as much as I liked the first F.E.A.R. game and it's expansions, it did have the F.E.A.R. feel to it but for me it wasn't as good as the original. But now, F.E.A.R. 3 is where they've messed up everything, everything I liked about the previous games was gone. First, there's no medkits or reflex boosts on the game because you now have regenerating health and you unlock levels, and yes I do mean actual ingame levels, by scoring points, I feel like they tried making F.E.A.R. 3 a kinda of score attack game but making it similar to modern first person shooters. So, if there's no medkits and reflex boosts there's not that much of incentive to go through each level exploring and trying to find hidden stuff to make your life easier... but then again they've changed that, most of the hidden stuff that you can now find in F.E.A.R. 3 are corpses which you can ""connect to"" and gain points by doing so and also finding some weird little statues that I also believe that give you points. Everytime you level up you can gain an increase to HP, increased time that you can use your slow time and increased ammo for each gun. I pretty much hate when developers nowadays make first person shooters with regenerating health because that basicly just means that everytime you're on low health you just need to get behind a wall and wait for your health to regenerate which I find to be somewhat, dumb. And now the guns. I thought that the shooting from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin was easier than the original F.E.A.R. but hell did they make it Call of Duty style on F.E.A.R. 3, you can pretty much just spray and pray with any gun without aiming down sights and you'll still get the kills even in long range with a shotgun, I realize that this might be appealing to some people out there but for a guy like me who likes guns to have a real kick to them and feel authentic when shooting and having the need to compensate recoil and spray patterns I find this Call of Duty style of gun handling to be really frustrating, so what's a first person shooter with shooting that people don't like?, yeah. And now, the story, maybe it was just me but I had the feeling during the whole game that the game was trying to shove you the story all the time, I didn't really get much of it and also they did it in kind of a weird way. I think F.E.A.R. 3 was designed as a co-op game because everytime there's a cutscene, and yes there's now cutscenes on a F.E.A.R. game, it's always the two brothers talking and by the time it ends you have the feeling that you're supposed to start a mission with you and your brother fighting the ""bad guys"" but no, there's just one of you there, and I find that to be rather weird because a few seconds ago there were two people there, couldn't they just put the other brother as an AI companion? One thing I certainly have to mention is that the enemy AI, mainly the soldiers is pretty well made, everytime you try to get behind cover they try to flank you while others distract you by providing supressive fire and enemies usually always go looking for cover as soon as they spot you and they even flip furniture in order to get cover behind it. The last thing I really hated about F.E.A.R. 3 and I'm sure many people will agree with me on this, is that the game despite looking pretty damn good it isn't scary at all, the F.E.A.R. franchise was supposed to be abunch of scary first person shooters with some paranormal elements and that ocurred in the previous game but in this one it kinda turned into a demonic invasion, creatures spawning from the walls through some kind of portals and at the end nothing pretty much made any sense to me, for me F.E.A.R. 3 looked more like fighting a demonic invasion other than fighting horror  and Alma and they pretty much failed on the scary and tense component from the previous games. The first F.E.A.R. was very tense and spooky, F.E.A.R. 2 was not that much but it still had some tense sections and some ocasional jumpscares while F.E.A.R. 3 is just a run and gun shooter. As you can clearly see I did not liked F.E.A.R. 3 at all, it is certainly a good game but not what I expected from a F.E.A.R. game. If you're a fan of the F.E.A.R. franchise I advise you not to play this or only playing it if you're curious about the story but if you haven't played any of the F.E.A.R. games you might enjoy your time with this one, I don't know honestly. Personally I don't recommend this one.			"

												I have always been an avid fan of the FEAR franchise. Fear 3 is the 3rd and probably most unique installment of this franchise. I am wondering if this should be considered the last one or WB is planning to publish another episode sometime in the near future.In Fear 2 we skipped the story of the good old Point Man, our protagonist from the 1st episode, and now we pick up his tale from where we were left off. Paxton also returns and this gives a game a unique experience as coop campaign is now available. Paxton can jump into enemies and take over them for a short period of time. On his own he is rather weak but once you possess a soldier you can use his weapons and should you be eliminated you can quickly find another host.Sequences with the Mech also return and they are more devastating than ever. There are more monsters now so it seems the developers upped the horror-like nature of the game a bit. Single player is relatively long and with the 2nd protagonist (Paxton) you have replayability here which is good news. The field where Fear 3 really shines is multiplayer. There are various game modes out there that are interesting and challenging, too. In F**king Run, for example, you are running away from a wall that means instant death once it reaches you. While running away you also need to eliminate the oncoming waves of enemies and cooperation is a must as if anybody from your team is caught by the wall that's game over for the entire group. I liked Fear 3. For me the best is the 2nd episode in this trilogy but the 3rd installment also offered an exciting action-horror experience and while I do not really favour the approach of releasing more and more sequels for a game I would be delighted to play a possible 4th episode.

												Initially I was severly disappointed. Now that I have finished the game I find that I enjoyed it but it could have been so much more. This should have been an awesome trilogy ending game. Instead it was an average FPS with a little paranormal thrown in riding on the coat tails of past titles of the same series.			"

												So after having played every fear game back to back I have to say that this game is an exterme let down. The story is disjointed, sloppy, and unintresting compared to the other fear games while also lacking the atmosphere that the previous games had. The only positive thing about this game is that it looks decent and the controls aren't bad other than that it's a generic FPS with nothing going for it.			"

												Fast, action packed with really nice graphics - what more can you want.Underrated and over criticised - in my experiencew quite a few reviews are just unfair, particularly where graphics, performance and gameplay are concerned.Im on Windows 10 and it runs flawlessly in 4K, looks really nice, as an example the sunset  coming through a window and displayed on a wall. But ive got a good TV and ive got the settings configured to make it look nice.Yeh its not not just your GPU and the game, set your TV to complement the graphics.I dont know why the AI gets dumped on so much - seems pretty good to me - enemies take cover most of the time and run around trying to outflank you, i aint come across any AI better than that and i aint come across any AI that was intelligent, cos its AI, its a computer.And if a game aint the same as one you played 10 years ago you gotta get over it - it aint fair on the Devs.Im loving the action and the sweet, fast responsive controls make it really exciting, your hit you dash - recover - you melee after creeping up on your foe - then theres one behind you pumping a shotgun and you gotta get away again - superb.Plus theres some good challenges.The camera - always a critical thing for me is near perfect and the 360 controller handles it great.Could have done with a map window though.Well worth the money.I believe in reviewing games in the first couple of hours, cause im a game player, i love video games, when i find one i wanna play i can play excessively till im knackered and irritated, it aint fair on the Devs to review a game when ive overplayed it.Enjoy.

												I have played the F.E.A.R. trilogy on the Xbox 360, as well as the PC. (However I have yet to finish this one yet on the PC). So here is how I feel about this game.As a shooters, is a fun game. The gun mechanics feel nice. The guns themselves feel nice. Hell, if you have a good PC running this at max settings, they look gorgeous. And I like the co-op-slash-competitive mode this game does. Whoever gets the highest score, becomes the ""favorite"" son to Alma. And you also level up in this game which increase stuff like ammo capacity, slo-mo, and whatever else.However, as a F.E.A.R. game, it is terrible. And that's why I don't recommend this for F.E.A.R. fans. F.E.A.R. 3 is the weakest installment of the series, lacking everything that made the first two great. Even F.E.A.R. 2, however others feel about it, was still faithful to the first one than this. The developers have essentionally made this as Call of Duty: Psychic Warfare.First, you are now relying on auto regen for your, now apparently low health bar. You used to be tough in previous installments, and need to find health kits to restore your health. Which was one of the things I have liked about this series. Now you can't even step out of cover without needing to GET BACK INTO cover after getting hit with a few bullets. (I'm exaggerating here, but the point is, they have basically nerfed your HP.)(Edit: I want to add really quick that I am playing this on normal difficutly. In case you're wondering if I was playing it in hard mode.)Secondly, the fear isn't there anymore. The game used to get you spooked with it's atmosphere. As supposed to the cheap jump scares studios typically do. (Which, there are some in previous installments, but they weren't heavily reliant.) Oh yeah, speaking of which, this one doesn't even have that. The atmosphere is gone. Now is just another generic first person shooter.Now, in case you're thinking, ""But what about the slo-mo? F.E.A.R. is known for that?"" So were Max Payne and True Crime. Doesn't mean anything if the game itself is still bad, does it? Yeah, it's there, but it's not like it saved this game.So overall, this is a disappointing installment. And this is after I said that it's a fun game. Perhaps if this was a different game, like say, a sequel to Blacklight, (Not counting Blacklight: Retribution) I could have given this a more positive review. Because it is a fun shooter. Generic or otherwise.If you're still thinking about buying this to see for yourself, I say wait for a steam sale, or, if you still have an Xbox 360 or PS3, see if you can find a copy for cheap. They should be around $10 or less by now.			"

												Pretty much the worst game in the series. F.E.A.R. has totally lost it, so prepare to get involved into a terrible story combined with awful gameplay and spiced up with ugly visuals. Unfortunately, there's no chance to get some fun from co-op either, for it's all about trying to make it through the hordes of stupid enemies without any sensible reason.I'd really like to have anything good to say about the triquel, and I actually liked the first two games, but honestly - F.E.A.R. 3 is the most ridiculous way to end the storyline ever imaginable.

												The weakest link of the F.E.A.R series. This is more like an action shooter than a horror shooter, the co-op is fun and takes about 3 or so hours. I'd advise you to get F.E.A.R 1 or 2, or even both instead of this. If you're a hardcore fan and want to see the finale, it MIGHT be worth getting.			"

About The Games:The F.E.A.R franchise has always been & always will be a game about ""The Paranormal"" expect a lot of Ghosts in each of the games more so in F.E.A.R 1 & 2. That generally has a solid story line and to be expected in a game about the paranormal plenty of gore & jump scares THESE ARE NOT BAD THINGS!F.E.A.R had you playing in the shoes of an unknown solider for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon Team"" or F.E.A.R for short, you went in and you were tasked to capture a test subject who was designed to control these ""Super Soldiers"" for a war. The project was a success except things went wrong & the leader went nutso & so you're here to clean up the mess.F.E.A.R 2 had you playing the role of another solider for the ""First Encounter Assault Recon"" who was in another squad & was deployed just before the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan in the first game, you were tasked to find & capture a doctor who was working on the test subject & then you are to eliminate the test subject & attempt to shut down project Origin by eliminate the main ""Ghost"" who was causing all the mayhem around the city, unfortunatly things don't pan out so well & then ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan & of course once more you're trying to battle your way out of the storm.F.E.A.R 3 on the other hand has you go back into the shoes of the ""Unknown Soldier"" from F.E.A.R 1 along with the ghost of your brother Paxton Fettle who was the test subject they were developing to control the ""Super Soldiers"" & use it for the war. The story fell really flat here & it certainly wasn't as much of an enjoyable game as the first 2 were.The Review:F.E.A.R 3 offers VERY minimal satisfaction for returning fans of the original games or for Single Player gamers as it's lost everything that made the first 2 F.E.A.R games great & on edge spooky, there's very little in the way of scary scenes & there's certainly not a solid story line here as there were more with F.E.A.R 1 & F.E.A.R 2.What F.E.A.R 3 does offers us is a very solid CO-OP experience with friends, there's some very EXCELLENT game modes, and Story is a blast to play with a partner to add some excellent gameplay mechanics, Story CO-OP:1 thing F.E.A.R 3 got right was the CO-OP experience you get while playing Story. 1 Player plays as a Ghost that can use all kinds of ghostly powers & telekenetics to dispatch of the foes, this includes: Possession of Enemies to use as stealth bait (Can flank enemies & then shoot them in the back so long as you don't fire at them first or get spotted body snatching) Telekenetic Smashes Ghostly Blasts, etcWhile the other player uses Firearms & Slow Motion reflexes to eleminate his foes as the F.E.A.R opperative. Each player gets to do different things in order to help you progress in the story so you're constantly helping each other out in order to get to the next section, this improves the games experience so i recommend playing CO-OP with a friend in order to get the most out of your game experience.CO-OP Multiplayer Modes:Moving onto the CO-OP Multiplayer experience we get some really fun CO-OP Modes such as: ♥♥♥♥ing RUN!,This game mode is a fun & fresh addition to bring something new & creative to a multiplayer game mode, it's kind of like a Death Run, you're given about 30 seconds to get a head start before something dark begins chasing you from behind & if you fall too far behind or stop too long at sections for a shootout with the pursueing enemies you'll get wiped out & then you're stuck watching to see if your team can survive. (Sounds boring on paper but once you get into a game, it becomes suspenceful & interesting to see if you're fast enough to escape). Survival Mode:This game mode is a classic game mode, survive the waves of enemies for as long as you can & try to best your friends or help them out & get the best top score together. (There's nothing quite like a good team building experience for me, i just enjoy the good old Survival)Multiplayer Modes:Now onto the Multiplayer Modes here's nothing new we have our usual game modes such as: Deathmatch Last Man StandNothing ground breaking or exciting here, Multiplayer is pretty well dead & you may or may not find the occasional server here or there. I recommend just playing with friends who may also enjoy the CO-OP experience or maybe a friendly Deathmatch with a group of friends.The Verdict:Finally it all boils down to my final conclusion of this game & sad to say that it's not a good one.I'll admit that it's impossible to say i did not have any fun in this game because i did have some fun, it's just not a game to play for it's Story or for the Single Player experience. This game thrives on it's obviously designed CO-OP experience that the developers had planned from the moment they started making F.E.A.R 3.This game is also very obviously ported from a Console so expect some very average controls for the PC & also very average Graphics.If you're looking for a more satisfying Single Player or Horror experience i very, VERY, whole heartedly suggest you look at F.E.A.R 1 or F.E.A.R 2 or even both of these games, this is because they are more enjoyable for the Single Player experience & for the Gameplay, Story & on edge Horror of the Single Player mode that'll keep you from rounding the next corner for a while.The Rating:This game receives a 4/10.  This is because of a few different factors  It has a very poor Story & for a game that started off so well in this department it's just not justifyable, it seems like the Developers just said after F.E.A.R 2 released ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ the story let's just slap together the final installment & hope to god somebody buys it"" Single Player has lost all meaning now, there's no scary scenes or suspenceful moments, it's all about the gun play & it's very baddly played, you're going to much more enjoy the Campaign with a friend simply because of that unique and amazing gameplay experience you get from playing as or with a Ghosly helper. Horror is almost non-existant anymore, this franchise started off SOOOOO thick with spooky and scary elements & it really made me want to stop playing at certain times because of the feeling i got everytime i saw a shadow or light flicker on the corner of the screen or when a ghost popped out behind a wall and started whispering creepy ♥♥♥♥ to me. Focus on run & gun play, the final nail in the coffin if not just because they removed what made the game so unique and scary was fear of the unknown, now just leaves fear of the ""Oh what do i shoot next"", there's no longer any great moments of anticipation of when will the next ghost decide to show itself or oh god when does the next shootout happen, now it's just shootout, after shootout, after shootout, and it really never stops.And with all this stuff out of the way i need to ask myself the question. ""Do i recommend this to anyone else?""Do I Recommend This Game?:This would have to be a NO! I don't recommend this to anybody who loved the first 2 games of the franchise & i certainly don't recommend it to people who love horror, BUT! I can however recommend this game only to those who seek a unique and quite fun CO-OP experience with friends, i can only recommend it for these people.Further Reading:Check out my Review on F.E.A.R 2: Project Origin: http://steamcommunity.com/id/Paddles01/recommended/16450/ "

												F.3.A.R. An interesting concept gone completely horribly wrong. Following some what the events of F.E.A.R. 2 you can play as either the Point Man or Paxton Fettel, making for an interesting Co-Op experience compared to recent titles. The game play can be quite entertaining, however offering very little replay value. Also the story writing goes further down the trash bin, personally letting me down as I am a die hard fan of the original F.E.A.R. and admittedly enjoyed F.E.A.R. 2. However taking a thriller/shooter and casualizing the game play to CoD style truly took the games identity away. I have lost all hope of this game coming back to its original stature. Do NOT purchase this title, do not recommend. Also looking at the banners for each title should show how the quality was given up each title to where it stands today.			"

[Edit]We managed to find solution to the coop issue. It seems that you and host needs to stay idle for a while in lobby and in beginning of the game in order to avoid being disconnected all of sudden. We spent 5 minutes talking at lobby and 5 minutes just standing at the beginning of a level. When we finally started to play, we managed to play several levels forward without any issues.Pros:* Coop was fun (when it works) and adds a lot to the game.* Possessing enemies were super fun. Friend in a bad spot? Posess an enemy from behind the enemy line and backstab everyone.Cons:* Scoring system sucks. Fettel will always lead in scores in normal game play (shared psychic links). Game endings are also tied to the score system. Should one of the brothers have more points than the other, it will cause good or bad ending.* The game is not scary. Game does not follow the original fear at all.* Controls are.. awkward. The game tries to have contextual controls, but fails in it. For example I need own keys for shooting while on feet or in vehicle.* The game has this typical AAA-game feeling. There is just no depth to it. There is no love for this game.I'm not going to change my rating for this game. We wasted too much time on the problems and it left a bad taste in mouth.[Original]I'm going to give thumbs down, as I was really looking to play this as a coop/multiplayer game.Buy only for the single player experience. The coop and multiplayer modes disconnect frequently from the host or kicks clients, hosting or not. Tried with multiple hosts with each having an excellent internet connection speeds. All required ports open. With and without a firewall. It just does not work.A real shame. The game is interesting, controls are working, the game is responsive, but everything is ruined by frequent disconnect issue.			"

												Okay, I am going to get right into this and say that F.E.A.R. 3 is a BAD game, but it is only a BAD game to people who have played the other games. If you've played the other F.E.A.R. games, you understand why this game is the bane of our existance, but, if not, I shall explain it to you. Alright, F.E.A.R. and F.E.A.R. 2: Project origin were both made by the same company and in the same style. They had large maps that you could get lost in and unnerving environments. Monolith was NOT afraid to hit you with a scare that comes across as mild, though is nothing compaired to the rest of the game, but it get's you anyway, probably even more than the really big scares. It was the small things that kept people on edge for the duration of your play time. The characters were well thought out and they were in no way scared to be brutal. They slapped you with a psychic canibal clone commander from the start who blew through innocent men and woman to get to the people who tortured and killed his mother who was forced into carrying to children via clone fetus implant. Yeah... Pretty sick stuff. The Problem with F.E.A.R. 3, however, was, not only the fact that the developer who made it KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT HORROR, but also the fact that it was so pointless and soul-crushing that it totally went in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION of what the original creators wanted. Day 1 RUINED F.E.A.R. by turning it into a light, CHEAP, co-op, FPS hell. They almost entirely removed the horror aspect of the game and handed us one of the biggest loads of trash. The problems are as follows. 1. Going by the story line of the previous games, the ending was anti-climactic and a serious let down.2. The horror aspect it an attempt to use wierd sounds and over-cooked map textures to scare people as well as cheap jumpscares that would hardly startle a small infant.3. They changed the characters to a fault. The two biggest examples being the Characters Paxton Fettel and Point Man. Paxton had always been propper and rightfully creepy simply by the way he delivered his lines and their context. He now speaks in partial slang and comes across more annoying with his lines than his former eree. Point Man was originally personality-less, intended to be that way by the company that was implimenting his make-shift powers. They didn't want him to have a personality. This also helped the immersion of the game by allowing the player to impliment themselves onto the character. NOW, Point Man has a very angry and cliche silent-protagonist role, comming across as an overused-""badass"" steriotype. 4. CUTSCENES. The other games had little to no cutscenes. What few they had were all in first person and allowed the player some range of head movement. In F.E.A.R. 3, however, the cutscenes are full on thirdperson with no choice, no point, and do little to advance the story. If anything, they just annoy the player. (Paxton's cheesy jokes don't help any.) This also breaks the immersion charm that the F.E.A.R. games were known for. 5. The story is dead. Yes, they continue on from the last game involving Alma's third child, but hardly any of the game is even about that. You play a ""must save the princess"" sort of game with the Character Jin sun-qwan who can't seem to keep away from trouble, but was a total badass in the other games. She didn't need to be saved and was a good ally. In this game, she even has the gall to be annoyingly bossy, something I quite detest, especially seeing as her voice actor get's very ear-clenching after level two. They also make sure to kill off the Protagonist from F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin in an unessisarily brutal way and give him a voice, though he had none in his own game (Though I wonder HOW IN THE HELL THIS GAME GOT AHOLD OF ROBIN ATKIN DOWNS.) 6. They play Alma as a completely innocent little girl, running from the tyrant that was her father. Alma was, in no way, innocent. She was an evil, demonic spirit who killed many to get what she wanted and even mind-♥♥♥♥♥ her youngest son to get it, making HIM kill many people as well at age 10 and again at age 30. Another thing to note is that Harlon Wade did some bad things, but, as it is shown in F.E.A.R. 2, was reluctant to do said things to Alma, but did because he thought they were for the better. He certainly loved Alma, though she did kill him, and was clouded in judgement by those of the Armacham corperation. A spirirt such as his could not have come back as a demon, let a long one with so much power over the surviving family. 7. Inconsistantcy. Paxton's role in this game, on its own, is an inconsistancy. Not only is he a ghost, which he shouldn't be due to him gaining a new body off of a clone in the DLC for F.E.A.R. 2, Reborn, but he seems to like becoming visible and invisible to anyone but Point Man at any given time. What I mean by this is: During the cutscenes, the game shows that Paxton is totally invisible to anyone but his brother, but, in combat and totally BAD times, he is visible to the world and can be harmed by bullets, though in some scenes it is depicted that bullets have no effect on him, which leads no another problem when, in Point Man's ending, he stops Fettel by shooting him. I know what they were trying to do in paying  respect to the first game, but with the way they loused it all up, it just doesn't work. 8. (Finally) The endings. In Point Man's ending, he shoots Paxton in the head, delivers Alma's baby, then leaves with it. (I've already explained the two problems with this ending.) and In Paxton's ending, he possesses his brother, delivers the baby, then eats his own mother, claiming it'll give him the power to take over the world, which, isn't just cliche, but NEVER HIS GOAL IN THE FIRST PLACE. Paxton's goal was always to avenge his mother and serve her. Now he wants world domination. What in the... Never mind... I digress...ALSO, if you want a bonus: THE FINAL BOSS IS SO EASY THAT YOU'D HAVE TO BE BRAIN DEAD WITH YOUR NON-FUNCTIONAL BRAIN REMOVED NOT TO BEAT IT THE FIRST TIME ON THE HIGHEST DIFFICULTY. I swear, it is as obvious as a five-foot black spider on a white bedroom wall and as liniar as the lines on a road.It has bad shotguns, too. They are 50% glass. That isn't a safe thing.			"

												As a fan of the first two FEAR games, I was pretty disappointed with how this game turned out. It gave up a lot of the interesting design of the first two for a rather bland, run-of-the-mill first person shooter experience. Levels were reduced to little more than straight corridors with things to hide behind and seemed to drag on longer than they should have as enemies filled choke points. Most of the guns felt uninspired compaired to guns from the first two and the weapon limit (brought over from 2, which was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of that game) didnt help at all. The worst part though is the wasted opportunity of a second playable character in the form of Paxton Fettel. So many more interesting gameplay mechanics could have been introduced in his powers, but we only got a stun blast attack and the ability to posses someone, which is basically just like playing as Point Man. I only really played this to see the conclusion of the story, which wasn't that great really, so I cant really recommend this on any level. (single player wise anyway, never tried the multiplayer).

The gunplay was amazing everygun sounded the way it should. Descent challege and some badass guns. The graphics are descent colors are what you exspect from a horror shooter. This is not for you hardcore Survival horror shooters fans. Get the 1st fear or DOOM 3. The story is well.. Nothing really. It doesn't add much besides finishing off the series all be it a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way. The sound design is hit or miss with the voices of allies and monsters or what ever is shooting at you.

												At first you think this game is an all-round progression from FEAR 2. Everything seems mechanically better, graphics and realism have both stepped up a notch. It soon becomes apparent, though,  that the story really is getting old - it just lacks mystery and suspense. To make matters worse, the game seems to have completely missed the mark on the horror side. It tries to scare, but just doesn't. Towards the end of the game you start to get tired of boring story sequences interrupting the action! So what are you left with? Well, a good urban warfare shooter, albeit a little short.  It still comes highly recommended, but I'm afraid that if you have expectations for this game being a ""horror"", you will feel let down. It's still one of the few true coop games around, and the coop is a great deal of fun, so it deserves recommendation on that fact alone. Just don't pay too much for it!			"

Quick Bit- While having the most fully realized combat of the series and an interesting asymmetrical twist with the co-op gameplay, it falls extremely short due to the poor execution of the campaign with both co-op and solo, and the dead-on-arrival multiplayer.Extra Bit- I love this series, but thankfully the ire it wrought has long since become a dull ache, which allows me to convey a much more mellow expression for F.E.A.R. 3. It can be an enjoyable romp with a friend in co-op, and the odd, but ultimately interesting mechanics that makeup the dynamic brotherly duo of Point Man and Paxton Fettel can be oddly fun, even with the story being insultingly bad, and not enjoyed in an ironic way either.  The game still looks pretty decent, and the combat holds up solid, but of course you will literally need to bring a friend if you want to play co-op. The years have not been kind because like the multiplayer, co-op’s as dead as Alma is. Which is sad, because they did try, but not enough unfortunately to make it shine, and I don’t doubt WB had its gnarled claw in the mix as well. So the legacy ends with a thump, if not for F.E.A.R. Online making a final macabre display of the franchise, at least the name will be remembered for the superb enemy A.I.I will provide additional details, if requested for, in the comment section of the review.

												Immediately upon starting playing it I didn't really like where the story went. But then when I saw the cover-lock system and how you can't jump over certain obstacles unless you use cover first... Well I got fed up with that trash pretty quickly. Then there's the fact that there's no real reason to try avoiding taking damage. Take as much as you like as often as you like, as long as you don't die you're all good cause it regenerates in a couple seconds. I found myself running around out of cover knifing all my enemies cause it was faster and there was no reason not to.			"

												The orginal FEAR was a horror masterpeice but unfortuantly F3AR is more like a generic FPS with monsters, a game that would have been unquie had it been released back in the mid 2000's (around 2002-2005). The story is really bad and the gameplay is nothing unquie while it obviosuly is trying to force you to play Co-Op over an actual single player gamel. It lacks the . One should think of it less as a FEAR game and more of a Resident Evil 5 knock-off (which was a ""horror"" game devloped for the Call of Duty audince) complte with a Co-Op feature that was shoehorned in.

												The first question you have to assume is whether or not F.E.A.R 3 is better or worse than F.E.A.R 2. I really can't answer that because this game is just so... flagrant with it's mediocrity.F.E.A.R is a tragic series to me simply because of how it strayed so far from it's roots. The original was a great game with non-linear map design, great AI and a very noticeable influence from Hong Kong action movies and horror films. With this game... it just feels like the devs didn't care. Like they went into it knowing it was going to suck so they just went ""Eh ♥♥♥♥ it"" and designed it anyway.""Eh ♥♥♥♥ it"" seems to be a reaccuring philosophy with this game. It continues right from the end of the original game but is so stylistically different it's shocking. The Point Man now looks like a homeless Jesus figure (compared to the faceless balclava wearing professional of the original). At the same time they attempted to do more unique things like playing as your super natural brother Paxton Fettel, and the multiplayer has some unique game modes. But if the texture quality and 6 hour campaign don't put you off the mediocrity will. None of the new features feel like they need to be there. Bullet time is completely unnecessary because of the new cover mechanic, and the new cover mechanic is pointless because we already had bullet time. It's like a ♥♥♥♥ing Catch 22 and all I want is for this series to stop sucking.			"

												FEAR 3.... oh FEAR 3.... or as I like to call it ""Call of Duty: Spooky Warfare"". I know that it's usually not a good idea to write a review without finishing the game you're reviewing first but, I think we can make an exception for this 'game', for the record I got half way through. As with all the games in this series it combines (or atleast tries too) horror elements with actiony FPS elements. The horror elements in this game boil down to vague satanic references and zombies. The FPS elements is similar to the past games but the way it's done just doesn't feel like a FEAR game, except for one little tiny thing... regenerating health... I don't think I need to say anymore. The game still has slow motion like the past 2 games and is executed in much the same way. The Co-op system i wasn't able to test since noone I know has this game, can't really blame them, but I'm sure it's adequate. I don't know how the story to the FEAR trilogy ends, but I really don't care, the first game ended on a high note and I wish that's where the series ended aswell. Just a note the only reason I have this game is because it came with the WB Games humble bundle charity thing they did a few months prior to this writing, it came with the rest of the FEAR games along with the batman arkham games and some other stuff. Just please don't buy this game, if you want to play a FEAR game buy the first one it is, in my opinion and I'm sure many other, one of the best FPS games out there, this one being quite the opposite.

												Every time I play a bad game it pains me to write an honest review, but this game nearly gave me an aneurysm by how bad it was. You cannot call this a FEAR game, and I refuse to believe that this is part of the FEAR franchise.- The gunplay was horrible.- The AI made a box of nails look sentient.- The visuals were worse than a game from 2007, and it might as well have been from 2007.- The weapon design offended my most basic human rights.- The sound design reminded me of a chalkboard being scratched.I might be speaking from my experience in singleplayer, but I wouldn't wish a co-op playthrough on anyone else. Not even as a joke. Do yourself a favor by avoiding this at all costs; unless you're really desperate to finish FEAR's story.			"

This isn't what previous games in the franchise were, this isn't a horror game and it isn't as nearly as tactical as the previous games, but and this is a bit but, I had a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of fun. If this game simply wasn't called FEAR I can assure you it would have been received with much more positive reviews.I grew up with FPS games like FEAR, Half Life, Doom, Quake etc., I love corridor-ish FPS games, I don't mind them being linear, sure it's nice when they have more open levels and more than one approach to a given situation, but I don't really mind linearity as long as the gameplay is good. I love running forward and shooting stuff in games, sure it would have been nice to a true successor to FEAR, but I'm not going to let my fanboism be in the way of me enjoying this.PROS*Fun gunplay*Great with friends*Bloody and gory as hell*Action feels satisfying*Not scary, but definitely atmospheric*Two characters to play, very different too*The whole campaign can be played in co-op and in addition there are some bonus game modes*Visually appealing and should run even on weaker systems*Contrary to what most people say I found the AI to be pretty alrightCONS*For the most part linear (doesn't bother me)*Not that scary*Story went to ♥♥♥♥*CGI cutscenes are baaaaad*Voice acting is questionable*Can get repetitive if you play alone*The occasional invisible wallEDIT:*Ending is ♥♥♥♥*Really anticlimactic final intervalI had fun guys, I love FPS games, I didn't mind what most people dislike and both me and my friend had a lot of fun, we plan on finishing this together.

However, if you want a shooter that makes you feel like a badass, has a pretty interesting story, and has some of the sickest gameplay, this game is for you. Personally, I love the slo mo thing, you can feel like a badass, sprinting around a corner, going slomo, grabbing a shot gun and blasting peoples heads off. Oh, yeah, you can blow peoples heads off, so... definitely not for kids.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is another great addition to the F.E.A.R. franchise that incorporates a co-op mode of gameplay. F.E.A.R. 3 uses similar mechanics from the original and its sequel, but still offers a fun adventure although with less emphasis on the story and a shorter campaign. However, you can play as either Point Man or Paxton Fettel in a single playthrough in the campaign - each with their own unique abilities. F.E.A.R. 3, basically, is a great game for acheivement hunters since many of them are fun and not too challenging.			"

												While it fails to compare to the beautifully-crafted original, FEAR 3 is probably one of the most solid built shooters of this year. If you're looking for a game that'll treat you to a night of explosions, bloodshed and pretty-looking rifles, FEAR 3 should definately be considered your mate, especially if you've got a mate of your own to bring along with the cooperative experience it provides.Of course, I heartfully recommend trying out the first FEAR before you even think of touching this one. The original was a masterpiece of thrills and suspence second only to Half-life, and should be a part of your virtual or physical library if it isn't already.			"

												Finishing off the FEAR trilogy!Every time I see FEAR 3 on sale I see people bashing it as the worst in the series, but the meta score is actually not too bad 74/100. Unlike the first 2 FEAR games, FEAR 3 has one of those regenerating health systems where you just hide under cover for a few seconds and you recover back to full health. No need to scrounge for med kits or armor. Also, the game seems built around 2 player co-op, which I like in first person shooter games (when I have someone to play with).*Spoilers ahead*FEAR 3 takes place an unspecified amount of time after the events of FEAR 2. Alma is pregnant and getting ready to give birth, as a result her psychic power is tearing up the city (possibly the world). Again the main opposition is the private military contractor Armacham, who seems to have become 100x more powerful than they were in the first games. Even without their clone super soldiers from the first games, Armacham seems capable of overrunning and occupying entire cities with soldiers, aircraft, and power armor. You play the Point Man protagonist from the first FEAR game (the guy you play in FEAR 2 also shows up briefly) but this time you have an “imaginary” friend Paxton Fettel (Bad guy from the first game). Your primary goal this time around is to reach Alma before she gives birth and deal with her once and for all. Unfortunately for you, Alma’s psychic pain has summoned nightmare creatures and twisted the surviving civilian population into crazed psychos.Unlike the previous FEAR games, FEAR 3 is broken down into missions or “levels” with each mission giving you a point score at the end. You gain points by finding collectables, killing enemies, and completing “challenges.” The challenges are similar to the “Skill shots” in Bulletstorm, where it’s basically just using various methods of killing. For example, 2000 points for killing enemies with a specific weapon, or 1000 points for getting 25 headshots, or 2000 points for getting 3 backstabs. The points aren’t just for show, by the way. You “level up” when you gain enough points and each level gives you some kind of perk, such as +10% health or +bullet capacity. You can replay levels as many times as you want to “grind” for points. This means that the game will get easier over time as you replay it. You might notice that when you first start the game, it seems far more difficult than the previous ones, well this changes as you level up and get stronger. The regenerating health means you can charge groups of enemies and just duck for cover when your screen is almost completely red (near death). Healing is free unlike FEAR 1 and 2 which had limited med kits.As I mentioned earlier, the game is built with 2 player co-op in mind. At the end of each mission there is a ranking between the 2 players to see who scored highest in several categories. The game’s ending depends on which of the two characters “won” the most missions. Of course if you’re playing single player the character you’re playing (Fettel or Point Man) will “win” every level you complete. Point Man’s gameplay is the same as the previous games (standard shooter with Slow-Mo power), But Fettel is a psychic commander. This means he can possess enemies and use them to fight (he doesn’t have slow-mo). Every time he takes over a new body he gets the weapons of the possessed enemy, so you can’t hoard powerful weapons or grenades the way Point Man does. You can only hold 2 weapons now, unlike 3 weapons in FEAR 1 and 4 weapons in FEAR 2. Possession also means you won’t be able to use the awesome power armors because the possessed body won’t last long enough. Pros:+Excellent graphics and visuals. Large variety of weapons available.+Some cool new enemies, particular the Phase Commander and Phase Caster.+A lot of replay value. I just finished the game and immediately restarted as Fettel. +2 player co-op available. Also a bunch of various multiplayer game modes I haven’t tried.Cons:-The game is very short, about 6 hours to beat the first time. Replay is strongly encouraged though.-The story is weaker than the first FEAR games. There’re a lot of unnecessary “dream sequences” that don’t seem to add much. You just walk forward about 15 seconds with someone talking in voice over and it ends.-I get the feeling that the enemies are much “dumber” than FEAR 1 enemies. They tend to stick behind the same piece of cover and just pop their heads out to shoot from there.Overall I think the game is well worth playing for fans of First Person Shooters and people who want to see how the FEAR story ends. Once you finish a mission in single player, the Fettel character is unlocked so you can try playing him for that particular level. The way to see the Fettel game ending is by playing through the game a second time (or play the game in co-op and Fettel has the highest score every mission). One thing I noticed is that the game’s Steam achievements seem to be half for multiplayer, and not many people are playing the multiplayer. This isn’t surprising since the game has been out for a few years. I’ll probably only be able to get about 45% completion for the game achievements by myself. "

												Yes, is good. There's nothing really wrong with this game. It has funny gameplay and some good moments. The production values here are high as you can expect from the WB brand. I write this as a FEAR fan. I've played the whole FEAR 1 + exp. and FEAR 2 + dlc just before playing this one. And also yes, the story is weaker,  the locations doesn't make all the sense they should and the character of Alma is a side note. In return we get a more developed relationship between the brothers, although only the character of Fethel is developed as the Point Man is not very talkative, in one of the bad design desitions. You can expect this from another developer than Monolith. It's a shame they couldn't do this. FEAR was their saga. On a final note, if you liked the previous ones you will like this one, just don't start nitpicking. P.D.: The Mech level is awesome as always.			"

												BEFORE i start, like F.E.A.R. 2 THIS one still miss the typical FEAR feeling from the first game...BUT that doesnt make the game bad (even when the story is not THIS totaly awesome) Play as Pointman or as Fettle both of them have his own gameplay, Gunfight and SlowMo action with Pointman or Prey hunting superpowers with Fettle. (like in every F.E.A.R. the gun play is STILL AMAZING)But now to the best part... the COOP mode, maybe the BEST COOP GAME you can find (2 Player coop). Fight together or against each other (yeah while coop campaing). You can protect each other (no really Fettle can shield damage from Pointman) or share SlowMo and other powers, or go for score hunting and see who of you two are better and who got the ending.Only Played Multiplayer solo until now, but what i see i LIKED, even survival did F.E.A.R. 3 GREAT, better as many other games.Maybe not F.E.A.R. as we know it, but EVERY SINGLE MONEY WORTH.

												F.E.A.R. 3 is, of course, the point at which this (still very excellent) franchise attempted to turn into Left 4 Dead 1 and 2.  Despite my love for these latter games, I'm not convinced that this was the wisest of moves, but in order for ANY series to move on changes must inevitably be embraced; even the slightly more questionable ones.     I guess ""infected""-style dudes with explosives strapped to their torsos still fits in well enough with the F.E.A.R. ethos of gritty super-soldiering versus the supernatural...kinda...sorta...at a pinch.  As long as F.E.A.R. 4 doesn't have giant undead cyborg dudes with gattling guns for arms, we'll still be in the clear, one suspects... Verdict: 9.5/10 (hey, it still kicks major butt, even if things have been SLIGHTLY dumbed-down for the Michael Bay generation).			"

												Fettel was the original antagonist, and may have been a vampire.  He died at the end of FEAR, came back as a ghost in a non-canon expansion, and came back as a possessed Replica soldier in a FEAR 2 expansion.  In FEAR 3 Fettel is clearly a ghost and there are no Replica forces.  Go figure.  3/5  Fun for 2-player co-op if you catch it on sale.  For the single player, it's inferior to the first two and likely not worth your time.			"

												Ok. Let me start by saying I'm a HUGE fan of the first two games. They both bring something different to the table and they had all the atmosphere, scares, and visceral combat the franchise is known for. F3AR Is severly lacking the simplest way this is not a FEAR game. There is a new studio, a new engine - and entirely new writers. Let me start with some gameplay changes: The persistent weapon carry system is gone - there is now a 2 weapon limit that resets upon the start of each new chapter. Don't bother saving up and trading off a weapon for a fully filled rocket launcher unless you plan to use it, because It'll be gone at the end by the time the cutscenes come up. The health/armor system is gone and in place is a regenerating health system. This hurts the gameplay due to the fact that you can simply melee the majority of the jump mosters and sit healing before moving to the next trigger- it kills the adrenaline entirely. The classic replicant variants are gone in favor or new, completely arbitrary lore-breaking entities with poor voice acting and predictable movement. The classic FEAR A.I. is gone, and what they've implemented here is atrocious. Many times ""elite"" AI will sit in a single place ducking behind cover while I set up for the next headshot. The booster/reflex injector mechanic is gone in favor or hoping players will alter their play to ""score up"" and unlock the next level, which merely increases your grenade and slo-mo meter. The slo-mo is the weakest yet, and drains much too fast and takes obnoxiously long to refill... The problem with this is that the award/score system is fundamentally flawed with things like giving you points for fully draining your meter 3 times in a chapter. The game rewards you for time in cover, picking up ammo, finding pointless psychic links, picking up alma doll's (what?), getting headshots, consecutive kills without damage and so on. This would be all fine and dandy but the co-op quickly turns into PVP with the ending of the entire game dependant on who gets the highest score overall. The clever level design and setpieces of the first are instead shifted here with lackluster textured environments that are riddled with tacky cover points much similar to gears of war and other 3rd person titles. The cover system hardly needs to be utilized, as a crouch toggle behind cover works faster - BUT - it doesn't give you the score points for staying in cover X amount of seconds (what?). The linearity and uninspired level design pushes further by unrealistic structures with only a handful of recycled items scattered throughout - this kills the immersion entirely. The intel items from FEAR 1 and FEAR 2 are gone, and there is no extra easter-eggs or background text to dive into, its bare-bones aside from collectibles that increase your score. Every time you collect items, or complete challenges, you have a constantly annoying banner popping up telling you how much of a badass you are for getting 30 slo-mo kills, picking up ammo you would anyways, or doing anything you normally would in the flow of gameplay. Again, another immersion killer - but hey - we've gotten past that this game isn't the slightest bit scary. The game isn't even chilling, the highly-scripted scares are mostly FX and art based with no actual tension to worry about death. The mech combat returns from FEAR 2 with two different variations, but gone is the extra effects such as infared vision. The addition of other enemy types hardly brings anything to the background of the story with weird psycho's called occultists, and a constantly pestering psychic monster which is explained later in the game. The variety presented here makes no sense with the continuity of the franchise and it has nothing fresh to bring to the table. Most of the weapon variants return from previous games although poor - gone is the selective fire mode, so once you get the 3-burst rifle, your stuck with 3 burst. The ammo placements are laughable, with hidden area's having a single pistol on the ground when I'm loaded up with two rifles. This might be great, but with the 2 weapon limit, it kills the need to ever use lesser tiers of weapons, save for again - the award points. +25 kills with the pistol! woo! The story of this game completely tarnishes everything in the FEAR universe. It leaves no leaf unturned. From the voice acting, or the follow events with characters from FEAR 2 - its a slap in the face to all fans who have invested thought into this mysterious story. Every chapter ends, and sometimes begins with a poorly animated cutscene that drags this experience even lower. It leaves even veteran players confused and asking... why? In short this game was made to cash in on the co-op craze and call of duty style reward system that was huge at the time. It threw away all of the innovations of the first two titles to lure in console players and casual FPS fans that can't stand a game without a progression system. I couldn't recommend this game even as a free title. The campaign is short, and rewards you for completing chapters fast & under a set time, rather than relishing in the atmosphere and taking in the level design. The name Day 1 Studios tells you everything you need to know about this game, because It's apparent they didn't spend more than 1 day on any particular facet of this once-amazing franchise. Two-thumbs DOWN.			"

												I'll say right off the bat that I am indeed a fan of the original F.E.A.R. game, I do not like the second one very much, and I think this third game is a complete atrocity. I promise I tried to make this review short, but there's just so much to say... Sorry. Let us begin.I shall also mention that, at the time of writing this review, I have completed the game twice - once as Fettel, once as the Pointman. I have not yet played the coop, although I'm sure it'll be a grand old time.Right off the bat, it is glaringly obvious that this game is intended to be cooperative. Is that a bad thing? Well, not inherently, coop shooters have been around for a very long time and there are a couple examples of cooperative horror done right. That is to say, it is still very scary indeed in spite the fact that you are not alone. However, given the fact that F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't deserve to be called a horror game - I'll get to that later - that's a rather moot point. So, you play as either the Point Man from the first game, or his brother Fettel. The Pointman obviously has bullet time, and Fettel the ability to possess enemies for a given time. I will say that the Pointman plays how you expect him to, no problems there, and Fettel is quite fun to play as well with what seems - to me, anyway - to be a rather well fleshed-out special ability. However, at the same time, it seems well balanced to the Pointman's and the enemies around. Although it would not surprise me if it is commonplace to fight to get Fettel over the Pointman.Getting back on topic, coop in itself is not an issue really, but I do believe that it was one of the big downfalls of this game. I shall elaborate at the end of this review.The second glaringly obvious addition which made me very upset when I first saw it was the inclusion of a per-level point system, complete with goals to earn you additional points which are snarkily or punnily named. Well, that's not very F.E.A.R.-like at all, now is it? Or horror-game like in general, really. Why, you ask? Well, in terms of U.I. and game mechanics, having a score system - let alone one with a little status menu you can look at in-game (by pressing F1) - kinda breaks the player's immersion. Maybe a post-mission stats screen would be okay, but having nothing at all - like in the last two F.E.A.R. games - would be a lot better. Hell, in the first game, immersion was one of the biggest things they were striving for! Hence the inclusion of such details like a full shadow for the player, good arm models, and the ability to look down and actually see your legs and feet. Same with the stigma the first game had about never taking control away from the player when possible. There were probably two cutscenes in the first game, and most of the times control is taken away from you is a few seconds after something whacked you on your butt and your person gets up, and even then it's almost nice as a breather between the action. This game, on the other hand, of course has that point-system, and cutscenes galore; the things bookending every single level.Although to be honest, immersion is a bit of a moot point with the lack of actual scares in the game...Let's get onto the horror elements, now. Or rather the lack-there-of. This game is not a horror game at all, it is a first-person shooter through and through. What makes me say that? Well, there are only four or five times in the entire game where it even tries to scare you or creep you out - and those times a very shortlived and ineffective. Going in fully blind, I didn't even get that sense of dread and not wanting to keep moving forward like I did in the first game. It did make me jump once in fear, although that was when I was walking through a seemingly empty house and an enemy - unintentionally - snuck up behind me and started yelling while clawing at me. T'was unexpected, but I don't think most people would even get scared by that - assuming they were playing it like one should an FPS; keeping their head on a swivel. There really just seemed like a lack of effort with the scares, to be honest. While I am sure they did try their best with the scary moments that are present, keep in mind there's literally four or five of them.Alright, so because this game is an FPS now, let's cover that next.The short version? It's your standard console shooter. What do I mean by that? Well, we now have regenerating health, a full cover system, a two-weapon carry limit, a very standard assortment of weapons outside of two which are even then not too interesting. You read that right, regenerating health in a F.E.A.R. game. A cover system, too, which I thought at first was kinda nice and was a change I'd be indifferent too. However, about midway through the game on my first run, I had a realization; the cover system was killing the pace of the combat. Hell, there's practically no need for the Pointman's bullet time given this. Just play it like you would Gears of War or similar and you're good to go. There's no panic or amazing action like in the first game, where there was no cover, and you had to be quick and clever to take out a whole squad. Though this was helped by a normal - or nowadays 'old school' - health system which, of course, gave you one-hundred points of health, and up to ten medkits which healed you a certain amount at the press of a button. Here, even if you try and replicate the amazing shootouts you remember from the original F.E.A.R. - and even the second game to a lesser extent - you're going to die, because the very nature of the regenerating health system doesn't allow such things. Even if you pull it off, you're just handicapping yourself really.However, then I had a thought. I stopped thinking about it as a F.E.A.R. game. Suddenly things got a lot better. This isn't a lazy, poorly made cash-in in my eyes, it was just made with the wrong license. If this game didn't have the F.E.A.R. title attatched to it, I would like it a hellofalot more. There was effort put in, and it is certainly fun to play at points, and at it's worst it's just like any other standard MMS (Modern Military Shooter), and I'm sure it'll be a blast when I get around to coop. It just shouldn't have been a F.E.A.R. game.While this is byfar the worst game in the F.E.A.R. franchise, but it's not a bad game on its own. Unless you count modern shooters bad, and I don't disagree with you if you do.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a decent game on its own, but unfortunately I can't recommend it to anyone because the experience alone doesn't quite cut it like the first installment. The core gameplay design is based around cooperative play with a partner, however due to non-existent player base, it's almost impossible to play this game online. The campaign is very short and can be finished in less than 4 hours. Unlike the first installment, this game is not worth buying just for solo experience. Even if you do manage to find someone to play with, you would probably experience a lot of problems (like lag and desync) which stem from bad netcode and unoptimized load management. The only good thing about this game is its sophisticated A.I. which honestly, is one of the best I've played against. But again, it was the same case with F.E.A.R. 1 as well.Other than that, level design is uninspiring and story is boring. If you're looking for about 4 hours of solo content, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise, buy the first installment. F.E.A.R. 1 is one of the best games ever made.			"

We were surprised on how the storyline was short, which we wish there was a lot more to it. We liked the creativity of the Blue guys which were hard to kill, but we were also hoping that there was more demons instead of more men being spawned.

												The internet convinced me this game would be terrible, a horrible abomination not even worth playing.Once again I am right and everyone else is stupid. In defense of these lesser minded opinions, this game is very unique in its series. You and an IRL friend engage in a six hour long campaign to outskill the other person. Bonuses are actively awarded for styling on enemies in a tremendous variety of methods. From backstabbing, headshots, using specific weapons, to killing without taking damage, the objective is to outdo your brother and become the ""favorite son."" Since the game was designed with 2p coop in mind, virtually all secondary item-finding exploration has been eliminated. This includes healthpacks and armor, which has been replaced with regenerating health. Even so the game presents a wide variety of environments and a ton of complex areas to go through.If you're playing this game by yourself you're really not doing it right. Grab a buddy and enjoy a pretty badass fps, laced with delicious FEAR-flavored sprinkles on top. Also the final boss is a giant instant-kill middle finger with attacks that are hard to predict and navigate around.			"

												Much better than F.E.A.R 2, the scares are back and the graphics are amazing. During gameplay you also have challenges which stop you from the run-n-gun which was a big part in the previous F.E.A.R. and makes you try out a different approach. Also they added a ""take cover"" option allowing you to duck behind walls and boxes other than just standing behind them.Great game and would recommend playing from the beginning.:Edit:After Playing the game as the ""Bad brother"" (fettel) a Strong Con of the game was that the Script was not changed, the same lines are said when you played as the ""Good brother"" and therefore some scenes didn't make sense.

												It's sad to see the F.E.A.R. series come to this. This game is suffering from consolitis, chest-high walls, popamole combat and flat storyline and characters. 4 hours into the game and I don't know if I even want to finish it. The only reason I even played this to begin with, is that the game supposedly has something to do with the other FEAR games. But you wouldn't know that from playing the game itself.  FEAR 2 already took some steps back, compared to the original game, but it was still an enjoyable game. Not great, but enjoyable.                FEAR 3 is barely recognisable as a FEAR game: Popamole combat, bland cutscenes and no atmosphere. You sit behind  chest-high walls and defeat enemy waves. Other times you watch bland cut-scenes or go through some uninspiring  flashbacks. I propably should mention the jump scares as well; They come off as desperate attempt to catch even a glimpse of the atmosphere of the previous games.            In the previous games you always felt somewhat sad for Alma's predicament and what had been done to her. That's a sign of good writing and it gave the games a great atmosphere. All that is gone in this 3rd instalment. First F.E.A.R. was a classic. It added bullet-time and horror elements to an fps game. It had good writing, aggressive combat and great A.I. It was an ambitious game. F.E.A.R. 3 on the other hand is mediocre in every respect. It's a mediocre Call of Duty game with some ""horror"" sprinkled on top of it.  The horror effects only remind the gamer, of the better F.E.A.R. games. ""Oh hey! I remember that better FEAR game that was actually good. Maybe I should play that instead.""5,5/10			"

												The gameplay is improved from the predecessors, especially if you play as Fettel, which introduces an element of urgency which forces more aggresive and thus dynamic and fun gameplay. Sadly you have to beat the game as Pointman first, but F.E.A.R. 3 is a pretty short title, so you can literally beat it as Fettel in an afternoon.The AI is pretty good.The story is a surprisingly deep allegory about child abuse.

												And alas we come full circle with the F.E.A.R series with F.E.A.R 3 or F.3.A.R if you're a fan of bad names. F.E.A.R 3 contructs its campaign to be a co-op based afair compared to the other games in the series, so it's best you play it with a buddy as I did. Gameplay remains much the same if you play as Pointman complete with slo-mo gunfighting and all. Fettell on the other hand is the more interesting character to play as he has some neat abilities like possession and suspending enemies. Story is pretty bare bones even for a F.E.A.R game with no really interesting character interactions except the dialogue between the brothers occasionally. The biggest flaw however is that the game is criminally short, like 4 hours total to beat all 8 intervals. Also the horror has taken a further backseat with the introduction of co-op. Overall whilst F.E.A.R 3 isn't a bad game, it's actually a fun co-op game to play with a friend, it's a bad F.E.A.R game compared to the others in the series.			"

												Although the storyline was disappointing (from a long-time F.E.A.R. fan's perspective) and the actual game only took about 6 hours to complete, F.3.A.R. is still a generally enjoyable game. The singleplayer seems to focus more on its action persona than its horror aspect, which was sad to see since the original game had an extremely frightening and terrifying atmosphere. The action is as you'd expect it to be - fast-paced, tight and fun, especially when you activate your slow-mo ability. Plus Co-Op is great with a friend. The multiplayer of the game is a pleasant surprise. Modes like ""Contractions"" (where you must survive against an endless wave of enemies) and ""F**king Run"" (a Left 4 Dead style gamemode where you must travel from one side of the map to the end, running from a giant wall of death) are extremely fun and require you to cooperate with your teammates to survive. If you don't, you won't last very long.A solid shooter that just doesn't live up to the original game.7/10			"

												The final entry in the F.E.A.R. franchise as of this writing, F.E.A.R. 3 provides a much better story than that of F.E.A.R. 2 (which could fit on a post-it and was generally non-existant and boring), better visuals, better performance and much better gameplay. Is it better than F.E.A.R. 1? No, but it's a lot of fun in single player (I don't play co-op) and offers a campaign both as Point Man and Fettel, with the Point Man being the protagnist of the first game and Fettel being a ghost, offering interesting dynamics. The shooting is fast and fluid and the bullet-time mechanics the franchise is known far work beautifully in a series of shootouts involving soldiers and mechs providing a varied challenge. The addition of stick to cover mechanics isn't distracting. Although the shooting takes place mostly in tightly scripted sequences of areas with the occasional signposting problem where you need to look around to figure out where to go next, the steady clip of the action punctuated by good cutscenes maintains a solid pace throughout. A satisfying conclusion to the series that redeems the pathetic F.E.A.R. 2 and although I'd have liked more of the super intelligent AI of F.E.A.R. 1, this'll do.			"

F.E.A.R. 3 does a great job at the gory, slow-mo shooting mechanics and the story is entertaining, however still largely nonsensical, but that is exactly how this series has always been: Great action, intense atmosphere, tons of blood and a completely ♥♥♥♥ed up mess of a story.

												F.E.A.R. 3 was made by Day One Studios instead of Monolith so obviously the game will be slightly different than the past 2 FEARS but the game is still decent. I still think FEAR 2 was the best of the series ,but FEAR 3 it is still worth trying out one of the main complaints I hear about the game is that the AI is not as smart as the past two games and that they hide behind objects to long and don't fight back but I have played through the game series 3 times on the Xbox and once through the PC and have not run into this issue.

												And alas we come full circle with the F.E.A.R series with F.E.A.R 3 or F.3.A.R if you're a fan of bad names. F.E.A.R 3 contructs its campaign to be a co-op based afair compared to the other games in the series, so it's best you play it with a buddy as I did. Gameplay remains much the same if you play as Pointman complete with slo-mo gunfighting and all. Fettell on the other hand is the more interesting character to play as he has some neat abilities like possession and suspending enemies. Story is pretty bare bones even for a F.E.A.R game with no really interesting character interactions except the dialogue between the brothers occasionally. The biggest flaw however is that the game is criminally short, like 4 hours total to beat all 8 intervals. Also the horror has taken a further backseat with the introduction of co-op. Overall whilst F.E.A.R 3 isn't a bad game, it's actually a fun co-op game to play with a friend, it's a bad F.E.A.R game compared to the others in the series.			"

												Although the storyline was disappointing (from a long-time F.E.A.R. fan's perspective) and the actual game only took about 6 hours to complete, F.3.A.R. is still a generally enjoyable game. The singleplayer seems to focus more on its action persona than its horror aspect, which was sad to see since the original game had an extremely frightening and terrifying atmosphere. The action is as you'd expect it to be - fast-paced, tight and fun, especially when you activate your slow-mo ability. Plus Co-Op is great with a friend. The multiplayer of the game is a pleasant surprise. Modes like ""Contractions"" (where you must survive against an endless wave of enemies) and ""F**king Run"" (a Left 4 Dead style gamemode where you must travel from one side of the map to the end, running from a giant wall of death) are extremely fun and require you to cooperate with your teammates to survive. If you don't, you won't last very long.A solid shooter that just doesn't live up to the original game.7/10			"

												Игра вполне хорошая, но это не F.E.A.R. Я ждал больше хорор моментов, неожиданных поворотов и более глубокий сюжет, который смог бы залатать дыры прошлых частей. На деле получилась игра с отличным экшеном(что для меня было на втором плане) но с наитупейшим сюжетом. Да и не то что бы сюжет тупой..просто он топчется на одном месте. Образ поинтмена мне вообще не понравился. Из солдата элитного подразделения феар, он превратился в бомжа. Этот образ ну никак не подходит. И что само бесит - галимый хорор и отсутствие неожиданных сюжетных поворотов. Напугать у разработчиков не получается. Да и эффекты присутсвия Альмы вообще испорчены. Во второй части от каждого появления бегали мурашки по коже.Разработчики в самом начале поставили не те задачи. Идея превратить FEAR в кооп шутер уже сразу не увенчался успехом. Вердикт - отличный экшн, слоумоу пыш пыш, но сюжет просто калл. И когда будите принимать решение о покупке игры, подумайте за что вы полюбили прошлые части феар. За сюжет, хорор, или же экшн. P.S. Я очень хочу увидеть 4ю часть, но что бы в разработчиках значился Monolith. Понятия не имею как можно залатать этот сюжетный бред после 3й части, но в их способностях я уверен. "

												It's sad to see the F.E.A.R. series come to this. This game is suffering from consolitis, chest-high walls, popamole combat and flat storyline and characters. 4 hours into the game and I don't know if I even want to finish it. The only reason I even played this to begin with, is that the game supposedly has something to do with the other FEAR games. But you wouldn't know that from playing the game itself.  FEAR 2 already took some steps back, compared to the original game, but it was still an enjoyable game. Not great, but enjoyable.                FEAR 3 is barely recognisable as a FEAR game: Popamole combat, bland cutscenes and no atmosphere. You sit behind  chest-high walls and defeat enemy waves. Other times you watch bland cut-scenes or go through some uninspiring  flashbacks. I propably should mention the jump scares as well; They come off as desperate attempt to catch even a glimpse of the atmosphere of the previous games.            In the previous games you always felt somewhat sad for Alma's predicament and what had been done to her. That's a sign of good writing and it gave the games a great atmosphere. All that is gone in this 3rd instalment. First F.E.A.R. was a classic. It added bullet-time and horror elements to an fps game. It had good writing, aggressive combat and great A.I. It was an ambitious game. F.E.A.R. 3 on the other hand is mediocre in every respect. It's a mediocre Call of Duty game with some ""horror"" sprinkled on top of it.  The horror effects only remind the gamer, of the better F.E.A.R. games. ""Oh hey! I remember that better FEAR game that was actually good. Maybe I should play that instead.""5,5/10			"

												The final entry in the F.E.A.R. franchise as of this writing, F.E.A.R. 3 provides a much better story than that of F.E.A.R. 2 (which could fit on a post-it and was generally non-existant and boring), better visuals, better performance and much better gameplay. Is it better than F.E.A.R. 1? No, but it's a lot of fun in single player (I don't play co-op) and offers a campaign both as Point Man and Fettel, with the Point Man being the protagnist of the first game and Fettel being a ghost, offering interesting dynamics. The shooting is fast and fluid and the bullet-time mechanics the franchise is known far work beautifully in a series of shootouts involving soldiers and mechs providing a varied challenge. The addition of stick to cover mechanics isn't distracting. Although the shooting takes place mostly in tightly scripted sequences of areas with the occasional signposting problem where you need to look around to figure out where to go next, the steady clip of the action punctuated by good cutscenes maintains a solid pace throughout. A satisfying conclusion to the series that redeems the pathetic F.E.A.R. 2 and although I'd have liked more of the super intelligent AI of F.E.A.R. 1, this'll do.			"

												FEAR has been apart of my life since it first came out. Hearing the whispers of Alma and having her appear again and again eviscerating and tearing apart anyone in her way. While FEAR 3 is not the favorite among many players...it does keep up with the story along with shocking conclusions and revelations. The game runs great honestly...while lacking in color. I run at 4096*2160 resolution and had Reshade and an ENB in my game for the best visuals.The combat was great, you can take cover, be tactical or use slow mo and take out five men in three seconds.While there was an obvious lack of jump scares as compared to the first game and its add-ons, the overall atmosphere, gore, ideas and thought in the level detail kind of makes up for it.I wish Alma could have been more of a main character in this game, even speaking more to the players as a source of background.Overall it is a great game and a great series. I give it an 8.5/10 since I wish there was more jump scares. I hope there is a fourth game as well!			"

Maybe once I get my new speakers i'll do just that, that will be priceless.The game itself is pretty straight forward, you go from level to level and kill all the bad guys, each level has different types of bad guys sometimes there are soldiers and sometimes there are psychos with bombs strapped to their bodies and other ones who throw knives at you.I think for an older game they did really well putting it together, I've never really played a game that was so creepy before, once through the game though I think it will lose its appeal.

												The original F.E.A.R. is one of my favorite Horror games of all time, and certainly on my top ten favorite FPS games ever. It delivered a sense of Horror and realism with graphics that excelled all possible thought during its initial release, and it was a while before we saw another Horror game deliver the same intensity and excitement F.E.A.R. did. Fast-forward a few years later, and we see the release of F.E.A.R. 2, a title that had promise in expanding the universe and story of Alma, but fell a little short when it came to delivering a captivating experience. Though not bad by any means, it certainly didn't live up to what the first F.E.A.R. had accomplished.And then there was the end to the trilogy, after an unecessary amount of ports and random spinoffs. This... this supposedly Horror game that has the word F.E.A.R. in the title, albeit as an acronym, is the biggest form of false advertisement I've seen in a while. It's like going to a pizzeria, and they have nothing to do with pizza. You're gonna tell me you're just going to say ""ƒuck it"" to the pizza when you know damn well you've been wanting pizza for the last couple of hours? One does not simply say ""ƒuck it"" to the pizza. Same thing here - I want my horror, and I got none of it. Where is the *FEAR* I'm supposed to be feeling? Where is the *FEAR* that the other two games exuded?F.E.A.R. 3 succumbed to the issue most banal FPS games have, which is waves of enemies, walk five feet, more waves of enemies, walk maybe ten feet this time just to make it seem like some actual ludology went into the design of the game, a couple lights flicker to remind you ""oh I remember this from the other F.E.A.R. games! That means I'm playing F.E.A.R. - I almost forgot!"", even though it doesn't mean sh!t, and then rinse and repeat. The story makes absolutely no sense and goes in an unecessary direction that's full of sh!t. That's the best way I can honestly put it - It's full of sh!t. Monolith had a genuinely good thing going and created a masterpiece from the first one, and a decent enough sequel to it, but whatever happened to this one once it changed studios... I just don't know. They clearly wanted to make a different game, but remembered that they were working on a game that already had a few entries before it. Basically ƒuck F.E.A.R. 3			"

And the shooting in general feels like its from a totally different game even the famous fear slo mo is under utilized you'll barely notice its there until you get to a part where the ai is kicking your butt and you'll try to see what technique your not using and then you'll remember oh yea i have slow mo.even though my review sounds negative im just being critical to say this is not the proper fear gamebut for the $5 i spent i'd say its a very playable shooter mainly for being able to play as the 2nd brother(not spoiling it for you)oh yea and the online community is dead so unless you know a buddy who has this game and is wlling to play with you don't expect a single player experience thats one for the ages. its sadly built around co-op.

												I was thrilled to hear of a third F.E.A.R., and  that it marked the return of the Point Man and Paxton Fettel in earnest. It's an excellent co-op title, offering divergent experiences depending on which character is used. It's generally much more challenging then the earlier titles, affording you meager  regen health and many deaths if you do not take advantage of it's somewhat unusual first-person cover system. Most people dislike this mechanic, I for one enjoyed it in Killzone 2 and in this game. Fettel's powers are a blast to use and there is a satisfying array of weapons. Mechanically, the game is sound. However, it has some story problems. On the whole it is far less creepy the earlier titles, giving Alma a much reduced role and forgoing many scares in favor of more thrilling gun battles. Much like F.E.A.R. 2, it makes little use of prior story elements and opts to take things laterally, offering some interesting backstory but leaving the continuing narrative stagnant.			"

												Mit F.E.A.R. 3 oder auch F.3.A.R. kam ein Spiel auf den Markt, an das hohe Erwartungen gestellt wurden - leider blieben diese völlig unerfüllt. Die Spieleserie wurde zu einem reinen Shooter heruntergewirtschaftet und der eingebaute ""Horror"" ist eine blanke Lächerlichkeit. Zu allem Überfluss lässt die Story zu wünschen übrig und die beiden Endings, die man erhalten kann, lassen mehr Fragen offen, als beantwortet werden.Wenn man ein Shooter-Liebhaber ist und gerne lineare Storylines ohne mehr als Herumgeballere spielt und auch glaubt, dass Horror nur aus Blut und Explosionen von Menschen besteht, wenn man ein Achievementhunter ist und auf Scores achtet, dem würde ich es zweifelsohne empfehlen. Wenn euch jedoch die F.E.A.R.-Reihe am Herzen liegt: kauft euch F.E.A.R. 3 nicht. Mehr als schießen und durch die Level rushen findet ihr da leider nicht mehr.			"

												It's a decent shooter, but it's not like the first F.E.A.R. Let me sum things up for you:Things I liked:- Ok/decent graphics, depending on the situation (bit low res at times)- Shooting feels good- Two different ways to play a level- Leveling- Challenges make sure you fight battles with more variety and promote 'exploring'Things I didn't like:- Horror elements weren't there or were very weak (key to the F.E.A.R. franchise)- Enemies spawning behind you while you just cleared that very same section- Uninteresting levelsThings I didn't give a try:- Co-op (yeah I know)[Rating: 76/100]			"

												My brother and I are playing the Coop campaign and we're both seasoned FPS players with pretty high standards. We're entertained, so the game is definately worth the £3.74 we each paid. The graphics for this game have been criticised by reviewers, but I don't really see anything wrong with them. The gameplay is pretty good and they've managed to do one or two little things that are actually quite original for a FPS, which is a claim when you consder how developed the genre is now. Fettel can overtake the bodies of enemies, or lift them into the sky so Point Man can have some target practice: a lot of fun. Downsides are: the game seems as if it will be quite short; the complicated system of achievements is intrusive and rather over-populated, so that they become somewhat meaningless (if achievements can actually have any meaning...); worst of all, as Fettle, you'll be trying to stay in the body of a soldier, and the game will run out of enemies in the inevitable ebb and flow of battle; desperate to find an enemy upon which you can kill and 'feed', you're left rushing through. I suppose that's at least in character. Worth a go for the gore, not the story. And remember: it continues to be true that, in any FEAR game, you should never get into a helicopter.			"

												FEAR 3 is a good FPS, but the story pales when compared to the first two games in the series. For starters, it's very short. Granted, I played it on easy as I have too many games to play and kind of rushed it, but it was still very short. The story is also extremely simple in plot and I could describe the entire plot of the game in a few sentences.The plot involves Point Man, the player character from FEAR (the first game). Set nine months after the events of the first two games, Point Man is currently a prisoner in a favela in Brazil and escapes after a psychic connection with his brother, Paxton, the villain from the first game. After escaping the prison, the two of you travel back to Fairport (basically Seattle), to try and reach Alma, the psychic horror inducing woman/girl from the first two games. If you played the first two games, you'd recall that she ♥♥♥♥♥ Beckett, the player character from FEAR 2. Well, you and Paxton crash land in a suburb and have to make your way to the city, teaming up with Jin, the FEAR team member from the first game, and eventually finding Beckett who is being held captive by Armacham, the evil corporation that did the experiments on Alma and you and your brother. I don't wanna spoil the game, but there really isn't that much else to say on the plot. You just fight your way through the city, an airport, the tower, etc, until you reach the endgame.Being a horror/FPS, I found this to be much less terrifying than the first two games and whenever I saw Alma, I wasn't even phased. It was just kind of like, ""Oh, there's Alma. She'll disappear anyway, nothing to worry about. Unlike that one time in FEAR where you actually had to shoot her before she reaches you.""This isn't even a bad game as there actually are elements in this one that aren't in the others. Such as the cover system. At least I'm pretty sure the cover system wasn't in the first two, it's been a while since I played them on the 360. But the cover system in this one was probably the best cover system in an FPS I've played, as you actually stay in first person and can stick to the cover while leaning out.I guess I can say I was satisfied with this game as it concludes the story of Point Man and Alma, but it could have been a lot more interesting than just fighting your way to the city. There are cutscenes that do explain the story, but, again, it could have been more involved.Good game though. Shooting elements were, of course, the best bits.8.0/10			"

												Alma returns in but this time her sons Point Man and Paxton Fettel introduce divergent co-op. Your distinctly different abilities affecting their own play as well as the experience of their co-op partner. There is single player or co-op modes as Point Man, a genetically enhanced super soldier originally introduced in F.E.A.R., and with him can shoot enemies with many weapons you will find on your way or can play cooperatively as his conniving brother Paxton Fettel, whose incredible telekinetic power has given him life beyond the grave.

												I AM ONLY RECOMMENDING THIS IF YOU HAVE A CO-OP PARTNER!This game is a giant step down from FEAR 1 and FEAR 2.It makes me think that the studio fired everyone fromthose games, then hired away bunch of the best people from other studios who assisted on other top FPSs, but forgot the most important parts: a game designer, a lead writer and voice talent.So, the graphics are good, AI is still quite good, pacing is quite good, and environments are interesting. But they all also feel very GENERIC.The voices are bad, especially Alma's voice. Her only ""line"" is screaming, but it sounds like some random girl they pulled off the street. It stands out badly and wrecks the experience whenever it happens.The dialogue is terrible, and while the other games in the series' stories were nothing to write home about, this one's plotjust plain stupid and incoherent. Literally every chapter ends with the hero falling down a hole or having his vehicle exploded, which conveniently means that each level starts with him having lost all of his weapons in the previous level. THIS IS BAD DESIGN.Design-wise, the first 2 games were great in that lighting, sound cues and level design always had you looking and moving in the right direction. This one seems to have sound cues, but they're just parts of the soundtrack, so a little spooky chime that would have coincided with a crawling enemies scurrying past is just meaningless in this game. I found myself just plain missing some of the intended jump stares because I was turned in the wrong direction in this game, while that never happened in the other games. This game frequently resorts to graffitti arrows to guide you from arena-type area to arena-type area. Needing to do that should be a sign for developers that their game design SUCKS.They totally removed the great sound design and cues from the first 2 games and replaced it with a run-of-the-mill, looping soundtrack that doesn't match ingame dynamics closely enough.They also went with a rechargeable health mechanic that I don't think is as good for this series as the first aid kit model that all of the other games had. FEAR1 and 2 basically just made sure you were stocked up on health after every battle, which is just as unrealistic as the Halo model, but made each battle feel like a self-contained test of skill. Switching that model makes the basic feel of this game just feel out of character, and you can frequently just go hide behind a crate in the corner and recharge ad nauseum.Also, the bullet time mechanic gets drained MUCH faster than in the other games and recharges much more slowly. I found myself in bullet time around 50% of the time in FEAR2 but only about 20% of the time here. Instead, all of the typical enemies are much less balanced to the character than before. In the other games, it was almost impossible to get through most encounters without bullet time because of that balance, but here, you only really need it during boss fights. Again, it really doesn't feel like a FEAR game as a reult.They added a cover system that I basically never used, because you stay in 1st person perspective staring at the wall when you're in cover, which makes it a huge tactical disadvantage.One of the most stupid things they added is an experience point system that affects how long you can bullet time and how many extra ammo clips you can carry. You get experience points via a series of way-too-gamey ""achievements"". What that means is that to get the most experience, you have to stop using a weapon after getting 10-25 kills with it, because each weapon only has one level of achievement. So, instead of using the best weapon available, you're forced to drop a good weapon after you've met its ""quota"" if you want to maximize your bullet time. This is STUPID. Even more stupid is achievements for using bullet time and cover that mean you'll want to start each level by sitting in cover for 200 seconds and use 5 minutes each level draining and recharging bullet time from max to empty a bunch of times to get those achievements. It's a design decision that breaks the flow of the game and rewards playing out of character. THIS IS IMMERSION BREAKING.CO-OP is VERY FUN in this game, despite all of the problems. Gunplay is quite nice and reminiscent of Homefront, CoD, etc.The game is really designed to be played in CO-OP and it's disappointing that there's no AI ""brother"" companion during single-player. Him not being there during the shooting doesn't make sense in terms of the (badly written) story.All in all, there's no reason to play this game unless you're:1. Playing it CO-OP2. Are out of other FPS's to playPlease note that the FEAR1 DLC's stories have been retconned out of this game, so it's not even really worth playing if you somehow feel invested in the trilogy's story enough to need to see the ending.

												[Serious]So let me just say, I have beaten this game twice. Once by myself, and a second time with a friend. This game is, plain and simple, fun. It fails to deliver as a third installment to the ""F.E.A.R."" series (not counting expansions). The story is bland, but picks up after the 1st/2nd game. But the leveling system in the campaign, the ""slow-mo"" effect you love to use, and overall combat, is just stupid FPS fun. The game is also short, so while at risk for being reptitive, it can be beaten in 1 sitting. Play this game with a friend if you can, and you're sure to have a good time. The diversity of game mechanics between the brothers, while not completely different, is a nice attempt to see. One brother can slow down time, while the other can possess enemies. Personally, I say get it on sale, and you shouldn't be regretting your purchase. It's just too bad it went more action, over the ""F.E.A.R."" we were given from the first.Also, this game doesn't give a fug. Some of the things that happen in the story, is just ridiculous.

There is also a simple but satifying acheivement based level up system.  This is one game that does achievments and  hidden items damn near perfectly, mostly 'cause it always give you points towards increasing your chracters abilities.

												If you're looking at buying this game because you loved the previous games, don't.  It's got very little in common with them except the plot.  It's got none of the atmosphere that the previus games had.  There is no fear.  I am not saying the previous games were all that scary, but they had the genuinely spooky quality to them, F.E.A.R. 3 doesn't.  It really tries to show that it's a F.E.A.R. game, but all the blood and gore in the world won't bring back that feeling you got when you first heard Alma laugh right behind you and when you turn all you see the mere flicker of a shadow run past your periphery.They took everything that made the first games unique and awesome and made this another COD clone.  They replaced armor and health packs with regenerating health.  They limit your ammo supply, but leave lots of it lying around to pick up.  The SloMo drains too fast and isn't fun to use anymore.  There is no resource management, just run and gun.  The nerf to the SloMo combined with pre-positioned enemies takes all the fun away from anticipating where the enemy is coming from, using SloMo to catch them early and gunning down three to four enemies before they can react properly like the badass you're supposed to be.I am not saying the games sucks, it's just not I wanted or expected.

												Let’s start off by saying that this isn’t a FEAR game in the same sense as the last two. This is more of an action game with some suspense but lacking the same atmosphere of the previous titles. Same as Dead Space 3 that way.That being said this is a very enjoyable and action packed shooter. The game offers a great deal of diversity when it comes to levels, the enemy types are not so diverse but still enjoyable to fight against. The world itself is the same as the previous games so I had a great time just looking around at the psychic cataclysms that was Fairpoint.The characters were the same as the first game, one brother insane the other silent but that didn’t detract. The story was fairly good and I did want to see what happened at the end, it does follow on from the second one so I’d recommend playing that one first unless you just want action then this one is the best bet.I liked this game a lot, it was not what I was expecting but it was great none the less. Plus if you replay it you can be Fettel and have a great time making people explode with your mind. There are also a lot of multiplayer modes available, I didn’t try them but they did look like good fun.Over all I recommend this if it’s on sale and you like action and a little horror.Have fun ^_^			"

												The third installment of the F.E.A.R. franchise, F.3.A.R. is an FPS with jump scares and heavy weaponry. It isn't scary in the sense of Amnesia or even Lone Survivor, but more in a scary sense of Doom 3 but kicked up a few notches. I actually did jump a few times in this game, and the huge amounts of gore, spooky lighting, and atmosphere the game throws at you gives you quite an intense experience. The level design is also very good, allowing you to explore extremely spooky areas with blood dripping upwards and dead-eyed teddy bears and dismembered corpses on a regular basis. Speaking of the lighting - it's phenomenal. Some of the best I've ever seen with ambient, red, and even water lighting graphics. It was outstanding. One part that really stands out for me is in an airport terminal. It's raining outside and if you look up you can see the water pooling on the glass ceiling and the lightning flashes and shows rain type effects on the wall and grounds of the terminal. It's a real shame this game tanked and Day1 studios went defunct because this incarnation of the Despair engine is of superb quality.Another great thing about this game is the co-op. I would *strongly* recommend playing through with a friend as the story and gameplay (each of the two characters is unique and has different abilities/uses in battle) really seems to be geared towards to the co-op mindset and even the ending depends on how the two players play together. Voice chat in the client worked flawlessly and there were no other networking problems that I discovered in a playthrough. There is also a multiplayer mode, but I didn't play that before writing this review and am basing my judgement solely on the single-player experience.Pros:Lighting - amazingWeaponry/Shooting ""Feels Good"" - weapons have ""weight"" to themCo-opGraphicsAmbianceReasonably ScaryCons:Some Level Design Choices - platformingThe only big con I have with this game is there's a little element of platforming on certain levels where if you fall off something you automatically die and both players have to start back at the checkpoint. This ruins the otherwise excellent co-op gameplay and could be easily rectified with something like the revive mechanic for regular deaths - perhaps hanging onto the ledge and pulling the other player up. Other than that this game was great and I would recommend it for a co-op shooter. B+			"

												[Serious]So let me just say, I have beaten this game twice. Once by myself, and a second time with a friend. This game is, plain and simple, fun. It fails to deliver as a third installment to the ""F.E.A.R."" series (not counting expansions). The story is bland, but picks up after the 1st/2nd game. But the leveling system in the campaign, the ""slow-mo"" effect you love to use, and overall combat, is just stupid FPS fun. The game is also short, so while at risk for being reptitive, it can be beaten in 1 sitting. Play this game with a friend if you can, and you're sure to have a good time. The diversity of game mechanics between the brothers, while not completely different, is a nice attempt to see. One brother can slow down time, while the other can possess enemies. Personally, I say get it on sale, and you shouldn't be regretting your purchase. It's just too bad it went more action, over the ""F.E.A.R."" we were given from the first.Also, this game doesn't give a fug. Some of the things that happen in the story, is just ridiculous. I'M FED UP WITH THIS WUUURRRRLLLLDDD!!!!!!!			"

												What happened F.E.A.R. did you lose sight of what you set out to be? Did the guy coming up with ideas and the A.I. just say ""Screw it"" and leave? Where did you go wrong? Your firt game was great and you fell from grace making a horrid 3rd game and an alright second one. All in all 3 was a let down, there is no way around it. This game was a waste and for me, the death of the F.E.A.R. series.			"

												Now this, is a co-op oriented kind of game, it truly is. Almost every bit of the game was made for you and you friend(s). There's 5 gamemodes total. First, the co-op campaign of course, the main dish. And then you got the Contractions mode, which is basically a survival mode, with tons of enemies, several boss fights, while you got the EPA to fight back. There's also a Soul King mode, in another words, is your turn to play the scary ghost to hunt AIs down. All you need to do is possess and kill, yeah including your friends, remember they're playing ghosts as well. Next one, the Soul Survivor mode, I'd say this is a co-op survival mode combined with zombie infection and PvP. You, or one of your friends would be chosen to become spectre randomly, his or her mission is to take the friends down and corrupt them, to make them become spectres, while you guys are fighting the AI. Finally, the Fahking Run mode, just run, and don't look behind. Help your teammates, don't let him or her get caught by that massive WALL OF DEATH which crossovered from Mummy the film.In conclusion, this game is totally worth the price. There's a leveling system, you can earn the exp by accomplishing the goals, and in each level, you'll get various reward, such as Slow-Mo duration increased etc.. And almost all of the gamemodes can be play in your own, nevertheless if it's a multiplayer mode.HOWEVER, there's still two downsides. FIRST, there is no fahking in-game chat, yes, there's none, you gotta chat with your mates via steam while you're shooting the replica soldiers, and let me tell you, it is one pain in the ♥♥♥♥ indeed, and keep in mind, all 5 modes within the game are co-op, too. SECOND, although the co-op campaign is the main dish, it is still too short, which is sad. I beat this game for like 6 hours, and there's only 8 intervals, and the final one got nothing to shoot at, except for the final boss fight.Now if you can take those downsides, just go ahead and buy it then.

												Co-op makes the game at least playable, Only downside is that you need to have good reflexes to catch most of the jump scares, which adds a whole layer of tactical gameplay were you have to coordinate with your teammate when and where a jump scare might occur so you don't miss it. Being the ghost dude with the powers was cool for a while, but after few hours gets repetitive. Overall very mediocre FPS with not much to offer. But if you get it for cheap, can bare 60 fov and have absolutely nothing better to do.. go for it.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is amazingly ineffective at getting us to care about the story it's trying to tell, and with no appealing support characters, it pulls you through one bloody explosion after the next. Though what F.E.A.R. 3 lacks in a compelling narrative, it more than makes up for in thrilling first-person shooter combat. With optional challenges as a neat addition to the game, leading to a competitive angle when players compete for points in co-op.			"

												Let’s start off by saying that this isn’t a FEAR game in the same sense as the last two. This is more of an action game with some suspense but lacking the same atmosphere of the previous titles. Same as Dead Space 3 that way.That being said this is a very enjoyable and action packed shooter. The game offers a great deal of diversity when it comes to levels, the enemy types are not so diverse but still enjoyable to fight against. The world itself is the same as the previous games so I had a great time just looking around at the psychic cataclysms that was Fairpoint.The characters were the same as the first game, one brother insane the other silent but that didn’t detract. The story was fairly good and I did want to see what happened at the end, it does follow on from the second one so I’d recommend playing that one first unless you just want action then this one is the best bet.I liked this game a lot, it was not what I was expecting but it was great none the less. Plus if you replay it you can be Fettel and have a great time making people explode with your mind. There are also a lot of multiplayer modes available, I didn’t try them but they did look like good fun.Over all I recommend this if it’s on sale and you like action and a little horror.Have fun ^_^			"

												Fear 3...Fear 1 was scary because you never knew what to expect... Fear 2 was boring I found, fear online was top fun back in the day when it was made and since dead..... Now fear 3...Graphics: The graphics are decent for the game, not really specialy or amazing or graphic pushing (Which fear one was at the time) It's just a game....Audio: The game has some creepy sounds, most of the sound is basic fear screams, atmosphere, guns and thats about it.Controls: The contols are just as easy and simple as the other gears, with some add motions of the way you run and stuff, very easy to get used too.Game: The game itself is just another FEAR game, but this time for some unknown reason no longer scary or freaky to play, but they have added an amazing coop mode to play with people, some robotos and a few others things (Not going to say or it's a spoiler) into the game which makes the game a lot of fun to play.The coop is shooter and evil guy, side by side and both helping each other to get through certain sections of the map and really the game is so much more fun because of this...I did not bother much with the mutlplayer aspect of the game, running around fighting players online.  I gave it a go but that was it and never touched it.			"

												В игре мы играем за Пойтмена, заключенного в тюрьму. Играть за Феттела можно будет после прохождения игры. Он – призрак, имеющий телепатические способности. В многопользовательской игре несколько режимов. В Soul Survivor один из игроков становится призраком. В режиме Soul King все игроки – призраки, вселяющиеся в NPC. Режим Contractions –  это кооперативный мультиплеер с нарастающими волнами противников. В режиме F**king Run четыре человека обороняются от противников. В кооперативе от набранного количества очков зависит концовка игры. Моя оценка 8/10.			"

												What is F.E.A.R. 3?--F.E.A.R. 3 is a twisted sequel to the F.E.A.R. series of psychic-horror first person shooter games. F.E.A.R. 3, however, is more of a co-op arcade cover based FPS with some very light psychic-horror elements.----Who would most enjoy F.E.A.R. 3?--If you're looking for a fast-pased co-op FPS, with a darker twist, F.E.A.R. 3 may be an enjoyable pick-up. The game fails to deliver the ambient terror and jump-scares of the previous title, and has a far weaker delivery of plot than its predecessors. That being said, it can make for an entertaining competative co-op experience, and provides a substantial amount of replay value, if that's what you're looking for.----Over-all: 62.5%F.E.A.R. falls short in a lot of areas where the previous titles excelled, providing a weaker experience over-all. The game provides more replayability than any of the previous titles, but with that said, I'm not convinced that this is a good thing, on it's own, as the core gaming experience just isn't enjoyable enough to replay.--Mechanics: 3/5The mechanical flow of F.E.A.R. 3 is inferior to it's predecessor, F.E.A.R. 2. The AI is slightly less interesting, and largely more annoying to play against, the movement and cover system is functional, but not exactly fluid, as are the weapons. On top of this, the bullet-time (core mechanic) feels less fluid and less functional than in previous games.--Experience: 2/5The textures of F.E.A.R. 3 have been updated, but the stylization was a serious turn-off for me. The game felt visually cheap, arcadey, and generally far from immursive. The audio fell short in all regards as well, providing much less emphasis towards the atmosphere than in previous titles, and in places, distracting from the atmosphere (enemy AI call-outs). Balance: 3/5Some weapons clearly out-class others, and are just as accessible, and the bullet-time mechanic seems to have been gutted to a degree. This aside, the game is decently balanced, and rarely overly frustrating, but the general balance is anything but remarkable.--Longevity: 4.5/5If you can get past the short-comings of the game, it does provide a lot of content. There's a level-up system, two different viewpoints to play the campaign from, and a fairly decent co-op mechanic. Beyond that, there's a competative element, using an elaborate point system, and for the speed runners out there, a tracker for completion time.			"

												FEAR 3 seems to get a rough review from PC players as opposed to the generally positive reviews from the press, which is sometimes the case.  I personally enjoy FEAR 3 and love the series.  Yes this game is very different from FEAR 1, no med packs, armor... you have regen health and so on.  I was not a fan of the cover system in this game, nor holding ""e"" to open items and such.  This said those issues are minor complaints for this game.  The graphics, granted are not state of the art but I loved the atmosphere and style.  It is bloody for sure, not a whole lot of scares but some good scenery and interesting locales.  The sound and music were awesome, I really enjoyed the soundtrack for this game.  FEAR 3 brings to the table co-op and mutiplayer.  I have played several rounds of the off line multiplayer mode which is similar to wave style format and though it was clever and well done.  There are different modes to the multiplayer which mix it up.  FEAR 3 was a fantastic purchase at $5 back in the summer I have no regrets.  ...Did I mention you get to play as Fettel - how cool is that?, you unlock him after each interval is cleared with ""Point Man"". ✓Recommended.

												I've seen playthroughs of the previous two FEARs and it's pretty obvious that a new company made this one. The game feels like an average FPS rather than a true FEAR game. Most of the time you will be fighting soldiers and it doesn't feel too scary, although as you get closer to the end, the more ""FEARy"" the game gets. There are  a total of 8 missions , which brings me to the next unfortunate bit, the length of the game. It took me and my mate a little bit over 4 hours to complete the game which is a bit sad because, in general, the world felt awesome and I would've loved to continue playing it. What is a huge + to the game is the  co-op portion . The game is really fun to play together with a friend, which is where the difference of the two playable characters comes into play. You often find yourself in a situation where you need to rely on your mate. You get a decent story in a beautiful environment and after a long coop game you and your mate face a sudden twist that will make you either smile or frown,  the one who gets the highest score gets his characters' ending cinematic, Anna lives or DIES .  Based on all these points, I think this game is  worth to buy  from a steam sale if you've got a mate to play with.			"

												This game is quite possibly one of the worst games I have ever played. Even Colonial Marines was more fun than this. I'm doing Coop and so far my experience has been having a completly useless ghost partner that for about 45 seconds can do stuff and me stuck killing everything else. Now this would be fun if the ai weren't shooting hitscan projectiles with pinpoint accuracy with an incredibly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system and terrible controls. Ontop of if the AI is literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only reason the game is slightly hard is the hitscan. You can grab a riot shield and just melee the base commanders (a super strong boss that is super original totally not just another human with a blue shield) and take literally zero damage and just click for 45 seconds. I killed 4 like that and that was probably the most fun I had in the game was how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and broken it was. Hell I'm writing this because the game has given me Vietnam style flashbacks of horrible Voice Acting, game play, level desing and bugs. So my useless ghost friend as we walk across a huge interstate above the ocean is battle mechs that blow up but oh wait if you get out of them they get full health instantly and don't actually blow up, he got out to revive me and got stuck in a wall forcing us to fight 2 helicopters for 5 minutes again in a fight that takes zero skill since you just hop out and get full health again. This game is pure ♥♥♥♥ and anyone that disagrees has even worse tastes in Video Games than people that liked COD Ghost. The fact that Colonial Marines is better than this ♥♥♥♥ is just sad. Oh and literally none of the game was scary it was just horrifically unfun, unchallenging and a waste of 5$. Oh I also forgot it has cool interactions like opening doors or pushing through revolving doors all the ♥♥♥♥ing time to slow down the game play even more.			"

												Background: I'm a very casual shooter fan and pretty undemanding on story while more interested in mechanics and overall experience. Originality certainly helps and appreciate memorable elements of any kind. I rate Crysis 2 as one of the greatest of the genre. I liked FEAR but was indifferent to part 2. Played Fear 3's campaign to the end but little of the multiplayer.Impressions:The engine looks ok and the shooting mechanics solid. There's a lot of realism in the world and gun play.. but that world is also drab and the enemies not particularly fun to shoot. The sound is really solid and the grunts chatter is situation appropriate and appears to intelligently adapt to how you engage them. However they also appear to be psychic calling your moves without eyes on you and are impossible to flank as they always seem to have a bead on you which dampens the fun of being a superior soldier, it feels like the game wants you to only ever take on frontal assaults in slow-mo and rely on your healing to save you every time. Makes 'Dead Space 3' feel like a a masterpiece of horror (another sadly tamed down, but still superior game) as it utterly fails to pull off scares, none are original or unexpected. I noted several early scripted jumps were totally mistimed as I was looking the wrong way or had already moved past the location. Overall there is a lack of polish and placeholder elements are all to obivous, for example flapping fabric elements are replaced with static 1 pixel thick sprites that jut out at as if they are stiff as a board.The Good:*Decent graphics and general audio.*The cover mechanic works well and gives some options.*Magic healing is handy but almost too handy.*Gun play is decent but unimaginative.*Linear route stops you getting lost.*Grunt conversations are pretty realistic and dynamic.The Bad:*Seriously disliked the Main menu interface, found it confusing.*World is very drab in the early stages and the grunts too hard to see.*Some textures and locations lack detail that jar in an otherwise more impressive world.*Gun sights actively make it harder to see the intended target.*For a cover game you rely on slow-mo far too much.*Grunts track you too well limiting flanking options.*Cover mechanic gets tedious and slows down the pace too far.*Weapons are boring standards and lack oomph or impact.*Fails at attempts at horror.*Slow-mo reveals the slack quality as, on a massively overspec'd machine, grunts jink making you deadeye shots miss. *Stealth seems to only apply when the developer wants you to use it.*Collectibles, upgrade points break immersion and other console tropes.*Linear route and narrow locations spoil exploration and experimentation.*Environment is destructible but rarely has any impact.*Story is too silly and becomes campy as cut-scenes lack impact and detail.Recommended for:3rd person shooter fans not looking for anything special to fill a gap, think more Call of Duty over Bioshock.Conclusion.5/10. Seriously disappointing shooter that seems confused by its realistic world and weapons attached to weak fantasy horror setting and characters.			"

												Nice graphics, good and fun gameplay, but, it's missing the all the mind f***s and the scary parts. In addition to that it's way too easy and short. I completed the game on hard on xbox (was the first time in years that I played a fps on xbox so wasn't used to the controller) and it barely took 8hours to complete. It's fun and all but it's not what it should be...imma dissapoiiint...I don't think that it's worth the full price, if you buy it then you should get it when it's on -75% off. + Good gameplay and good coop- short- missing the ""FEAR"" part of the game7/10			"

												Pretty damn scary, and good! If you know a bit about the story line already from the previous F.E.A.R. games, this one throws you for a loop. All in all, the story line flowed well and the game provided tons of challenges. Co-op mode was a fantastic concept. You'll have to play to know what I mean by that.			"

												I've seen playthroughs of the previous two FEARs and it's pretty obvious that a new company made this one. The game feels like an average FPS rather than a true FEAR game. Most of the time you will be fighting soldiers and it doesn't feel too scary, although as you get closer to the end, the more ""FEARy"" the game gets. There are  a total of 8 missions , which brings me to the next unfortunate bit, the length of the game. It took me and my mate a little bit over 4 hours to complete the game which is a bit sad because, in general, the world felt awesome and I would've loved to continue playing it. What is a huge + to the game is the  co-op portion . The game is really fun to play together with a friend, which is where the difference of the two playable characters comes into play. You often find yourself in a situation where you need to rely on your mate. You get a decent story in a beautiful environment and after a long coop game you and your mate face a sudden twist that will make you either smile or frown,  the one who gets the highest score gets his characters' ending cinematic, Anna lives or DIES .  Based on all these points, I think this game is  worth to buy  from a steam sale if you've got a mate to play with.			"

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a third part of F.E.A.R. - first person shooter horror series. You have to get scared, you have to shoot, no exact point of the game.Gameplay / StoryI've played all F.E.A.R.s - 1,2 and finaly 3. Well, I enjoyed first and second part much more than the third. Maybe it is a good story, but the game developers made it look and feel WAY too bad. Seriously, the story is shown very bad - a voice acting is bad, cut-scenes are bad and.. basicly how is story tolerated is bad! Gameplay dissapointed me even more. I cannot say its unplayable, but taking cover, runing, jumping, shooting - it all SUCKS in this game. I mean its so messed up, that it makes camera shake and bug. Speaking of bugs, this game has A LOT of them. I bearly finished the whole game. I thought its the end of the nightmare, but no! There is also a cooperation mode which is EVEN WORSE THAN SINGLEPLAYER. Seriously, its even more unplayable. They shouldn't have even done it. Oh, I almost forgot - I finished whole campaign in 3 hours ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥it.Sounds / Atmosphere / Level designWhole game sounded like a good game.. but from 5 years earlier. Sounds were more like for a sci-fi game, in a space, on a spaceship - not for a horror game, on Earth, on our freakin planet. Global atmosphere was fatal. Game wasn't scary at all. I finished this during one night and gone to bed with no nightmares. Level design is slighty better, and I can say the best of these three. But the 'open areas' were realy 'closed' sometimes, cause developers were too lazy to make some skyboxes in some locations.GraphicsHere is what is as bad as gameplay is. I mean, its not THAT bad.. sorry... graphics... BUT YOU LOOK SO MAINSTREAM. Seriously, was that supposed to be a sci-fi game or a horror game? I must say though - models are made very good, and animations are also good (not these for weapons), but everything looks bad because of lame shaders. Damn, developers, that was THAT hard to make a Lens Flare shaders, that you included a fake ones in the sprites? Come on, guys...So...as I said - I enjoyed FEAR 1st and 2nd more than 3th part. I do not recommend buying this game if you've got a slow PC. I recommend buying it when its on a bargain, cause 20 ♥♥♥♥in Euros is WAY TOO MUCH for this game.4.5/10			"

												F.E.A.R. 1 was brilliant. The following expansion packs added a good punch to the storyline. F.E.A.R. 2 was also pretty good, while adding a ton to the wonderful story.Then came F.E.A.R. 3. This game is from a different development studio. The engine appears to be different, the models and environments have a new artistic style, and the gameplay isn't even close to the original. If you like arcade-style games, then you will enjoy this game. Between each ""mission"", you get a stats page showing you how well you did in the previous mission, as well as what items and rankings you unlocked. This is not at all what I had hoped for. I was looking for a more seamless storyline, like what F.E.A.R. 1 & 2 had. Granted, I would put up with the arcade-style of gameplay for this new game in order to learn more about the F.E.A.R. story arc. But it appears that the new studio had no interest in the previous storylines, and went in their own direction. This game almost feels like an ""inspired by F.E.A.R."" game, as opposed to the officially sanctioned game that it really is. Warner Bros. should be more careful with this IP in the future; it has so much potential, but F.E.A.R. 3 was a slap in the face of the original story idea.			"

												FEAR 3 seems to get a rough review from PC players as opposed to the generally positive reviews from the press, which is sometimes the case.  I personally enjoy FEAR 3 and love the series.  Yes this game is very different from FEAR 1, no med packs, armor... you have regen health and so on.  I was not a fan of the cover system in this game, nor holding ""e"" to open items and such.  This said those issues are minor complaints for this game.  The graphics, granted are not state of the art but I loved the atmosphere and style.  It is bloody for sure, not a whole lot of scares but some good scenery and interesting locales.  The sound and music were awesome, I really enjoyed the soundtrack for this game.  FEAR 3 brings to the table co-op and mutiplayer.  I have played several rounds of the off line multiplayer mode which is similar to wave style format and though it was clever and well done.  There are different modes to the multiplayer which mix it up.  FEAR 3 was a fantastic purchase at $5 back in the summer I have no regrets.  ...Did I mention you get to play as Fettel - how cool is that?, you unlock him after each interval is cleared with ""Point Man"". ✓Recommended.

												Unshackled from original developer Monolith, FEAR 3 was always going to come up against resistance.  Early impressions seem to justify this – the graphics are terrible (with a poorly optimised PC port),  the story is now more preposterous and impenetrable than ever, and there’s a bizarre focus on co-op that sits poorly with its horror themes. It’s hard not to draw comparisons with Dead Space 3, another horror franchise taken in a direction nobody asked for, that became more and more action orientated in an ill-conceived bid to make the franchise more accessible.Of course, calling FEAR a horror game is stretching it a bit. Even the excellent original was never truly scary – while it was tense and oppressively atmospheric, being armed with a machine gun and having the ability to slow down time was always going to take the edge off things. However, the horror elements were always fairly subtle – a girlish laugh here, a flitting shadow there. FEAR 2 largely abandoned this sadly, though it did contain the amazing elementary school level – probably the most creepy and sinister level in any FEAR game. FEAR 3, even forgetting the co-op elements, has horror elements so obvious and poorly considered that it is borderline parody. Alma, the series’ resident lank haired J-horror ghost (several years too late to the party even back in 2005) seems like she can barely be bothered even when she does deign to appear. There is a section late on where you’re on an escalator, and the Alma is just going in the opposite direction. You maintain eye contact as you pass, and it’s probably the least scary thing ever – you can just imagine her giving a half hearted shrug or honking a comedy horn.The core of the game, FEAR’s kinetic slo-mo combat, is thankfully still present and correct. The biggest change is that the game has dispensed with the armour and medpack system of previous game. My initial thoughts were ones of revulsion, but honestly it does work – supplies were so plentiful in the first two that you might as well have had fading health anyway, and your ability to pop medkits like skittles during combat made the normal difficulty a cakewalk – FEAR 2 in particular was almost insultingly easy.FEAR 3 is significantly harder as a result which is a welcome change, but the difficulty is uneven with some pretty horrible spikes later on. It’s obvious that some of the encounters were built with co-op in mind – there does not appear to be any concessions made to a single player. There’s a bigger variety of enemies compared to previous games too, but unfortunately these enemies are pretty one note compared to human opposition. I’m not sure that FEAR, known to for its excellent AI, really benefits from throwing zombies into the mix.But when you are fighting human opposition, the game sings – the gunplay is heavy and sharp, and the AI seems to have got its edge back after the lightweights of FEAR 2. The slo-mo gauge both empties faster and charges up more slowly, and though this can be improved with a poorly considered CoD style levelling system (why?), unlike previous games this ability is something you use when you need it rather than just clearing whole rooms. This is mainly down to enemies coming in waves, which adds a welcome level of resource management to every fight.I should probably cover that co-op mode as well. The game is built from the ground up to support this, which is a bizarre decision in a single player horror themed franchise. There’s a competition element that determines the ending of the game, but psychic ghost Paxton Fettle (still sporting his fetching bullet wound in his head) is so much more powerful (and entertaining) that it makes this part of the game a little trivial. Sadly in the single player you are limited to scowling mute beard-on-a stick Pointman until you have finished the game, and I don’t see this being a favourite to revisit.So then. Is FEAR 3 worthy of your time? Despite this review being something of a laundry list of complaints, it’s testament to the game’s core appeal that the whole package is still an enjoyable enough diversion. It never strays into greatness, but nor is it the abomination that it is often portrayed as. It’s just a shame that this will be how the series ends – a confused grab at the mass market that dilutes the appeal that made FEAR popular in the first place. "

Nice graphic and slo-mo effects. Mechs are damn cool, but a bit over-powered.However, public lobby is non-existence, neither coop nor MP. So ONLY get this game if you got friends to play with (or if you're a hardcore FEAR fans).My score: 8/10			"

												F.E.A.R. is a game series that does a pretty good job at combining the FPS and horror genres by taking aspects from both (Specifically by throwing you into the middle of an intense, non-stop gunfight with jump scares around every corner). F.E.A.R. 3 is a nice addition to the series and a fun game to play my only complaint is that it's just not long enough. There are only a handful of levels that you could knock out on your lunch break which is disappointing seeing as to how intriguing the plot actually is. Still I'd definately reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of horror games or shooters, crank the difficulty all the way up for maximum intensity.			"

												Tight combination of scares and creepiness with basic but solid first person tactical shooter.  A few jump scares and a creepy little girl are the main plot points, and they work although get repetitive by this the third installment (FEAR 2 is my favorite of the series).  Has slow motion time which helps make the game playable for people like myself that don't have great fast twitch reflexes, but if you like a more challenging shooter just don't use the slow mo ability and FEAR 3 will then be plenty challenging.  I’m not a big FPS fan myself, but even so I found the story and scary atmosphere along with the slow mo powers intriguing enough to have played all 3 games in the series, for what its worth.			"

												Assai lontano dalla magnificenza del primo F.E.A.R, questo terzo capitolo non convince molto.La Campagna perde quasi totalmente la verve narrativa e le inqutanti scene horror che avevano caratterizato il brand,virando verso un stile molto ""coddaro"" ed a volte completamente no-sense.Detto questo la campagna si lascia godere, complice un gamplay caratterizato da bonus contestuali  che valorizzano molto il proseguo dell'avventura.Il multiplayer invece svolge il suo compito senza infamia ne lode, proponendo delle modalità co-op godibili e divertenti ma che non cattureranno il giocatore tanto allungo.Questo F.3.A.R è senza ombra di dubbio il titolo peggiore della serie. Paradossale come cosa visto che era stato annunciato come il grande capitolo conclusivo della serie, ed è un vero peccato che le avventure di Point Man, Fettel ed Alma terminino così.Voto 7,5\10			"

												So after playing the first two games and finding the second one at least decent I was fairly hopeful about the the third one. But no. Fear 3 is comparatively terrible. It feels mostly like any modern military shooter game complete with cover mechanics, auto heal, having only 2 guns at once and a terrible fov. The shooting feels a bit better than in F.E.A.R. 2 and the levels are more diverse (but still hallways) but those are the only advantages compared to the rest of the series.The whole co-op aspect feels tacked on, Paxton Fettel is annoying and the levels feel too disconnected from each other. That you start every level with basically nothing doesn't help. They don't even really try to bring scares in anymore. It is just running from one part with excessive shooting to another and most non-soldier enemy types aren't even fun to fight. No sir, I didn't like it.So if you want more F.E.A.R. don't get this. If you want a generic shooter with an a little bit interesting setting. Go for it.			"

That's a no.The levels are fine, same goes for the weapons, the horror is really low compared to the first F.E.A.R. and even F.E.A.R. 2.But it's still a nice game to get while on sale, you can play with a friend on co-op and have a lot of fun even if the game is not better than the previous ones.7.5/10			"

												While as a solo experience, it's just a disappointing followup to the previous games in the series, the inclusion of a second playable coop character with unique powers elevates it to a worthwhile use of your time. It's not especially interesting or polished, but the mechanics of the two player characters together makes it an enjoyable campaign to go through with a friend. It also tends to go on sale for very cheap, so if you're looking for a more coop stuff and have a friend to play with, you could do worse. Not my highest recommendation, but I had a good time playing as a ghost who can possess enemies and use their guns against them, because of course I did.			"

												This one is more challenging than 1 & 2, because its designed for coop, I think, but I like the difficulty in single player. The AI is great, very agile and fast-thinking enemies.The campaign has been consulted by John Carpenter, director of ""The thing"", ""They live"" and many more.There is a ranking system, you get points for certain actions. As you rank up, you receive a perk automatically.This is a ""they don't make them like this any more"" type of game for me.

												I think Monolith are trying to run their business to the ground. I was certain that they had done the worst game that they possible could with F.E.A.R. 2, but lo and behold, they have proven me wrong. Amazingly, F.3.A.R. does the impossible and manages to be even worse than its predecessor. The horror elements were pretty much reduced to quick-time events in F.E.A.R. 2 and have been binned altogether by the third game; the gameplay is as uninspiring as ever with most enemies taking all of one headshot to kill; the story is completely nonsensical even if you ignore the first game and worse still if you do take it into account; and instead of the perplexing abortion of an ending that we got in F.E.A.R. 2, we now have TWO of the bloody things. Happily, the third game is even shorter than the second, taking only about three and a half agonizing hours to trawl through.Avoid like a crotch rot.			"

												♥ Diverse levels.I'm not one to mind repeating levels/maps in games however it's clear that they put effort into the design of Fear's world. I quite liked how each chapter was a change from the last...you explore a variety of buildings and are put into a number of situations, instead of facing the same boss over and over again, or being forced into a series of mazes. Diversity in its design is a strong virtue of Fear 3. ♥ Made me jump.Though Fear 3 isn't nearly as scary as the past titles, it did have several spooky moments in it. Granted I'm a total scaredy cat yet who wouldn't jump at an angry little girl leaping at them while they're climbing up a ladder? ; _ ; ♥ Enjoyable co-op.Whenever someone has wanted to play a co-op game with me, I used to always suggest playing Fear 3 together. Why? For one the co-op is balanced, a fact that I appreciate. Unlike other games it has both players doing equal amount of work and requires teamwork without going overboard.For another, I liked how the average time to beat the game, at least for my friends and I, was around 8 to 12 hours. I liked having a game to invest time into without having to play it week after week with someone. I understand others have found the main story lacking time wise yet this was never a problem for me.In case you're bored or finish the main storyline, there are four, multiplayer, mini games to play. Very fun! ✘ The story IS lacking. I can understand people who value games by looking at all aspects - the sound, the story, the graphics, etc. I can also understand people who have the view of looking for one thing, excellent graphics, beautiful music, and the like above all else. For me what matters most is the story of a game. Compared to the other Fear titles, I agree that Fear 3 is lacking in its story. They could have taken it so much farther than they did - I found the relationship between the two main characters was filled with possibility that they seemed to purposely shove aside. I don't believe we need to be pirvy to every aspect of a character, however they made them seem like cardboard cut outs, instead of real...Humans, ghosts, aliens, there was no difference for they all acted flat and emotionally frigid. Not once when I've replayed Fear 3 have I ever felt a connection to any of them nor have I felt pulled in by the story. As scary as I found the first Fear to be, it DID pull me into the story and the world of Alma. The dev team had so much they could have worked with backstory wise, relationships between characters, etc. and used none of it. I'll stick to fanfiction to get an emotional high... ' - ' ✘ Very hard to play with motion sickness.As my motion sickness has gotten worse, I've had to give up playing many games, Fear 3 among them. Despite its flaws, I have always enjoyed the game, and would replay it every few months. If anyone suffering from motion sickness is thinking about buying it, I would strongly advice you to think twice, for the game isn't kind to those who suffer from it! ✘ I think the main reason people are let down with Fear 3 is when they buy it thinking it's going to be a horror game. Does it have jump scares? Yes. Is it spooky? To me it is. However unlike the others in the series, I consider Fear 3 a shooter/survival game more than anything. It's wonderful if you're looking for a co-op game, no fault there, but as a horror game? Not so much. Still it might give you a spook or two!Overall if you're looking for a co-op game, Fear 3 would make a wonderful choice. If you're considering it from the aspect of loving the Fear series, I'd skip it.  "

Then the second game came out, wasnt as good, but still fun and scary sometimes and didnt hurt the story that much. Then came this thing, not scary at all, the story was terrible, the enemies have portal guns now wich looks just dumb and doesnt fit the game.

												Bite Size Review - FEAR 3The Good:- The slowdown mechanic is still satisfying in this game- A good variety of guns to play with- The setting (horror mixed with call of duty) is still interesting- Big robot sequences are some of my favorite partsThe Bad:- The story is very one note (need to get to Ulma)- Main character (Point Man) is unlikable and un-interesting- Some of the new mechanics like the cover system are less useful than just moving from out of cover with WASD- Less Horror levels/moments in this game, more Call of Duty- The first game in the series still has the best enemy AI and Horror inducing levels, this game takes a step back with both of these aspectsThe Verdict:This game is a bit of a mixed bag for me. On one hand if you are looking for a cheap 6 hour romp through a semi interesting game, this is a good choice. But the story is very linear and boiler plate, and the main character is a silent killer that has no personality at all. If it is on sale and you have played the previous two games, I would recommend it. Other wise, if you want to buy a game, buy the first one, it's better than this one and the second game.  "

												Full disclosure. I played this game before playing F.E.A.R. 1, it's DLC's or 2, and while I do recommend it, there are several large caveats and it's a tentative recommendation. Pros:- Looks pretty good, nothing extraordinary though- Co-op is fun- Multiplayer is pretty alright- Story was fairly interesting to me, if rather cliched. But perhaps it only interested me because I had no idea what was going on....ever.- Gameplay is ok- Multiple endingsCons:- 5 hours long, I was bloody awful at it and my co-op partner carried us, we respawned a LOT and it still only took us about 5 and a half hours.- Extremely linear, linearity isn't bad but Fear 3's linearity is similar to being on rails- Co-op gameplay is lopsided. Pointman's gameplay is well worn and honestly sort of boring but much easier, or Paxton, who has gameplay that's more fun yet not nearly as solid, it's much easier to do well in the grading system each mission insists on as Pointman as opposed to Paxton- Not horror, like not even a little.- MP servers are dead in the water- Repetitive gameplay- Questionable AI(at times)- Just mediocre, neither the graphics, nor the story, nor the non-existent horror help this game stand out.Now, did I have fun with it? Yeah i did, but more in the vein of it being a fun co-op shooter with a fairly interesting premise instead of it being a Fear game. I'd expected something else and got a fairly fun co-op shooter that's easy to shoot through.I recommend this to Die-heard FEAR fans, but even then only if it's on steep discount. Otherwise with the amount of other quality games that come out, buying this game for 20 dollars isn't worth it. "

												I know I haven't finished the game yet, but I'm making an exception to my recent ""never write a review until I've finished the game"" rule, and here's why:F.E.A.R. 3 does not cooperate with Steam Cloud, meaning that if something happens and you have to reinstall Steam then F.E.A.R. 3 will not bring over your save files, meaning that you have to start the game again from the very beginning. This happened first when I uninstalled then reinstalled Steam to clean my disk space of all the redundant files leftover from Steam's updates. Afterwards I had to play F.E.A.R. 3 again from the very beginning, since I took a break from the game after reaching a particularily frustrating boss fight. Then just last week I sent my computer away to get an operating system upgrade, which also meant that I had to reinstall Steam, which coincided with another temporary F.E.A.R. break as I have hit another frustrating point in the game. Now that the game has reset a second time I actually have no intention of replaying everything again up to that point, so I am now writing this review to hold over until some time in the distant future when I decide to revisit the F.E.A.R. series.From a basic and simple list of pros and cons written during my experiences in the game, I have generally mixed feeling about F.E.A.R. 3 (herein referred to as F3): The game has a vast improvement on the story, which I felt was really lacking in the previous titles, I'm able to follow it better because I actually somewhat care about what's happening, which was not the case before. Previously the exposition for the story tested my patience because it distracted from the gameplay and wasn't particularily interesting. F3 is better here because the environments showcase the events going on, I actually see and feel the world tearing apart at the seams, and without saying too much, that is exactly what is happening and it is up to the player to stop it with some unexpected help. This is made even better because that annoying little girl who'd always jump out and go ""ABOOGABOOGABOOGA"" is barely around. Alma, you aren't scary, you're just wierd. Get lost and let me shoot things. But the drawback with story is that instead of little girl jumpscares, it has cutscenes. This wouldn't be such a bad thing if not for one flaw: You play as a silent protagonist. Silent protagonists work if you have control over them at all times, giving the player control during all story exposition and making them feel like they are the hero of the story, like Half-Life 2, which did the silent hero thing perfectly. F3 however has cutscenes with supporting characters directly addressing the hero, who never responds or shows any signs of reaction, just stands there silently glaring at everything. Do you see the problem here? But at least the shooting is fun, and when you are actually in control it makes sense to keep his yak shut.Speaking of shooting, my god is the combat in this game amped up. With the tense environments and the unsettling enemies you're up against the game should have combat that's fast paced and free flowing, right? Well yes and no. The actualy gunplay is very tight, reactive and satisfying as you blow chunks out of your enemies with a good supply of firearms, that sniper rifle is a very welcome addition to my arsenal let me tell you. Enemies are varied and keep the player on their toes, ranging from simple tactical grunts who actively take cover to deranged bloodsoaked lunatics going kamikaze with explosives strapped to their chests, and it wouldn't be F.E.A.R. without the giant mech every now and again would it? The mechs are an intense fight making the player jump from aggressive force to defensive turtle in an instant, and like in F.E.A.R. 2 you can pilot them when you find an empty one, my god that part is so fun. But then there's the biggest gripe I've heard about F3. The cover system. Cover systems in a first-person game I find to be always sticky, clumsy and awkward, and this is no exception. A cover system would work better in a third-person over the shoulder viewpoint because the perspective allows it to work to it's full potential as the Mass Effect games show, but in F3 it's just not needed. When we needed cover before in a first-person game we simply pressed the crouch button behind a barrel, and let go of the crouch button to come out. We don't want or need some backend programming making us stick to the cover until we press the button, as it restricts our movement and makes things way more angering than they need to be. Keep cover systems OUT of first-person shooters. Got it? And then my biggest gripe about F3, the regenerating health system. In the previous games you could find and pick up healthkits to use when you needed them, which gave you more control over how the combat flowed while keeping you mindful of your current inventory of health, and that was fine, it was fun and made sense. With F3 however you just wait a moment and your wounds magically heal themselves, it's not fitting in the game and it made certain areas and boss fights way more frustrating (which is why I took my breaks from this game before I punched something). The big boss battles are in an arena with not as much cover so you don't often get a break to let your cuts and bruises fix themselves, you have to be always on the move, most of the time being in the direct line of fire of the boss enemy. With the healthkits system you could drop a few grenades and heavy weapons fire on the tanky enemy, using your healthkits as you do so, that way you can tank more damage which also made inventory management so much more important because popping first-aid like tic-tacs would screw you over in the inevitable boss arenas. With F3 however the arenas follow the same guidelines, leaving you open more often than not, but you can't tank damage. This is a major problem with the game, the boss fights aren't intense and challenging, their infuriating and kill the experience. Even the limited cover you have won't help you because some bosses have smaller allies that flank you and others can walk through the freakin' walls and get right in your face. It's not a fair challenge and I cannot play these boss fights without getting angry at the game, hence why I took these breaks that ultimately forced me through a series of unavoidable events to play it all from the beginning.There is also an in-game levelling and perk system that rates your performance in each level, giving you optional challenges to complete while playing such as ""kill x amount of enemies with melee"" and whatnot with the reward for levelling up being a buff in either the player's max health, reflex bar (which slows down time while in use, giving more delicious gunplay goodness) and other things. The only problem is that the game selects what to upgrade for you, you have no choice. If you want more health? Too bad, more reflex. It would be so much more engaging if you could choose what to level up, but for some reason you're not allowed to.So with all my mixed feelings about F.E.A.R. 3 I had to ask myself, do I or do I not recommend it? When the game gets something right, it gets it right. But there are equal moments of B.S. that make F.E.A.R. 3 take a massive step backwards from the last game which is by and far my favorite game in the series. So to be completely and utterly honest? No, I cannot in good conscience give F.E.A.R. 3 a positive recommendation. It's flaws are so game-breaking and the direction the developers want to take it is so confused that the whole experience suffers as a result. If you were able to follow and pay attention to the storyline unlike me then you'd probably want to play it for the closure of the series' finale, but otherwise I'd say just play up to F.E.A.R. 2 and leave it at that.

												Get this game not if you're inexperienced with the F.E.A.R universe for its been more of a let down for fans. The game is hardly horror and more of a Co-op experience on campaign. Get two copies of this for you and your good buddy/partner to play for it does offer a great competitive coop experience. In short, you play as alma's two sons, competiting against each other for stats, and your overall performance impacts the ending as who's the ""Favourite Son"". So its all sibling rivilary.Multiplayer modes are great! sort of the zombie suriving experience call of duty delivers.Overall, must play if two people are willing to play together.

												This game is an insult to the original FEAR. The AI has been dumbed down, the guns feel weightless and sound dull, the atmosphere has been gutted to be another action FPS, the HUD is a cluttered mess, a completely pointless XP system has been added, the lighting and effects are not as impressive as they used to be, the list goes on and on. I've seen people say the co-op makes this game bearable, but I found this to be completely untrue. My first playthrough was co-op with my best friend and as my Steam hour count shows, we couldn't make it past the first few hours. What we played was just another mass-manufactured action shooter with none of the attention to detail of the original.The original FEAR was not perfect. However, what in lacked in level design and enemy variety it made up for with superior gunplay, spectacular effects and lighting, and a haunting atmosphere. FEAR 3 has none of that. It's a homogeneous clone of every other popular FPS on the market to appeal to widest common denominator. Such a damn shame.			"

												If this game was released as its own title, it honestly might have done a lot better. As a fear game it is quite unfaithful.The game itself is actually pretty fun to play, and the multiplayer contractions mode was really cool. Basically you fight waves of illusionary soldiers/creatures, and between waves you can repair barricades and collect weapon caches.The single player is trash, almost entirely due to the fact that it's so unfaithful to the original. From the mood to the guns and atmosphere, it's weird. Like uncannily weird. You spend a lot of time fighting in spaces like suburbs, supermarkets and airports. Where as in FEAR 1 and 2 the game was  more localized around industrial areas and downtown cityscapes, it feels very weird to spend your time fighting in these much less industrial areas.This game is also not scary at all. I really don't remember anything in the game that was legitimately scary in the same vein of the first two games. But to be fair I also feel like the game ended up way past its prime, I think the original theme was already played out to death, the way the story pans out in this last game makes light of the entire supernatural threat from the first two games.So basically, it's call of duty with spooky stuff, except the spooky stuff is on your side. Or something.			"

												I'm pretty easy to please with FPS's, but this together with Perfect Dark Zero and Red Faction 2, is one of the worst sequels I've ever played. I first tried this on the 360 and then got it for pennies on a Steam sale or something apparently, well I want those pennies back. I am a huge fan of the first two games because of the amazing combat, cool atmosphere, and fantastic level design. This fails on all accounts plus more, even the new engine somehow feels chunkier and like a backstep from FEAR 2. The levels are small, the game just spams you with enemies with no time to take in any atmosphere whatsoever, the story and music is dryer than sand, and this game simply does nothing good. Surely there is another FPS you could be playing instead of this. Gotta love those ninja zombies who throw rapid firing silent knives or something at you.			"

												Before you buy this game based soley on my recomendation, you should realize that, while it still has its scares, it is not really a horror game anymore. It also has lost much of what made it a great shooter. Why am I recomending it then?Simple: the co-op is amazing. Most of those 7.5 hours on record? It was with a friend. It was also (unintentionally) hilarious. It's just a by-product of having two college students play through a game that wants you to take it seriously so much. I also have to admit, having Paxton Fettel as a playable character is a nice touch. Combine his ability to posess people with the Pointman's slo-mo powers, and there are some neat teamwork dynamics at play. If you see this game at a price where you can afford to buy it for yourself AND give it to a friend (especially to a funny one,) do so.However, if you want balls-to-the-wall mind****s, creepy atmosphere, and a gun that can staple people to walls, buy the other two.Seriously, though, this gun doesn't have The Penetrator? The one weapon that would make Co-op even more hilarious?			"

												The main reason I'm saying go for this game (preferably on sale) is because it gives closure to the story started back in the first F.E.A.R.  I remember seeing the commercials on TV for this game and apparently had a misconception about how having Fettel as a secondary character would be.  Day 1 did some neat things with the game differently from Monolith, but ultimately I think they fell short of realizing the true potential of the game.  I will say that I did not play the co-op portion at all...mostly because I had no one to play with.  That being said, I did complete the single-player mode, and unlocked Fettel on all missions to replay through again.  I did start this, but quickly lost interest, as the dialogue and almost everything about the game seemed quite repetitive, except you see cut scenes from Fettel's point of view.  I think the game itsefl could have had some awesome variety, as well as some extra gameplay time added for first play-through if the story involved using both characters and switching back and forth depending on the mission or circumstances.The graphics I thought were much better, the control scheme vastly different, but I got used to it.  I do feel the realism factor increased in fighting by using the reddening screen and then letting the Point Man recover (I'm assuming part of his meta/super-humaness involved an accelerated healing factor).  Sometimes it gets old searching for health packs.I can't say I was super happy with the ending, but I wasn't disappointed either.  The story seemed to be building up to some amazing climax, but in the end just left me feeling sorry for Alma and wondering if she just wanted someone to be kind to her all along.  The cultish aspect of some of the later levels was a little disturbing, but that seemed to be more of where Fettel's character was going as well.  There's definitely plenty of blood.  Blood on the walls, blood flying from gunshots, knife kills, dripping from bodies and oozing from everyone you meet practically.  I was startled a couple of times....never overly scared...The variety of antagonists in the game was definitely a little more varied than in F.E.A.R. 2, but I'm guessing because Alma's power was at a max and everyone and everything was being affected more drastically.  Some of the goons you fight were more annoying than anything, and I started to get bored with fighting Replica Commanders very quickly.If it's on sale, then definitely pick it up, but I wouldn't pay $20 for it.

												F.E.A.R 3 is one of those games that takes an old classic game and tries to transform it into a new Battlefield or Call of Duty. I would sum what happens in F.E.A.R 3, but the story is so forgettable that I can't remember what happened in it, and I beat it twice. Apparently the two brothers have to go and stop Alma's baby from being born, but the game throws in a multiple ending that rewards whoever was the ""best brother."" That means A. you need to beat the story mode twice to get all endings or B. Play the whole 6 HOUR story mode in co op. Gameplay is dumbed down from the last 2 F.E.A.R games. There is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cover system, you can only carry 2 guns, health regenerates, and F.E.A.R's top of the line AI has been reduced to standard FPS AI.The worst part is that the game isn't scary. F.E.A.R 2 wasn't all that scary, but it had great gameplay to make up for it. F.E.A.R 3 has nothing going for it besides a co-op that, once again, doesn't make it scary. I don't know what went through WB's head to get rid of Monolith [Creators of F.E.A.R] and replace them with some unknown studio that never heard of F.E.A.R. If you really love the F.E.A.R games like me, just make up in your head what happens in the story, it would probably be better than what they came up with.Also F.3.A.R... really guys? "

												""F.E.A.R. 3.""A review by Richard Valkinsenn.""How quickly it all returns to you.""Often stylized as F.3.A.R., this game serves as the official conclusion to the action-packed F.E.A.R. trilogy. Thrilling, chilling, and packed with just the right mix of tension-filled atmosphere and adrenaline-fueled action, F.E.A.R. 3 serves as a clear reminder that first-person shooters can be a lot of fun... even if their visual presentation leaves something to be desired, and the gameplay seems a bit cliche.F.E.A.R. 3 follows the story of Point Man and Paxton Fettel months after the events of the original F.E.A.R. in which the former is captured by Armacham and the latter frees him from their interrogation, assisting him in his escape. The two form an uneasy alliance as they fight their way through Armacham forces, dangerous psychotics, and sinister paranormal apparitions, amid an impending apocalypse and a growing distrust between the two protagonists.Stylistically, the game oozes atmospheric tension throughout it's fun, albeit short campaign. The world around the player constantly teeters on the edge of impending doom, and just about every location in the game is deserted, save for the game's vicious--and often tough--enemies. Voice acting in the game is spot-on and believable, although much of the supporting cast ends up feeling forced and rather one-dimensional. Even characters from previous entries in the series end up falling short. Thankfully, however, the two protagonists of the game, especially Fettel, will not likely be forgotten soon.Gameplay is F.E.A.R. 3's strongest suit. Though it may include such modern--and now admittedly cliche--conventions like ironsights and regenerating health, the controls and mechanics feel solid and responsive, even though experienced players will likely not use the game's first-person cover system. F.E.A.R. 3's solo/co-op campaign features a tough, numerous, and varied cast of intelligent foes opposite of the player, ranging from Armacham mercenaries to blade-wielding psychotics and even armored battlemechs. However, the player's odds are even, as Point Man can slow his perception of time, and Paxton Fettel can telekinetically suspend and crush his foes in midair, and even possess them for a brief amount of time. The blood-soaked campaign is also unapologetically violent, featuring buckets of gore in almost every scene, in addition to a bone-crunching arsenal that allows players to literally rip enemies to pieces, reduce them to red vapor, and even nail them to walls. F.E.A.R. 3 also features competitive and cooperative online multiplayer modes apart from the campaign which are fun, even though both maps and modes are few in number.Visually, the game is a mixed bag. The game's atmosphere-rich environments often suffer from low texture quality, even though the game's weapons all feature (mostly) high-quality texturing and design. Lighting and level design in F.E.A.R. 3 are generally very good with logical paths and cover points carved out for the player, in addition to some very moody lighting schemes. However, sometimes the level design can be confusing, especially without an ingame guide, and the lighting sometimes suffers from appearing rather flat in one too many places.In summary, if you're willing to forgive F.E.A.R. 3's at-times subpar visual presentation and arguably cliche mechanics, then the game serves as an exceedingly fun time both offline and on, and even manages to present the player with an engaging, albeit short, first-person single player narrative.Final verdict: I liked it.This has been a review by Richard Valkinsenn.Thank you for your attention.

												F.E.A.R 3 is a strange game, it needs a series of requirements to be met for it to be a very, very good experience, otherwise, there are just better games to spend your money on, let me give you a quick list of what you need:- A partner, Fear 3 is much, MUCH better with a partner. The enemy AI really shines when you see it actively trying to flank your friend or yourself, asymetric coop is tons of fun and its just a much better, overall experience.- A controller, I know many will think playing an fps with a controller when you have a perfectly good M/KB setup is some sort of sacrilege, but sadly the game has mouse acceleration and little bit of autoaiming enabled (with no ways to remove them), also the FoV is locked to 65 (can be changed by editing a config file), so a controller will just give you the better experience (sadly on screen inputs are locked to the keyboard, oh well).- A complete disregard for the prequels, Fear 3 is not scary (at all) but it has a good atmosphere, the story is mediocre at best, try to think of it not as a Fear game but as a good coop game.Okay let me wrap this up quick, still a good game, some of the multiplayer game modes can be fun if you can get some people in them (online is dead), graphics are nice, so is sound, game has decent graphic options, input options are lacking, no button mapping for the controller (default is pretty good tho). It's fun, you like fun.			"

												I've been meaning to complete the FEAR anthology for some time now having played the original FEAR some years ago, so when they came on sale for the anthology I couldn't resist. I'll admit I've played (approximately) half of the original FEAR, and completed FEAR 3, so I will only reveal story information without ending spoilers pertaining to FEAR 3.You start out nine months after the ending of the first two games, captured protagonist known as the point man held in south america works to escape with the assistance of Paxton Fettel after interrogation. Brothers in arms Point Man who is the Wolverine-like protagonist and Paxton a spectre. During their escape, they discover that they are being hunted along with their mother, Alma. The creature seeking to kill the family was created based on the evil memories of the mother, and this evil has formed a strange paranoia over Fairport. In order to restore the balance, the brothers set out to destroy any memories associated to the past to weaken the monster hunting them.The game sets a good base story and introduces a very cool horror element. There was some supernatural element introduced that didn't really fit but the actual horror side of the supernatural was a perfect buttery fit and it got a couple of good jumps from me. The story is particularly hard to follow until you get three quarters in but once you get there the story and gameplay make much more sense and the game goes from being somewhat random to making sense.After completing all but the last few chapters, the game really picks up and becomes a lot more fun. The horror elements in the last chapter were the highlight as the story became very clear in this chapter and it really felt like an action horror where as the rest of the game was scattered between action and horror but never the two. The game is short, sweet, but it's also lacking in story and fun comparring to its original - of which I recall having a lot of fun in my youth. I have heard from a lot of people complaining that this game fell short of its original, I can agree and understand, but there's no denying you'll have fun in this game because you will.I feel it more of a casual game due to the points system, it feels like it was created for its points system and not its story. Yje lack of story in the beginning, the point system and its linearity all contribute to the downgrade of this games reception to me. It does become repetitive when all you need to do is shoot until everybody is dead, move into next section and repeat the entire game. I have an issue with that, but there's no real interaction or immersive features.It's a solid game and it runs well on old technology. Getting a jump or two makes you smile, and the whole composure results in a great story and a lot of fun.			"

												What can I say about F.E.A.R 3? Quite obviously, It's the 3rd game in the F.E.A.R franchise, which, one would expect, would say everything. But in all honesty, it doesn't - in fact, the third installment of the F.E.A.R franchise is much more akin to the generic first person shooter than the trouser-browning horror shooter that the F.E.A.R name is otherwise known for.The gameplay is, to put it in one word, generic. You have guns, they go bang, there are a LOT of enemies to shoot with them, same old. However, the genericness is tempered slightly with a very nice cover system, the slow-mo mechanic which is a mainstay of the F.E.A.R franchise, and the occasional creepy moment, though undoubtedly nothing as trouser-wetting as the previous games in the series, which I have admittedly not actually played a lot of. There is also some geo-mod, but this is needless and hinders more than it helps. However, the game is still relatively fun despite the genericness and shortcomings.The story is confusing. Whilst playing through the game I had little idea of what was actually going on, but from what I could gather, Alma, the creepy little F.E.A.R mainstay, has become pregnant for whatever reason, and the main character, the ""Point Man"" and his brother Paxton Fettel, who was killed in F.E.A.R 1 and who has somehow returned, have to find her and... well, Fettel wants to eat the child and Point Man wants to destroy it. That's as much as I could gather.The game takes about 6 to 7 hours to beat, though this is somewhat artificially extended by the game's difficulty. I was playing on ""Commando"" (Normal) difficulty, and some areas of the game were heavily confusing and others were incredibly difficult, particularly one section where I had to defeat a massive mech which could kill me in a few shots and tear any cover you might choose to use to pieces, and also another where I was attacked by TWO of the most annoying enemy in the game, which needless to say was frustrating.To summarise, F.E.A.R 3 is generic, difficult, short, confusing and has stupidly large numbers of incredibly annoying enemies. I'd reccommend this game only if you're a fan of first-person shooters in general and like a challenge, in which case you may find it quite fun (Though you may find yourself not wanting anyone to mention phase casters to you ever again), otherwise save your cash and buy another good FPS, or better, one of the prior F.E.A.R games.

												This just isn't a F.E.A.R. game anymore. It's calla doody with some Fear flavoring thrown in.Only selling point is that you get to be Paxton Fettel and can control people's minds, but you have to play the calla doody-like point man's campaign first, and that's just not happening.			"

												This game was only Okay. Not as much jump scare as F.E.A.R 1 but it was ok. It was nice to return to the main character at long last. but that is where the pleasantries end as playing as Paxton Fettel is a flop they could have made it great and missed by a mile, as they have not improved the graphics by much at all and the characters look almost cartoon like. What happened to the amazing and creepy feel of F.E.A.R, F.E.A.R Extraction Point and F.E.A.R Perseus Mandate? I was hoping for more intense graphics and better weapons not a child’s cartoon characters arsenal. Hopefully they will realise there mistake and return to the original style of game play but as for F.E.A.R 3 I rate this game 3/10 (my lowest rating to date)			"

												As a shooter FEAR 3 holds its own just fine, using the previous games as its foundation. As a single-player experience it does almost nothing to improve on the series’ formula, keeping mostly the same enemies, similar mech suits, almost all the same weapons, and the same scare tactics. As a co-op campaign, the game becomes significantly more interesting, but we’ll talk about that in a bit. Despite the lack of changes to the formula, the shooting is still solid, the slo-mo is still satisfying, the gore is nice and crunchy, and the weapons have hefty power. The level design still hasn’t strayed all that much from the much-criticized “gray corridors” of the first FEAR – sure, you explore suburban houses, a Costco-like store, a huge bridge, and even a forest, but much of the time you’re still in monochrome corridors.

												Simply amazing terror-story games. I played F.E.A.R. when I was a child. When i saw all the F.E.A.R games on sale I just bought it for all the memories I have . Then I decided to play it and,no words can describe how I felt when I end this amazing trilogy.Although the first two games don't have such nice graphics, the story is fantastic! You are always hoping to know what is going to happen but when you play the campaign and you read all those notes ,all those voice messages is the time you realise you know nothing.In addition , in F.3.A.R. there's a cooperative mode too!! and you can play as both brothers in the campaign. Just like I 've told you before,AMAZING games!!!! If you see these games on sale,BUY THEM!!.On the whole, amazing story, characters and frights.9.5/10 "

												This game has more jump scares than F.E.A.R. 2. The only problem I find is that this game ranking system is bad, max level is 21, why is it that number? The point system is okay I guess, doesn't mean much to me. The multiplayer game modes are pretty fun, although very little people play multiplayer. I only played this game for the story itself and the story is pretty decent. 8.5/10 Has more replay value than the previous games.			"

A bit about the game and developers.F.E.A.R. 3 has been developed by Day 1 Studios, and published by Warner Bros. They have been publishing many different games so I won't mention any of them at the moment. F.E.A.R. 3, or Fear3 for short is a horror game which continues the story of the first two parts.About Gameplay.Fear 3 offers three different types of gameplay, singleplayer, co-op and multiplayer. Single player and co-op both have the same story to go through. Single player is much more challenging thought. The game is a continuation of the first two FEAR games, therefore in Fear 3 you play as Point Man, a guy who you have been playing as since the first FEAR game, while your friend gets to play Fettel, your badass ghost brother who you killed in the first game. Point Man's only power is to slow down time and react quicker, while Fettel can choke people, consume their body and so on and on.The multiplayer is something different from the other games. In Fear 3, multiplayer is a survival game. A survival in which you need to gather crates and put them in a specific area to unlock more weapons, which will then help you survive more and more rounds. The only sad thing about it is that the multiplayer has died out completely, and I wasn't able to find even a single server. But then again, playing with people you know is always more fun than with strangers!The game also has a handful selection of guns. There's not many of them and they are not too special, but it's always fun to try out new stuff. Thought, you will always find yourself mainly using the start gun that you obtain in the very early part of the game. On come co-op missions you even get to use a mech, which is very, very fun to play with!Graphic and AudioGraphic of this game is pretty good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Audio is okay but it does get rather empty most of the time.Pros, cons and final grade.Pros:- Nice Co-Op experience.Cons:- Multiplayer is dead- The game does not bring anything new.Final Grade: 4/10Extra Info: It actually took me a long, long time to write this review. I just didn't know what to write about the game. It's a very fun co-op game, but.. Nothing special. If you can get it cheaply, go for it. Thank you for reading my review! Don't forget that I'm doing weekly reviews on my blog! The page of my blog is:http://midnightwolfie.blogspot.com "

												Not your daddy's FEAR. It's a step down from FEAR1 and definitely a huge change of pace. But it's got satisfying shooting, interesting set pieces (I mean that, I can REMEMBER every specific battle in this game. How many shooters have that many memorable fights? This game does a lot to shape each encounter so it feels unique.), a cute scoring system, and some colorful environments.It's not great but it's a game that really had some love put into it. The regen health is a pain and the cover system works on consoles but is awful on PC but it does not hinder the game. A solid effort and a fun time-waster. Better if you can do it in co-op.			"

												sadly, if you played first two parts of F.E.A.R - you  don't really want to try this one. The idea of horror is gone - replaced by rather weak arena type shooter - get to the big room/courtyard, kill insane amount of monsters appearing from nowhere and move to another romm/courtyard. Oh, and kill some bosses almost impossible to kill without finding a glitch in between. Only two PARTS of episode 6 (episodes are called intervals, 8 of them in total) can stand to two before games, but those are very, very short - quickly returning to ""Serious Sam"" type shooter. But - while ""Seriuos Sam"" was funny, this one is only annoying. Graphics are OK I guess, music is lame, but doesn't really disturb you. The new cover system does - it's not helping, it's only the great way to get killed. And story - it's not frightening at all. Finally - the game is short - I am not anytype of hardcore gamer - rather lame - and it took me only 13 hours, including numerous repeats on bosses... I believe really trained gamer would finish it in one, maybe two evenings. So - leave this one, no need to play it. Loss of money...			"

												Do you like horror games? No? Do you like gunwank? Yes? Do you take yourself too seriously? Yes?

That is why it says that I have 0h playtime.			"

												By far the weakest entry in the F.E.A.R. series, next to the Perseus Mandate expansion. This game waters down F.E.A.R. 2 even further with regenerating health, a higher reliance on action sequences and shootouts, forgettable music, awful pre-rendered cutscenes, a decreased quality in visuals, and scares that fail to impress. The story itself returns to the series' main protagonist, but the game fumbles with its momentum, switching between action and horror sequences too quickly. The game can hardly don the style ""psychological horror"" as most of the scary elements are tangible, such as crazed humans or otherworldly monsters.There are no terrorizing setpieces like in the previous two games. Even F.E.A.R. 3's scariest moments are nothing compared to sequences like the school basement or the failed commander experiments from the previous game. It borrows too many elements from the typical ""bro shooter"", in order to strengthen the co-op. Because you know, nothing's scarier than having a buddy right next to you while you're afraid. I can only imagine the co-op was a corporate decision, and it was a bad decision. The story is interesting enough, and I enjoyed looking into the brothers' past, but Point Man isn't at all likeable and Fettel is a smug ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who has no reason to be helping his brother.F.E.A.R. 3 fell victim to trends. It's got a few scares here and there, but the regenerating health takes an enormous amount of edge off of the game, the cover mechanic is flimsy, the enemies are downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the co-op is incredibly shoehorned. This is not how you make a horror game. This is how you make a sub-par bro-shooter.			"

												Did you like FEAR? Did you even suffer through FEAR 2? Well, that's what you get for it. I present to you FEAR 3, the worst entry in the franchise.The good:- Gunplay is surprisingly solid compared to FEAR 2. More like the first game.- No almost endlessly respawning enemies like in F2- Sprint button- Grenades are again simply thrown and not selected. Thank you- Graphics are kinda neat- Fettel is still a badass. Kinda.And that's about it...not a lot to see hereThe bad:- Gameplay is so generic it hurts.- COVER system in an FPS...- Regenerating health- Silly ""level up"" system- Boring weapons- Bugs- Glitches- Even on easy annoyingly unfair at times- Story is quasi non-existant- No manual saves- Long checkpoints- You still do not talk...everyone else does...- I wonder what ""we"" did during FEAR 2...disjointed narration- Short, oh sooo so short, and still glad it's almost over.- Is this supposed to be scary?So, well, yeah, while the basic shooting mechanics are solid. Everything else just kinda falls flat on its face. The story makes little sense and is just boring. The scary or unsettling moments are almost completely gone. You have to run from checkpoint to checkpoint. Firefights are often protracted sequences with aiming out of cover. You die really fast in this game, but hey, regenerating health...yay.There's also an ""achievement"" system in the game through which you ""level up"". For example getting a sprint melee attack, more health, more slo mo time, etc. It's completely shallow and weird though. Not to mention you restart most achievements with every new instance. There are also some glitches and game breaking bugs, which require you to restart a checkpoint (for example, an enemy somehow dropped out of the world and was thus invincible, thereby not triggering the next set of enemies that let you advance through the level). Did I mention that this game is SHORT!? I played FEAR 1 for about 8 hours (12 with DLC), Fear 2 for about 6 or 7 hours as well, but this one? No more than 4 hours spread over 8 intervals. The different settings are also not very interesting from an artistic view point. *sigh* Just play FEAR 1 instead. It's better in every regard, except graphically.Edit: Also terrible FOV and motion blur which cannot be changed, unless you dig through Google to find out you need to edit the settings file in a certain way. That is just ridiculous. The game literally made me sick playing it without this ""fix"".			"

												Rating 7/10Overview: FPS with the ability to go into slow-mo The Good+ The game features 2 main characters you can play as. You first have to complete the game as 'point man'. This character allows you to slow down time while you blast away your enemies. The other character is Paxton Fettel who has the ability to possess almost any enemy in the game. + A cover based system in a first person shooter never seems to work out, yet this game handles the feature nicely. With a single press of a button  you can hide behind cover and easily pop out and shoot your enemies. + By completing challenges you acquire experience which is then used to level up your character. Challenges include killing a certain amount of enemies with a weapon, getting headshots, staying in slow-mo for a certain amount of time etc. It's a nice addition and it helps you change up your play style so you're not constantly relying on the same tricks over and over again. + I feel the AI has improved (yet still lacking to the first FEAR), enemies flank, hide, take cover and feel like a genuine threat when facing them. +Variety of different weapons and grenades+The shooting mechanics feel good, going into slow-mo and shooting enemies is always fun. The game also introduces sections where you ride a mech to change up the gameplay.The Average:On a technical level the graphics are decent. Textures are solid, lighting and shadows look decent however artistically the game feels bland and uninspired. Poor color usage and levels that feel and look the same despite being in different environments doesn't help either. The story is decent but it really is starting to feel convoluted at this point. Game will provide around 5-7 hours for one playthrough. Multiplayer and playing through the campaign as the second character can extend playtime for a bit. The game features some multiplayer modes that can be played in single player and extend your game time. The problem is that multiplayer is dead which is sad given that some of these modes looks really fun to play.The Bad- multiplayer is dead which also means getting certain achievements is now impossible- no local co-opConclusionThe more FEAR games we get the farther we move away from what made the original so great. This game lacks even less horror elements and tactical shooting from the previous entries and is essentially a straight up first person shooter with the slow-mo ability. I don't consider this a bad game but compared to the last 2 entries it feels like it took 2 steps back and 1 step forward. "

												F.E.A.R. 3 is a fun and well polished shooter, IF you're looking for a fun casual experience a la Call of Duty, but do NOT mistake it for a sequel to the excellent F.E.A.R.. The gameplay has now become a mix of Parkour and fast paced gunfights, the goal being to make the highest score by replaying the same levels, over and over.Interestingly, the campaign can be played in co-op, but this makes the game a little too easy, so I would recommend to finish the game in solo first. The game also features some very original multiplayer game modes. In F*king Run, up to six players are tasked to escape from an ever advancing fog of death, while the players are being pursued by an increasing number and tougher enemies. This game mode is exceptionally fun and challenging. Contractions is a survival mode tasking the players to barricade themselves from waves of possessed enemies. Unfortunately, nowadays it's impossible to find anybody playing multiplayer games or the cooperative campaign.			"

												One of the best co-op experiences, endings and credits song ever! Atmospheric horror shooting with two characters from which to choose – each for different playing style. Good graphics and tactical advancement. Also, F.E.A.R.3 has one of the most reasonable achievement system on Steam. The balanced, fast-paced gameplay and intriguing story will keep you going from the beginning until the end for the first walktrough, which takes only about 6-7 hours. But it's not a problem. After the first time, you can take the other character or try multiplayer. Still feels great.The multiplayer is ok, but nothing exciting.Despite some managable technical problems, it's one of my favourite games.Overall rating: 10/10.NB!There are few technical tweaks you should know, before you play this game.1. First, rename ClientRegistry.blob file to ClientRegistryOld.blob (Steam folder). This might save you from kicking out, when there are too many players on server (happens around sales time).2. Manually adjust the FOV, by opening the options.cfg file (game folder) and deleting the # tag and changing value to 85. This will save you from dizziness.			"

												One extraordinary shooter game. Simple notes:-Although it dosent have that scary factor that the FEAR francize started with, its still a very playable game because it has good graphics, gameplay and storyline. I recomend it, considering it a [must play at least once in a lifetime] game. -The story line and short animation clips are very much impressive and interesting; they make the player understand step by step whats going on and by the end of the game it blows your mind away when you realise where and how it all started.-My favorite: The slow motion obtion + rocket launcher = EPIC FREAKING GAMEPLAY.-And another thing that makes you enjoy the game more is that the multiplayer comunity is still alive. You could find almost anytime players who are willing to play co-op or MP.Great game! "

The motion blur and FOV aren't able to change and cause to me to become extremely motion sick when playing and I have to take breaks every 10-20 minutes so I don't throw up. If you don't get motion sick, then this game is worth the purchase when it is discounted.			"

												Mostly a generic shooter with not much weapon variety or enemies. Very short to play through once, with the option to play though again as the other brother.There are a few creepy visuals but I wasn't scared once. The story felt somewhat lack luster too.

												I just finished F.E.A.R. 2 a couple of days ago and I have seen a remarkable difference between that one to F.E.A.R. 3.The developer changed from Monolith (who made the first and the second one) to Day 1 Studios.They cramped the strategic fast paced action from the last ones, changing thing to a mediocre concept.I played until the 4th stage, always giving a chance to things get better.

												I really couldn't bring myself to finish F.E.A.R. 3. It was so lacklustre in comparison to its far superior predecessors, to the point where it was simply the stuff from my nightmares.Gunplay in F.E.A.R. 3 is sluggish and boring. While the guns sound impressive, I find the aiming and movement mechanics to be too wavy for my tastes. Getting a bead on enemies is awkward, saved only by the Slo-Mo mechanic that was also present in the previous two games. Even adjusting the sensitivity failed to improve anything. When playing arcadey-style shooters, I expect fast, fluid and responsive combat. F.E.A.R. 3 has none of that.Graphically, the game is laughable, looking like an Xbox 360/PS3 launch title at best. The atmosphere is foggy and ugly, and is nowhere near as immersive as the dark, claustrophobia-inducing corridors and areas that the original F.E.A.R. harboured. The game is completely lacking in the horror department, resorting only to cheap jump scares instead of the subtle, eerie hallucinations and sound effects that the made the first game so terrifying. Even the presence of a bloodied, heavily pregnant Alma failed to make me jump and cower behind my chair in terror.Multiplayer is quite fun. F**king Run is intense and challenging enough on its own, but the sluggish gunplay made experiencing it nothing short of a nightmare; no pun intended. On the plus side, most servers were lag-free and performed reasonably well.Apologies for the short review, but I really can’t say much more about F.E.A.R. 3. The game was so boring and awkward to play that I simply couldn’t bring myself to play more than a few hours of it. Half-decent multiplayer and a woeful singleplayer campaign does not justify a playthrough, even at the €5 price tag that I bought this game at. A waste of money and time. It truly is the black sheep of the F.E.A.R. series, and anyone who enjoyed the previous two iterations would do well to stay away from this tosh.Being one of the worst FPS games I have played in recent memory, F.E.A.R. 3 gets a 3/10.

												I purchased this as ""juat another co-op game"". Today I have to admit - this game is great. A truly nice co-op experience.In the co-op campaign (2-player co-op) you and your partner are two different species altogether, and with different abilities. Your abilities will have synergistic effect ( 1+1 > 2 ). Well that's what real co-op is, isn't it?In the multiplayer ( most modes among which is co-op only ), one is a wave survival game. You have to carry-in ammunition in those short ""in-between"" times, where co-op is required if you want to extend the time a little bit into the succeeding wave. There is another mode where you have to keep running away from some dark wall that chases to engulf you into death. Even this mode needs a lot of co-op play (revives and all).			"

												This game was incredibly disappointing. The push towards console gaming is made even more apparant with the 3rd iteration in the FEAR franchise, a game that completely abandons everything that made the original such a classic. The gameplay has been oversimplified and while it's cliche to say it's like a ""COD"" game now, it quite literally is. I'm not exactly sure why this game is even called ""FEAR"" because this game was less scary than Octodad. The story is completely idiotic it could easily be compared to something like Sharknado. And the graphics have suffered a significant amount, looking worse than the original game that came out almost a decade before it. Let's talk about the gameplay in more detail though...First off, the game is much more fast paced. You're given the ability to sprint, slide, vault, and worst of all, ""take cover."" This game mechanic is so incredibly annoying. Basically if you are near any vertical surface and decide you want to crouch, the game will automatically snap you to cover. This will lock you into position until you hit the crouch button again, meaning you have to stand up in the middle of a firefight just to relocate your position. The game also offers a new and completely unnecessary ""ranking"" system that constantly gives you these big cheesy notifications whenever you kill a certain amount of enemies in a row with headshots or something. This franchise is about walking around in dark hallways, shooting enemies in slow motion, and being scared silly by some creepy girl in the shadows. FEAR 3 seems to have forgotten all of that. Every level in the game seems to take place in broad daylight, and even when you do go inside a dark building, the ambient lighting is so bright you can see the terrible textures in every dark corner. Now don't get me wrong, the gunplay is more fun than it has ever been, but because of this focus on improving combat, the game's identity has been completely lost. Even the few times that you do see the creepy girl ""Alma,"" it's almost comical... like seeing her riding on the opposite escalator, looking confused as to why she no longer was scaring me. Another major downside to the game is the most immediate thing you'll probably notice, ""health regen."" That's right, they finally did away with the classic refreshing ""health-kits"" that make games so much more intense and opted for the ""COD"" approach where you can inhale bullets, take cover for half a second, and then jump out from cover good as new. This along with the near endless supply of ammo for every gun has taken away any type of suspense left in this game. I was able to cruise through this game without any real problems at all in less than half the time it took me to beat the original FEAR. So while the game is fast-paced and fun shooter by itself, FEAR fans will want to avoid this entirely due to the complete lack of horror. Now let's talk about the story. It sucks. It's just so painfully bad. Basically it starts off with the stupid ending from FEAR 2 where ALMA somehow rapes a guy (yes... according to the FEAR developers, a woman can now ♥♥♥♥ a man) and is now pregnant and going into labor. In FEAR 3, you take on the role of the original character, who I guess is named ""Point-Man"" and are tasked with trying to stop ALMA from having this evil baby. Your brother that you shot in the head in the first game is somehow, without explanation, back... and is now constantly on your shoulder the entire game, spoiling all of the mystery and suspense behind everything that happens. ""Uh oh.. sounds like ALMA is here, she's probably going to jump out at you brother!"" your brother will say as you walk into a new area. In addition to his terrible voice acting, your forced to listen to these frustrating loud screams that are supposed to be ALMA going into labor, but just sound like poorly done fake ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sounds and they sound absolutely ridiculous. Thankfully this train-wreck of a story ends quickly, with some completley random and unexplained player rank-based ending that I guess is affected by how well you played throughout the game? You're never given any warning about this so it was really confusing once I reached the end. If you're a fan of FEAR's storyline, I suggest you avoid this... avoid this like the plague. You're better off watching Alien 4 or something...Graphics are another pretty big deal when it comes to FEAR games. The original FEAR was one of the best looking games available in its time with revolutionary physics, shadows, and fantastic lighting. FEAR 3 is quite the opposite. I'm surprised games post-2010 can even look this bad. The lighting is all static, with hardly any dynamic nature at all to the environment in any sense (meaning no more cool slow motion physics based destruction). The gore is laughable, with enemies just exploding into tiny blood shaded explosions when you shoot them with a shotgun, and even on the highest possible settings, the texture resolutions were just painful to look at. The FEAR franchise has certainly fallen from grace in the graphics department. It's frustrating seeing a franchise die so quickly with obvious shifts towards a more action oriented, COD friendly consumer base, and the FEAR franchise is a perfect example of this. What once was a hardcore, scary, action shooter with no health-regen and some impressive visuals has now turned into a Call of Duty game with a different franchise's logo pasted onto the cover. FEAR 3's gameplay is fun, fast paced, and hectic, but this just wasn't a necessary change. The game's horror has been completely abandoned and the storyline feels like an afterthought. This along with the games lazy graphic design are all reasons I just simply can't recommend buying this game. Maybe if the entire franchise is on sale it's worth it for a short afternoon killing spree, but I wouldn't expect much that's for sure.			"

												This game wasn't actually made by Monolith; it was developed by Day One Studios, the studio that was previously only responsible for making the console ports of FEAR 1 and its expansions. It shows, in a lot of ways. The levels are much more linear, you're limited to two weapons, and the graphics are arguably worse than FEAR 2's and maybe even FEAR 1's. The story is barely coherent at best (which isn't helped by the fact that despite FEAR 3 having actual cutscenes, Pointman is still a silent protagonist who only communicates through furiously scrunching his eyebrows), and you don't even get a clear goal or an idea of where you're actually going until around halfway through the game's 4 hour campaign. The only aspect of the game that's anything interesting is the co-op system, in which the two players are cooperating but still loosely competing against each other to decide which ending they get, which works a lot better than it does in games that somehow manage to be even worse than this one like Call of Juarez: The Cartel. And that's a good thing, because the only way I can recommend even considering playing this game is if you have a friend to play it with, though even then it's only a loose recommendation since this game is really only that fun under the ""any game is fun with a friend"" rule. This game barely has enough content to be a hard sell if it were priced at $10 or $15 like the first two games are, but at $20 it's absolutely not worth picking up unless you just really want to suffer through an evening with a friend and have expended all other available options.

												So I bought this game as a fun Co-op game for me and my friend. It was, at first. We liked the first couple act, then we realized what total garbage this game is. Even the song during the credits was a terrible cover to a song that matched the game. Im not saying this game isnt bad to play so long as you have your boi with you to make it enertaining. DO NOT PLAY ALONE its just plain boring and you lose interest real quick.			"

												I love this game and the entire series in general. If you like FPS, Horror, and Gore you should give this a shot. It has a solid FPS feel and being able to play Fettle gives it a new twist. I am playing backwards through the Fear series but it is really entertaining. I think it needs an update though to give Fettle more bonuses because Pointman seems to always out score him no matter what you do. I haven't counted but I believe it's because Pointman has more opportunities to score points and Fettle has to posses a body to even compete. Fettle is really fun to play just don't count on getting the ending you want based on Fettle due to the unbalance. Played through COOP with a friend over seas and the network code was flawless. Highly recomend for a good time just don't try and compete for favorite son, it's biased.			"

												I have a lot of gripes with where Day 1 Studios went with the story and tone, but the gameplay of F.E.A.R. 3 is as fun as the series has ever been. F.E.A.R. 1 and 2 are much more well-rounded and sensibly designed, but F.E.A.R. 3 does have co-op. Yes, it does have co-op. Designing the campaign with co-op in mind is probably the main culprit for why F.E.A.R. 3's story/campaign isn't quite as great as the other two's. It ends weird and kind of anti-climactically too. But, it does have co-op.The combat is just about as deliciously good as the other games in the series though, so despite its odd disappointments in terms of how it concluded the series, it should still be a fun romp for anyone who liked the other F.E.A.R. games. It's mostly the same in that regard, although with rank challenges (a sort of points system) and noticeably less scary. Playing as Paxton Fettel is also a cool spin on things that adds replayability. And the rank challenges (which is in all modes) add an extra layer of fun.Also, Alma's just ugly in this one... :(			"

To be fair, there are some good jumpscares and the atmosphere is nice.  Furthermore, there are some GREAT shootouts and good AI in the game as well.  It's really meant more for co-op, but plays just fine single player as well.  Haven't tried the online components, but the single player campaign is pretty damn fun.			"

I don't understand how they think a ""recruit"" level player is expected to make it past some of the battles where endless enemies are spawned on top of superhuman species. I'm in for a challange but this just got stupid frustrating on a single person campaign. If I could rate this game negative I would.			"

												Howdy, So straight up its a 2.85/10Was a fun shooter, linear storyline, no presense of the original FEAR that I fell in love with, ran through it in 6 hours with a mate. The difficulty level only really slows down your progress and is more of a chore instead of being entertaining or challenging, just hoard ammo and you'll be right.Seems that it was produced in a few days with no further thought of being looked after further as the connection kept dropping out consistently. Also graphics have something of an arcade feel to it.Look if you have a spare 5/6 hours on a flight with a laptop and you forgot to download anything else then play this, otherwise just look up the cutscenes on Youtube and you can watch the whole game in 10 min.

												I just finished the co-op campaign literally 5 minutes ago, and it was so epic that I just had to write a review. I didn't play the first two games because I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥, so this will be a review for this game only, not comparing it to the other titles.Now for the people wondering how scary this is, there are some tense moments, and some slight scares like suddenly Alma or a monster pops up, but no flashes or screamers or whatever. I think the best part of the game is the fact that you can play co-op campaign, where each player can play as one of the two brothers. The combat is fairly simple, as Point man you just shoot, as Fettel you use your powers to get into enemies bodies for a period of time, lift them up, give Point man shields, that kind of stuff. It's a lot of fun to play together, I really enjoyed it a lot.Now for the story, there was a lot of story in here, I got a fairly good idea of what was going on. It was pretty interesting, but also confusing at times, probably because I haven't played the two previous games. I would love to, but I don't want a heart attack or ♥♥♥♥ my pants.TL;DR:Get this game if you want a good and interesting shooter, especially enjoyable with co-op. 10/10 for me.			"

												This is a bad shooter that barely belongs in the F.E.A.R. storyline. The second game was tolerable and even good at points but this one makes you wonder why you're not just doing anything else instead. The second mission felt like a bad rip-off of the favela fights in a much better FPS game, and the constant pop-ups for minor achievements are incredibly irritating. For what should theoretically be a relatively slow-paced shooter with bouts of action this one misses the mark completely, and it even throws in regenerating health to hammer the point home. It's like the difference between the Pripyat levels in STALKER and in Modern Warfare - despite having similar themes the feel of them is completely different. This feels barely like the second game and nothing at all like the original. After the favela mission I looked at the ""Challenge board"" and the ""target time"" of the mission and decided that it wasn't worth continuing. If I hadn't gotten the game as part of a cheap bundle I wouldn't have even bothered getting that far. I feel sorry for anyone who paid full price for this.			"

												If you're loyal to the series, I'd play it just to see where the story ultimately ends. The combat only improved in my opinion; they added a clunky but fuctional cover system, weapons that remenisce of the past games, and AI that make poor attempts to flank you, but still they attempt. The upgrade system they implemented on the other hand, falls short of what it seems they were attempting to accomplish. Finding the Psychic links and Alma Dolls even after replaying a mission over and over gets old pretty damn quick. By the 6th interval, sadly, I just wanted it to be over. I can't lie and say it's not worth playing; I feel like it's a hit or a miss, shooter preference with this one			"

												Well, a great dissapointment has befallen me within the first 10 minutes of playing this game.  I was a huge fan of F.E.A.R. , F.E.A.R. Extraction Point,  F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate, and knowing how sequels often get dilluted in the development process, I was surprised to see that F.E.A.R. 2 is just as good as the original with actual improvements to the lighting, sound, and gameplay that don't detriment the trademark ambience of the classic F.E.A.R., which makes sense because the entire franchise up to this point was developed by Monolith as a competitive PC market shooter.  Unfortunately,   F.E.A.R. 3 offers none of this.   Because it's a blatant console port.   The lighting is absolutely horrid.  There's some ridiculous grainy mist all over the place which apparently  serves to dress up the fact that the architecture and lighting are completely inadequate for a game in this series, and why is that?  Because it was developed for underpowered fanboy consoles.  F.E.A.R. 1 had better graphics than this, because it was developed for PCs that came out BEFORE PS3, and XBOX 360, which strongly underlines the fact of how pathetic consoles and their games are.  The storyline is completely thrown out the window on this one too. There's no explanation of how Pointman ended up in a prison cell, but we're supposed to be pacified by the appearance of a badly animated cartoon-like Fettel with a  bullet which miraculously stopped in a crater on his forehead. Odd, because I distinctly remember blowing his brains completely out in F.E.A.R. Is this a way to help the clueless console fanboys who didn't play the first two F.E.A.R. games figure out that Fettel was killed by a gunshot to the head and Pointman did it?  Apparently so.  But let's not neglect to mention that the voiceovers for the replica soldiers is equally as disconcerting.  They talk like normal people.   They are not normal people.  As we learned in F.E.A.R. 2 these Replica soldiers under their masks are facially disfigured cheap human clones with little education or vocal skill, and their voice should be gruffy, low and borderline animalistic.  In F.E.A.R. 3 they talk like professional sports announcers at the International Table Tennis Tournament. When you shoot them, you get a yellow hit marker, and if you squint really hard you might see a tinge of red blood. Where is the gore?  But within 10 minutes you'll also be able to figure out that the introduction of Alma in this game is about as frightening as an angry poodle. Another opportunity wasted.  The use of music in the game is done poorly, and the music itself is completely uninspiring.  Another opportunity wasted. Go into settings.  That's right, auto-aim is on by default, because this is a console port.  All this culminates into F.E.A.R. 3 being a total let down and downright disgrace to what is otherwise a legendary franchise loved by many. When will game publishers learn to stop destroying great concepts in the name of wider market audiences and temporary profit gains?  WB clearly took a page from the EA and Activision book on F.E.A.R. 3 and it's no surprise we'll never see another real F.E.A.R. game again...			"

												I bought this game shortly after it was released simply because I enjoyed the first two. Boy was that a mistake.There's almost no horror at all. The one jumpscare that got me was on a ladder pretty early in the game.As for the rest of the game, none of it was scary. It was literally a shooter with some ugly creatures with the title F.3.A.R. slapped onto it.I even beat the game in one sitting... Something I can never do with horror games I've never played.Oh well, back to Metro.			"

												I think this game had earned its place among the worthy games over the years. It has a good story and its a decent horror game in single player. Of course in coop, the scary-factor just can't be as high as in single, but the fun of playing together with someone who also feels this game and can immerse in it with you is far overcompensate the latter problem. It has a unique atmoshpere and I really like the rank system. A real contra maybe only its short campaign.			"

												Even though it was made a substantial amount of time later, FEAR 3 still manages to feel more clunky and outdated than its predecessor by miles. You know you've ♥♥♥♥ed up when your game easily looks 10 times worse than the one that came before it. An incomparably ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot, mixed with repetitive design and horrible gameplay make this game not deserve any of your money. Dont get it even if its on sale, Co-Op mode isnt even that impressive and the multiplayer is a joke. "

												Doesn't have smooth FPS even on a GTX 1070. I would be able to give a better review if they ever fix the FPS issue for Pascal cards, but for now, I can't conclusively say whether it's fun from the gameplay stance. The story is pretty predictable and though it's not great, it wraps stuff up. Play it for yourself to figure out whether you will truly enjoy it.			"

												I'm a fan of the previoius FEAR games but this one didn't do it for me.  For one thing, IMO the health auto-regen pretty much sucks, espeically in a game that forces a lack situational awareness during game play.  The player is forced to rely too much on auto-regen.  In my view, the boss battles take way too long and take away from the enjoyment of the game.  I made it up to the airport teminal and threw in the towel.

												FEAR3 plays like if Half-life 2 and CoD had a ugly child,who then had a child with a buggy 90s FPS.It's got it all: Ominscent AI, Magic Bullets, Heisenberg's Walls,Impassable Pebbles, Feathery Hit Boxes... you name it.That's not to say it cannot be fun, but what a sad way to end this franchise.If you're thinking of getting this one, may I suggest you buy Fear2 instead?  The first in the series is very good of course,but it doesn't run well on modern systems, and by modern I meanpost-2009ish.			"

												I've played FEAR 1 & 2, lots of other horror games and here's what I have to say about FEAR 3....a letdown!  In a nutshell FEAR 3 feels like Call of Duty with a ghost that appears every so often.  FEAR 1 & 2 had major moments of scares and making you feel like you were always haunted.  FEAR 3 is just bad guys, bad guys and more bad guys...then Alma shows up and is gone.  I acknowledge that FEAR 3 is a shooter game but I think it concentrates too much on shooting and not the horror.  Furthermore, I'm upset that you can shoot an enemy in the face a couple of times then he gets back up and shoots and granades you a dozen times.  The AI is a bit too smart as well.  Before you round the corner they're already shooting at you!  Forget ducking for cover because they seem to have an unlimited supply of granades.  By the time I reached a ""ghost moment"" I was so frustrated that I was basically like, whatever Alma just get outta my way go haunt someone who cares!  The creepy moments are very brief and and they're ok but far from great.  If you like horror games stay away from this, it'll be a letdown.Pros:+Controls (after changing them from default)+Ablility to use cover during a firefight+WeaponsCons:-Graphics (worse than FEAR 2 for some reason)-Enemies keep spawning in some places-Enemies hard to kill even at point blank-No real scary moments, not a true horror game-For a shooter/horror game it's boring.

												Having finished Fear 2, I was wanting more. That game had its issues, but its atmosphere carried it, and it was a great experience overall.Since I had Fear 3, I decidede to give it a try. Well, having finished one playthrough in Fearless difficulty, I can see I was a bit disappointed. BUT, it's not a bad game. Not a bad game at all... just not a very good Fear, in my opinion.This game feels a lot like a modern shooter, without the creepy atmosphere. Besides, there really isn't a very coherent place in which you play. Each level is a different location. While that does provide variety, it doesn't feel very good to just jump from place to place just because. It makes it feel more like an amusement park... Besides, these places don't feel scary anymore. You're not as much is hostile territory anymore, and that was the biggest disappointment.Atmosphere has gone down the drain. For some reason, for the developers, blood everywhere=horror. All there is to it is bloody patterns everywhere, and red candles. These are in almost every level and don't really make much sense. Aside from these candles and blood, there is trash everywhere... even places that make no sense for it to be there. I... I don't know why they'd do this. They went more for the visual component of the environment rather than creating a good, dark atmosphere. It feels very artificial in Fear 3.The supermarket level has some cool places, I'll give them that. And the last level was enjoyable as well. Other than that... meh.The shooting feels better. I'd say gunplay has been improved, and it feels great to shoot human enemies and watch them fall apart. Weapon variety is essentially the same has in the previous game, without alternate firing modes.The new regenerating Health System is a big, big disappointment. Why did they do it? One of the best things in the previous game was exploring for health and armour, and feeling cautious when you had none. This time around, there's no point. If you're low on health, just hide behind cover for a couple of seconds. Another aspect which feels like a modern shooter rather than a Fear game.The mech control was also pretty good.Enemy variety is questionable, and just boils down to a completely average shooter with 2 or 3 additional mini-boss style enemies.Difficulty was fairly easy, with the exception of a couple of completely spikes. Nothing impossible, just pay attention to the environment and choose where to stand/hide and you'll be fine. It's just a shame that it was a bit incoherent in this aspect. Nothing too bad.Visually, it's significantly better than the previous game. Despite being a pretty poor port, that was patched and problem should be solved without too much of an issue. The textures were very blurry, but it wasn't too noticeable unless you were actively looking at them. Lighting effects were really good, I'll give them that. They've used the shadows to enhance atmosphere a bit but it was definitely not enough to carry it. Still, credits where its due, good job on the lighting effects.Animation quality was spot on as well, I'd say, as were the cutscenes. Particle effects were dubious at times, but there were pretty good overall.The music was another aspect that pushed the atmosphere down. Most of the music was very action oriented, taking Fear out of the game. Sound effects weren't nothing to write home about, but nothing too bad. They did the job. Except for Alma's screams. Those were pretty bad, in my opinion.There was no horror in this game, unfortunately. All the scares were jumpscares. And they weren't all that scary, really. Some were good, most were barely noticeable. It's a real shame. They've completely ruined the atmosphere of the game. They've opted for the easy way out, making a modern shooter instead of a Fear game. Environment was based around blood everywhere. Just... blood and symbols. It didn't really feel hostile towards you, and that might be the reason why it didn't feel scary at all.Story was pretty straightforward. Alma's in pregnant (play the last game) and her other 2 sons go after her to do something about it. ♥♥♥♥ happens on the way and half of the city is destroyed. Nothing spectacular, although I did like the ending. Still, nothing that'll get you thinking. It's just an excuse to shoot everything.Collectibles and Achievements... Argh, these were awful. Really awful. Collectibles do absolutely nothing for the player. Except for achievements. But... well, why would one do it? In the last game, you would explore for Intel, which gave you insight on the backstory. This time, there's nothing. Absolutely nothing, and I hate it. They've dumbed down everything that made Fear, Fear! You collect stuff for the sake of it. No context, no reward.Absolutely pointless, and it makes me mad.Besides, there are ""challenges"" in each level, which simply pushes the player towards a playstyle that isn't necessarily the most fun. It's just about getting x kills with each weapon, hide behind cover for x time, etc. etc.It's not there to improve gameplay in any way, so it might has well not be there, to be honest. Overall impressions. This was a pretty negative review, I realize it. But it's not a bad game. The gameplay feels good, it looks and sounds good... but it has barely anything to do with Fear. It's just another shooter now... maybe a bit more gory, but that's it.And that's definitely not what I was looking for.So, if you're looking for a brainless shooter, go ahead and play this.If you're looking for a well crafted game, with a great atmosphere... look somewhere else.It's a good game. Just not a good Fear game. "
