												I picked the game up for a song, and for quite a while it seemed rather enjoyable. Simple, pretty easy, a relatively short but fun experience.Perhaps I was just lucky. Perhaps there's other ridiculous bugs and glitches throughout the game that through sheer dumb luck I avoided.Then I got to the final boss. The big climax for the game. And I got stuck. I couldn't figure out why. At a certain point it became invincible and I could do nothing except reset. And then it happened again. Frustrated, I tried to figure out what was going on.At a certain point in the boss fight, there's four separate towers you have to destroy. The boss fight is designed in such a way that you're meant to only be able to destroy one at a time. But you can destroy more than one. I found it very easy to do so. Apparently the developers never considered this as destroying more than one at a time caused the invincibility bug.I was not impressed.It was never an amazing game to begin with, just some simple mindless fun. But when the final boss is so buggy, that's a serious issue. I have no doubt if I looked into it I'd find countless other problems throughout. Releasing a game in such a state is inexcusable. Even when it's on sale at massive discount, I cannot recommend this. It is lazy to release a game with such huge obvious problematic glitches. This is something that even a small amount of playtesting should have caught.			"

												Needed some tricks to work on a dual screen setup, see the Steam forums for a solution. The controls (I've tested with both kb+mouse and a joypad) are quite unintuitive no matter how I set them up. Also the voice acting is mostly annoying, but the game looks really good and who wouldn't love the steampunk setting. Still, unfortunately in terms of playability, there are a lot arcade shooters out there which are better.			"

												Bought this game cheaper than dirt and it still wasn't worth it. Absolutely awful. The in-game performance is fine, even on max settings (and it does look fairly nice), but for some reason there's MASSIVE slowdown on the menus - any menu I tried to access was nearly unusable as the game rendered one frame every few seconds.The controls are awful. I haven't tried it with a controller, but with a keyboard, WASD was a horrible choice. The maps are placed diagonally, yet you move on standard XY axes. The maps aren't even at a 45 degree angle, so you'll have to juggle between one direction and another to travel down, say, a long canal. Also, most ""rooms"" are small boxes, so you'll have to awkwardly switch from one misaligned direction to another. The developer should have added an option for this control scheme: W - Forward, S - Backward, A & D - Turn left and right, respectively. If I remember right, that's what Battleship: Surface Thunder did, and that game is a hundred times better than this terrible clone.The game, for the short time I played it, seemed like it had the potential to be fun, but trying to actually play it was such a terrible chore, I decided it really wasn't worth the time to get used to the bad controls or the small amount of space it took up out of 2.5 TB available on my computer. Waste of even 79 cents. If I could go back and stop myself from buying it, I might decide to buy it later on anyway if it went on sale for, say, a penny. Sitting uninstalled in my library, it isn't worth anything anyway, except as a warning to others.			"

												I played this game for a while now and I believe this game isn't bad at all. The graphics are nice and well implemented following a decent steam punk art design, that can be found throughout the whole game. There are many different missions too, each one following a different storyline so there is plenty of room for a multiple playthrough.Some bugs are in it as well I must say though ...The first is, that in the settings window for the keyboard bindings there are two of 'em simply swapped. But it's easy to avoid once you know it. The second is that sometimes for no apparent reason the whole game switches to some sort of ""ultra slomotion mode"". I've had this happen quite some times now and while in the beginning of the story-line the only thing to get it up and running again was to quit the game and start it again (your progress being saved), later in the campaign i experienced some of those ""magic slowdowns"" that disapeared without restarting the game.But apart from that I'm having quite a good time with the game. The story is well implemented and I'm still enjoying it. It's even featuring some really good voice-acting.I mean, c'mon ... it's a shooter ... what type of extraordinary storytelling do you expect from such a game? This game here got more storytelling than most other arcade type shooters I've played in my life. And I've definitely played A LOT of 'em ...There are even some points in the story that get me laughing each time they occur ...I recommend this game. It's got a nice pricetag and it's simple and rewarding shooting fun all through the game.Buy it and enjoy! Even more when it's on discount!			"

												I would not recommend this game. It is a decent game, fairly easy, but the graphics glitch like crazy, I can't stand to play it mostly for that. It's a bit buggy, but for less than a dollar, that's okay. What I really, really dislike is that the controls aren't really up and down, it's a slight angle, making you  have to adjust every little bit you move, it's a pain. Make the camera actually straight, and I'd have liked this much, much more.Sorry Dev's, just update it and you'll make a lot more people happy.			"

												Graphics Clicthes and the controlls are not logical. The controlls are unlogical, instead of foward, left/right turn, you get up,down, right, left and have to zig-zac trought a diagonal canal. Fixing those problems could make the game rather good, but no.. they don't care to fix it :(			"

												I can't recommend NW, it's a sub-par SHMUP, based around a victorian-styled navy. Don't expect a story, characters, graphics options of any kind other than resolution and AA, also have to disable any second monitors to get it to display. Uninteresting style, could've gone further with it, plus graphical issues like screen lag and flickering textures even when on a non-cluttered screen. There are better games of this type out there.

												The game looks pretty enjoyable in the trailer, and I like what they were trying to go for, but there are some major hang-ups with it, most notably the control scheme.  The controls are mostly just infuriating, as you might think they would've elected to go for something closer to Asteroid-type controls, but instead they've gone for something closer to Zelda games.  Zelda-type controls probably would've worked OK, except that when you go from left to right, up to down, or vice-versa, instead of just going the other direction, it does this little rotation maneuver that sort of makes it impossible to know where you'll end up.  Aside from that, I could barely see the cursor on the screen when using a mouse, all of which makes it seem like it could only be played using a gamepad.The graphics are adequate for this type of game and the storyline seems moderately interesting, but I personally just couldn't get passed the frustrating control scheme.I think the game could've easily been salvaged with some other/better control scheme choices, but as it stands there are better places to spend your time.

												It was a interesting game. Not one for hardcore gamers that want a challenge. It was a very short game maybe an hour to beat it all. The graphic are good, but that seems to all this game has going for itself. The sounds in game sound good as you would expect. The cut-scenes are generic and kind of lame because you don't feel the passion that is being portrayed by the characters.  The gameplay can be frustrating at times but its still a simple game with simple gameplay. You can use a Xbox 360 controller to play this game. There is a local co-op (multiplayer) and its alot of fun to play with a friend, locally. The story doesn't make sense, and random villeins are mad at you for no reason. The game is a must buy at a reduced cost because if you bought this at full price you wouldn't be getting your monies worth. Its a good game to spend a hour to beat.			"

												A fun top down arcade style shooter, in a boat. Remanicent of a game known as Overboard on the PSX. What more could you ask for?One thing you could ask for is a longer game. As enjoyable as Naval Warfare is, I found myself a little saddened at the end that the game ended there. Right at the moment I was becoming more involved in the game and edging to do more boat sinking mayham, it ends. Although you do unlock a new difficulty, encouraging you to play again. However the War that was brewing in the Seas felt more like a ""Hey, stop lobbing rocks at my house or I'll park my cruiser up your aft.""Putting that all aside though, Naval is a enjoyable little game with lots of little things to feel good about. Giving you just the right amount of fun to play it just long enough to be satisfied, leaving you saying ""That was pretty good, I'll play that some more later."" It's definately a game that can be enjoyed on those ""...meh..."" days.Give Naval Warfare a go. I rate this a 6.3 out of 10			"

												Игру можно назвать наследником Overboard! с примесью Crimsonland. Даже при том что не так много произведений в жанре ""стимпанк"" созданно, игра обладает жутко штампованным и скучным сюжетом, на который игра делает упор вместо того чтобы делать его на визуальный ряд и развитие корабля. Все улучшения выдаются по сюжету, либо могут быть найдены чуть ранее, корабли при своих различиях не имеют своих жёстких ниш или стилей игры, как например в Bandits: Phoenix Rising.В итоге хоть поиграть и можно, но ничего особенного в игре нет, совсем.

Product received for free
												By Jove have I ever seen a pretty game.Naval Warfare strikes me as a game that tries for a certain balance between both satisfying, in-depth, skill based gameplay and enormous gratuitous explosions. Suffice to say it hits that mark. Despite plenty of checkpoints and fairly generous power ups this game genuinely feels challenging to play - which makes it even more satisfying to watch a ship sink below the waves.Now, as I said earlier, this game is pretty. Really pretty. (You may wish to glance at the screenshots above at this point) The game is tagged as ""Steampunk"", a title I will happily say it earns. Unlike many others, who grab a few gears, brass and a bucket of oil, stick them on an airship, give it to a lady wearing a corset and metal goggles (seriously why would you ever make your goggles out of metal), then proceed to slap the steampunk label on it; this game has clearly thought put into it's art and design. Everything from an aircraft to enourmous battleships and artillery cannons fit together perfectly.Also in the tags is the phrase ""Twin Stick"", which, I think, is a good thing: it appears this game plays far better with a controller, as the keyboard controls seem awkward and significantly limiting in that they only allow travel in the four cardinal directions. If you are to buy Naval Warfare - bear this in mind.All in all, if it's your thing, I'd say it's worth the £2.00 price tag and more. That said, I recieved this as a gift, and you may want to evaluate that yourself.Steeples Out <3			"

												Bugged. I can't switch my ship from a Cruiser to a Gunship in the Workshop in Episode 2 and because I can't switch, I can't leave the workshop, so the game can't continue. I found a workaround for the bug. In the PC version, you can't use the mouse to switch, you have to use the WASD to change them. That will prevent the bug.PROSGreat game. Bought for 2 USD, could have bought it at 1 USD.Great mechanics. Real Time Strategy game using keyboard & mouse to control a single ship.Great ideas for the ships.CONSSome major bugs early in the campaign mission cause the game to be unplayable e.g. Unable to switch between carrier and gunship in the warshop, thus causing the player to be stuck in the warshop forever.Movement controls are not fine-tuned. Turning is very weird especially for 180 degree turns.There is no online multiplayer. Only a hot seat for multiple controllers to be plugged in.			"

The ships, the water and everything except for the land masses look pretty decent graphicly, but the freaking flashing graphical glitches on the land masses are horrible! My computer is way of above the recommended specs, there is no excuse for such poor textures! I used an XBOX 360 controller and it controlled well enough.

												This game is fun to play, set in an interesting world and the graphics and water effects are quite nice also. It's also quite a unique game I believe.The only thing that takes some getting used to is the control style (you press the direction you want to go, not the direction relative to the ship), ie. left always moves the ship to the left of the screen, etc.Apart from that the voice acting was quite good and added to the game experience, even with quite a funny joke about the airship.I found it was best played on a TV with a gamepad while sitting back on a comfortable chair etc.			"

												Is quite a fun little game, you get to pick between 3 boat types each with their own abilities as you'd expect. Cut scenes are in the form of stylized stills which work quite well. The Good : I didn't experience any bugs during my play through, the boss fights are part battle part puzzle which was an interesting change, decent graphics. The Bad : The controls take some getting used to (used M&K, simple to understand how they work, quite hard to implement as it's a familiar hand layout but with a different result, so you intuitively use a key and end up going the wrong direction). It is quite a short play though, For a game which is $4 at full price, I thought it was worth it. The controls are a bit easier if you don't play any other games until you've finished your playthrough. If a sequel comes out I'll be grabbing it.			"

												this game has horrible mouse control and voice acting, alot of the options menu wont even work, the progression system makes no sence, the first boss battle is badly made and the rest of the boss battles are just puzzles with a bit of shooting that still makes no sence outside of blind shooting, at times you cant use some support boats because of the reason of no, the one part of the game that i bought it for that i saw in the show case video was short and poorly made, the story was crap, the cut scenes were out of synk cut out and did not fit the art style, some of the boats are made of pure bull♥♥♥♥♥♥(play and you would know), the ending was pointless and had the worst twist, its never explains the back story of why the word is water, you travle from the polls of the world to the equator in no time flat, the AI is as dumb as bricks, the w a s d keys are some how side ways, and it looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ but i did have a fun time with the game and i would recommend this game			"

												I have seen a lot of negative reviews on this one, but honestly, I think the reviews are old, and really do not do this game justice. The controller interface is great. If you don't care for the keyboard controls, I strongly recommend that you use the controller. As far as the glitches and slow menus reported: How about buying a sdecent graphics card? lolAll in all, this a great game. Simple arcade style feel with a steampunk aesthetic. The voice actors do surprisingly well, and the progression is relaxed and enjoyable. This felt like a nautical sister game to Sine Mora.THe price is great too. Buy it yourself, test it out, and enjoy. To hell with the whiny old reviews.			"

												imo at an 80% sale, it is not badThere are many games suited for mouse and keyboard, and many others for controller. This is definitely a controller game, its really bad with the keyboard and mouse. Play it with a controller.It's fun to zip around with left analogue and shoot with right analogue, and boost with one of the controllers buttons (yeh, not with the triggers, more on this later).There are reviews saying it has bad controls. Do not play it with mouse and keyboardYou can stop at Squad Shops to buy squads that you can command. Not fully command, you can tell them what to attack or to follow you and that's it, but for a game like this it is good enoughYou can also choose between 3 classes of ships each with a special ability, and also choose weapons and bonuses for them in a War shop.There is a lack of graphical options, and I experienced a lot of graphical glitches with the land texturesThere is also a lack of controller customization options, and I would like to change some buttons so that's one down side, like boosting with a trigger instead of a controller face button. The trigger is for landmines and torpedoes... so, yeah. But you can customize mouse and keyboard options, but like I said you definitely want to use a controller imoDon't expect much from the story and cinematics. The voice acting of the English side is good enough, but the stereotypical Russian voice acting is so bad... the game has sub titles and gameplay pauses during cutscenes, so why not get Russians to speakers to speak Russian and we can read the subs? This goes out to all game devs, but anyway you aren't going to get this game for the story and cinematics.There are some variety of enemies, but it is quite repetitive, but still fun to zip aroundI have not played multiplayer, the game seems unpopular, mostly hated, but imo it is hated for wrong reasons, although there are some issues as I mentioned. There is no online multiplayer, which is a real shame, only localIt's often on sale for 80% off. If you have a controller, get it for some fun gameplay of zipping around in a speedboat. Not at full price, because of the lack of customization in the options menu and the land texture glitches.			"

												Ultimately, Naval Warfare is a decent arcade shooter. Unfortunately, the storyline is confusing and the levels are inconsistent in difficulty--many levels are maddeningly easy, while others are suddenly extremely difficult. This makes for a frustratingly uneven campaign experience, and because upgrades are level-specific, there's little reason to want to replay this title. Multiplayer isn't much better, as it's limited by the fact that you're unable to make custom maps or play online.			"

												Just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. What makes me wonder what kind of stupid people designed this game is that torpedo's are worthless because you can only fire them from the front of your ship and since you have to never stop moving you basically usually can't hit anything with them. Like one online review said, the campaign has some serious difficulty spikes, going from the game being a breeze to being very difficult. I made it to the part where you escort 3 ships north and you get flooded with enemy ships. I probably could've been more careful and not died, but I died and it made me start the whole thing over again. Definitely one of those ""are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? I have to do this♥♥♥♥♥♥all over again?"" moments. And it wasn't the first time on that part. I had to retry it once because the game crashed during it, which from what I have read in the forums this game has problems with constant crashes. It also has a really bad graphical glitch that I have seen a ton of other people say affects them as well, which is that any terrain and mountains have a black interlaced flashing effect. It is really very distracting. Another thing you will/should notice unless you are legally ret@rded is the horrible writing. The voice acting is fine, but the script sounds like something a seven year old would write.Is it a fun game though? No, not really. The combat is arcade shooter style but just never feels that fun. Your ship goes too fast and when you fire it slows down while firing, but you still have to keep moving while firing to avoid enemy fire. You can never, ever be still in this game, which like I said makes torpedos nearly totally useless. It just never feels satisfying as a game, period. None of anything I have to say about the gameplay matters anyway because the game randomly crashes, making it unplayable.Steam should absolutely take all the profits from this current sale in which was when I bought it and give refunds to everyone, even people with no problems because the game just ♥♥♥♥ing sucks even without the numerous horrible crushing problems. It sucks bad enough that they should force people that have it and like it to be removed from their library and be given a refund because anyone who thinks this is a good game is a sorry human being with horrible, dog crap taste in gaming.Bad graphical glitch, random crashes, uneven campaign difficulty spikes, horrible writing, and being generally unfun bury this so far in the water it should never be salvaged for parts. Ever. I don't think I have ever seen a game with so many legitimate problems all happening at once like this. Truly staggering, -450/10. Yes you read that right, negative four hundred and fifty out of ♥♥♥♥ing ten. Hopefully anyone involved with making this never works again, for any reason whatsoever.			"

No freedom of choise, simple graphics, no strategical or tactical elements, just shoot everything on your sight with that lonelly ship, which is your actual fleet. Not much to do... At least, in first 3 missions. I kinda expected more, but still, there is this attractive discount... 99 cents. A whole dollar! Oh boy... That was the main argument for me to buy it and I must say, it worth 1 dollar. It will keep you entertained for... Half hour... Maybe.			"

												Worth a $1 yes but its a port from console and the controls dont work well with keyboard as you have Up down left right but no diaganal which much of the game play it makes control very challenging, with a controller that has a pov its fun to play and well worth the price a good few hours entertainment.

												Im going to be honest, after seeing most of the negitive reviews I didn't even play this game until this morning.  Now, im glad I did.  This game is really a decent twin stick shooter if your using a 360 controller.  It plays nice and its only real short comings is the voice acting is like a B movie gone bad, but who cares about that. This game is about game play and I personally think they did a pretty good job of it.  This is a game you should add to your library as specially if you can get it on sale.6/10 Decent Game			"

												Naval Warfare, known to console gamers as ""Aqua"", is a competent and well-executed twin-stick shooter that came in well under my radar. I am fortunate to have discovered it, as it's a satisfying blend of fast action and classy presentation, with beautiful hand-drawn cutscenes and that smoky steampunk taste. It's rare to see such a game put you in control of a boat rather then a land or air vehicle. As you progress through the campaign you are eventually given a choice of three different warships, each with a unique special attack and a wide variety of regular weapons. There's a few annoying escort missions, but most of the time you are on the glorious assault, facing hordes of enemy vessels and those classic, massive shmup bosses.			"

												This game is a purely action game. Any pretensions at RP are nowhere. You don't carry over mods to your weapons or keep any squads you hire when you go to the next ""stage.""There's also that problem with the controllers. Based on the forum discussions, this is a port from the XBox 360 so it was designed to play with an analogue stick. With the keyboard, you only have WASD. And the damned thing is so hard to move around.For those who care, the backstory seems rather weak although the world seems rather interesting. The voice acting is also not so good, but not truly horrendous.Too bad because it seems to be a fun shoot-em-up kind of action game with stages.			"

												finished in 4 hours on medium difficulty. not too bad a game but way from good enough to recommend anyone to spend any amount of money and time on.usually i go easy on games like this.they are as old as they are cheap.they don't pretend to be brilliant. they just offer you the opportunity to kill your time while exploring other genres for little money.but this one just doesn't cut it. it's short, owners of nvidia gpus get flickering textures on terrain and the controls are clumsy and counterintuitive. while the carnage is decent the missions are uninspired, enemies just spawn randomly all around you and the boss fights are annoying thanks to the bad controls.the steampunk / gothic style of the game is very decent, i'll give them that. but that alone doesn't save the day.so if you are looking for some casual game for 2 bucks to spend some time on you better keep looking. unless you are a real hardcore fan of the genre there is not much to enjoy here.i'm glad it's over and i will never ever play this again.unless they add trading cards and achievements. ;-)but i don't see that happen. this fish has been dead in the water for years and while it may not stink too much you certainly don't want to have it for lunch.

												It is very poorly optimized. The textures keep flipering, wich makes the game visualy unbearable. There are almost no graphics options and changing them don't help with the textures problem.			"
