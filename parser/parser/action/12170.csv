Short version: 73%It’d be a lie to say GTA1 aged well, but the first entry of the series is still a fun arcade game about carjacking and other criminal activities, with the kind of satiric humour that stood the test of time.Long version:Compared to the massive open world lumbering giant the franchise grew into, Grand Theft Auto 1 is a simple top-down arcade action game, inspired by the highway car chase helicopter news casts.The simplicity is reflected in the core mechanics: instead of playing through a story (which this game lacks pretty much entirely), all six levels require a target score to pass. While almost every action gives points, the intended way to progress is to raise the score multiplier, usually by completing missions. These missions are barely anything more than a random set of objectives, tied together with some immature and politically incorrect, yet not too controversial flavour text with some (black) humour and social satire.The game is easy in many regards– enemies aim terribly, the police are quite ineffective, and all tasks can be described in a few words– but many small annoyances can ruin gameplay. For example, there are no mission retries, and when even the player dies in one hit, it is easy to fail a task on the first try.The best way to approach GTA1 is to think it as a memorisation game: learn the city layouts, weapon locations, and the mission objectives, and it’ll go smoothly. Just don’t forget that there is no save, so each stage has to be completed in one sitting. The game engine is ancient and difficult to run on any modern system. On top of that, it can cause nausea with the jerky camera movement and wonky frame rates. And when it works, the player can enjoy the interesting physics that turn every vehicle into a bouncy bumper car.Still, if you can live with these limitations, GTA1 can still hold itself on its own as a good arcade game that can warrant a replay from time to time.

												Grand Theft Auto is the root of open world exploration and gameplay. Released in 1998, this classic title started jump started the future for gaming. I don’t recommend this game just because it’s classic, I recommend it because it genuinely has good gameplay. The world is rather large for a game of the late 90s, and gameplay is actually better than a lot of Indies of today. Multiple mission routes mean endless replay value. If you’re not the type to follow story, just go around stealing cars and killing ♥♥♥♥♥es, hoes, and pedestrians for mad points. It’s a real shame the developers gimped on the graphics of Grand Theft Auto. Even for a late 90’s game, the graphics for Grand Theft Auto is god awful. When my avatar leaves his car, I can’t tell the difference between his front and backside; this makes shooting quite chaotic and confusing at times. If you look pass the graphics, there is lots of fun to be had from this classic title. Play it.			"

												To be honest, I was never a big fan of first Grand Theft Auto game. Maybe I was a little too young to understand how to take missions, back then I also didn't understand much of english. So, the only thing I was doing was driving around, killing people and jumping on THAT bridge. It was probably enought for me to have fun. Not sure how much time spend playing like that but I know one thing - it didn't lasted that long for sure. There were many good games around that time so I probably moved to another game. After years, I wanted to give first GTA game another try. Finished some missions, played around for some time and, at least for now, no more. First of all, this game is really hard compared to other games in series. You can't save game after mission - you need to get way too much cash if you want to ""save"" your progress and move to next level. Does that mean it's no fun at all? NO. It's really fun. I probably enjoyed it more than newest Grand Theft Auto games. It's kind of game made purely for fun. Also, that main theme song (Joyride by Da Shootaz) is my second favorite one in whole series, it's so great. There is only one thing that I'm kinda of mad at - Rockstar never released mission packs (London 1969 and London 1961) on Steam. For what reason? I'm not sure. Since they brought back Steam pages for both first and second Grand Theft Auto games, maybe one day they will do something about those addons... at least I hope so.At the moment I'm making this review, there is no way to buy first GTA game on Steam. You can hunt for old GTA Complete Packs on websites which sells games BUT there is no guarantee that it will be included at all. Guess you could also check Steam forums, there are always people who are making info about that. If you are fan of series, if you ever wanted to try it or maybe you played it years ago - doesn't matter, it's worth all the trouble of trying to get it.			"

												The one that started it all - and I mean getting the editor of the Daily Mail to threaten to resign if the game wasn't banned. Four games later, the GTA series succeeded. Back to the original, witness (read: cause) such atrocities like 'Gouranga': achieved by running down lines of Hare Krishna monks. Beg, kill, steal, and cheat your way into avoiding cops to earn your cool million bucks. Then get out of town as fast as you can... crime just isn't what it used to be.			"

												GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAND THEFT AUTOAnyway. Both this game and GTA2 were taken off the Steam store, likely due to licensing shenanigans on Rockstar's part. This also means that you cannot create new reviews of either game. Lucky for me, I posted a joke review years ago, consisting of that one-liner at the top.The game itself is an old top-down arcade-style open-world game where you must complete missions and wreak havoc to gain points. Each city has two 'levels' containing missions, and you can only save at the end of each level. Once you get enough points you can advance to the next level. Liberty City, Vice City and Los Santos all make their debut in this game. The controls can be difficult, and when you're driving, the car and camera often move too fast for you to react to obstacles.This isn't exactly a stellar game, but it's interesting to witness the birth of GTA, even though it wouldn't assume the form we know it as now until GTA III was released. The main menu is deliciously '90s, at least. If you consider yourself a game history buff or a connoisseur of old games, try this one out if you can find it.			"

												GTA1 is a PC classic by now. The first two GTA games are both in a 2D top-down style. The gameplay resembles what you'd expect to find in any Grand Theft Auto game: steal cars, run down pedestrians, and evade the police. The difference is that this game offers very little else. There's a very loose mission structure, but really very little reason to care about them. This game truly is a sandbox, which can be fun to play around in, but the lack of direction prevents it from holding your attention for too long.The graphics are decent for the time. The sound can get obnoxious quickly, and there's no music. The controls aren't very good, and I found it imposible to play with a controller.At the very least, the price is right. You can't buy it individually on Steam, but it's free on Rockstar's website.			"

												Grand Theft Auto:Some games are better left forgotten...Remember when GTA II first came out on playstation in the 90s? I do. I recall being sick, so I couldn't attend school. I sat in the living room playing Grand Theft Auto II - and boy was it glorious!This game is the predecessor, GTA.I decided that 20 years later I should give it a try, with all those fond memories of GTA II. Let me tell you, this game is NOT GREAT and for that matter, neither is GTA II - not anymore - they used to be.Through my nostalgia, I still thought they were.Positives:+ Good childhood memories, which I guess is always important.Negatives:- Disgusting graphics, birds eye view obstructs vision of anywhere you drive or run.- No story, no clear objectives, difficult to complete missions (due to the flaws of the game).- Rampages and killing is not fun, nothing is fun in this game! GTA is simply too old to be enjoyable. It's a product of its time - a gem when released. Sadly, being a 2D game means it has no place in modern gaming and its replay value is essentially zero.Valve no longer sells it anyway, so this review is just for the lols.2/10			"

												Sometimes we like to play the original games of successful franchises so that we can appreciate where they all began, but this isn't worth it in the slightest. Bad game.			"

												One awesome little game that started it all. It only has a top down view that takes a few mins to get adjusted to, but once you get the controls, it is a pretty cool little game. It still has all of the crazy and wackiness as the new ones, and you also have freedom to make money however you want in the city. The only thing is it has the old school like difficulty, and that might turn others off, but I still think this is an awesome game. You can also play it on anything, even a netbook.			"

												The classic, the one, the only, GTA. This is free to play off the Rockstar Classics site - so no doubt get it for free if possible, but this really started open world gaming. You need a set million X points to progress - get it with missions (easiest way) or by doing whatever you want - police are agressive, top down view is fast and frentic, and it is damn hard in later levels! Wonderful stuff, then and mostly now.			"

												The original and my opinion still the best GTA game.  If you have not played it before what are you waiting for?  It is only a couple of quid and is a very important part of gaming history if nothing else.			"
