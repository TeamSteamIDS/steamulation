D - Difficulty - It is well balanced , its little bit hard for the first time but can be beaten with practice , patience , efficient weapon/style uasage and learning enemy moveset  . You need to be extremely good for higher difficulty levels . After all video games need to be challenging , they are more fun that way . DA was tougher than SE .C - Combat - ♥♥♥♥in amazing , its so much fun to hurl enemies into air , use them as a skateboard , mixing devil arms and melee weapons in the combat and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies . Style play  promotes  chaining of combos . Use of different styles , different weapons and devil arms brings variety in combat and gives fresh and fantastic experience . They just nailed it in this department , style switcher mod for pc takes it to next level . There so many brilliant combo videos on youtube and all are  amazing .B - Boss Fights - Boss fights are simply outstanding . Agni&Rudra , Nevan , Beowulf , Dante's shadow , Vergil fights etc ( one of the best boss ever )  all are amazing . No cutscene , qte ♥♥♥♥ just pure dope gameplay . You have to learn their moves and fight effectively . Bosses are designed well too and give  sense of achievement after beating them . Normal enemies are not that great and not that bad and there is a room for improvement . Loved vergil's and doppelganger's taunts .A - Action - Right in your face intense action . Amazing combat , style play and hordes of enemies keep the action going on . Few puzzles are here and there which save your fingers from getting sore . DMC3 is all about cool & stylish moves/action . DMC3 is one of the best action games ever made . S- Story - Pretty straightforward story , DMC3 focuses more on action/combat and this what i expect from a action game . Minimal story and loads of gameplay . Cutscenes are top notch and action packed esp. when dante gets devil trigger . Vergil & The Lady cutscenes are equally epic . SS - Sick Soundtrack - Battle theme pumps you up and with metal in the background and action going on the screen , one can never go wrong  . Metal + action games combo  gives birth to amazing gaming experience  . Battle theme do get repetitve and sometimes it gets irritating . Vergil 3 and doppelganger themes are great . Last but not the least , just listen to Devils never cry . So ♥♥♥♥in gooooood SSS - SonS of Sparda - Both Dante and vergil are fantstic characters , esp. Dante . Their chemistry is so interesting , both are twins but completely opposite to each other and whenever they interact its fun watch them . Dante is such a badass character with bring it on attitude and vergil on the other hand calm and more  deadly foe .Their design is pretty great too with old school red vs blue touch . No words to describe the battles between them , play it and experience it . Unarguably one of the best combination and boss fight . Rarely you have a opponent who is equally as powerful as you and defeats you . Being your own brother makes things more heated up( only in game :P )Pc port is bad but can be fixed easliy with few fixes , thanks to modding community . Replay value  is great with playable vergil ,  bloody palce mode and ofcourse trying different styles and maximizing them .Masterpiece 9.9/10			"

												Last and Final Warning... DO NOT BUY!!!!!(Fixes for this game are at the bottom of the review. Click on the link) DO NOT GET ON PC!!!! Get the HD Collection on PS3 or Xbox 360 instead. This Game is an AMAZING Game. However, the PC Port of this game is HORRIBLE!!!!! the controlls don't work right and you have to do a ton of unecessary fixes just to have some functionality, not even full functionality. and the resolution is about the same resolution as the original PS2 game so it will not play in HD or in any wide aspact ratio. This is a total waste of your hard earned money. your better off getting the ""Devil May Cry HD Collection"" on PS3 or Xbox 360 where u get the first 3 original DMC games including this one, the controls flow like you where born to play this game, and the resolution is FULL HD! now that is a WAY BETTER buy then this PC version piece of crap. keep in mind that DMC 4 and DMC:Devil May Cry (Remake) works amazing on PC so just becuase this one sucks on PC doesn't mean the other 2 on pc are bad as well. I would recommend DMC 4, and DMC Reamake over this game aswell. Have fun with those other DMC Games. :)I HAVE AMAZING NEWS!!! this link at the bottom of the review will help you fix every single problem this game can dish out! :D. it's in the steam forums. if you really want this game, than you have to see this link. This link will give you everything! how to get full controller functionality, get the proper resolution in game in full screen, and more. this is highly recomended for more advance computer users so, be warned, some of this fixes for some people aren't easy but for most it should be a piece of cake ;) have fun!http://steamcommunity.com/app/6550/discussions/0/864969320373351964/#p1 "

												Most of the negative reviews here are because of technical issues that are solvable on most systems. Fullscreen works by pressing ALT+Enter (maybe not while in the menu or title screen or cutscene, but ingame), widescreen support is available via a hack. On some systems, the resolution may be limited to 640x480 or 800x600, but that is not the normal behaviour. You should get the highest 4:3 resolution closest to your native resolution without a patch. XBox controllers are not officially supported because this game uses directinput for controller support, which is the predecessor to xinput. If you have one of the recent Logitech gamepads (F310 for example), you can choose between directinput and xinput via a hardware switch on the controller, then map the controller keys correctly (setup controller) and the game works out of the box. If you have to use an xbox compatible controller, you have to fiddle around to get the trigger keys working. This is because the trigger keys are analog and on the same axis on the xbox compatible controllers, but are two seperate digital keys on the older standard. Please note that this game was developed before the xbox compatible controllers had been invented! It would have been nice of Capcom to have this version revamped like they did for PS3 and XBox, but they have not.  It is not optimized for the PC and it is an old game, but I still think it is awesome.			"

If you are going to buy the PC version of DMC3, be prepared to configure the game files for a more enjoyable experience!.I'd highly recommend playing the PS3 / Xbox 360 versions that are included in the Devil May Cry HD Collection instead or the PS2 versions of DMC3 as this game is an absolute masterpiece despite how notoriously difficult it is.

												No need to worry about port anymore. Styleswitcher mod fixes everything and turns DMC3 into a dream come true who those who want to experience more out of the game. Ever wanted to use style switching from dmc4 with the 5 different weapon arms and gun arms in the game, then get dat styleswitcher mod. Want to customize some other aspects of hte games engine to allow for even crazier combos, styleswitcher mod. Is this game worth it even if you already own the the hd collection...sadly, only with the style swticher mod. So yeah, as a port, absolutely flawed to the core but a super fast fix in just 5 minutes with styleswitcher mod. Why can't I stop talking about it? It's the best thing that ever happened to dmc3 that's what...though, that's my opinion, so why don't you make your own giving it a go. Infinite combo potential awaits you.http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/It's very easy to set up. Check out styleswitcher mod combo videos while you are at it.AND DON'T LISTEN TO PEOPLE SAYING OTHERWISE NOT TO GET IT! Do yourself a favor and just use this fix for a game that surpasses even the HD version.			"

												This is the third installment in the Devil May Cry® series, but, in lore, the first one.You take the role of the hero in the previous games, Dante. You get to learn more of his past, how his Devil Hunting store came to be and you get to learn more about his brother, Vergil.It's an old game, but still, one of the best Devil May Cries out there, and one of the most fun! You've got several modes of difficulty in this game, some of those being seriously ridiculous and fun.Being it a Hack and Slash, you can't defend. Only dodge. The more you diverse your attacks and taunt your enemy, the more style points you get, to escalate from D (Dope) to SSS (SSStylish). So do levels rank to that based on your performance throughout them.Although, if you get this game, I advise, GET A CONTROLLER and the software Xpadder. Otherwise, this is going to be a major pain to play without. It was made to bear one, it's meant to be played that way.In short, great game, definitly worth getting!			"

												Jesus Christ where to start. The Good:- My god, the gameplay, the gameplay is perhaps one of the best hack and slash experiences EVER. Tear through endless demon hordes as Dante, the cool protagonist of the series. (EXCEPT DMC4) - Difficulty is just right, across all modes you get what you asked for. Although some newcomers may have a hard time trying to beat the harder difficulties like Dante Must Die. - The level of replay ability for such a game is great. Even after you beat every difficulty mode as Dante and Vergil (Two different campaigns) you can still fight huge and dangerous groups of demons in Bloody Palace. The Bad: - Some parts of the game are not so fun, which will make you wanna stop playing and take a break. Puzzles that are very horrid will show up, although once you get through them you'll have a good time fighting bosses and enemies. - The story, I will admit I'm attached to the cast and the story yet looking at it professionally it's not the best. Most players will ignore the story and focus on gameplay which is fine, as you won't be missing that much unless you care for the series. - Your boyfriend/girlfriend will leave you after she finds out you spent a week playing this game and not responding to his/her texts. The Ugly(Oh god the ugly):- DEAR GOD, THE PORT OF THIS GAME IS SO ATROCIOUS. Exhibit A: For most folks this game does not work AT ALL. Exhibit B: For all folks, Xbox controllers are not supported. Exhibit C: WHY CAPCOM but wait, there is a fix Yes, some saint that goes by the name of serpentiem has fixed all these problems with Style Switcher. A mod that not only lets you chose styles in the middle of combat, but also repairs the busted PC port that is this game. http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?- The graphics have not aged well; this is not the kind of game you can expect to look good although the graphics have that PS2 feel to them. I had a lot more to this review but Steam has a pretty strict character limit so, this is the end of the review.

He'll cut you in two with a sword or his wit, nothing can stop him, he's as good as it gets. This game captures that rebellious attidue and bottles it for sale, oozing with sass from every pore.

												once you find a way to get a controler working properly its a pretty enjoyable game... took me a couple days but finally got my logitech f310 to work properly for the most part. The biggest issue I have now is the camera function doesnt work well. To get the controler to work right I used Xpadder 5.3 and played with the settings till I got it to work mapping L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3, and the left stick to WASD. I used xmod which seemed to give me the best use of the controler. no issues with changing the display resolution, but had to figure out how to get it to play full screen (alt+enter) at the title screen, afterwards the game has continued to start in full screen... the second issue I came across was figuring out how to exit the game, again alt+enter then click the red x. Yet to try it but I think alt+F4 might work for exiting as well. So far great game but the porting was ♥♥♥♥ poor.			"

												Like real talk, the port is ♥♥♥♥ no question. It should by no means still be even on the store at least not at £15.99 in it's state. But with a the styleswitcher mod it's good as new, you wont even mind the smell. Step 1: go here http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/? or your local mod distribute of choice and grab the game. Step 2: Dump all the contents in the zip into the root folder of the game and click the install that was in there. Step 3: Now with that you can enter the styleswitcher.ini and adjust everything to your liking, fixed audio, fully functional resolution options, fixed fullscreen for users with that issue like me. (contains instructions for people not knowing what to do with the .ini)Also contains within the mod further instructions to fix the games outdated controller support which is just fantastic.Don't get me wrong, just because mods exist doesn't excuse the original state it was in, this game doesn't deserve a possitive review, the fan's who went out of their way to fix and find fixes to the game deserve it.

												This is just a negative review of the PC port. I love the Devil May Cry series. I enjoyed Devil May Cry 3 on PS2, I gave Devil May Cry 4 a good review, and I recently bought DmC: Devil May Cry.Devil May Cry 3 on PC is almost impossible to play without a controller and even if you do use a controller, the game uses the left analog stick to control the camera and the right analog stick to control your character, which is HORRIBLE. Skip Devil May Cry 3 and go straight for Devil May Cry 4 and DmC: Devil May Cry instead.			"

												How to make this party Cuhrayzy: The Step-by-step guide1. Buy the game, install 2. Google for DMC3SE style switcher mod3. Follow given instructions4. Lauch the game5. Show your MotivationOptional step: Mess around with mod settings for desired level of Cuhrayzy.While the mod might cause crashes or other problems, I personally can recommend this game only with it, for it makes the PC-version clearly superior version compared to original, emulated or HD-remake. Easily the best starting point for this series, story and gameplay-wise, for DMC1 & 2 struggled to find the thing DMC3 finally brought us: Stylish and fast combat, with different combinations of styles and weapons to find and enemies to beat. The main point is combat, which has level of depth rarely seen: Chance to newer players to learn, challenge for those wanting to best Temen-Ni-Gru and ultimate challenge of mastering the combat to ascend to Realm of Super Smokin' Style. I've played this game semi-regurlarly for almost nine years , starigt with the PS2 version, and still finding new stuff to try. That might be a hit-or-miss for some people, since everything else is made to set stage for ever-increasing showcase of crazy combat: The Story, the music, the levels. Two of the latter are not bad and with mods it is possible to put your own soundfiles (or just mute the music and listen some other music). Story is there, if you want life-like characters, good narrative and thought-provoking themes, go read a book. Here you find classical Capcomesque anime-style story about young, superhuman demonhunter who is most likely blowing his pay-check on pizza and energy drinks. So if you want to clash with the forces of Demon Realm with Style, get the game, apply the mods and get on the ride to experience a piece of best Third Person Action made by Capcom and in my opinion, the history of action games.PS. While mod helps with keyboard & mouse controls, i personally recommend to play with a gamepad.			"

												Word of advice for those who buy this you need two things-Style Switcher mod (for most fun lets you switch styles like DMC4 and some fixes and tweaks)*OR-(though I don't condone piracy but since this exe is outdated) Get a cracked 1.3 DMC3SE.exe file (fixes A LOT of framerate issues)(sadly they don't work in tandem)The Good-Stylish but aged combat style system (fixed with this mod)*-Banging Music-Fun-Vergil-Unlockable costumes-High replayability (which can be extended by the mod)*-pretty challengingThe Bad-A bit unfair boss fights (basically fake difficulty)-The problems with the games' combat shows on higher difficultiesThe Ugly-Poorly optimized due to audio bug(mods and patchs previously mentioned mitigate some of these chinks in the armor)-Overpriced for how old and un-updated it isIf your willing to tweak the game and the game happens to be on sale I say buy it.

												Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening. -Or Special Edition, as it is now.The best game in the series yet, in my own humblest opinion.The story is awesome, gameplay is top notch just like any other DMC game.Now... The port.. is bad.. It IS playable and you CAN use a controller.But it is STILL A BETTER PORT THAN DARK SOULS 1 WAS. But people seem to ignore that.I love this game to bits.If you do happen to own a Playstation 2, 3 or 4, consider getting the original or HD versions there instead.EDIT: Yes, I was able to complete it with my keyboard entirely, but I do enjoy it more with a controller. The controller support is good.			"

												DMC3 is a wonderful game, but stock the port has some issues:Only 4:3 resolution optiionsSwitched analog sticks with controllersPoor default button layoutThis annoyances are pretty significant to me BUT the DMC3 Style Switcher mod fixes these issues. I did run into a bit of trouble getting the mod installed, but now that the annoyances are taken care of I'm very happy to have this game.Out of the box, maybe I wouldn't reccomend it, but with the mod, yes. This is still the skill based, combo slinging, and currency grinding game it's always been.			"

												Devil May Cry 3 is absolutely CUHRAYZEE.+ Undisputed god-tier gameplay that's fun as all hell with the highest skill ceiling in gaming because it has so much depth and exploitation that you can basically become a god.+ Loads of weapons and styles that offer unlimited gameplay potential.+ The style meter that keeps track and judges your combat performance and how often you switch your attacks up.+ Powerups that you aren't forced to rely on and are even frowned upon since they detract from your ending mission rank.+ Fantastic boss fights at the end of almost every single mission.+ Fantastic level design that manages to be more than linear corridors.+ Metal as f*ck music that perfectly pumps the moment.+ Likable characters all around with cheesy but fantastic voice acting.+ Goofy but charming cutscenes that are absolutely cuhrayzee.- Like two bosses out of the entire game manage to be lackluster.- Some styles will be more useful than others and you may end up relying on just one or two the entire game.You must know that the PC port is absolutely garbage and you will NEED to download the ""StyleSwitcher"" mod from Nexus to get this game to run properly. It's so bad that the f*cking music files of all things make the game drop frames slightly, even with the mod. If you wish to play this game in an optimal way, buy the DMC HD Collection for either PS3 or Xbox 360 which looks and runs perfectly at 60fps and comes with DMC1, 2, and 3, all great games (except 2..).The game itself is a 9/10. Play it any way you can but be warned the PC version requires work and some sacrifices like turning off some sound and music files.			"

												The issues with this game.Frame Rate drops randomly, not sure if that is for everyone or if there is a fix. Also, some sounds act up for me, like the Gigapede boss music cut off half way through the fight.The good stuff? It is dmc3. I have a guide on how to fix the shotty controller settings for MotioninJoy, so that isn't much of a issue if you have a ps3 controller for the game. So if you get this game, and not a cry baby about ""my game isn't always at 60FPS!"" then this game is for you.. If not, There is the DmC HD collection for console. Which is also nice when that doesn't glitch.(which only happend once to me.)Kinda amazed steam allows the game to have so many bugs though, and still be sold. Felt it should of been fixed long ago.

												before you read my review or buy the game remember DMC3 is a amazing game I highly suggest you buy it, I have bought it three times now but DON'T buy the pc version if you don't want to tear your hair out in frustration but more of that later.Lets start the actual review now shall we?First the story - The story takes place a few years before the first devil may cry, Dante who has yet to pick a name for his shop is just hanging around when a man named Arkham enters and tells Dante his brother has a invitation for him. Dante is then attacked by lessor demons but quickly (and stylishly) kills them all and this starts the events of the game and overall the story is pretty good best in the series has some insane motioncapture and good voice acting (compared to DMC1 and DmC this is oscar worthy)Second the styles - You can choose between four different styles which are Swordmaster where your melee weapons have more moves, do more damage and let you combo in the air easily, Gunslinger lets you use your guns in extremely stylish ways from spinning in mid air while fireing down to curb stomping a demon while shooting him in the head and its a pleasure to watch the animations, Royalguard works as a block button but it doesn't stop there sure you can block and take reduced damage but if you perfectly time your block you can absorb all damage and release it in a extremely damaging attack that if you build enough damage up you can instant kill some of the tougher demons, Trickster gives you another type of dodge, a teleport, a air dash and the ability to run on walls, Trickster can be used to create insane combos if you know what you're doing. There are two other styles quicksilver and doppleganger which let you slow down time and create a copy of yourself and thats about it but if used right are deadly (doppleganger unlocks a hidden two player mode to)Third the combat - The combat in this game is insanely fun with a total of 5 devil arms (melee weapons) and 5 fire arms (guns) for Dante and the ability to bring any combination of weapons (two devil arms two fire arms) and one of 6 styles to choose from this game has a crazy ammount of depth in its combat especailly since all weapons and styles (except doppleganger and quicksilver) can be upgraded and gain more moves.Fourth Extras - With the special edition you are able to play as Vergil who has 3 devil arms and no fire arms but shoots summond swords instead and a single style (he has less depth then Dante but is fun to play) After you beat the game once you can start a new game as Vergil you will be given a cutscene that takes place before DMC3 but don't get your hopes up he ends up going through the same levels as Dante (from the Devil May Cry all the way to hell) The style switcher mod does work on Vergil but you can only use dark slayer (Default style) and Dante's quicksilver style (due to the other styles not working right or them already being a part of Dark Slayer)Fifth should you buy it - In short yes you should buy this game...... if you have a playstation 2 the pc version is a extremely bad port and it is fixable (I fixed it after spending over 10 hours configureing it) it just takes a lot of time and a lot of reading user guides on how to fix it. On the brightside of the pc version is the ability to mod and the famous style switcher mod (go get it now) which lets you change to any of the 6 styles at any time in game without having to stop at a statue to change them (it also comes with other features that let you customize the game further but I won't get into that)If you use a controller be prepared to break it in half with your teeth out of pure rage when you find out the triggers don't work and the sticks are reversed (right stick moves you left stick turns camera) there are fixes for this but they don't always work and if you are useing Motioninjoy be prepared to just quit (I made a discussion post on how to fix a ps3 controller with motioninjoy but if you are useing any other controllers good luck to you)I also hope you have a somewhat decent computer cause this game runs like hell the framerate is subpar and requires you to delete audio files (really?) to get the framerate up but it stops the badass soundtrack from playing if you do so (luckly for me my computer can handle it)Final - Do i recommend this game? again yes if you can get a console copy or if you are willing to spend 10+ hours fixing it, if you have no choice but to buy it on PC buy it when it goes on sale it usualy drops down to $7.50 but this is one of my favorite games of all time it just has a bad pc portLet's Rock!

												Capcom. Wtf man? Ok - without checking forums (and I should never have to do that) it won't run in anything other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ windowed mode. It's not designed to, or adapted to, 360 compatible joysticks which is pretty much the only stick anyone has. Sure you can reconfigure the joystick but you'll have to remember  what the hell button 4 or 7 or 2 is, and there's no guide or helpful hint so you're just left stabbing in the dark. The only way to get the game working properly (and i'm not sure that I can) is going to be if i go and check forum posts - that just shoudn't happen. It should work perfectly out of the box for the vast majority of setups. They haven't even tried. I should have known after the Ducktales affair (where Capcom released a game that they KNEW was fundamentally broken) that Capcom were going to butt♥♥♥♥ me on this one but like a fool I thought it couldn't be THAT bad. Boy was I wrong. Buy it if you want an example of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy a port can be. Otherwise avoid like the plague.EDIT: After checking the forums you can apparently edit the ini file to get the 360 controller working kindasorta but for some it doesn't work and too bad if you're not comfy with editing files like that.Then you need the styleswitcher mod to get the most of the game, And then, no matter how beastly your pc, there are a couple of points where there's really bad framerate drops due to *gasp* music playing. Once you get through all that...it's apparently not too bad. The sad fact is that Capcom could and should easily release a patch that would fix the 360 controller problem. But they won't. Why? Because they are a pack of something that ryhmes with punts.So still a big no go from me. And it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy another Capcom game.			"

												If you come here expecting a 4K experience, you came to the wrong place. Maximum you'll get from the game is 1400x1050, which can be enhanced with mods, but I haven't dwelt on those. What I did was use the Windowed Borderless Gaming software to upscale it to 1920x1080. This is a straight up port from the PS2 version of the game. So much so, that you need to either Alt+F4 out of it or boot up Task Manager to terminate the .exe. Another gripe you might have with this game is the control scheme. Again taken straight from the PS2 game, so if you plug a Dualshock 3 controller to your computer with no modification to it's drivers, it will work perfectly. However, you won't be able to use that controller for any other games in it's current state as it isn't recognized as an X-Input controller, which is what other games ask for. Nevertheless, there are tutorials out there in the forums to help you out in configuring your controller so that it works perfectly without too much hassle when switching between games. Now, once you do get your controller running decently with the game I can guarantee one single thing; absolute fun. Being the straight port it is from the PS2 game, the mechanics are exactly the same and they're so intuitive you'll only need a couple of tries till you get the hang of the moves to then execute them to great effect. However, while the skill floor is reasonably low, the skill ceiling is super high. To master the game you WILL have to pour a lot of time and effort into it. Therefore, it boils down to the following: If you want to complete the story, you'll be able to do it without having to practice for hours. It's very accessible for that.If you want to complete every difficulty and unlock everything, get ready to climb those Rocky stairs over and over again. You'll need to learn how to perform every combo consistently, every enemy moveset and understand every mechanic thoroughly, as there is a mode where you die in 1 hit.In conclusion, if you don't mind going through the hassle of solving the issues I pointed out, then;This party is just getting started!- Dante "

												Decided to review it to save the fools who are looking into this on launch.TLDR: Amazing game. Brutally difficult. You gotta ""git gud"" as they say if you want to make it past the first few levels of the game. Combat is fluid, graphics are okay for the time. Isn't much better than the PS2 version. Story's ""meh"" and the cutscenes are so cheesy it's...still kind of good. It was during the whacky time of Capcom after all.Now for why I'm giving it a negative review:The PC version adds _NOTHING_ from the PS2 version of ""Special edition"" If you already have it on PS2/3/Xbox360, there isn't much of a reason to rebuy it unless you wanted to play on your PC. The port is godawful. Doesn't recognize controllers, awful keyboard button layouts, awful resolution settings, this game is a MUST to get a mod just to make it playable. A bunch of reviewers kindly put the link down to ""patching the game"" into a playable state. I'll copy and paste it here too as a sign of thanks for actually reading this review, i guess.Basically; great game, awful port.http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/? "

												This i an AMAZING game that I played years ago on the PS2.  Everything about this game is rediculous.  The combat, the story, the cutscenes, it's all over the top crazy action, and I love it.  I bought this on Steam to try to replay it with some better graphics, but unfortunately, this game was not optimized for PC at ALL.Controller support is awful, you CAN get some of them to work, but it isn't easy, and you have to a lot of research to find out how to get it to work.  Graphics are technically better than they were on the PS2, but widescreen support is not built in, so if you are one of the normal PC users that have a 16:9 or 16:10 screen, you will have blackbars on the sides of the screen.  There is a mod to 'fix' this, but it basically just stretches the screen, so it looks awful.Capcom didn't try very hard on the PC version of this game, which is unfortunate, because it's one of the best DMC's.  Try Devil May Cry 4 or DMC, they have way better support, so they know how to do it right, just not wortgh their effort to fix this version I guess. TL;DR version - Great game, but badly ported.  Play the game, just not the PC version.			"

												I'm sure other reviews here will say roughly the same as I'll say.This is a rather poorly made port of DMC3 for the PS2. It's not entirely unplayable as some may lead you to believe, but it's bad enough to make you want to not play the game despite how fun it is.Most console controllers will refuse to work for the game and what DOES work will leave you wanting more, such as not being able to use one of your joysticks. You CAN download a program to fix this and it's really not the main issue with the port because it can be fixed. The real problem comes from the fact that you will have massive, and I mean MASSIVE fps drops in multiple locations resulting in it being neigh unplayable.But in those non-large areas where fps is stable and you fix the controller up, it works rather well for a port.I wouldn't recommend it because it's far too much work to get everything in working condition.(At this point there might even be a fix for the FPS drops but I didn't care to look for it)THAT ALL BEING SAIDIf you don't have a problem with everything I said, feel free to pick up this game.

												As a huge Devil May Cry fan, this game hold up the standards just as well as it's predecessors,possibly even better (I'm looking at you DMC2).From a general game perspective, it is a solid Hack and Slash game with memorable characters,a simple but enjoyable story, and more importantly you get to beat the crap out of demons while being a totalbadass. (Also it's pretty challenging so, if you don't like handholding- this is the game for you)I've had and played this game for about 4 years now, and still love it dearly. (Although it only says 30 hours on Steam, I also played it a lot on PS3 later).But recently I came to notice how low the Steam ratings for this game were, and I read through the reviews to see why.From what I've seen, it's all in regards to the port itself, which is understandable.I've personally never had a problem running the game on Steam (even without downloading patches or anything).That said, I do think that the in-game references to the controls are complete jank, because they are based on anumbering system for buttons that VERY unclear. This can be solved by a simple google search to see what each buttondoes. I don't think the frame-rate is optimal (especially for a hack and slash) but it's not unplayable,I really didn't notice it all that much when I first got into the game, but only after I'd had my share of a varietyof hack and slash games and really came to know the genre, did I notice the difference.I also never had a problem using a controller as the controller scheme menu is actually pretty easy to understand,although customization is a bit annoying.In summary:I guess from my experience, I'd say the game is still worth is, especially during Steam Sales, assuming that you can run it.Like I said, it is a bit jank here and there, and it's not an excellent port by any means, but if you are looking to have a hack and slash game that's easy to run on most computers just to casually play whenever, this is the game for you.

												You REALLY need to want to play this game if you want to fix everything in this terrible port. You need to download the style switcher mod and/wide-screen mod (and delete some songs out of the soundtrack) to make it playable at least. With the style switcher mod you can have 1080p/60fps gameplay galore but be warned it can become a hassle to install. Now to the game.This is still to this day the king of the character action/spectacle brawler genre. The trifecta would go as dmc3, bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden Black. To this day no other action game has the complexity and freedom that this game provides in its more or less 20 missions. This is no ""dial-a-combo"" action game, you're free to create your own combos as you wish, just remember that with that freedom comes the weight of complexity as it is no easy game. The skill ceiling goes through the roof, just look at any MAD combo on YouTube. The good thing is that this game is constantly challenging and if you're willing to put the work it will grow with you abilities. There's a lot of difficulty modes which you unlock by beating the game in the difficulty that comes before it and with each new difficulty comes new challenges, a more aggressive AI and even a mode where you cannot get hit. Seriously...this amount of depth has not yet been rivaled by any game in the genre. TL;DR : if you like action games, tough bosses, depth in your combat mechanics, freedom to play as you want, a difficulty that has a pretty high ceiling but eases you up into it this is the game for you. Be aware that you have to be willing to pull off the mods to make it work correctly and also be aware that this game asks a lot from you as s gamer. If you're up to the challenge and you're willing to put in the time this is s sure recommendation. Just like crossfit or a pretty long book, this isn't for everybody but if you're up for the challenge I assure you you'll love it.			"

Devil May Cry® 3 Special Edition ReviewOne of the best hack'n'slash games ever made, is available on Steam with worst PC port i have ever played.PC portThis is without a doubt, the worst PC port i have ever played. Controlls are terrible, sticks are inverted (left stick controlls the camera, right one controlls the movement), framerate is awful, and graphics are downgraded. What the hell Capcom!? But..... thankfully Style Switcher mod exists. It fixed resolution, controlls and graphics can look bit better. However it didn't fix framerate for me, so i had to delete some songs from the game in order to make it stable, which is just bad. StoryDevil May Cry 3 is a prequel to the original Devil May Cry (which totally deserves to be on Steam...). One day, while young Dante was minding his own business in his shop which he hadn't opened yet, a misterious menacing man called Arkham appeared, and gave Dante an ''invitation'' from his brother Vergil. Vergil thirsts for poweri suppose because he was unable to save his mother and protect his son Nero, and he wants to obtain the strenght of his father Sparda. But in order to do so, he must sacrifice humanity, and that's when Dante is going to try to stop him. In the mean-time, a young lady called Mary (see what i did there?) wants to avenge her mother, by killing the one responsible for her death. The one and only, Arkham. Dante and Mary will occasionally meet each other, and as expected, they will start from hating each other to having huge respect for each other. And now, without saying what will happen, a war between good and evil begins!Cutscenes are awesome, and i rarely skip them. Story is nothing too special, but it's quite amusing.GameplayThis is one of the best hack'n'slash of all time. There are many weapons, items, enemies, and of course, huge difficulty. Is it unfair? No, it's totally fair, and if you died, then it's your fault for not being good enough. Should you feel bad if you die? No, because this game can be ridiculously difficult at moments, but practice makes perfect! Now, there are 2 playable characters:Dante: Haves 6 styles, 5 weapons, 5 firearms. Trickster Style is for those who prefer to have an ''escape'' and ''approach'' ability, which makes it great for evading attacks from enemies and going towards them. Swordsmaster Style is for those who want to go full berserk on demons. Gunslinger Style is for those who prefer more firepower over slashing. Royal Guard is for those who grew up with SF3 and want to parry everything. Quicksilver Style is for those who want to have ''NOW FREEZE!'' button, which usually means your enemy is defenseless, or you're getting pressured. Doppleganger Style is for those who want to.... well honestly i don't know much about this one, let's just say for Naruto fans, because of clones..... Now, if you have Style Switcher mode installed, you can be all of the above at once! As for weapons and firearms, the combo possibilities are endless, so you won't get bored easily.Vergil: Haves 1 style, 3 weapons, 1 firearm. Dark Slayer Style is perfect for evading, approaching, and trolling your opponents. It's so fast, and it works just like you want it to. His main sword Yamato doesn't have many combos, but Judgement Cut ability is ridiculously broken. Beowulf and Infinite Edge are great too, but not as much. His ''firearm'' is basically summoning swords which can fly at your enemies and spin around you for area damage. Best thing is that they  won't stop your attack animation, which means you can spam it as much as you want while beating hell out of demons.All in all, gameplay is fantastic.GraphicsI loved the PS2 graphics, so why the hell are there so many missing details and filters in PC version? It looks washed out. Thankfully, Style Switcher mod haves an option to make graphics slightly closer to PS2 version, but it's still not good.SoundtrackSoundtrack is very atmospheric, and it makes you feel like a badass demon slayer. Genre? I..... suppose electronic rock/metal, i don't really knowOverallOne of my favorite games of all time, with worst PC port in existence. Installing Style Switcher mode can be a pain in the a*s, and after that, you have to set up your controlls and other stuff. Again, this didn't fix horrible framerate for me, so i was forced to play this game without music. IF YOU'RE A DIEHARD, THEN BUY IT ON SALE, IF YOU'RE A NEWCOMER, DON'T BOTHER AND BUY DMC 4: SE OR DMC HD COLLECTION INSTEAD!Devil May Cry 3: 9.5/10PC version: 2/10 but 7/10 with Style SwitcherP.S. Where's my HD Collection on Steam Capcom?			"

												This game was obviously not optimized for PCs in mind. When I started playing it, it was stuck in 640 x 480 resolution with no way to change resolution or to change to fullscreen despite an option for the former in the options menu. What gives? Also, there was no xinput mappings, so my XBox One controller mappings were all over the place; in fact, to move, I had to move the RIGHT analog stick! It made the game extremely unfun and unplayable. Stay away at all costs until or unless these issues are resolved.			"

												A great game if you want a game that challenges you and lets you fight with style! Challenging but entertaining fights, a combat system that is fun to explore, and an amusing protagonist to join the ride. It's a bit tricky in the beginning, and you may need some time to get into the mechanics, but it feels very good and rewarding once you get going. At the end of levels you can get ranked from D to S on various things, so there's a lot of room to practice your skills. A less good part of the game would be a bit dodgy platforming in some parts, but they are generally far and between. Oh, and this is not a very good port on it's own. If you want to buy this, remember to download the mod that fixes it up as well!I loved this game, and if you like Platinum style games you may enjoy it too!			"

												First and foremost I'm playing this game with the steam controller and have found a preset that works for me, what didn't work for me where mouse & keyboard or the xbox one controller. The game is a true classic and if you can life with a few drawbacks(the resolution is not up to date, the keyboard controlls are horrendous and most gamepads are not supported from the get go [check the forums to see how to get modern ones to work]), it's absolutley worth giving it a shot. I do however strongly recomand to install the style changer mod as it resolves many issues one may experience with the game & to play it using the steam controller(many good presets are available) or at least a suported one if you don't want to fiddle arround with remapping tools.

												Although the controls were bad, and the frames would drop sometimes (Mostly when there are more than 3 enemies fighting you), this game was still very good. But I just had one issue with the game that annoyed me. I played with a Xbox 360 controller and had I tons of trouble setting it up. My keyboard controls would be transferred to the Xbox controllers buttons which made it really confusing and hard to play, but once I did it was smooth sailing from there. Good story, good characters, and great boss fights. Devil May Cry 3 may have annoying controls but over time you will get used to them and enjoy the game.			"

But if you don't mind doing some work to make the game work (widescreen and controller support and decrease the lag), then buy it on a sale, because it's a really enjoyable one.

												Well, this is awkward.In case you live under a rock, Devil May Cry 3 is an excellent game, and the Special Edition is a gem among spectacle fighters. However, this port is completely unacceptable. Japanese video game companies aren't exactly known for great first attempts at PC porting, and Capcom is no exception. They DID more than make up for it with DMC4 and DmC, with the PC ports being the superior versions of the game, but this is one I can't whole-heartedly recommend. If you picked up the DmC Complete Pack, you basically got this one for free, but since that bundle no longer seems to exist, I can't recommend this, especially not as a single purchase. Unless you're one of the PC Master Race and refuse to own even what is possibly the best console of all time, drop by a GameStop and pick this game up from a used games bin, for a better experience and a much more reasonable asking price. The Steam version of DMC3:SE should only be an absolute last resort.			"

I also can not close this game out without bringing up my Task Manager which is fun.The default controls for my gamepad are completely screwed up and totally backwards from the original scheme. without even going into the game itself, this is one of the most poorly handled ports I've ever seen to the point where it's literally UNPLAYABLE.Avoid this at all costs and buy DMC4 Special Edition instead.

												Let me say one thing first: The game itself is excellent.However, this port of it is one of the worst things I've ever tried to play.The game launches at 860x480 and crashes if you try to change that.A standard Xbox 360 USB controller isn't supported by default so you have to rebind all the controls. However, something is wrong with how the game detects your inputs, which results in you having to control your movements with the right analog stick while needing A, B, X and Y for combat.So overall, I'd say get this game on console and avoid this heap of trash.

Sure, it takes a while to get the mandatory controller set up, the frames drop quite a bit, it can't go fullscreen, etc., but it's still a good game. Forget about how bad of a PC port it is, and concentrate on the game itself. It's awesome. Super fun hack-and-slash. This game is VERY difficult, If you're new to DMC, this game will take you out back, strip you of your clothes, ♥♥♥♥ you, cut of your manly/womanly parts, keep them as a trophy, and then it will cannibalize your corpse. If you aren't new to DMC, this game will take you out back, dry-hump you, and then only cut off your left nipple. What I'm saying is that it's hard no matter what.			"

												Devil May Cry 3... the king of the hack and slash games and arguably the prime of the series for its insane yet fun difficulty and its skill based gameplay. Unfortunately however this port to the PC is an insult to this legendary game from its god awful controller layout where community members have to manually add their own layout fixes to this lazy port and along with that at  times crappy frame rate issues have occured regardless of how powerful my pc is. For those new to the series PLEASE do not buy this port! I highly recommened instead buying it either for the PS2 or the HD collection for the XBOX 360/PS3 to see how amazing this game really is.EDIT 16/01/15: A mod called ""style switcher"" for this PC port has literally fixed almost every issue completely, it makes the game look 10 times better with fog and gamma fixes, fixing the terrible controller button layout, 1080p support (making it sharper and more crisp than the HD collections DMC 3) and widescreen, even allowing you to switch styles with both Dante and Vergil just like in Devil May Cry 4!!! Unfortunately however the framerate issue still applies, but this can be fixed by removing a select amount of audio files (but that means less badassery during combat :c).If you ever (though i'd still not recommend this crappy port) decide to get this PC port please mod it with the style switcher mod!

												It's a good game but, not the best port. I strongly recommend using a 360 controller of some gamepad. You do unfortuantly have to mod the game by changling the controller script to make the triggers work. But after that it's solid. it's the special edition version so you get a few extra not seen in the original ps2 version. I would reccomend the console hd collection over this. but if a pc is all you got then this isn't a bad place to start in the Devil May Cry Series.			"

You need to actually fix the game youre self by going to sites most common things need fixing-the music becuase for some reason the way they handled it the music makes the game run bad-another thing to fix is the full screen so it actually goes to full screen by its self-lastly fixing the contoler becuase it wont work with a 360 controler.There may be more things that need fixing I think I heard theres some graphical bugs like no lightning and ect...So my last thoughts are just play this on a console or emulate it Becuase it would be easyer and and better.

												Does not work properly. No native controller support, you have to use 3rd party software to make it work, not to mention messing around with the game's ini file to set the controllers right. No native support for modern wide-screens, you have to download a 3rd party patch for that as well. I have also read about issues where the game's fps drops dramatically, where your only solution is deleting a significant number of sound files. Sadly, I never got to see those fps issues.I started the game, it looked like crap, the sound was off, and my Sabertooth was not detected at all.Not to say the computer didn't detect it, I had no problem using Steam's 'Big Picture', but, the game simply refuses to work with it.I tried to use solutions from the forum, sadly, I lack knowladge in controllers and thus it is a bit complicated for me. Amongs things I could not understand, is the fact that ControlMK did not show me which key was which, and those that know Sabertooth, know that it has, in it's full configuration, 16 keys, not including the two analog sticks, and the 4 directional buttons on the left lower side.Left with not enough guidance, and no background knowladge of my own, I am forced to give this game up.

People actually recommend to pirate this game (though I refuse to do it and in no way suggest it) as the files include a fix for the numerous issues this port has, and people also suggested to me to emulate this game's playstation 2 edition because even when emulated it runs better and more stable than this port.This makes me sad.

Maybe I'm just lucky (or maybe my 4790k is brute forcing the game into submission), but I haven't had any performance issues.

												So Devil May Cry 3 is a game I played a long time ago on the ps2, and I played the original. The original was much harder as the medium difficulty for that game was the hard for this version of the game. Somehow I beat the game and it was fantastic. Sadly this pc port was done by, get a vomit bucket, Ubisoft. As we all know, anything Ubisoft touches usually gets destroyed, and that is exactly what happened to this pc port. The controls don't work, the right stick controls the movement which is impossible to play with, the game has no support for widescreen moniters, it has a max resolution of 1280x720. Now these issues make the game unplayable. However thanks to the amazing mod authors, all of these issues are fixed with 1 simple mod, Style Switcher. Style switcher fixes the game to allow all resolutions, fixes the controls, makes the game compatible with most widescreen moniters, and it even allows the ability to switch styles with the dpad just like dmc4! It requires a few ini tweaks but overall is easy to install. The game itself is fantastic, theres no question about that, but the main reason this game has downvotes is because of the port, which is all fixed with this mod. So if you want to play dmc3, buy this, get the mod, and play one of the hardest, most rewarding, and one of the best games on ps2.			"

												Let's have a look on one of Capcons most action loaded games Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition for the PC.Platform: PCPublisher: UbisoftDeveloper: CapcomGenre: Fantasy Action AdventureRelease Date: Oct 16, 2006Story: The story so far plays earlier than the orginal Devil May Cry game for the PS2. Its's about the half devil Dante Sparda who tries once again to save the world from the influence of the devil possesed Arkhamand his horde of undead creatures from hell. In this game there is also some very cool new character introduced named Vergil Sparda who is actually Dantes evil twinbrother and most fearsome foe.Virgil works together with Arkham in order to open the gate of hell which was closed long years ago by Dantes father the legandary Devil Knight Sparda. So Dante starts his journey to climb up the unholy tower of evil called ""The Temen-Ni-Gru"" which is summoned by Arkham in order to connect the human world to the demon world. On his way up he crosses lines with a strange woman called Lady who tries to shoot him on sight.The whereabouts of the Temen-Ni-Gru as well as the identity of lady seem very dark and unclear. What the end offers... i can't tell, just play to find out :D 8/10Gameplay: DMC3-Se is a third perspective fantasy action adventure which combines very fast gameplay with lots of combos and various puzzles throughout the game. The fighting system is devided in ""styles"" whichDante can switch between Missions and also level them up to perform even greater combos. There are also special obiects called orbs to collect as well as a very great varaety of fire and melee weapons throughout the game. 8/10Controls: This is one of the main problems with the PC version of DMC3-Se because its totally bugged and you need a patch in order to convert the right keyboard comands to some gamepad. 4/10Graphic: This is unfortunately another minus for the PC port as you will see some graphics in ingame arent drawn very correctly as the PS2 version and also some parts of the game seem pretty greyscale due to the direct X output of your PC, nevertheless the FMV movies are really great. 7/10Sound: I have to mention that the sound is absoluty awesome. DMC3-Se brings some very good soundtrack and very nice soundsamples combined with very thrilling metal music. 9/10My Review: First of all I have to say that I have played only the PC version of DMC3-Se hench I am writting this review for the PC version of that great game.The game starts right of in Dantes office with one of the most impressive and action loaded FMV movies I saw so far. After the nice introducing of the control tutorial you are directly thrown into action to kick some demon butts. You will learn very fast the combos and special attacks if you play the first time through this game. Actually you can change between 4 styles called Trickster, Gunslinger, Royal Guard and Swordmaster. As the names describe, each style is bound to some very cool and unique special attack and combos. For example if you like using long range weapons than you can choose Gunslinger for improving your shoot abillities but if you prefer short range you can go along with Swordmaster. All in one I really liked the style system and the idea of combining different styles. So after you have killed tons of demons and alot of other evil guys you will be introduced step by step through very cool FMV movies to the story of this game which is in my opinion really great. The game is divided in 20 Missions, and you will come across some very cool and though bosses, one remarcable of them will be Dantes twinbrother Virgil who actually seems to interfere with Dante on purpose. The boss fights are one big plus in this game because they really deliever some thrilling and decent difficulty (at least if you play on very hard or Dante must die mode). What I really liked about this game is the character developement its really different from DMC2 which was... to put it bluntly ""it sucked"". I would generally say that the difficulty in this game is fair and really depends on what scale you play. I beat this game on hard mode in 9 hours but some other guys sure need between 15 - 20 hours. Also after beating the entire game you can unlock Vergil as a playable character, and this is included in the Special edition only as well as some other nice feature I will mention beneath.So what are the differences between the original Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening and Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition you may ask ?Well here they are:Difficulties:- Easy mode- Hard mode - Very Hard mode- Dante Must Die mode- Heaven or Hell modePlayable Character:- ""Vergil"" is playable after beating the game once with Dante. He brings his own uniqe styles as well as flying swords as his long range weapons.Extra Mode:- ""Bloody Palace"" is available after beating the game once with Dante, its some kind of battle arena where you are thrown in with a limited supply of orbs and must fight random enemies and bosses.Extra Outfits:- 4 new costumes for Vergil unlockable- 6 new outfits for Dante unlockableGallery:-you can unlock diverse Artwork and CGI work form DMC3 hereDemo Digest:- You can preview all Ingame Movies from here- There is also some timelimit in the end of the game where you can beat 100 enemies in order to unlock a hidden endingMiscellaneous:- There are different locations in the game where you know can fight Jester (its that annoying clown BTW)- Lady wears some fency new suit depending on the outfit you choose in Ingame- There is a yellow and gold option at the beginning of the game which allows to use the yellow orbs as restore point after dieing.These are the differences available in the Special Edition of DMC3 as well for the PS2 version as for the PC version which was only released as the Special edition by the way.FInal Words: DMC3 SE sure is some special game for fans of the Devil May Cry series as well as for action fans who like fast and flashy gamplay combined with metal music and gothic ambience. I was very pleased about the importation of this game to the PC and really forgot fast about the undeveloped control settings which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ indeed for people who wants to play the PC version on a gamepad. All I can say is that you should stick with the PS2 version if you are a die hard fan of DMC as for me I also liked the PC version therefore I give this game a 7 out of 10.Endrating: 7/10			"

												Definitely. Add a SSS to that ''Definitely'' if you see the price drop. A word of caution, if you have a XBOX controller, there are HIGH chances of it not working.Devil May Cry 3 is nothing short of genius and none of it gets ruined by the horrible port (considering there is a guide towards multiple fixes in the forums). The numerous weapons and styles guarantees a playstyle up your alley, and difficulty gets cranked to insane levels, bosses to dream for, enemies to punish, loveable characters, some mods are even available on the PC version and, well, it's nothing short of being one of my favourite game.Now go kick ♥♥♥ and chew bubblegum.

Its' successors madse this game's legacy stand out for its' hellish difficulty and a story that left many loyal to the franchise.Maybe Capcom should've reworked Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition from scratch with a better engine instead of the crap that was DmC: Devil May Cry.

												As much as I love Devil May Cry 3, the PC version is absolutely unplayable. I've spent hours trying to get this game to run correctly, trying every solution I've found online and nothing has worked. One thing every game needs in order to be played is a proper control system. With the six different programs I've downloaded to run this one game with a Playstation 3 controller, I can finally use my four basic buttons, but having to use the right analog stick to move Dante and the left analog stick to move the camera is torturous. I found myself using the right analog stick with my left thumb just to be able to move around. I understand that this game is old and has never worked right, but if Valve is to sucker people like me out of their money for it 9 years later, I think it's about time it got fixed. I wish I could get my money and all the time invested into trying to get the game to work properly back. If you want to play this game, you're much better off buying the PS2 version, but whatever you do, do NOT buy this horrible PC version.			"

												It is difficult to say whether I would recommend this. It is a fun game but with some quite severe issues. I'm not convinced that it is enough fun to outweigh the problems. This is a very shoddy console port with the controller arbitrarily mapped to the keyboard without any thought about how it might play. You can remap them but you can't use the mouse. Eventually with help from the forums I managed to configure enough of the controls to a controller for it to be playable. Once I got the game working the difficulty of this game is horrible and the button combos for special moves terrible. Eventually once you have died a few times it unlocks easy mode. Only at this point does the game become fun. It has an enjoyable story and excellent level design. Dante manages to come across as confidently awesome where it would have been very easy to be arrogant and hateable. So whether you buy this game or not depends upon you think it is worth the rigmarole of getting it up and running.			"

												I think it says something that even with a terrible port job the gameplay still shines. (this ain't a review of the game, just a bad port warning)There isn't native gamepad support because this is an old PC port. You can still play with a keyboard and you can get a gamepad eventually working. But there is one glaring problem with this port. There is a bug in the sound engine that makes certain noises cause frame rate drops. You can avoid this by deleting sound files.... but it's pretty ludicrous to have to play the game with muted sounds.If there was a way to fix that sound glitch without needing to remove the files then I could recommend it, but as of right now  (and the forseeable future) DO NOT GET THIS PORT. Pick up DmC HD Collection on PS3/360 instead.			"

												IMHO its criminal to sell this game in its current state and Steam owes me money. Here are all the problems: no fullscreen, choppy music, terrible/nonexistent keyboard controls (you literally can't navigate the menu w/ a keyboard), and ONLY three crappy resolution options. Oh but we aren't done, there's more to this crapshoot. Once you do get a controller to play this game, you better hope you got a PS3 controller, otherwise you have to manually edit files in the game to get an Xbox 360 controller working--but guess what! This still won't solve the control problems! The camera controls are nearly nonexistent. R3 snaps the camera to Dante's back, sometimes. Terrain/walls/obstacles within a level will stop the camera in its tracks whether you're using R3 or the stick itself (which pans the camera at a snail's pace). In a notoriously difficult game, this is unacceptable since you will be getting attacked offscreen. Yeah, it only cost me a few dollars, but I'd have been better off using my money as fuel for a fire. Do yourself a favor and tell Capcom how unacceptable this is with your wallet by staying far away from this terrible experience.			"

												This is in my opinion, the best Devil May Cry in the serie, the problem is the port, the game is almost unplayble with a wireless 360 controller except if you do some changes to it but even so, In my opinion, for a ''Special Edition'' It should be better than that, more screen resolution choices would be great too.Despite this game being great, the ''Special Edition'' isn't that great, for a remake at least.They could have done it better.9.5/10 for the game itself.4.5/10 for the port.I'd still recommend this game though cause it is a really great game and it works.

												There is no doubt that this is one of the worst ports I have ever seen in my life, but the game is also one of the best I have ever played in my life. Devil May Cry 3 is really difficult game not to mention that this is the Special Edition which came out in order to be easier. I agree with everyone else that it is almost impposible to play this game on PC but if you have a cotroller and if you get thorugh the problems that this port delievers you will enjoy the hardship that this game will make you go thorugh, even so it is recommended that you play this game on the PS2 version its without a doubt the superior version.

												In all seriousness, only buy this game on console. It is an amazing game and probably on my top...50 games. However, the port for this game on PC makes it so you're using stupid ♥♥♥♥♥ like JKL for attacks and shooting and the like, and the controller doesn't let you move up or down, only left and right (up makes you go right down makes you go left.) The port is one of the worst ones I've ever seen, buy on a console. Avoid like a super virus on PC.			"

												I've been wanting to play a Devil May Cry game for a really long time, but couldn't because of my religious parents. So when I saw the PC port, I put it on my wishlist because I've only heard good things about DMC and I love Dante's wit and sarcasm.I should have read the reviews first, and then removed it so that my good friends didn't waste their money getting it for me. I can't tell if having a gamepad or a controller would have made any difference or not. I spent the first, probably, 15-20 minutes trying to figure out what keys did what, and then trying to configure them to what could best suit me. But it was futile.This port is beyond unplayable in the state it's in right now, at least for me(I don't know about anyone else). It wouldn't even let me past the ""Style Selection"" menu because when I'd press 3 to select, it would just move the cursor down the list of fighting styles. I gave up. I'm probably never going to be able to play this game unless Capcom and Steam release an updated, BETTER, port because of the ""sensitive"" nature of the game. At least I was given 3 and 4, and from what I've read, 4 is at least an okay port. I'm very disappointed in the lack of effort that was clearly put into this release, though.TL;DR: Don't buy the port unless you're good at coding and are willing to dig deep and research how to make this game dance for you. Buy the DMC HD collection instead if you can get the platform for it. "

												I love DmC:3.  I love the Gold edition to play around as Vergil.  I love the music and, despite the games plot always being ridiculous and hammy, this is one of the better plots I could get invested in (though I haven't completed 4 yet so my opinion might change....""might"" ).*clears throat* ...with that said; I love the game (on PS2 or PS3).  This port to the steam (currently) is NON-PLAYABLE (unless you PC players are truly experts on playing action games like this on a Keyboard and don't mind wearing out or breaking your keys).  So far, it doesn't matter what Gamepad you are using; I've tried the PC Microsoft Xbox controller and using a gamepad program to make my PS3 and PS2 controller work on my comptuer (and I have made it work for several games without problems INCLUDING some where I had to custom input the functions for each buttons)...but it is STILL UNPLAYABLE.  Most of the functionatlly still works; the sword/gun/jump/camera/taunt/tricks button can still be used properly and rearranged on the game's setup screen like normal,,,but the Analog sticks DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY.That's the only real problem at this time (which is why I can't comment on anything else graphical or compatibile-wise because I'm stuck in level 1).  The left analog stick does NOT function at all for this game.  For some reason you have to move with the right stick; but even if THAT functioned correctly I don't think most players could play this game at all like this.  And it's STILL bad because the only thing you can do to move is either left or right (or just up or down).  Either way; you can NOT move properly to enjoy playing this port.I'm not officially ready to say this Port SUCKS, because I am REALLY hoping Valve/Steam team are getting feedback like this and tell them they need to fix/patch the control schemes if anyone is to ever play this port at all.  Otherwise; for now until they do so, Do NOT purchase this game unless you more of a game collector building up your library.(To note: I have read some of the Steam user's guides to set-up your gamepad controller for it to work properly and said they had success...but I've tried and retried several times and I don't think the Game itself will register it at all, only keeping to what it's currently control functions are...which is crap.  Also, the port does come with a Gamepad Config that will NOT RECOGNIZE the Xbox controller...it recognized my PS controller, but nothing was accomplished as I hoped.  Plus, there is a option to switch/Reverse the L and R analog sticks...but it didn't do anything at all! ).			"

												Let me get this out of the way. I love Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. It is a fantastic hack n'slash game that I can recommend to anyone. However, don't get the PC version because of the controller compatibility issues. Any regular controller, like for example a logitech gamepad, the game will say that the controller import is not compatible with the game. The button layout that the game expects you to use as the default control settings is beyond terrible. Now you can map the buttons on the controller for different commands, but the game does not recognize the left and right triggers as buttons. The only way to make your controller sync up with Devil May Cry 3 is to download a program like Xpadder and customize your own default controls setting and then sync that to the game. The thing is you'll have to shell out $10.00 to download Xpadder. So that will be the determining factor if you want to by the game or not. Personally, I'd get any other version of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition over the PC version.			"

												Great game. Undeniably best in the DMC series. However, this port was terrible. The game is locked to 4:3 resolutions despite originally comig from a widescreen ready console, unable to go fullscreen by ANY means (not even F11) and not mappable to an Xbox 360 pad unless one actually manually Assigns such in a text file within the game folders, even then the triggers not working correctly. The game is prone to utterly random lag even on a PC capable of playing 2011 level AAA titles on full settings.Legitimately, if you have a decent PC by 2014 standards, it's actually better to play this game through a PS2 emulator.

												UPDATE: It seems the first link and second link for the joystick support in my review died. Look in the DMC3 Guide. Control fix is below in Update 2.UPDATE 2:  MotionInJoy setupIf you have a PS3 controller and MotionInJoy you can play this by choosing a custom profile and assigning:L stick x+ to Ry+L stick x- to Ry-L stick y+ to Rz+L stick y- to Rz-R stick x+ to Slider+R stick x+ to Slider-Do this and you'll have analogue movement and camera rotation!Anyways, I don't believe this is a bad port. If people tried resarching a little more you can get the werid and bad controls corrected.It's a great game overall though, I have it on ps2 but I got it on the PC sense I am not sure where my PS2 DMC3 Copy went off too. It's great to play this game again. But all I can say it's not a bad port, With a little research and mods to the game it will help correct it.			"

												I really liked the series on Playstation and looked forward to reliving those awesome moments. Unfortunately this version of the game is not as satisfying, as it is horribly unpolished in regards to the in-game video, resolution and controller settings. It would be really welcome if Capcom could one day release a PC version which feels and plays like a completed product. With pain in my heart, i can't recommend this game to anyone in this quality state.			"

												So let me be very clear when I say this is my favorite game of all time. ALL OF IT. So when I saw the edition availible on steam, I was pretty psyched since my PS2 went out and replacements can no longer be found.But whatever you do, don't buy it. Not here. Not ever. Read any other review, the port is BAD. I can't use any controllers, even one specifically for PC and has all programable buttons. And playing this game with a keyboard? Dont even. Best game ever into worst port ever. If you're going to spend money on it, do so elsewhere.			"

												Many people are saying the port is awful for controllers, but are simply too lazy to look in the discussion page for this game to search for a fix, so I'll ignore that.The keyboard controls for this game can be easily found by going into the options and looking at the controls as well. Not only that, but they work just fine, so ignore the idiots that are too lazy to solve problems and just write an angry review after 10 minutes.About the actual game, the port has some problems with some lag in a few areas. It's not excessive lag that will affect gameplay, but it will slow down the game for a second. One spot I can think of off the top of my head is the area on Mission 7 where you have to jump down to enter the library. I noticed slightly more lag with Vergil, but again, it did not affect areas where I was actually fighting enemies. There are also fixes for the lag if it seems like it's actually affecting your gameplay, so again, if you plan on getting this game, take a couple minutes to look for some common questions and answers. It's a good game and you don't need a console to play it, so there's no point in throwing a hissy-fit when you encounter small problems with the port. "

Unfortunately it's unbelieveable at how half ♥♥♥ this port to pc was. I know about the mods and fan made patches out there, but that doesn't automatically make it ok that this port is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Having to rely on your customers to fix your game is unacceptable. If you're looking at playing this for the first time, I suggest going for the original ps2 version or just go for the HD collection.

You have to input custom configs into the game files just to get the buttons to work with modern controllers (because the keyboard controls are a joke), and even then, you need to get a program like Xpadder to manually map the L and R buttons because the game doesn't recognize them.

												I like the game but framerate drops, poorly done controls, and many other problems make it hard to say this port is worth it, even on sale I can't honestly recomend it. If you have the option to get the HD collection it's the best way to play this title. Or you can always look up a copy for the ps2 which is not a bad option.			"

												I love this game and the series since DMC1 which is the best one in my opinion, a timeless classic no doubt. (DMC2 is not real and never happened for me). And while this is a good game sadly this port is not.This port has many many issues and it can't be fixed even with the Style Switcher Mod, and is a real shame since this could have been the best version ever, the framerate is unstable in many parts and the recommended fix is to delete some music files which I find preposterous to call that a real fix.The game stutters (and no, it's not your computer) the audio system is broken, many of the effects like when you swing the sword around sound a lot worse than the PS2 version and even the music, and I haven't even mention the sound crackling, plus no real controller support and then you need edit a config file to add your pad manually or download 3rd party stuff just to use the triggers to change guns on the fly, which is something I never had to do ever before in my 20 years playing games on PC.Now let's talk about graphics, yes technically with a mod you can play the game at any resolution you want which is a huge advantage over the console versions, but taking into account the bad performance and that the game is missing a lot of visual effects, for example it has no shaders or colour correction, so you lose the original atmosphere of the game, no dynamic shadows just generic blobs, no depth of field or bloom, NO v-sync, weird and worse quality textures compared to the PS2 version., or that the game crashes from time to time, you might start to understand why I hate this port and I don't recommend it, there's even some bugs that are exclusive to the PC version like one that can make you lose thousands of orbs, or that the game can randomly  corrupt your saves. In conclusion this port is bad,  this is not the case where you install 1 or 2 mods and the game runs completely flawlessly. It seems like Nothing can get rid of the framedrops NOTHING who cares if you can run the game at 60fps if in many random parts you will see your framerate drop to 20 or 40 for no reason. I don't know about the others but I'm pretty sensible to stutter and framedrops. And This is not acceptable for a such a good game.I wish Capcom would step up and port the HD collection like their last ports which have been received positively but it's highly unlikely to happen.If you want to play the game, They're other better ways to enjoy this game Like running the original PS2 version on PCSX2 if you know how to configure it or grabbing the HD Collection if you have a PS3/XBOX360 around.

												Devil May Cry 3 is a great game, do not get me wrong.This version however, is bloody awful. Framerate hovers around 30 at the best of times -- other versions maintain a stable 60 -- and this can drop when certain enemies appear. I've heard this is something to do with the music files, but I shouldn't have to fart around with deleting or renaming files just to get a game to run as it was supposed to.Gameplay-wise though, DMC3 has a massive and in-depth combat system that includes lots of small details -- and even lets you do things that were in cutscenes! Not every thing from every cutscene, but a considerable amount of them are indeed doable. Dante handles rather well, and although the Style System is a little limited in this game compared to Devil May Cry 4, the time lapse between the two - enough for Dante to go from cocky, though out of his depth straight through to a marvelous drunken uncle who quite frankly has zero f**ks to give - can be seen as a handwave from the technical reasons for limiting the Style system as such.My advice? Skip this version, and either get the original PS2 version of the Special Edition, or if you're running a PS3 or 360 in HD, just get the HD Collection. If you get the HD Collection and you're running in SD, you may have some audio synch problems during cutscenes. Also, get DMC4's PC version. Don't let the Games for Windows Live fool you, it's the best version by a long shot, including unique content.			"

												Should you play DMC3? Yes, indeed, the game is pretty good and has a quite interesting combat. Should you buy this port? Nope. Unless your willing to invest around an hour changing things in order to play the game correctly. Controllers are barely supported. The right and left triggers are not recognized in the game, so you need a program that allows you to configure those triggers to keyboard buttons in order to switch your weapons in game, unless you want to press (Q) or (E) to switch your weapons mid game. tl;dr - Amazing game. Terrible port. Don't buy unless you're willing to spend around an hour to get the game functioning correctly.			"

												Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition is a fun game, with well developed characters, a great story, challenging puzzles and awesome gameplay and battles. However I did not like this version of the game, pc over XBox 360, due to the difficult controls and movement. I prefer the Devil May Cry HD Collection for the XBox 360 over the PC version simply due to the easier controls, movement, and camera angles. This game also has the issue of starting out with a small screen instead of fullscreen, if you want the fullscreen you have to change the resolution. Now this isn't much of an issue but it is an annoyance that shouldn't even exist. With the HD Collection for the 360, you get the first three DMC games for about $20, instead of spending close to $40 here on Steam for each individual game. If you're looking for a really good hackin' slash, action packed game look no further than DMC 3 SE!			"

												I do love DMC and have probably clocked well above week's worth of gameplay on the PS2. It really a great action title that's just great for those looking for a challenge, But I cannot reccomend this version if you are not willing to remove files such as the battle music and fiddle with a .ini to get a modern controller working just right with the game. I already have a PS2 copy to play still so I think I'll just live with that. If you do not have a console and insist on playing this game just know there will be a few hoops to jump through to get this game at it's peak and that it may never be quite as great as it is on a console, you can check out it's entry on the PC Gaming wiki to find all the fixes and links to certain mods to make your time easier,And while I don't care for these mods as I wish to play the game vanilla, there does seem to be mods which add to the gameplay such as giving Dante his style switch system from DMC4 that also happens to add a FoV option.

												This game is a broken port of the console version. Very badly made without thinking from the perspective of the PC player control ergonomics either using keyboard or gamepad.GRAPHICSThe graphics are typical of the older Play Station games (think of Resident Evil 2 and 3, except that background buildings are also in 3D). It's dated for 2015, but nothing sinful from when it was originally released.But the sinful thing in here is that there is no fullscreen mode. It can only be viewed in windowed mode. Max resolution is at 1600x1200. (Even DOS games has fullscreen).SOUNDIt's ok. From the intro to the rock tunes of the (in-game) broken jukebox, it does fine. Positional audio was not used.CONTROLSIt's a bad port mainly because the control scheme is unbearably bad... keyboard or XBox controller.With the keyboard, you can configure the key map. The problem with using the keyboard is that [Jump] is reflected as [Style Action]. Pressing [Style Action] is still [Style Action]. I can't make Dante jump.Buttons can also be configured with the XBox controller... except for the directional movement which is unfortunately placed to the Right analog stick. Forget about no rumble feature. I just want to move the character properly, which I can't.GAMEPLAYIt has a lot of potential and I can feel that this could have been a good game. Camera control poorly done as well, though. I can only reset the camera view to it's default location. I can't do anything else with it.OVERALLI can't even play it, so I can't recommend it at all. The DMC franchise has gone a long way, but unless they've made the controls better, it is probably best to play the older parts of the franchise in the console rather than the PC.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway			"

												Fantastic game by absolutely all means, and if not the best game in the entire Devil May Cry franchise.However, considering this is not on it's original platform, the controls can come off as a bit convoluted. It would be nice if the game were ported and configured to be a bit more PC friendly like the franchise's newest addition.But this aside, DMC3 is definitely my all-time favourite game in the series.The controls are solid, the game feel is fluid, and it's just dang fun to play! I couldn't think of a different game from the series I would recommend one plays first than this.And with that, you'd have to play this first. It's only the prequel to events leading up to the rest of the games.Granted DmC Devil May Cry takes the title of complete prequel, Devil May Cry 3 is just the best game in the whole series.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic ok the pc version does have some problems but if you take some time to fix them it's a realy enjoyabel gameThe story is a prequel to the 1st geme wher Dante's brother Vergil whats to optain the power of there father Sparda is not the best but it does it job and i think it's good and also Dante is cool and not just normal cool he is super coolThe gamepley is realy good and a big inprovmet over DMC2's lack luster gameplayBasecl Dante stil has his signiture Rebelion but from defeating bosses sometimes you get new wepons like Cerbures,Agni&Rudra,Nevan'Beowolf. Guns are also are also good but not to po like the whure in DMC2 Dante also has 4 new styles Trickster,Swordmaster,Gunslinger and Royalguard he also get's 2 bonus styles Quicksilver and Doppelganger Ko now let me explain what each style does 1.Trickster alous Dante to preform faste doges by pressing the B butten it can also teleport you to enemys2.Swordmaster Gives evry mailai wepen a secondeary attack3.Gunslinger gives evry gun a secondary attack4.Royalguard let you pery attack5.Quicksilver slows down time6.and doppelganger is prety self explanetoryThe level disain is also realy good and whail it's all in the same casel it stil not dull or boringThe bosses are realy hard but never unfair (get gud) my favourit are the Vergil boss fights the 1st one is not that hard but the other to defenetly are the music it good but i wish ther was a litel bit moer veraiteOverall 9/10			"

												Question time:Did Capcom mess up by making a bad port? - Yes, royally!Did they have a brain fart when they made Devil May Cry: HD Collection only for X360 & PS3? - Yes, but that's just my opinion.Is this game worth buying? - YES! YES! AND F***ING YES!!!BUT:Be ready to spend less than 2 hours (or less than that), just to make it compatible with your controller and to enable Widescreen support. Feel free to work out the Style Switcher mod too. It was the second time I bought this game, because the first time I refunded it and didn't want to deal with the fixes. However, I thought of giving it another shot, so I purchased it while it was on sale and...It's totally worth it in the end! Two things I love about this game: the gameplay and the soundtrack. It makes your blood pump and really feel the action. The story is compelling, even for a game that focuses more on action.You will not regret the time spent on making those fixes. Check out the Steam discussions forums or other forums and you will find your answers right away.			"

												This PC port of DMC3 is pretty bad. Controller support is the worst I've ever seen. The only real way to get around it is to unplug your controller while the game is starting and map it to the keyboard. There is no widescreen or fullscreen support and the graphics are the most basic they could be. The game itself is not a bad game, but Capcom did a terrible job at porting it. Check out DMC4 instead; it has all of these problems fixed and looks amazing in comparison.			"

												Probably one of the best hack and slash games I've ever played. While the game is a dreadful PC port, the game is excellent. Everything holds up really well, especially the combat. While the game is old, the combat rivals most modern hack and slash games, it's that good. The story is kind of dumb at first, but gets better as the game progresses. The graphics aren't bad, especially for the time. The soundtrack is an alt-rock/metal type which fits in perfectly with what's going on in the game. If your going to play this game, use a playstation 2,  3, or 4 controller, because playing with a keyboard is impossible and trying to get an xbox controller to work with the game is too much work.Raw Score: 9/10Score with bad port factored in: 7.5/10If you can look past the port issues, you'll love this game.

												Fantastic game by absolutely all means, and if not the best game in the entire Devil May Cry franchise.However, considering this is not on it's original platform, the controls can come off as a bit convoluted. It would be nice if the game were ported and configured to be a bit more PC friendly like the franchise's newest addition.But this aside, DMC3 is definitely my all-time favourite game in the series.The controls are solid, the game feel is fluid, and it's just dang fun to play! I couldn't think of a different game from the series I would recommend one plays first than this.And with that, you'd have to play this first. It's only the prequel to events leading up to the rest of the games.Granted DmC Devil May Cry takes the title of complete prequel, Devil May Cry 3 is just the best game in the whole series.			"

												This should be taken down from the store as the controls are utterly horrible. It's practically unplayable with both a keyboard and mouse and a controller. I did manage to get it working (imperfectly) with a controller, but the effort requires should not be necessary.On PS2, I put the game in my console and played it, that's the standard I expect from a game I pay money for.

												Went in thinking this will be great, just like the ps2 version. Couldn't have been more wrong. The port is awful, can't change screen size, can't even move with the control stick. If you can't move, you can't really play the game can you? Ubisoft needs to properly port games if they want people to like them.

												This ""special edition"" is worse than many BETA games on Steam. As soon as I booted up DMC3 the display was warped and distorted on the beginning cutscenes... and the worse part about it is that you can't skip it and have to endure it for a good several minutes each time you boot up the game. Just when you think that's over, the controls are awkward and uncomfortable. It's barely even playable and the guides on Steam couldn't resolve my display and contoler issues. But just when you decide to leave this trash of a port the game doesn't have a real exit function for PC so you're forced to close it with task manager and wait for your computer to respond. Sure, maybe you could be able to get this game to work, but the amount of hassle it takes to enjoy the game really isn't worth it. DMC3 is a really good game, but this is a terrible port of it and you should spare your wallet of this $20 pile of crap.			"

												While I am a huge fan of the Devil May Cry series, the simple fact that this version has such lackluster control makes it worth collecting purely for a completionist. The story is still good, and the game itself is as enchanting as the console versions - but the partial controller support is a big pain in the butt. Not to mention all of the mods you would need to download, figure out, and install just to put it on the same level as Devil May Cry 4 in terms of playability. All in all, a great game bogged down by poor redesign and an incomplete transition to modern PCs. If you don't have the patience for mods - and unless someone has the kindness and time to put together everything into one, easy-to-handle package - you're better off with the console versions.			"

												So before anything I need to say I played this game on PS2. In my opinion, this is the best Devil May Cry. The difficulty, the story, amazingly stylish gameplay and the most important part of this is Dante. He is so cool and likable, also Vergil is great character and fighting him for me is one of the best fights in the game. BUT!!!!! Like I said I refunded this because I couldn't get it to work (resolution, controller support etc.). But on the other hand, I didn't try hard enough to fix it all. I'm sure IT IS POSSIBLE to get this to work on PC and it's definitely worth going the extra mile for it. So all in all. If you are ready to work around all of these issues with this port and try to fix it BUY IT. If you are like me and can't stand going and fixing stuff you just bought and downloaded DON'T BUY IT. And if you have a PS2 then go and buy DMC 1,2 and 3 for 20$ or something like this and spent your weekend being awesome. "

												Great Game, highly recomended......but not on PC.This is one of the best action titles you could ever play, and is arguably the best game in the series. The combat system is one of the deepest in any game, and it ranks you on how well you can perform combos. It has a lot of unlockables, including Vergil as a playable character, so there is also a lot of replay value in the game.Unfortunately, though, the PC port is horrible, one of the worst ever made. The game was released back in 2006 on PC's and it still gives even some of the higher end PC's performance issues. The reason behind the poor performance is the music of all things. The game also lacks controller support, so you're forced to use the keyboard and mouse to play the game. There is a survival guide thread that tells you how to fix the problems, but there are a few third party downloads that have to be made, and even then, success isn't guaranteed for everyone.In the end, the game is just a very poor port of an otherwise amazing game. If you are interested in the game, buy either the original version of the game on the PlayStation 2, or the Devil May Cry HD Collection on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Those have none of the issues that the PC version has.			"

												I couldn't be bothered to put up with this port for more than an hour. I only had a 360 pad, but there was no way for me to comfortably map the buttons.Furthermore, it doesn't run smoothly. I can live with sub-30FPS in a lot of things, but I can't live with it in an action game like DMC3. It's kind of a shame since DMC3 is one of the best action games of the 2000s and considered by some to be better than 4 (which received a FANTASTIC PC port and its own special edition). Even RE4 received a decent pre-RE4HD port, so I don't know what went wrong here. Chances are that you probably have a 360 or PS3 around. Pick up the HD collection and enjoy DMC3 on that instead.

It's free and you won't be making this lazy company even richier.Want more proofs this port sucks? Then go read some reviews at the store page, you'll see.			"

Buttons are annoying to configure using a controller, and ontop of that the analogs are switched as many people have stated, making the game pretty much unplayable.If you want a Devil May Cry game, play 4 and DmC....dont bother with this.

												Devil May Cry 3 – не только триумфальное возвращение ошибочно списанного сериала и не только главный экшен 2006-го года для нашей платформы so far. Прежде всего, DMC 3 – это ультимативный слэшер, вобравший в себя все лучшие наработки Die by the Sword, Rune, и Severance: Blade of Darkness.Геймплей: 10.0Графика: 10.0Звук и музыка: 10.0Интерфейс и управление: 9.5Общий рейтинг: 10.0 P.S: Единственным минусом могу отметить отсутствие русской локализации, но ведь это легко решаемая проблема.

Fun fast combat, brutal combos and over-the-top action that is unrealistic in many ways (Dante rides a rocket in midair like a skateboard) and because of that i LOVE this game.

												Unfortunately, the game itself tries to prevent you from playing. From screen resolution, windowed mode, keybinding or controller mapping, everything actively tries to stop you from playing.In my case, I admit, it succeeded.I just couldn't even start the game properly on the screen resolution, full screen mode, that I wanted, on my X-Box controller with no absurd mapping.I didn't have the courage to look for community patching or whatever. But, as sold here, chances are good you won't be able to properly play the game.			"

												So before anything I need to say I played this game on PS2. In my opinion, this is the best Devil May Cry. The difficulty, the story, amazingly stylish gameplay and the most important part of this is Dante. He is so cool and likable, also Vergil is great character and fighting him for me is one of the best fights in the game. BUT!!!!! Like I said I refunded this because I couldn't get it to work (resolution, controller support etc.). But on the other hand, I didn't try hard enough to fix it all. I'm sure IT IS POSSIBLE to get this to work on PC and it's definitely worth going the extra mile for it. So all in all. If you are ready to work around all of these issues with this port and try to fix it BUY IT. If you are like me and can't stand going and fixing stuff you just bought and downloaded DON'T BUY IT. And if you have a PS2 then go and buy DMC 1,2 and 3 for 20$ or something like this and spent your weekend being awesome. "

It may take a while to actually get it work properly but the game itself is the challenging hack n slash you would expect from a Devil May Cry game.			"

												DMC3 is one of the best action games ever but somehow Capcom ruined it for the PC and made one of the worst ports possible. This version is a direct 1:1 port of the console version and is impossible to play. I have tried every gamepad config option through both the game's choices and MotioninJoy's emulated controllers and none of them work properly. Either the buttons refuse to map in game, axis' are reversed/swapped, or the controller just isn't reconized. I have a PS3 controller and it works with every other gamepad game I've played before. Yes, keyboard controls are technically possible but ridiculously cumbersome considering the control scheme.Even if my gamepad worked, the game starts off windowed and max rez on my 1920x1080 monitor is 1280x960, with all other options being 4:3 and no widescreen support. All cutscenes are heavily compressed and look significantly worse than the console versions. Actual gameplay looks better but considering that I can't play it kind of ruins the experience.Pick this up on PS2 or use an emu instead because this is unplayable.			"

												♥♥♥♥ THISThis game is on my top 10 list and I was going to bring back some memories while I was playing on PS2. I had over 800 hours on PS2 and I really enjoyed the game and pushed it to it's limits. BUT STUPID PC VERSION DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.To play the game you must install a mod , and patch the game which takes around 1 hour to do properly. After that you enter the game and it's ♥♥♥♥ing windowed ( BUT THAT'S NOT ALL) as soon as you press ALT+ENTER to make it full screen YOU WILL SEE THAT CONTROLLS ARE HORRIBLE AND THERE IS NO POINT IN CHANGING ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T. Used my PS4,PS3 even my PC MS CONTROLLER BUT ♥♥♥♥ DOESN'T WORK .A lot of modders tried to make this game playable but it doesn't help at all. I feel sorry for all the work they dedicated and it's still unplayable. I was messing around with some settings and files myself, but still couldn't make it playable.Game is locked onto a low resolution which makes it look like a N64 game and it's horrible to look at. I know this is an old game, but they could at least make it playable on PC. A DISASTER PORT OF A GAME. It's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ......DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT ALL COST. MODS DON'T HELP AT ALLThis game is ruined on PC. I can't describe how my heart is broken that I can't play this blockbuster of a game on my PC to relive some memories. Waste of nerves and frustrating as ♥♥♥♥. Just play it on PS2 like I am going to or buy a PS3 trilogy .It's a lot more profitable to get a PS2 or a PS3 and DMC collection than buying this crappy port and try and make it playable. At least you will save time and have a great day not like people who tried this crap0/10000This game is AMAZING, it's my favorite game of all time BUT THIS ♥♥♥♥ IS UNBEARABLEGoodbye DMC 3, you won't be missed on SteamAND YES, ♥♥♥♥ YOU CAPCOM YOU GREEDY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S			"

												Let's get this party started! Devil May Cry 3 is the best. It just is. With a charming cast of supporting characters, Dante at his best, both gameplay and personality wise, as well as the best music, enviroments, enemy design, and bosses, weapon selection, and extra content of the series, I cannot tell you how much I love this game, but  I can say it is a lot. So much feels connected and satisfying, and the game just has so many satisfying moments it's enough to make me sweat more than anything else does.Shamefully however, Ubisoft ported this and they did a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job too. No widescreen support is lame, really bad controller support is ♥♥♥♥ing awful and actually manages to make DS3 bluescreen somehow. And the cutscene quality is pretty dissapointing too,  but thankfully most of this can be fixed. Now I can get on to the good stuff though. Dante's gameplay just feels great because he not only has the abilities to bring interesting stuff to the table, but enemies that flow around them. If there's something that feels awkward to fight, it's because you aren't thinking outside the box yet.  DT explosion is an okay mechanic too, I like it better than ""DT improves style moves"", but it's just filler most of the time I think.The bosses in this are really cool too, Nevan in particular is a favourite of mine, not due to her sexuality, but due to the fact that she really compliments Dante in her scenes, if only one boss could become a Devil Arm, it should be her. The other bosses are pretty cool too, with Cerberus' great music and Dante's cheeky one liners at him, those twin swords guys making for an interesting fight that forces you to think of it as a double boss; as well as the Vergil and Jester fights that gradually get harder and more interesting as the game goes on, which make for a very cool REAL final boss fight, although fighting side by side with a certain character for that one boss was cool too. I also really like how while Dante tends to be an overzealous cocky badass, he does understand what it means to actually be human and actually shows emotion as well, which is good, since Lady is a great receptor for these feelings, as well as an attractive character style, sexually, and personality wise. I also do like Vergil's conviction and dedication to his personal creed as well. Arkham and Jester are also very cool as well!  Another thing I really like is how powerful styles get to be at level 3, it really makes you feel powerful with whatever you choose, but you also don't feel dependent on them, with the strong weapons and guns as well.Playing as Vergil is also pretty cool, although I must admit he feels a bit too eh for me. I also like the ability to pick whatever level of Bloody Palace you want to go to, it's just neat, but I wish there was a boss rush mode sometimes.Also have to say the credits sequence is a HUGE turn on, ♥♥♥♥ I love playable credits.One hell of a party!/10			"

												There's no question that the minute you boot this game and see with your own eyes just how bad this port is you will feel an immediate and pressing urge to redeem a refund as soon as humanly possible. However, I implore you to reconsider that course of action. For as terrible a PC port as this game is, all the severe gameplay breaking bugs can be resolved, given you spend a few minutes following the ""Windows 10 Complete Experience"" guide for fixing the game. 


DMC3: SE On Windows 10 - My Guide for the Complete Experience 
A Guide for Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition
By: nealiosis

			A summary of the steps to take on Windows 10 to configure this game so it will function properly with full music, custcenes, and XBOX360 controller support.		


Once the fixes are applied and functional, the pure majesty of this game is revealed. The graphics are so remarkable, the combat is as fluid and responsive as an olympic gymnist, and the game itself is devilishy addictive and fun. This game is an all-time great game and this PC edition (once you have fixed the issues) is, without a doubt, the definitive build of this product. Its a true and legitimate masterpiece of a game and don't let yourself miss out on one of gaming's greatest gems because Capcom skimped out and hired a team of incompetent chimpanzees to port the game to the PC platform.

												This is probably the worst PC port I've ever seen in my life. The only reason I would reccomend it, is if you are a die hard Devil May Cry fan, and the aspect of going through DMC3 again with the ability to switch styles mid-combat (like DMC4) sounds appealing enough to you to justify a purchase.The Style Switcher mod is the only reason I own this game. Even then, there's some serious problems to work around. Otherwise... just don't.			"

												If you can get past the terrible port, this is an amazingly good game. If you spend 30 minutes learning which buttons are which, it's time well spent for what the rest of the game will offer you. I would also recommend checking out DMC4 for a much better port, maybe the best port ever. However, DMC4 is not as good a game as DMC3 is, and even with a few issues here and there, DMC3 is the absolute best hack-n-slash game out there. (Don't even think about bothering with DmC, because that has half the content the FIRST DMC has.)			"

												Garbage port. Pretty much impossible to get it to run unless you use mods and even then it will lag unless you disable music. On the plus side there is a style switcher mod out there which allows you to be able to switch between all styles on the fly silimar to DMC4 which opens up a whole new world of combo possibilites.I'd only really recommend this port to diehard fans who wants to play this game with the styleswitcher mod. If you're new to this series I'd recommend picking up the DMC4: Special Edition over this one, runs smooth as butter and plays great even though as a game it's inferior to DMC3. I'd also recommend to pick up the HD Collection on PS3/Xbox 360 for the best version of DMC3 over this one.			"

Dante doesn't even say ♥♥♥♥ YOU once!!!  Vergil is in this too but he talks quiet and dresses like a horse rider.  There was this lady (Don't remember her name) with a bazooka but NO SIGN OF KAT!  YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO GO TO LIMBO, you just run around in the dirty street or through big hallways.  Another thing is that the game is so hard!

												You want a challenge? You want a game that demand skill? Well look no further, this game offers both of these things. Even on Normal mode.It's ridiculous on how hard this game. So combat wise it's a pretty fun game but it has some problems.The weapons have few moveset in the start and buying upgrades for them on the first run is pretty hard. Grinding souls just isn't an option on Normal mode either in my opinion. So it's best to stick with a weapon and that would most likely be Rebellion.For the styles it's pretty much Swordmaster that you need. You can hit enemies in the air then because you'll always do a downward thrust. Later on you might use Doppleganger though because it can double your power on stunned bosses. Which is nice.For items you need to be aware of one thing. The price goes up when you buy one. It goes up a lot. Using an item and continuing a stage makes you lose the item and start over the last checkpoint. Keep that in mind when fighting bosses.As for getting the game to work. It ran fine on my system and my PS2 gamepad worked just fine with the game. But if you have a 360 gamepad you might need to look up on a fix.But honestly, I'd pick up Devil May Cry 4 instead as the controls are better that time around. It can still be a lot of fun as well.

It doesn't support an XBOX360 controller by default, and even though you can basically set up a usable configuration with it, you can't use the triggers, the right stick is permanently bound to movement, and the left stick isn't used.So unless you don't mind downloading a third party controller-compatibilty program and losing analog control, steer clear of this for now.

												Well, the PC port is pretty bad, but not to the point where you ABSOLUTELY can't play and enjoy it. As for the controls, seriously guys, as many people posting about how the XBox controller won't work there are still people who continue to say so. Rather than complaining, go out and get a Logitech controller, adjust the controls with the gamepad application in the main file, and you're set to go. It's like playing on your PS2 all over again. But aside from some graphical errors, the game is still as great as it was when it first came out. Using an emulator takes too much time, what with finding all the files you need or having to actually purchase the game CD from one of the few small town stores that sell old and retro games/consoles. In my opinion it is better to just buy it on here, and spend a little bit of money for a simple Logitech controller. Or if you're too lazy to edit controls or get a controller, find a store that sells old PS2 games and consoles. 10/10 Will CONTINUE to play.			"

												OH GOD SERIOUSLY THIS PORT IS HORRENDOUS.If you want to play this great game, arguably the best in the DmC series, expect to use a couple of the wonderful Steam Guides to know how to configure .ini files or using XPadder to use a gamepad. You don't want to use a keyboard . . . seriously.A lot of the button options in game are listed as numbers, which doesn't make any reasonable sense. Want to do the Stinger, huh? Hold foward and press 6. Yes.HOWEVER, aside from the horrible porting, it's challenging, it's quirky, it's awesome. The flames are, indeed, in my eyes. If you want to ignore the horrible port and still get a good Devil May Cry experience, get DmC 4 or the reboot.			"

												Often regarded by long time DMC fans as the best all around DMC title, I can agree that it is very well put together and a hell of a lot of fun. While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)Fast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.My only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).Regardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games. You won't be disappointed.			"

												AntiMacro is better gamepad to key mapping, as it is FREE, multi OS, and supports Win8.1.http://www.webupd8.org/2013/09/map-keyboardmouse-input-to-your-gamepad.htmlHere are the configs for the Razer Sabertooth Elite:[Controller (Razer Sabertooth Elite)]START = 7SELECT = 6CIRCLE = 1TRIANGLE = 3SQUARE = 2CROSS = 0L1 = 4R1 = 5L2 = R2 = L3 = 8R3 = 9L<->R = 1Use AntiMacro to map the L and R trigger to Q and E, then map the guide button with hold, alt, F4, and release under advance.  Also here is the general guidelines on how to fix your controller:1, the top line is your device name in Windows.  For Win 8.1, you need to go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers, then right click on your gamepad and select ""Game controller settings"".  Put whatever name that comes up for your controller inside [].2, the numbers for the button is exactly the name of the button minus 1. For example, the A button for my Razer Sabortooth Elite shows up as button 1, so 1 - 1 = 0, thus map ""0"" to the cross or X button.  You can ID the buttons within Properties > Test from the ""Game controller settings.""3, L and R trigger and the guide button need to be map with AntiMacro as mentioned above.4, L<->R is to swap the left and right stick, which needs to be enabled with a 1 for the Sabertooth Elite (0 to disable).5, the mapping was based on the PS2 verion of the controls, so change them to your linking in the config file for custom mapping.  DO NOT TRY TO CONFIG INSIDE THE GAME, and just leave anything to default and you will be fine.			"

												If you use an xbox 360 game pad you will have to look up in the forums how to set it up. Other than that it is a great game in a great series. Always worth a revisit.If you are in the more modern era of gaming and didn't play game like this when they came out, prepare for the frustration of locked camera angles that often make little to no sense. Like running against the clock while only being able to see behind you, or in combat and unable to see the corner of the room that the last enemy is hiding in when he dashes at you to ruin your SSS ranking is combat style. The curse of the platformer is felt full strength in DMC 3. Oh, and if you like Dante from DMC 1 and DMC 2, just remember that he is a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in DMC 3. Unlockable and extremely high skill cap make this game a worthy challange.			"

I haven't tried the keyboard but my guess is it's gonna be easier to play than on a 360 controller. The screen size is an issue as well.

												I hate to say it but this is a REALLY bad port of one of my favorite games of all time. The game lags terribly on the second level and it also lacks good controller support. You NEED good controls to properly learn the mechanics of this game. It's not impossible to play it on a keyboard but this game was originally designed for a PS2 controller so keep that in mind.I highly recommend finding a copy for the PS2 or picking up the HD remastered editions on either the PS3 or the XBOX 360.Avoid this one at all costs...

												The game itself is about what you'd expect from the Devil May Cry series, i.e. an awesome and over-the-top hack-'n-slash adventure starring everyone's favorite wise-cracking devil hunter, Dante. However, this has got to be one of the most badly ported games of all time. The first time I installed it, the control stick's usual ""LS for movement, RS for camera control"" was reversed and couldn't be changed, and it, much like Dark Souls, is borderline unplayable without a controller. I can only recommend this to anyone if they're fans of the series who can put up with a really wonky control scheme.			"

It suffers from low-res graphics, and I could only change the resolution to 1024*768 tops, unless you mess the exe file with a hex editor..On top of that, i absolutely hate the controls, as the Gamepad Configuration that comes with the 1.3 update doesn't support Xbox Controllers for Windows whatsoever, thus I have to move Dante via the right analog stick, which is really annoying and frustrating..Well, you could find 3rd parter softwares such as XBCD Setup Utility, JoyToKey and Xpadder to solve the controller mapping issue, but it's troublesome..Other than these issues, it's playable - 4.5/10			"

												With a little bit of effort and the Style Switcher mod, this title is a great alternative to the PS2 version.  This is still one of my favorite action games to date, and the gameplay is still challenging.  However, you will have to do some work if you want it to work.It's made even more dynamic with the ability to expand on Virgil and switch styles on the fly (using mods).For those who have never played a Devil May Cry title, this is arguably the best of them all.  Though there's options to start on Easy, the game can become extremely challenging.  Once you clear one difficulty, the next one is unlocked.  The hardest difficulty gets extremely hard with more enemies in each level, faster enemies that deal more damage, bosses with fatal (or near) attacks, and if you don't clear enemies quickly, the become much harder to kill.I think this is one of Capcom's best titles, even though the voice-acting and cutscenes are corny.  Controller extremely highly recommended.			"

												It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get this game working on modern PCs- download the Style Switcher mod and thank me later. It's a shame that this port is so terrible, but with the help of the very talented modding team behind the aforementioned fix, you too can enjoy DMC3 in all its stylish, nu-metal-blaring, bishounen-loving goodness. It's damn near the best game in the series next to DMC4, and a paragon of the character action genre. Just wait for it to go on sale for uber cheap.			"

												This is definately a very fun game with a wicked sense of humor.  It is the prelude to the Devil May Cry series, so you don't need to play the other 2 before this one to understand it.  Be warned, you definately want a gamepad for this, and it is EXTREMELY hard.  This is not for the faint of heart.Also, be aware on the front end, this port is horrible.  Be prepared to do a lot of Jerryrigging in order to get the game working properly.  Specifically, downloading from a different source the sound and music files in order to fix the frame rate drop.

												-> NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC PORT. BETTER OFF TO BUY THE CONSOLE VERSION ETC. <-Devil May Cry 3 is actually a fun game as usual, probably the best one in the franchise that I played. Main character is of course Dante, and his evil brother Virgil. The gameplay is my most favorite from this game, ranged weapons to choose like dual pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, some laser weapon, and even a sniper rifle. For melee, is his very own big sword, fists, dual swords, a ♥♥♥♥ing guitar (whoa), and others that I may forgot. Devil triggers are pretty cool too, I think my most favorite one is the one that you can clone yourself for double the destruction. So for the bad side of the game, only the keyboard works, gamepad controls are broken for me, what a shame. (I'd recommend XPadder if you really need the gamepad controls.) Theres also this weapon changing from the pause menu, why not during ingame for blazing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the combo'ing? (though this is possible in DMC4, but whatever.) Rating: 7 / 10 Pros: Obvious gameplay is obvious, lots of weapons to use, a ♥♥♥♥ing guitar as a weapon (holy ♥♥♥♥), Devil Triggers are game changers to cause more mayhem. Cons: Problems with gamepad, Weapon switching should've been ingame instead of in the pause menu.			"

												I'll echo another popular review - ""one of the best action games of all time with one of the worst ports of all time""if you have a controller and are willing to go through a slightly more difficult method of getting the game running (with style switcher mod) you'll have a lot less difficulty. Pulling off stylish combos is an absolute delight in these kind of games. If you're inexperienced i would recommend devil may cry 4 first, as DMC 4 will actually tell you which buttons to press to achieve combos (and Dante has nearly identical controls)its cheap and its brilliant, i'd recommend it under that context of my review			"

												insanely horrible PC port, this game is unplayable without the use of modifications that fix the controller problems, visual issues, and add the style swap mechanic.If the mods were built into the base game, this game would easily be a confirmed sell, but without tweaks that the community has created, not capcom, this game is hard to recommend to those that do not want to use external sources to fix the major issues this game has.Overall, as it stands, TWO YEARS LATER. This game is unacceptable without the use of modifications. But when this game does run as intended.... Dope! Crazy! Blast! Alright! Sweet! SShowtime! SSStylish!			"

												Devil Mary Cry 3...an excellent game with a couple of problems.  For the graphics hounds out there, this is a port so it's not quite optimized though the graphics are good and from the PS2-era.  The controls...take a bit of time to get used to.  Once those drawbacks are overcome (or you install a controller) you have a game with a great combat system, awesome (if smug) protagonists and a certain antagonist and God knows how many difficulties to try the game at, if that is your cup of tea.

												<h1>Look out for a sale, grab the Style Switcher Mod, and enjoy one of the best hack-and-slash action game ever made.</h1> <b>A precaution:</b>If using Style Switcher, <i>do not</i> change the HUD value from 1.0. It will make one of the boss fight unable to be attacked with a melee weapon.Also, you don't want it to drop below 50 fps (this may be possible even on a relatively powerful rig; it's truly a bad port). DMC3 requires good timing and good reflex - low fps will screw you up.And perhaps contrary to most people, I did find playing with a keyboard to be more convenient and reflexive, especially when it comes to changing weapons, and going ""full assault"" with Vergil. Do try playing with a keyboard, seriously. "

Also here is the general guidelines on how to fix your controller:1, the top line is your device name in Windows.  For Win 8.1, you need to go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers, then right click on your gamepad and select ""Game controller settings"".  Put whatever name that comes up for your controller inside [].2, the numbers for the button is exactly the name of the button minus 1. For example, the A button for my Razer Sabortooth Elite shows up as button 1, so 1 - 1 = 0, thus map ""0"" to the cross or X button.  You can ID the buttons within Properties > Test from the ""Game controller settings.""3, L and R trigger and the guide button need to be map with AntiMacro as mentioned above.4, L<->R is to swap the left and right stick, which needs to be enabled with a 1 for the Sabertooth Elite (0 to disable).5, the mapping was based on the PS2 verion of the controls, so change them to your linking in the config file for custom mapping.  DO NOT TRY TO CONFIG INSIDE THE GAME, and just leave anything to default and you will be fine.			"

												Often regarded by long time DMC fans as the best all around DMC title, I can agree that it is very well put together and a hell of a lot of fun. While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)Fast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.My only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).Regardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games. You won't be disappointed.			"

You don't want to use a keyboard . . . seriously.A lot of the button options in game are listed as numbers, which doesn't make any reasonable sense. Want to do the Stinger, huh? Hold foward and press 6. Yes.HOWEVER, aside from the horrible porting, it's challenging, it's quirky, it's awesome. The flames are, indeed, in my eyes. If you want to ignore the horrible port and still get a good Devil May Cry experience, get DmC 4 or the reboot.			"

												I wont lie... this game has its ups and downs. The Cons are that this is thee worst port on steam. This port makes dark souls port looks amazing. You can't use your mouse, it doesn't work well with gamepad, and your fingers will burn after playing it with keyboard. Not to mention, because of the keyboard, you can't fully use combos to their max potentional. Still, even though this game has alot of issues... Issues aside, the fact remains that this is a great game. Evereyon who has played the original game on other systems will conclude about how much they enjoyed and loved this game and I have never played those other systems much. The story is really good, the game is fun besides the pitfalls, and the character Dante is amusing as ever. The game was challenging, the fighting cool, and the world well done. Was this a bad port, yes but was this a bad game, no. So if you don't mind hurting your fingers to play a good story then play it. If you can't stand that kind of thing then don't play it and play it on another system.			"

												It is a REALLY good game, absolutely terrible port. I never tried the DMC series until the Capcom sale and so I bought this and DMC:Devil May Cry. Both games make me LOVE the premise and the combat system. I love playing these games now... but unless you want to mod this game, I just reccommend buying the HD collection on console. At least there, you'll be able to have a fixed game. I wish Capcom would come back and patch this game so modding wouldn't be the only way to play this game but that is just wishful hoping....			"

												DMC 3 was my jumping in point when it came to classic action titles. The combat is meaty, fast paced, and all around fun. As a lot of the people claim though, this isn't the best port. In fact, I'd say it's a pretty bad one. That being said, it's work-able if you have a 360 controller and you're willing to use joy to key. Just a warning though, this game can be difficult. If you're new to the series, I seriously suggest being willing to try easy mode once you unlock it, (by dying enough on normal,) and then after a while you'll be demon slaying with the best of them. You'll just need practice.			"

												This is the first game that I've requrested a refund for.  The controls make this game unplayable.  There is no mouse suppoort - only keyboard - and even with my PS3 controller plugged in, I was unable to remap all of the buttons (there is one more action than there are mappable buttons); I was also only able to use the right joystick (under the attack buttons) to move.  I understand that there are mods and 'fixes' that make the game playable, but I still requested a refund because, frankly, mods should be used to enhance the gameplay, not make the game run correctly.If you're willing to put in the work to fix the game with mods and bug-fixers, I would still recommend buying this game as it is a great, classic hack-and-slash.

												I'll echo another popular review - ""one of the best action games of all time with one of the worst ports of all time""if you have a controller and are willing to go through a slightly more difficult method of getting the game running (with style switcher mod) you'll have a lot less difficulty. Pulling off stylish combos is an absolute delight in these kind of games. If you're inexperienced i would recommend devil may cry 4 first, as DMC 4 will actually tell you which buttons to press to achieve combos (and Dante has nearly identical controls)its cheap and its brilliant, i'd recommend it under that context of my review			"

												Capcom kinda butchered the port but hey, it's still Devil May Cry. I've found that the keyboard configuration is actually really fun and effective once you get used to it. Hell, if it weren't for the lack of analog movement I would even go so far as to say that it's better than the controller configuration! Although, to be fair, I'm not exactly a DMC pro considering the original PS2 release was way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed hard and 12 year old me could never even make it past CerberusAnyways, what I'm trying to say is give the keyboard controls a try! If you're new it might help since you can keep a finger on the attack, shoot, and style buttons at all times. If you're a seasoned DMC veteram who's gone through Heaven and Hell unscathed, it could be an interesting new playstyle that lets you suck at and eventually master the game all over again.

It's a complete mess... but until a very much wanted HD collection comes to Steam, this is the DMC3 we get, but at least it's still ♥♥♥♥ing DMC3!

												I recommend this game solely based on the story. It was over the top and a blast to play through and see. You can watch the cutscenes on youtube (and I also recommend that), but it won't feel quite as fulfilling as completing the game yourself.The recommendation however is not an absolute must buy thing. The problem for this game is in its control scheme in that I found it awkward during some fights. Aside from the controls (which are quite a big deal in this game) I don't have any real problems with the game. Camera controls could be better at times and the platforming levels are best left forgotten. The platforming however is largely optional in bonus levels that are timed.			"

												<h1>Look out for a sale, grab the Style Switcher Mod, and enjoy one of the best hack-and-slash action game ever made.</h1> <b>A precaution:</b>If using Style Switcher, <i>do not</i> change the HUD value from 1.0. It will make one of the boss fight unable to be attacked with a melee weapon.Also, you don't want it to drop below 50 fps (this may be possible even on a relatively powerful rig; it's truly a bad port). DMC3 requires good timing and good reflex - low fps will screw you up.And perhaps contrary to most people, I did find playing with a keyboard to be more convenient and reflexive, especially when it comes to changing weapons, and going ""full assault"" with Vergil. Do try playing with a keyboard, seriously. "

												Being the first game I completed back on the PS2 I'm actually rather attached to it. However this port is beyond redemption. as i began to play the first level I noticed that each time i hit the melee key it did a different thing: sometimes jump, sometimes shoot, sometimes the actions skill; this was the same for the other three keys that are supposed to represent those actions.There is no fix. There is no Controller support. No mapping program solves this. You cant play at 1080p.and to top it all off theres no sign of a proper HD Collection port for PC to divert the problem.I bought this game under the pretense that I was buying a game. This is a bugged mess that makes a mockary of its original. This needs a working fix made.			"

												WARNING: HORRIBLE PORT.I got this game on a Steam sale because I have it for PS2 and, honestly, it's awesome.Devil May Cry is one of my favorite series.  The first and third installments are really, really good.  I've heard bad things about 2, but I've only played it a little.Imagine my surprise when I launch it and it's a small window with awful resolution and aliasing.  There's no fullscreen option.  I spent the next half hour or so trying to find online fixes.I get it: it's an old game.  You know what else is an old game?  Half Life, but I can run that in full screen.  Don't put crap like this on the store if it's only going to be a step up from minesweeper.  It's a good game if you can get mods to fix it (working on it), I just launched it like, an hour ago and I've been doing other stuff.  I'm about to try it again with mods.  If it doesn't fix it, I'm getting a refund.tl;dr: Game is awesome, PC/Steam port is unplayable.  Don't buy until they fix.			"

												One of the best video games of the character action genre, one of the best shallow popcorn action movies you'll ever watch, and the true ""start"" of the Devil May Cry series as far as I'm concerned (and I don't mean chronologically, though it is also the earliest game canon-wise). I've played this game many times over the years on the original PS2 and in its HD re-release on PS3. I've loved it each and every time and I still love it now.Things you should know about this PC port: Yes, it's a shoddy port, but no, the PC version in its mod-less state is NOT unplayable. You just need to muck around a bit and you'll be fine with the game as-is (though the game will still run at much less than the natural 60 fps sometimes without mods, but it's still very playable under 60). (EDIT: Looks like after installing the K-Lite Codec Pack Mega and its Updates that I mention later on in this review, the number of drops in the framerate have reduced quite a bit. I guess the issue was tied to system codecs somehow. END EDIT)Some tips to get it running without mods: - Run the gamepad setup app that comes with the game before playing if you want to use a gamepad (and for a game like DMC3 that was designed with a gamepad in mind, you REALLY should). You'll need to disconnect any XInput gamepads (like an Xbox 360 gamepad) before using the setup app or playing the game; this game was made before XInput, so it's just not supported properly and will argue about it if it's still connected. What WILL work is a DInput (Direct Input) gamepad. I personally find that a DualShock 4 works perfectly (make sure you disable any background programs that will make the DS4 emulate a 360 gamepad). Edit the bindings in the app as you see fit, click the Save button multiple times until you see the ""saved"" popup, exit the app via its Exit button, and your gamepad should be good to go. - The game might crash during the opening pre-rendered videos due to possible codec incompatibilities. If you encounter this, downloading and installing a codec pack for your PC might fix this. I personally recommend the K-Lite Codec Pack Mega (if you choose this, don't forget to also download and install the separate Update app on the K-Lite Codec Pack website after downloading and installing the K-Lite Codec Pack). - The game might display strange resolutions in the Options (like 0x0) if you have a multiple monitor setup going. Unfortunate, I know, but that's why it's a shoddy port. Switching to only 1 monitor output before playing is best to choose the resolution you want. After choosing the desired resolution and making a save file, any time you start the game after, it will remember the resolution you chose, even if you re-enable multiple monitors and it goes back to displaying strange resolution in the Options. - The game will start windowed by default. To go back and forth between fullscreen, make sure the window has focus and hit Alt+Enter (it will unfortunately sometimes crash when doing this; I find it's safest to do it while you're in the Options menu). - The game was made in the era of 4:3 televisions (after all, it was a PS2 game first and foremost), so all offered resolutions will be in 4:3. If you are going to fullscreen, make sure your display uses the correct aspect ratio to avoid a stretched image (personally, I have to use my separate graphics card settings app to switch from scaling by aspect ratio to scaling by fullscreen, and then I have to set my actual display's settings to output in 4:3, though the specifics may vary depending on your setup). - There's no ""Exit Game"" option in the game, so to exit, you have to exit fullscreen and hit the window's close button to close it. When you do, THEN you'll actually get a ""Quit Game"" choice in-game. Choose ""Yes"" to close. - There can be quite a bit of screen tearing at times. However, the game DOES technically support V-sync. To enable it, however, you'll have to do it from your separate graphics card settings app.So yeah, it IS a shoddy port, but the game without mods is still very much playable if you're willing to put in a bit of elbow grease for this old title. I'd say it's worth it, though; this game is a hell of a ride and a hell of a gem! And hell, you can still use the mods too if you want after all this, why not =p			"

Once i bough it i tried playing it only on the keypad but the keys were too close together and it just felt awkward to play.So i decided to buy a controller for the pc but that didn't work either. The buttons were programmed wrong and it was impossible to change and not because the controller was broken but the game automatically programmed it that way.All in all Devil May Cry 3 is a good game non the less but DO NOT buy it on pc unless ypu want clunky awkward controls!

												I wont lie... this game has its ups and downs. The Cons are that this is thee worst port on steam. This port makes dark souls port looks amazing. You can't use your mouse, it doesn't work well with gamepad, and your fingers will burn after playing it with keyboard. Not to mention, because of the keyboard, you can't fully use combos to their max potentional. Still, even though this game has alot of issues... Issues aside, the fact remains that this is a great game. Evereyon who has played the original game on other systems will conclude about how much they enjoyed and loved this game and I have never played those other systems much. The story is really good, the game is fun besides the pitfalls, and the character Dante is amusing as ever. The game was challenging, the fighting cool, and the world well done. Was this a bad port, yes but was this a bad game, no. So if you don't mind hurting your fingers to play a good story then play it. If you can't stand that kind of thing then don't play it and play it on another system.			"

												Great game - iffy port. Had this game back on ps2 and love it, the port however hasnt seen much love. I couldnt find a full screen option ingame, nor did it support my xbox controller. I was forced to go into the DMC3SE.ini in my program files and custom map all my controls. The games worth a buy if its on sale, dmc3 is an amazing game, one of the best hack n slash games ever.

												Classic, brutal, stylish. DMC3 makes you realize how easy recent action games are. It's incredibly fun and mercilessly punishing. Surprisingly, the graphics have aged pretty well and the combat engine is just as fast-paced as it was on the PS2 port, better even.Though I love this game to death, it can be frustratingly difficult and can turn off casual gamers. The default keyboard controls also take some time getting used to. But for everyone else, ♥♥♥♥ing play this game.			"

												A stylish fighting game classic. This may be considered the peak of the Devil May Cry series. It is also out for quite the while now, so it seems hardly necessary to go into too much detail that has already been covered over and over again.Storywise, you battle your way through an ancient tower to face your brother Vergil and foil his sinister intentions... but whose plan is really in action here?Gameplaywise, this game really shines. You can achieve mastery in four styles with different foci (Gunslinger, Swordmaster, Trickster and Royal Guard), plus two slightly more gimmick-like unlockables. You acquire an arsenal of five melee and five long range weapons, each category of which you can equip two and seamlessly switch between them. This is hardly astonishing nowadays, but it still blends together magnificently. There is also the bloody palace, an arena mode that provides slaughter aplenty.This version comes with new difficulty modes (compared to the original on PS2), which may or may not be of interest to you, and with a playable Vergil. This is a fun variant of the fighting gameplay, but does not introduce a lot of new content otherwise - the levels are simply the campaign all over again, minus the story cutscenes.One thing that should be mentioned is the optimization of the steam version. I bought the game in retail originally, and there were quite a few problems with it not recognizing gamepads correctly or at all - I ended up with a JoyToKey-workaround, which rather nullified the use of analog sticks, and still had trouble mapping the controller because some buttons were not registered, some double, and some of the in-game controls refused to be changed. The steam game comes with a controller configuration application, a nice little thing that took all this work away and actually succeeded in using both sticks and the various seemingly problematic buttons. This little addition increases playability a good deal for me.If you do not have this game yet and care for action / (sword-) fighting games with a really well thought-through combat system, I highly recommend looking into this.

												As someone who grew up with the original DMC3SE on ps2. I have to say this port is kinda bad. multple framerate drops, wonky gamepad support and lack of graphics settings......however if you play this with the style switcher mod. it fixes most of the problems and adds a ton of new features.  like the name implies being able to switch your style on command. with this mod the pc version far exceeds the console counter part so i reccomend this game only if you get the style switcher modMod Link: http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?

												I love Devil May Cry series, but this game needs a mod in order to work properly with a controller, and even if you use that mod, the game doesn´t change the buttons of the tutorial for the buttons of the controller you are already using, so you´ll have to be guessing all the time which button is which... I recommend Devil May Cry 3 as a really good game, but if you don´t have a controller nor you are very familiar installing mods and things like that I do not recommend buying this game on Steam.

												Devil May Cry 3 seems very classic when compared to DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition (which I'm not to fond of, but that's a different review). Dante is back in his 3rd game in the series, the bosses are fairly difficult, and this game overall is quite a challenge.Which might be because it took me (an experienced DMC fan) over 10 minutes just to figure out all of the buttons. The camera angles feel weird and confining, and as far as I could tell.. unchangeable.3.5/5 "

												I really want to give this game a good review, but I can't because this version of the game is literally broken. Devil May Cry is one of the less forgiving entries in the series, but does crappy port of the game does no justice. Some people will try to defend their purchase that it is rather playable, but you need to do some advance configurations to get the game running with playable settings.Control support is barebones to the point that you might as well play with mouse and keyboard, oh wait, that's broken too.Graphics are really choppy and the setttings are barebones as well.The game aside is good but this port is horrendous.I got this game with a DMC 4 bundle so I don't really care that this is in my library, but if anyone were to buy this game seperate please, I beg of  you don't buy it, and buy DMC4 seperate as it is worth the money.Do yourself a favor and go buy the console version or the DMC HD collection, or emulate it, whatever. Its really upsetting that this game is still up for sale and Valve won't take it down because they want to have DMC games in their library. Trust me, you'll love yourself for buying the console version instead of this poor excuse of a port that hasn't been updated forever.EDIT: So I found out that there is a mod that does fix the support for controls and video settings. BUT my review still stands as a thumbs down as no one should buy this game full price just for a third party mod. Just get the console version with the HD Collection.			"

												Recommended but for fans only ! I would even say fans that don't mind putting some effort into fixing the problems. It's a pretty bad port ! Be advise of what you're getting. Things that don't work as expected :  Dualshock 3 not detected (setup as a 360 controller with DS3/Better DS3. Work in every game but this one).  Can't launch in fullscreen. Got to press alt+enter everytime. Resolution isn't saved. Got to set it to 1280x960 everytime (That's the maximum, original 4:3 format mind you). There's some clipping on both side of the screen when in fullscreen. Ok so that's my complaint after just got out of the shop and facing that 3 headed dog. I ended mapping all the keyboard buttons on my Steam Controller and it works well enough. Gotta say that I'm a fan of the serie, played them all back on the PS2, PS3 and now on PC. This port is just really really bad but if you put some effort, you can make it work with patches and fixes by the community. Just know what you're getting into. Be advised !!			"

												DMC3 is a great game, but the PC Version is not enjoyable at all you need to fix the game yourself if you want to play it with a Controller (because playing with a Keyboard isn't the same) or to play it all. Another thing is that the resolution has to be fixed aswell, because the game starts in a small window even after changing the resolution manually and when i tried to do it in the game it crashed.Buy this game if you like downloading mods and fixes and if not play the console version, it's just a shame the see such a  great console game being ported so bad.

												Control sucks. Screen sucks. Fixing settings. Can't exit game. Buy a steam controller and it works fine. Meaning spend 50 more bucks for the controllers or your own Xbox controller to experience the awesome game. Capcom a.k.a caps on..... Needs o fix this game. I wonder why it's 5 bucks. Sure it's a gr8 game but still needs a lot of fixes. Bring back the dante games but rather or modern graphics and better fighting styles and more weps. Also make bayonetta be part of the games as well. Please capcom SAMA you have gaben-San now.			"

												Great game, and it runs well even on my outdated laptop, but the controller support is pretty awful. It doesn't support an XBOX360 controller by default, and even though you can basically set up a usable configuration with it, you can't use the triggers, the right stick is permanently bound to movement, and the left stick isn't used.So unless you don't mind downloading a third party controller-compatibilty program and losing analog control, steer clear of this for now.

												I can't believe PCSX2 Plays this better. I'm running into very bad frame rates with this game while i can play this almost flawlessly on emulation. Plus the controller support is crap. Do not get this bad port. Though i recommend getting DMC4 because it runs alot better than this game and can even run on my laptop.			"

												Amazing game...however!! It's a broken port that DOES NOT WORK. It takes forever just to get it set-up right for the controller and then when you get it started...the screen is suddenly tiny...just...tiny. However, then I went to play...and...the whole controller was mirrored...so go to fix that, then it's not working.Simply put, it's a half-♥♥♥♥♥ port from the console and they did not put ANY effort whatsoever into making it PC compatible with keyboard/mouse or easy to set-up with a controller. I just wanna play the game! Not spend thirty minutes to try to hook it up.			"

												The original game for the PS2 is one of the best games I have played in my life in terms of gameplay.  It's the pinnacle of it's genre and all people should play it.  The PC port of this game is...about as appealing as putting a rusty nail in your toe nail then kicking a wall, then gouging your eyes out with a broken spatula, then drowning to death in a pool of your own ♥♥♥♥.

												0/10First off, this is an AMAZING GAME. Just not the PC version.If you thought Dark Souls on the PC was bad, be prepared for a new low.No fullscreen. Low resolution (which is fair for an older game).No 360 controller support.Even my with my PS gamepad the controls were buggered.Please just buy it on PS2 or the HD collection.Please.			"

												This is by far my favorite game of all time (except for the work required to make this pc version playable) I can find nothing wrong with this game (granted a heavy bias) If you haven't played this game I honestly recommend the HD collection edition on the xbox 360 or this version if you don't mind putting in a little work.If you have played this game you probably understand why this is my favorite game of all time.

												This game + a wired xbox 360 controller and a free program called ""xpadder"" = all your port problems solved. Play the game like you played it on ps2. Others have recommended style switcher mod, which I myself haven't tried, but between the mod, xpadder, or just using an off brand xbox controller, one I got from walmart for like 10 or 19 bucks works with the game immediately, so there is no excuse for people saying this is an awful port... just use a controller! Devil May Cry is hard to play with a keyboard! (I used to do that too, it's actually not THAT hard...but it is hard to be stylish with the keyboard, still here are 3 solutions so you have no excuse, this game kicks too much ♥♥♥ to pass up on)  Also this Special Edition on PC because of pc resolution I guess it makes the graphics better. I'm not sure how it works exactly or if it is in fact more polygons, but it looks like it, or it looks like the same old ps2 graphics, but just like, optimized and used to their fullest and with much more clarity; it looks a lot better than on ps2. So this is a good thing and a nice upgrade. Considering all these things and everything else I've said here and the ratings I've given this kickass game, I can't really not recommend you buy it if it comes on sale.Needless to say this is one of the best games ever made, it is legendary for revolutionizing and innovating especially in the hack n' slash genre, so for $3.99, you'd be hard pressed to find a better way to spend four dollars. Many hours of fulfilling playtime, with the best characters, story, and gameplay of any DMC title. If your game collection is lacking this legendary title, a new experience awaits! It's a classic for several reasons you just have to play to discover and appreciate, and if it's one of the few or only CAPCOM games you haven't played, you are missing out! Special Edition adds Dante's twin brother Vergil as a playable character in all 20 story missions, and bloody palace mode. ""This party's gettin crazy! Let's rock!"" - Dante Story:  9.1Gameplay:  9.4Sound:  8.9 Replay value: 8.5Graphics : 8.9 Atmosphere/world: 8Bottom line:  This is definitely one you get for entertaining gameplay and short, humorous (sometimes mysterious) filler cutscenes with likeable dialogue (short and to the point, not drawn out) that keep the flow and advance the story, as well as decent game length compared to the average game and some different than your average platformer puzzles. Highly recommended. This is a very natural feeling game with good content. The story is good too, easily the best of any DMC game, but it doesn't ever seem to get in the way of the focus: awesome gameplay, and different puzzles. The only things I could say would improve this game by making it slightly more immersive, in my opinion, would be perhaps to see some other humans in the city, how they are affected by the Temen-ni-gru's resurrection, and maybe one or two bright, open places to contrast the otherwise dark, gritty, and toiling tower (there are some areas in the game that do this, and do it well, it just makes you wish there were more but it's a good balance, besides, too much (or particularly, in this game, since the gates to the demon world are being opened, much of any light at all) would be breaking the tone ). However, the game sticks to its guns (no pun intended, although appropriate as hell), and does what it does extremely well. You feel the journey you're on to the demon world as you ascend and traverse the tower and it's many diverse bosses, and it is beautifully executed.Also, one other drawback (this game does not have many of), the other styles besides swordmaster are pretty irrelevant and even unexciting, but this is hardly noticed as all the attacks you can do with swordmaster are so much fun and deal the greatest damage anyway. One exception to this is that the ""Doppleganger"" style enabled a sort of two player mode on the PS2, with a second controller plugged in and Super Dante, the costume that allows you to stay in Devil Trigger mode infinitely, thereby allowing a second player to follow and battle alongside you through the entire game. I have not tested this on this PC version with two Xbox 360 controllers, but this would be interesting, and if I find out the answer to that question by testing it myself or another's comment, I will update my review to reflect that. Happy hunting, son of Sparda!			"

												I tried to play this game after finishing DMC4 Special Edition but this game really doesn't want you to play it.FORTUNATELY I have found a perfect solution:EMULATE IT ON PS2!I couldnt stomach installing Styleswitcher and even then it wouldnt fix the atroucious graphics and resolution. On the other hand the emulated version is extremely flexible when it comes to graphics settings and there is no issue with the gamepad whatsoever.Show your love by buying this game but spare yourself the trouble and just emulate it, you will far more pleased than doing a messy install for style switcher while suffering from bad resolution.

												The game itself is good.  However, getting it to play nice with a 360 controller and finding a decent resolution is a chore.  But I thought it was worth it in the end.This link posted by another reviewer helped me get setup: http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?I think this is what worked for me to get the 360 controller to work correctly with the game.

												Initially I gave this game a worse review, since it's still an atrocious port of one of the character action greats. It's got no fullscreen option, bad controller support, occasional slowdowns and bugged music in some parts. Playing this on a Playstation 2, or playing the HD collection is obviously the better option.That said, I managed to play this game in its entirety by fiddling with my controller (one of those cheap Logitech gamepads with input options) and setting my computer's power option to High Performance. Once I did the latter, the game ran almost perfectly, but with no fullscreen. If you're willing to try your luck with this piece of ♥♥♥♥ or you have the patience to install the Style Switcher mod, buy this port on sale.Otherwise, play it on a Playstation or emulate it. "
