												One of the best older FPS-games I ever played, due to the sheer number of weapons and attacks, ways to kill the enemys and deal with the missions it is nearly a sandbox game but gets really hard later on and challenges the player. Rarely had this much fun with an older FPS in recent years, worth the exploration, time and money!			"

												Project: Snowblind isn't going to go down as one of the great legendary FPS games, but it is a very good game for the $1.50 I paid for it. The structure of the game is that of your usual single-player fps campaign (beating a linear series of levels), but it does some interesting things that make it worth playing.The combat in this game is excellent. Each weapon is interesting and fun to use, but more importantly each weapon is useful for different types situations, meaning you'll be switching which one you use frequently. Furthermore, they all retain their usefullness throughout the campaign, meaning you won't be lugging around a bunch of useless weapons by the time the endgame rolls around. Each weapon also has an alt-fire, which expands their possibilities even more. This game started off as a spin-off of Deus Ex, and even though the final product no longer shares that title or universe (and doesn't have any rpg elements, being a pure FPS), it does let you use the same of type nano-augmentations to give you the upper hand in combat. This ranges from making your self invisible, to shooting electric bolts, to becoming completely invulnerable. These augmentations let you try a variety of different strategies for approaching each battle and did a great job of spicing up the game (although I did find myself using the invulerability one pretty much exclusively it was made available). Also like Deus Ex, there is also a hacking element. You have a device called the ""icepick"" that lets you fire a dart onto anything that's hackable and then take control of that thing remotely. This allows you to take control of turrets and mechs, and using them to turn the tables on the enemies is hilarious and awesome. The last thing in terms of gameplay I want to bring up is that the level design is excellent. Even though the levels are mostly linear, each area gives you a handful of options and alternate routes, meaning you could go in guns blazing, or you could try to find a sneakier path and do things stealthily. Overall, the gameplay is Project: Snowblind's strongest point, as the weapon design, level design, and augmentations blend together brilliantly.Despite the excellent gameplay, there are a handful of areas Project: Snowblind falls short in, some of which were detrimental to my enjoyment of the game, some not so much. The biggest issue I had with this game is that the saves are handled using manual checkpoints you must find and activate within the level, as opposed to being able to save where you want or using automatic checkpoints. Normally, I don't mind checkpoints too much, but Project: Snowblind only has one or two of these points per level, meaning that if you die, you usually have to replay much more of what you just did than is desirable (usually about 7 or 8 minutes worth). What's even worse is these checkpoints are sometimes hidden in obscure, out of the way places and in some levels I couldn't even find them despite the game having a feature telling you what direction you should be heading to find them. These checkpoints really drag down the game, and whenever I found myself quitting the game, it was usually because I was tired of having to replay massive swaths just to retry one point. On the technical side, Snowblind has a few glaring issues as well. I had the game crash on me several times during my playthrough. This was especially annoying because they usually happened once I finally overcame whatever section of the game I was stuck on (meaning I would have to replay that part yet again once I restarted the game). Annother annoying bug is that there is something wrong with the game's contrast, making everything look extremely washed out making stuff that's supposed to be black more of a gray. This seems to effect everyone's copy and I haven't found any kind of workaround or fix. Take a loot at the user posted screenshots on this game's Steam community hub, then compare them to the screenshots on the Store page, and you will see that something is very wrong. This is extremely annoying and even makes the game hard to look at in places, which is unfortunate, because you can tell the game has decent art direction and isn't supposed to look like this (videos I watched of the PS2 and Xbox versions seemed to be fine however). With that said, I was able to look past this and enjoy the gameplay (which again, is excellent), but this is something you should know about going in.The storyline is a weak point as well, but it does have some merit. The overall plot is completely forgettable, basically serving as an excuse for you to shoot your way through each level (as an aside, nearly every cutscene contains a helicopter either destroying something or getting destroyed. This is not a problem). The most interesting thing about the storyline is that the big evil plot that you try to prevent is almost identical to one of the ending options from Deus Ex 1, but that's about it. With that said, the character themselves were actually pretty likeable and distinct, and there is some pretty good voice acting as well (the game also has a surprisingly decent sense of humor that pops up now and them). You won't care why you're fighting this war, but you will enjoy the company.Overall, Project: Snowblind is pretty solid for a budget game, thanks to fantastic gameplay (even if it doesn't have much else going for it). I don't think I'll be playing through it a second time, but for $1.50, the ride was a fun one worth taking.			"

												My review of this game is easy.If you like cleaner FPS games like Red Faction, Star Wars Commandos, or even original F.E.A.R., then you should love Snowblind.  It has all the things I love about those games.  Here are just some of them:1) All environments are ""real"".  By that I mean that they are all rendered in the 3D world.  Anything you see, you can probably jump or stand on.  No invisible walls except in the sense that the levels have to be defined by something. They aren't infinite after all.  But it is usually something believable like a wall or fence.2) Along with the above, and the addition of many game elements like alarms, being able to hack terminals and so on, you have many options for how you want to defeat your enemies.  This ranges from a full on berserk attack to stealthily creeping around or hiding.  Lots of air ducts to crawl through.3) Plenty (and I do mean plenty) of weapons, additional equipment you can use and augmentations to you personally.  Some of these are  -Increased vision abilities  -Spiderbots that follow you around, like the insects in Half Life, and help you out.  -EMP, poison gas, and frag grenades  -Cool shotgun, Carbine, Sniper rifle, and pistol  -Reflex augmentation that functions like the reflex boost in F.E.A.R.  -...the list goes on.  This is only a very small part.4) Lots of environmental elements like steam, lighting, being able to break windows, opening cabinets and breaking some crates for items.  There also is a weapon similar to the gravity gun in Half Life that lets you move some things around and you can pick up certain objects.5) Fitting AI and com chatter voices, for this kind of game.  So, that means coming across humorous conversations as you sneak around and a CO that is pushing you ahead.  I really appreciate all the background talking that is going on in this game.There are lots of other elements that I like too.  But, if any of this interests you, than I would just go get this game.  I bought it for not much from BundleStars since it had been on my Amazon wishlist for some time.  But, now that I know how good it is, I would pay the full $6 price for sure.One final caveat:  There are some graphical issues with this game.  Mostly that it looks kind of washed out and low contrast on modern systems.  BUT, I easily took care of it with a little trial and error in the Nvidia control panel.  But, even without that, it seems like the biggest thing that helped was turning off ""Fullscreen effects"" in the games own options.  You have to run its separate option utility to access it.  Its not hard to get to.  It just pops up when you go to play the game.While trying to troubleshoot this issue, I ran across a lot of hate for this game.  It is completely undeserved.  Its an awesome game, if you like these kinds of games.  Its NOT a COD clone or FarCry or Splinter Cell.  But it is interesting and a lot of fun.  Give it a try!			"

												7/10 Solid, middle-of-the-road shooting goodness. Not going to set the world on fire, but the special abilities are certainly fun, even if a handful of the weapons and abilities feel a little pointless. OK AI and gameplay, some amusing level design in places, mechs can be frustrating bullet sponges. Ignore the story, and the horrible cutscenes.TL;DR the best kind of generic.			"

												Amazing game. I loved it when I had it for the PlayStation 2, and I still love it on PC. The campaign mode is phenomenal; what game lets you play as a badass supersoldier who can repel bullets, see through walls, turn invisible, and move faster? Oh, and possess some sick guns as well.

												Deus Ex Spinoff which should be called Deus Ex: Clan Wars. They think about making a MP version of Deus Ex but after failed Invisible War, forget about that beginnings and make a game in other universe. But better talk about gameplay.Do ever dreamed about more linear deus ex ? Do you tired of leveling up ♥♥♥♥, and SWIMMING SKILL ? You just want shoot arses and use AUGMENTATION. So project: snowblind is just for you! Its linear FPS with AUGMENTATIONS and great storyline.You can play out any mission with rush\stealth\predator playing style and its not even frustrating! Sadly that Singleplayer is pretty short and Multiplayer is dead, but really great experience for any who loves FPS as a genre and  vent shafts.  I never asked for this.  "

												NOTE: I did not attempt the multiplayer, please take that into account.Set in the future, and originally intended as a spin-off of Deus Ex: Invisible War, Project: Snowblind shares many similarities with that game.Focusing almost exlusively on shooting (i.e. gunplay), you are boosted with a handful of augmentations. While the game is nowhere near as complex as a Deus Ex game, in terms of choices, alternate paths, etc., this game places far more emphasis on shooting, as one would expect.Not the longest, and certainly not the prettiest game out there, Project: Snowblind is nevertheless a fun and enjoyable ride, with a well-weighted ramp up in difficulty as you progress. If you enjoy FPS games, give this one a try. With the multitude of guns, alternate fire modes and more, you will have a good time.If you are playing on a widescreen monitor (and who isn't these days?), I followed the below guide (all credit for guide goes to OP):

												Project: Snowblind was initially a Deus Ex game, before later being turned into a new IP after the poor performance of Invisible War, and it doesn't do a very good job of hiding the fact. You play as a soldier who was forced to become nano-augmented after suffering heavy trauma in a battle, and fight for a peace-keeping group called UNAT- no, wait, I mean the ""Liberty Coalition"". There's a character who acts as your commander who is mechanically augmented, and frequently laments that he's become outdated. The items all look like they were taken straight from Deus Ex, like the energy cells and health kits, and you fight a lot of familiar enemies like bipedal mechs and mechanical spiders. Even the hacking tool is named after the ICEbreaker hacking interface from Deus Ex.However, it's probably for the best that it never ended up being released as a Deus Ex game. In many ways, this game is sort of like the Bioshock Infinite of Deus Ex, right down to replacing the actual hacking of the real games with a gun that you shoot at panels to instantly hack them. Rather than being an RPG with shooter elements, Project Snowblind is a full FPS. There are no wide open maps or choices to make, just enemies to shoot and objectives to move towards. The game does a loose job of allowing both shooting and stealth playthroughs, but the stealth half is pretty horribly done and not all that viable. The radio contact in the game is also somewhat schizophrenic about this; in one particular mission where you have to get up a few levels of a parking garage, he initially contacts you to tell you that it might be a good idea to sneak through it due to high guard activity, then almost immediately tells you that you might be able to cause some real chaos with one of the vehicles in the next room, only to go back to telling you that stealth might allow you to listen in on guards' conversations on the next floor. You get a handful of augmentations throughout the game, but instead of being able to choose which ones you get or being able to upgrade them, the game just hands them out as you progress, using the same story justification as the reason they later used in Human Revolution. The game doesn't feature very many characters, and while the few it does feature aren't bad, they're barely used, and after you first meet them they tend to disappear until they're needed for a dramatic moment. The story in general is pretty poorly paced, and you fight the final boss of the game about 3/4 into the game. The game is also pretty short, only lasting around 6 hours. The game also has a tendency to crash, particularly when you minimize it, which is a problem since due to being a console game, you can only save in designated save rooms rather than having a quicksave or even checkpoint system.On the other hand, as long as you can see it as its own game instead of a Deus Ex main game, it's a pretty fun shooter. It's interesting to see it as a spinoff where you play as just a semi-regular member of not-UNATCO instead of ""that guy who single-handedly unravels an Illuminati conspiracy"", and while the stealth is generally awful, the shooting is done pretty well, and the weapons and their secondary functions are all pretty fun to use. While it does have a lot of faults if you compare it to Deus Ex itself, as a standalone game it's pretty fun, and it's only $6 at its base price and presumably much less on sale. It's interesting to try out, if only to see the lost Deus Ex game that almost existed. If you do decide to buy it, be sure to check out the widescreen patch on pcgamingwiki if you have a widescreen monitor.			"

												This is a fun little FPS game. It was released back in 2005, and this is the first time I've played it and thought it was pretty fun. Don't expect a masterpiece or hours upon hours of gameplay, but if you like a short single-player focused sci-fi shooter with a cool setting, then give it a try.The setting is a near future and really reminded me of Deus Ex (from what I've heard, it was initially planned to be a sequel to Deus Ex, but later turned into a standalone title). You play as military commander who gets injured in battle and implanted with combat augmentations, which become available for use over time.This is what I really enjoyed about the gameplay. It's not just your bog standard corridor shooter relying on twitch reflexes. It has a bit of a strategic edge, as you acquire a number of interesting augmentations throughout the game, such as the ability to slow time, ballistic shielding (temporary protection from bullets), cloak, enhanced vision, and so on. In addition to augmentations, you also find some cool gadgets to use in battle too, such as spider bots to act as your little pets and aid you in combat, deployable force field to act as cover, a large variety of grenades (most of the ones from Deus Ex), and even a nanoboost, which is like your emergency revive that you can choose to use if you die in battle.The game seems to have only one difficulty mode (I didn't see how to change it), but overall it's paced really well. I didn't come across any difficulty spikes and the game never throws anything unfair towards you. In some levels it's just you infiltrating some facility, in others the combat takes on a large scale assault and you have many of your squadmates with you and witness battles between large groups of soldiers. It's all really well done, even if graphically the game aged a fair bit.I only have one big gripe. The game crashes from time to time for no reason. It only happened about 5-6 times for me during my playthrough, but because you aren't able to save anytime you like, at times you could lose chunks of progress. Saving can only be done in special save rooms and also at the end of each level.Overall it was a fun game. Aside from the crashes, I thought it was well done and would certainly recommend it if you like FPS games with a story and a bit of a tactical edge.			"

												*TL;DR*An Oldie *But a Goodie* with clunky controls, strange jump physics, and a plot that involves shooting Commies in the face? Sign me the hell up!*For those of you still reading, read on*Project: Snowblind puts you into the shoes of Lt. Nathan Frost, a self proclaimed grunt who wound up getting enhancements due to a tiny bit of stupidity during a bombing. The Coalition, which Nathan is a part of, is fighting the thinly veiled People's Republic of China *It's just called The Republic but you can definitely see the communist overtones with them* Fighting a war to liberate China from The Republic's attempt to take it over during a time of weakness in that nation.Gameplay is pretty solid overall, having guns that feel powerful and with the secondary fires and utility uses, have purpose outside of a few levels, so there's no moment of one weapon outshining the others, leaving them to collect dust. Ammo is plentiful yet scarce in the right way. Forcing you to the other guns when the need arises, including some guns that take the same ammo *Pistol and Carbine take the same bullets for example* though there are only two cases where this is true...Controls are a bit awkward at first but once you get the hang of them, you'll find your fingers naturally hitting those keys like Clockwork *EXAMPLE: Ctl is PUNCH *Probably one of the most SATISFYING punches of all time by the way*, Alt is Augs, Shift is Grenade, etc. etc. etc.* Though do not ask me about Multiplayer as I do not know if that still lives. There is also a Stealth Mechanic that isn't OVERLY Necessary but it is an option. It can feel pretty good when you take out an entire room without them realizing you were there until only one remains and you reveal yourself, taking your sweet time in ending him.Music is rather generic at points but it can at least strike a few chords that make you go 'F'n A.' though otherwise they are forgettable.The Story is rather slapdash at parts but consistant all throughout the game, so there's some Kudos, not much I CAN say about it partly due to spoilers but also because its not always there, though that CAN Be a good thing if you just want to play and not give a damn. *You can skip cutscenes too, which is good if you forgot to save* And Checkpoints are more or less just save rooms which allow you to come back at any time to that section either if you die *and lack Nanoboosts* OR If you left and returned at a later time.Either way, I recommend this game if you're up for some gunplay and well applied Stealth, the Augmentations are fun and boring *The factor being your playstyle, though some are more fun than others universally.* and the game is a decent length, around 3-4 at least if you're just blazing through it, a couple more if you are being stealthy or playing Hard Mode. *Or better yet, both*			"

												So starting with the bad, this is a console port. It's so heavily obvious. - The textures are bland, very washed out. - Options are limited - Mouse sensitivity is soapy - Not the worst optimization, but far from good - Crashes a little less than ""often""The good: - Really fun and addictive game - Guns feel awesome (despite their flimsy sounds) - Stunning and unique abilities that few games manage to pull off (to be honest it still feelsweird, but it feels like that's how it was meant to feel like) - Purely cheesy game, in a good way - Cutscenes are dramatic (cheesy dramatic) but still enough to engage you - Damn good level design - As a whole, most of the gameplay ""works""Overall, yes, I recommend this game, but that makes me almost generous. I'm so close to not recommending it (the demo doesn't even work...) but the good about this game outweights the bad by a very TINY bit. Of course if you have access to an Xbox or PS2 with composite or some modded HDMI support, that's the best way you've got going for you to play this, in fact, stay far away from this console port if you've got those options. If not, the PC version is still fair enough.			"

												When ever you try to compare games to Deus Ex things always seem to get a poor review due to comparison, rather than a review on the games own merits.I love Deus Ex, it and System Shock 2 share the position on the number 1 spot of my favourite games of all time.Deus Ex: Invisible War is a terrible sequel in regards to the original, but I defend the game on its own merits. This is the case with Project: Snowblind, comparing it to its heritage will result in the game being slammed. But is it a bad game? No.Project: Snowblind is a interesting game, granted the game is easy as hell and the main protagonist isn't particularly likeable, but the game has some interesting ideas, and some kickass weapons. My favourite of these is the Flecette.If you're a fan of System Shock, Deus Ex, or Bioshock, then you should check this game out. It's not great, it makes Invisible War look like a masterpiece, but judge this one by its merits.			"

It's not a terribly long game, but the journey to the end is fun and each new gun and power up makes you feel more like the powerful superweapon you are.

If you looking for an fps game with a bunch of options with weapons and equipment then this game is for you. Plus at only a 1.50 on sale, its a steal. The game crashes a bit but not enough to ruin it since the game loads quickly too. The game has a surprisingly good amount of cutscenes.

												Project: Snowblind is a first person shooter with a distinctly arcade action feel.  The graphics are quire dated and the control scheme lacks a lot of the nuance of a modern shooter, but it handles well and the ai isn't too dull.  The game features a checkpoint save system, which at times can present a challenge for the novice player but seem to be spaced an adequate distance apart.  The game only supports resolutions up to 1600 x 1200, but the Steam Overlay does work.  In the end Project: Snowblind is an above average shooter from it's era. even though it definitely shows its age.			"

												THis is probably the best game I have played outside the usual shooter team - based mission based/ goal oriented FPS.It is also good to know its done by the team that made the recent Tomb Raider games, which means the A.I. is very well done, and the level designs are too. The cool thing is usually the guns in the games youre used to, however here the tools and types of granades are what make the game quite different and interesting.It is also nice that it will run on most machines going back at least five or more years( I mean to 2005 all the way through todays machines).

												Obligatory header to the review: I focus on four primary areas whenever I review a game: gameplay, story, graphics, and sound/audio/general things that go into your earholes. Gameplay and Story get a rating scale from 1 to 10, and the AV stuff gets a rating from 1 to 5. My philosophy on this is that there are some instances in which a game may not necessarily have that much in the way of gameplay (take Amnesia for example), but the story/atmosphere/whatever it may be is reason enough to pick it up. Also, take the cumulative score with a grain of salt; it's just a numerical feeling about the game as a whole. That's part of why I do these subscores. Also, keep in mind that I'm not going off of school grade based rankings. A 5/10 denotes what I feel to be an average game. Likewise, 7/10 is a game that I think is pretty cool, and something that gets a 2/10 is near-abomination level. Pinning scores to an even further obfuscated rating scale is kinda senseless, but for the sake of my backloggery, I'll repeat again that 1.0-2.7 is a one-star game, 3.0-4.7 is a two-star game, 5.0-6.7, 7.0-8.7, and 9.0-10 are three, four, and five stars, respectively.Gameplay: Project Snowblind, as you may or may not know, was originally intended to be a more multi-player focused game in the Deus Ex series to be called Deus Ex: Clan Wars. Then Invisible War came along and utterly tarnished the Deus Ex name.  Despite the abandonment of the namesake, the game still retains a lot of the level design sensibilities that Deus Ex had, albeit a lot more straightforward here than in Deus Ex. By that, I mean that the player has plenty of choices on how to take areas. You can run in, guns ablaze; pick enemies off from a distance with the sniper rifle; sneak through the area entirely; hack any nearby electronics to kill enemies remotely, etc. etc. Since I often opt for the most meat-headed approach to gameplay, I was a guns blazing kind of player, although there were a few chapters where I found that it wasn't the best approach.As I said earlier, this game is pretty much Deus Ex Lite. It has pretty much everything Deus Ex had, although much simpler to suit the very action oriented gameplay. All the RPG elements are gone, which can be disappointing for some. Hacking is done with an Icepick; a weird sort of EMP hacking kajigger. This does mean that you are limited to how many things you can hack throughout the level, although I found that ammo for the Icepick was easy to come by, presuming you looked around for it. Augmentations are here as well, with a few abilities being cloaking, slow motion, and bullet shields. They don't last forever and do use up Bioenergy, which you can find both replenishing items and increases to your maximum Bioenergy (the same for health, of course).Unfortunately, this game is very much a port. Autoaim is on by default, and I found no way of disabling it. Some people talked about the game crashing all the time; it crashed a couple of times for me, and both times it was just after a cutscene started. After looking at what happened in the Event Viewer, I wasn't able to make certain what it was specifically in Snowblind.SP that crashed or why it did so. This could have also been because of a thing I did to make the game run at 1080p (I'll talk about that later). I did rebind a couple of keys; namely rebinding augmentation usage to Tab and getting rid of the weapon menu altogether. It's just more fun frantically scrolling through weapons in the heat of battle (to me, at least).The levels themselves are short, usually lasting about ten to fifteen minutes, and have at least one savepoint in the area. This game doesn't have checkpoints, so be sure to make use of the savepoints. These levels are pretty well paced and often feel reasonable and fair without being completely boring. Enemy variety isn't the greatest, and I would have liked to have seen a few more mech enemies, but it's not too big of a deal. Overall, if you're looking for a dumb mid-2000's shooter to play for a night, you really can't go wrong with this one. For the price of $6 (I picked it up on sale, so it was even cheaper), I can say that this is a very worthwhile purchase, even if you do have to do a few things to get it in reasonable working order. 8/10.Story: Again, it's pretty much Deus Ex Lite. The game did open with some actually quite good exposition of the main character, Nathan Frost. Unfortunately, it does kinda turn to the same old military hoo-rah schtick after a while. There really isn't much in the way of character development for Frost, much less for anyone else. At least it's not Russia being the bad guys, so I guess there's that. However, at least it's pretty well directed, even if the source material isn't the greatest. The cinematics are pretty well done, even if they do have some questionable choices in filters from time to time. They do start to feel like more of an action movie than a Deus Ex intrigue, however, so take that as you will. However, for what was there, it was pretty enjoyable, if rather cliche at times. 7/10.Graphics: You're gonna need to do a bit of work in order to get this game running decently on a modern computer. For starters, this game only runs in 4:3 using the default resolutions in-game. I looked a bit on the Steam forums for this game, and I came across a fix that had me download an over-riding DX9 .dll file and its associated .cfg. In that .cfg, it's rather easy to set the resolution to that of your monitors. Some people have said that the fix doesn't work for them, but it worked well for me. Perhaps they didn't put the .dll and .cfg file in the root directory of the game; I dunno. Nevertheless, if you do a little searching on the P:S forums for a topic on widescreen resolution, you'll find what I'm talking about. I will be keeping that file around; it seems to be a pretty neat little multi-purpose DX9 ""modernizer"". Just don't be dumb and drop it in System32.As for how the game looks in the perspective of art style, this is what I talk about when I bring up realistic graphics not standing the test of time. It doesn't look god-awful, but it isn't the easiest thing to look at. Probably the best looking area in the game is the last level, which goes for a very Tron-esque look. Again, the game as a whole doesn't look terrible today, but this is yet another reason why art style should always trump realism when it comes to visual direction. 2/5.Sound: The soundtrack is pretty much a generic action movie soundtrack. It's not bad and it does pump you up, but it's still not that musically interesting. Voice acting is alright; it's certainly not going to be winning any awards, but it's probably not going to put you off, either. I'm running out of space, so I'll just say it's alright. 3/5.Overall scores are: 8/7/2/3; cumulative score of 6.7/10.			"

												Game was good until it keeps constantly crashing at some point.The game is good, theres no difficulty in this which is a big flaw in story mode campaigns. Only saves you have is the ones in the room (you will know through tutorial) and when you beat the chapter (which is fine).The only most big important thing in gaming is the crash which usually happens at random occasions in later levels which is a bother. Not sure if it happens to anyone but it happens to me before. Manage to beat it, but barely because of the crash.I wouldnt recommend it unless you know how to deal with the crashes.			"

This game was the best game I played on the Playstation. It's defiantely the best gamer on steam right now. 22/10.

												I got great nostalgia from this game, back then I used to play it on PS2. The game has the cheesiest story I have played you basically land in a a hong Kong civil war and trying to save a freindly soldier you got hit by a missile and aout of nowhere you were chosen to be augmented and promoted to liutenant...So yeah story isnt that superb, but it is entretaining at least. The gameplay is pretty basic, there is somekind of autoaim wich is annoying but it isnt a major problem. In conclusion the game has some flwas but it still pretty good considering it is a game from 2005..3 HOURSS, 3 HOURSS LOONG. Corporate Comander had something to do with this game back in 2005.			"

												I first played this game during the golden age of the Xbox. Lots of fun guns, gadgets and powers help you crush the dissident  forces of General Badguy and help save Neo Hong Kong. The game runs well on my system (Win10) without any compatability modes or SysAdmin settings. Just don't alt-tab out of it, otherwise you'll get to crashing. If the game fails to load because it ""can't find steam"" just copypasta the steam.dll from your Steam root directory directly into this game's folder. There is also a widescreen patch that you can get, just Google that for 16:9 goodness. The graphics can look a little muddy with higher resolutions, but your Nvidia/Radeon control panel can help alleviate that. I grabbed it for super cheap during Summer Sale 2016, but the game is well worth full price. If I were to compare this to a newer game, it would best be compared to Singularity... a cool gimmick, fun gameplay, and definately underrated. Final score: 9/10 JC Dentons.			"

												I'm told this game was intended as a Deus Ex spinoff, sequel, or spiritual successor and it shows. The hacking, spiderbots, and stealth options are very reminicent of the Deus Ex series, but this game is much more action oriented than Deus Ex.There is almost always more than one to take on a situation. There are tons of weapons to use. There are a bunch of different grenade types. You can hack into mechs and turn them on enemies.Project: Snowblind is a very fun FPS game that has aged far less than I expected it to be.			"

												Some games growing old with dignity and still performing just as good as they did 15-20 years back. No, that’s not about Project Snowblind. I remember playing it 10 years back, just after release, and even then it was not so pleasant experience, with all that console-style shooting mechanics. Replaying it now, I see that the best part of this game is its plot line, which was called “generic” even by backers of this “Project”. So, in short, that’s not a title you really need in your collection, unless you have some personal history with it.The story in this game telling you about a soldier who got under missile fire, and recovered in hospital, with half of his body replaced with implants. After some petty missions he found himself behind enemy lines, with a few support, against some evil plan to bend over the world. If you think it sounds like Deus Ex, be sure it does: that game was supposed to continue named franchise, adding multiplayer experience, but all of sudden, was released as a standalone title. If you consider that Project Snowblind was just as bad as Deus Ex Invisible War, you'll agree that that was a smart move from Eidos.For a count of pluses of this game I can say, it gives you opportunities not to simple shoot in people, but also cloaking from them with one of augmentations, see through walls with another, hacking computers and turrets… And lurking in the air ducts, of course! Everybody love air ducts.Also it is quite short – you can finish it in less than 10 hours. Yeah, it is a plus for a game like this.For contras I need to say, that the major part of the game, its essence, a gameplay process – is quite dumb and boring. For real, in the year 2005 we had Far Cry 1 and F.E.A.R., which gives you much better FPS experience. Even if we remember that Project Snowblind is a multi-platform, nesting on XBx, PS2 and only then on PC… There are still a great Psi Ops: the Mindgate Conspiracy game, which was also from PS2.Multiplayer in that game wasn't really entertaining from the day 1, and it is obvious nobody will be playing it for MP now.Finally, the reason why I decided to put the dust off from this generic shooter was a hashtag “cyberpunk”. Sadly, but the dose of cyberpunk theme in the Project Snowblind is much lesser than in real world around us. So it’s not cyberpunk. Even with all those augmented superpowers that game gives you. A first Robocop movie have tons of cyberpunk of better quality than Project Snowblind.Summarize:Obsolete title deserving only a small R.I.P. commemorative plaque, with mark like 5.5-6/10, and not your actual time. All the better stuff you could possibly find in this game was moved into Deus Ex: Human Revolution. See it for much better experience.			"

												Beware Multiplayer is dead due to Gamespy, so don't click on Multiplayer. It will crash the game.It can run on Windows 8.This game is actually not that hard. It is short, but kind of disappointing. Only 1 Boss fight.There is are a serious of known bugs. Do not move any crate/boxes with ""KINETIC KICKER"" unless told to do so in tutorial. For it will crash. This is on my experience, some people might not have it. If you start to crash because you moved a crate, just don't move any crates anymore.Another known bug is it will crash when you use MG emplacements on late missions.  Once it starts crashing after using a MG Emplacement, you won't need to use them anyways. Do not mount any MG emplacements after that. Should I recommend this game? The game has a lot of hardware issues making my CPU run very fast. I was able to beat the game and just uninstall it. The bugs and CPU issue was on my system. There are other bugs and issues running on new systems which would be discuss in the forums or other negative reviews. I haven't gotten any of those, but these are just some of the hardware issues.No I do not recommend this game. It didn't age well and cannot run properly on some computers.Only buy this if you think you can actually run it without issues. The game is no longer supported by the devs. There are better games that came out in the same age that can run better on newer systems. There are no replay value or unlockables in this game. Once you beat singleplayer its done.			"

												Когда диск с Project: Snowblind попал ко мне в руки, я особо не медлил.Игра в те уже довольно далекие времена прошла на одном дыхании. Увлекательный шутер, где ты играешь за суперсолдата с интересными способностями. Побываешь в городе...Под городом...Над городом. В игре разные локации с множеством противников и лазеек, элементы стелса слабы, но присутствуют.Саундтрек приятен на слух и отлично вписывается.Сюжет увлекателен, однако встречающиеся нам персонажи ""безлики"" и их место в игре слишком эпиодично и отвлеченно, разве что вражеский генерал сильно поразил - как персонаж и как противник.НО если вы посмотрите на это сейчас или просто заходите предаться чувству ностальгии - вас может вывернуть. Я купил в порыве нахлынувших воспоминаний. Сильно пожалел. С такой графикой трудно ужиться, даже если ты видел ее ранее. С непривычным управлением (к счастью, настраивается) и убогой анимацией, небогатыми на дизайнерские решения локациями тоже придется смириться иначе вы долго не протянете - продолжительность велика.Интересный геймплей, неплохой сюжет, но слишком старо визуально.

												Absolute rubbish. Plays like a lifeless PS2 port: clunky and dull.It does not support resolutions above 1400x1050. There are no solutions to be found online, and  no obvious .ini files/ system files to hex edit to rectify the problem. Beyond that, the textures are blurry and the models are mediocre and angular. The final kick to the balls is that the game adjusts the gamma far too high (with no option to adjust), and it remains in effect after the game is closed, forcing a restart.Beyond the technical problems, the game just has zero emotional resonance. The AI is akin to that of Doom. The original. I just can't find a reason to care enough to keep playing.How this was ever supposed to be a 'spiritual successor' to Deus Ex, I do not know.

												Do you want to play an old-school FPS? Get Hard Reset.Do you want to play Deus Ex-like? Get Alpha Protocol.Even for an old game Project Snowblind is just plain bad. It often tries to play itself up as a hybrid of run-and-gun but hey you could totall stealth and kind of hack stuff (with your auto-hack gun thing) but the only really viable route is the former and it's awful at that too. There's maybe one level where you can kind of sneak, for a little while at least because there's lots of knee high walls to crouch behind but you don't have any silenced weapons and the guard patrols aren't designed to allow for that type of gameplay. You aggro one, you've aggro'd every enemy on that floor or building. I managed to hack a giant robot once which was fun but I could only do that because it was powered down, I never saw another one like that after.You just end up playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hybrid of taking cover until you get bored, run forward and mow everyone down hoping there's a health pick-up through the next door. Except robots and security make that hard, sometimes they're nice enough to put those panels before they appear but often they don't and of course you can't really sneak to them either. It's a cluster♥♥♥♥.The level I played before finally unistalling it, had me dealing with running through wave after wave of enemies. Like that's it, I would make my way through the level and there'd be at least five guys around every corner. Couldn't sneak because everyone would aggro and apparently there's no locational damage either making ammo a pain in the ♥♥♥ to deal with.Just an awful, awful, awful game. Never buy this, ever.			"

												This is a great game. Full of action, never dull, and a great story line. Only problem is the constant crashing due to new gen hardware. Other than that it is a great game.			"

												I was stunned to find this game on Steam, mostly because I thought it was an obscure title. (I had it for the Xbox, however, my disc is broken). But as soon as I discovered it on Steam I immediately bought it. If you like FPS, this game is for you. You play as a Liutenant Frost, a man that miraculously survives an encounter with a missle after attempting to help a fellow soldier. You are implanted with biotech augmentations, such as slow motion and night vision. The graphics are pretty cool, and the storyline is pretty solid. Combat is fun considering the different weapons and augmentations Frost has at his disposal.			"

												Ever wanted to play Deus Ex and actually utilize all these awesome combat augs and loud guns instead of sneaking around? (well, technically you can, but...who does, really?) This is the game for you.While technically not a Deus Ex game, in fact pretty much everything screams otherwise. The design of some stuff - like the energy cells and the spiderbot grenades - is literally straight out of Invisible War (hell, they probably lifted the models). The gear, like the guns (it's not as apparent here, since nothing's straight up reused, but they're definitely the work of the same person who designed the guns in Invisible War - or at least someone imitating the style) Obviously the nanoaugmentations are too, but that's enough of a broad, common idea to not really support the idea. But that's not really the point.The point is... it's fun. It's fun to go balls out for once when playing a Deus Ex game. It's fun to pop the slow-mo aug and jump out of a window exchanging gunfire with Chinese soldiers like a lost scene from a Ghost In The Shell episode. It's fun to watch someone's bullets bounce off your shielding aug as you run in to sock 'em in the face with your fist (with blue circuitry running along your forearm to make it feel that much more ~cyberpunk~). It's fun to tag a bipedal combat robot for a joyride by tagging it with the Icepick - the game's one-stop shot hacking solution - and then letting loose with its laser minigun and rocket launcher on the unsuspecting soldiers.Project: Snowblind is just a fun game.Now, it's got a heap of problems, too, to be frank. The interface just screams ""mid '00s console port"" - it's giant and really unsuited to a pc screen. To add insult to injury, there's no widescreen resolutions to be seen anywhere in the options, so you gotta play in 4:3, which further limits your field of vision. The gamma's absolutely screwed, with no way to change it I know of. Same with the bloom - oh my god, does this game love its bloom.And despite these, it's still really enjoyable, which I think speaks even higher of its quality. Definitely a game I'd consider more of a Deus Ex than Invisible War. If you can stomach the interface, and want to feel like the Major while wiping out faceless mooks in style, look no further. For the price of a beer, or a coffee if you don't drink, it's an absolute steal - and then more.Oh yeah and the spiderbot grenades are my favorite thing. They're like tiny adorable chirping Tachikomas.			"

												Fun action game with a decent backstory, good to see something going down in Hongkong. The crashes are a nuisance, but I got around it by lowering rendering settings manually in nVidia control panel and not being in any turrets or vehicles when reaching certain dialogue points or check points.

												Deus Ex + vehicles + speed - RPG = Project: Snowblind! ; )A very good game consisting of missions ranging from ""run-and-gun"" to the stealthy ones; fast-paced and keeping one entertained at all times.If you like the good old Deus Ex'es (1 & 2) and don't care too much about the storyline - you'll most probably like Snowblind.

												project snowblind i a really good game with a good story and nice characters. the guns in this game are also very nice and all of them have a secondary fire mode (the snipers secondery mode turns your enemies in your allies) and all of the guns feel and play different (not like in many games). nathan frost (the main character whitch u play) has too some nice powers like clocking and a ballistic shield witch he gets time by time when u progress. i would recommend this game EVERYONE who likes shooter. the game has too some problems (like every game on this planet) 1.) the campain is not that long (8-10 hours) 2.)there are no achivments 3.) you have no reason to play it again, there are no difficultis, no collectibels 4.) the game crashes sometimes but for the price it is okay in my eyes.
