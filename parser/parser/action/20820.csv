												Shatter is quite good and i have to say is all aroudn THE best block breaker game ive ever played. I spent a lot of time as a young kid playing Arkanoid with my family. My mother and I spent hours upon hours playing it, had the actual Arkanoid controller and everything. So this type of game is a classic to me. An all time favorite. Before i played this, Reaxxion was the best block breaker game that i had ever played, but it doesent even come close to being able to compare to Shatter. Shatte3r is in a class by itself. You can control the ball once you get it down pat, you have the ability to push or pull the ball by using either the left or right mouse buttons. So as its bouncing aorund you can kind of direct it to where you want it to go. At first it seemed random to me. But after a few minutes oif play i caught on, and i was guiding the ball straight to the blocks i wanted it to hit, instead of just bouncing it off of my paddle and hoping it hit something like every other block breaker game in existence. The graphics are really nice, the music fits well and is upbeat, gets you hyped up while playing. The controls are nice and tight, no movements you dont expect or anything of the sort. It also has boss battles. I've only odne 1 so far, and it was pretty interesting. Was battling a big snake-like thing that had a paddle on its head, hitting the ball back at me, and i needed to keep hitting its body to defeat it. After that, there was a bonus level where i had ot keep 3 balls in play at once, there were no blocks ont he screen, just the balls, but the gravity was random and made the balls fly all goofy, and got faster and faster as you went on.If you're into block breaker games, you are definitely going to want this one. There i sno comparing it to any other, at least not that ive hand my hands on.For the genre this game is in, on a scale of 1 throguh 10, its an easy 10/10.			"

												When it comes to brick-busting, contenders to the Arkanoid throne have always attempted sophistication through complexity and glitz. Physics was always going to be a natural evolution for the genre. Unlike its forerunners, the quality in Shatter is not from quantity, but clarity. There is physics: bricks swing, bounce and slide about, but it's not the centrepiece. It's developers remembered correctly, that in games like these, the star is the paddle.Left and right triggers push and pull with understandable conviction, letting you curve the ball slightly for ninja-class aimed shots. Bricks shatter into Shards, collected with pull to charge a manually-activated super-shot barrage that blasts through bricks in slow-motion. The charge meter also powers your shield, used to protect yourself from incoming bricks. If a brick hits the paddle, it's out of commission for a few vital seconds. Trusty multi-ball is available at any time, if you want to risk your ball stock on it. Press X, and one of your lives enters the playfield in simple risk versus reward.Long after you're done playing, the modernized chiptune retrostyled music will remain in your head, by far the most memorable aspect of the game. That, and how cheap it is.After 23 years, there is finally something better than Arkanoid. It tells an engrossing story of an errant kinetic harvesting machine gone rogue. The plot is presented in pantomime. The paddle, your avatar in its two-dimensional world of balls and bricks, is a Jedi.			"

												Easy to play, difficult to master, Shatter is an arcade dream, taking the basic concept of Pong, and flipping it on its tail. Suck in power ups, blow out fragments and manuever your ship through some beautiful environments and challenging bosses.  I figured this would be a quick one off 10-minute pick-up game, but the ""one more round"" leveling and mastering the physics just sucks you in...  It's fast, fun and challenging to figure out when to suck and when to blow to best position your ball for maximum fragmentation.  Recommended for arcade puzzle and shooter fans alike; Shatter is good for a quick blast, or an OCD high score mission.  Plus Multiplayer hot seat or co-op and XBOX 360 controller support...I picked this Steam Key on sale at Amazon for 2.49.  That didn't suck either... Enjoy.			"

												Stunning graphics, awesome soundtrack and clever/innovative game mechanisms make the brick-breaker genre reinvented. Enemies are usually dropping lives when you're about to die and the continue option helps sustain the fun so you never quit rage, having to restart all over again. Different bosses and bonus stages break the continuity that would make the game too repetitive. Multiple game modes are also offering a good replay value. Very nice game.			"

												The definitive breakout clone. Innovating only by allowing you to slightly alter your shot trajectory, it perfects the genre, doing away with the slow monotony of having to destroy that one last brick before moving on, keeping the gameplay fast and smooth. Couple that with a crisp presentation and one of the best soundtracks to date, and it's a fantastic arcade game that more people need to own. A must-have.			"

												Do you remember Breakout?I don't. I remember a Breakout clone on the BBC Micro that my headmaster was showing off, It was an old-♥♥♥ game getting cloned by the time I was in primary school. I don't 'remember' Breakout, although I played a bit of Arkanoid and Batty on the Spectrum.This is a cool Breakout style game. It has slightly more interesting mechanics, in that you can multiball whenever you want, and the triggers can blow and suck your balls (Please. We've established that I'm old as hell but come on, I'm better than that). It has all the cool powerups and variety in block type and arena layout to keep you interested.How about Wipeout? Do you remembe Wipeout?I ask because that's the other main influence that really jumped out at me from this game. I *do* remember Wipeout. I remember it being a busy time for videogaming, with the Playstation happening and Designers Republic taking gaming into clubland and bringing back with some of the spoils. I remember Wipeout as being representative of that really vibrant and exciting time.And that's the other thing about Shatter. it's really... exciting. That's honestly the best word for it. It feels like something that should've been in the arcade. It's got that magical impact that reeks of the arcade, when they were trying to give you your money's worth in satisfying noises as soon as you hit the Start button. It's loud and bright and exciting and cool and does feel a bit like you're playing a visualiser at times.Arkanoid + Wipeout with a bit of Peggle. Ideal if you have people over and have the urge to pass something around.			"

												GAMEPLAY:You know how many Breakout/Arkanoid games can be described as ""It's Arkanoid but with X.""  Well this game is like Arkanoid but with X, Y, Z, A, B, C, D and J.  A very inventive spin on the genre.  How inventive?  How about boss battles that require different strategies to beat.  Or bricks that are cells and multiply via mitosis.  Or bricks that take off like bottle rockets when you hit them.  Or....MUSIC:The creators of this game were clearly fans of Daft Punk.  The soundtrack is =SUPERB=.  This is the Daft Punkiest game soundtrack that doesn't actually have music by Daft Punk.  And I mean that in the best way.GRAPHICS:The graphics presentation is very polished.  Stylized 3D backgrounds compliment the 2D gameplay action in the foreground.  Between each round the camera moves around or through the 3D background for another viewpoint.  The only drawback here is sometimes the ball is difficult to see when the bloomy particle effects are at their most concentrated.If you like old-school breakout action with a modern shine and everything but the kitchen sink added to it, get this game!Disclaimer; I am only a couple of hours into the game at this point.  There may also be a kitchen sink.			"

												I heard and loved the beautiful electro soundtrack of Shatter at least a couple of years before having the opportunity to play the game itself, so with it being included in a recent Humble Bundle for a ridiculously low price a bum like me could afford, I jumped at making a purchase and have since been very eager to put my obviously high expectations on the line and finally give it a go! I got around to that last night and well, what can I say? I've had my high expectations completely... shattered! HAHAH! D: (that was completely unavoidable, I promise) The producers of Shatter have taken on the rather daring task of taking 70's bounce the ball at the breakable blocks arcade classic, Breakout, and modernising it. Needless to say they've bloody well succeeded in doing so producing a game with the addition of beautiful visuals, a futurisitic feel, a wonderfully fitting soundtrack, and immensely fun and complex gameplay which also contains just the right amount of simplicity found from the roots! Please buy Shatter immediately so I don't feel so bad about paying so little for it, thank you! :D			"

Ooohhhh.  I love this game.  Brilliant stuff.SHATTER is a block-breaker game that bends the usual formula, with such things as rounded levels, being able to sway the ball with air, and shooting a deadly beam of glass-like energy.  Did I mention boss battles?  Yeah.One of the big selling point is SHATTER's delectable soundtrack.  Mmmm.  It's very much a tasty experience for the ears, and the unique art style makes it a pleasing game to sit down and mellow out too.  That is, until the giant squid made of blocks comes to try and stretch you a new one.Yeah, I'd say buy it.  It's short, and you may not find MUCH replayability, but it's a clever little game that's worth a play, if for the soundtrack alone.			"

												Shatter plays like the Atari classic Breakout, on steroids. The game is beautiful, the soundtrack is great. But it's hard to get excited about the gameplay.This, coming from someone who logged hundreds of hours in Breakout on his Atari 2600. But in 1978, that's what passed for entertainment, you know?I am giving this game a thumbs-up because it is excellent at what it is. Also, it's frequently in bundles and on sale. If you like Breakout/Arkanoid-style games, Shatter is definitely worth a go.Tip: For this game, put your controller down, and play with the mouse.			"

												Shatter is about bouncing a projectile between your paddle/ship/etc. and various blocks you need to break to progress to the next stage.  Power-ups occasionally drop from said blocks, and there are different varieties.  That's all pretty basic.  What sets Shatter apart is the beautiful backgrounds and setpieces in the game, as well as the unique features it adds.  The most obvious is your ability to push away or draw in objects as you play, including the ball, the pickups, the fragments (points), and sometimes the blocks themselves.  At first it's merely a nice feature for adjusting the path of the ball mid-flight, but later it becomes necessary to really properly progress through the game.  Fortunately, Shatter does a good job of ramping up the necessity of using these features, so by the time you truly need to it's natural.Another somewhat unusual feature is the concept of boss fights, not totally unseen in a block-breaker clone but rarely done well.  Shatter does it quite well, I'm happy to say, and thanks to the aforementioned beautiful design of the game the bosses are visually satisfying in addition to challenging.  The mechanics of each boss fight are similar but not identical, making you target specific vulnerable points while dodging whatever attacks the boss is capable of.  The fights are also spaced evenly between the levels, giving you a nice change of pace to break up any monotony that might set in.Difficulty wise, the game is not easy but not especially hard for an experienced player... at least when it comes to just surviving the game.  If you want to rack up the high scores, well that will take some serious skill.  The game's scoring system is simple on paper but hard to master, relying on a multiplier which increases with gathered fragments but decreases for any blocks which slip past your paddle or make contact with it (yes, they can do that).  It provides a reason to replay the game for people who are all about the high scores, made even more attractive with the game virtually taunting you by showing you higher scores from any of your friends who also play the game.  Devious, but effective.Beyond all that the game is quite solid, featuring some unique types of blocks, interesting mechanics, varied arena shapes including circular, and a fun bonus round after each area where you have to keep three projectiles in the arena for as long as possible.  I also really have to compliment the game's music, which is both fitting and kind of catchy.  If you have any love for Kavinsky or Daft Punk you'll probably like the soundtrack.Shatter is a fresh take on an old formula, one that adds some interesting new concepts without straying too far from the basic idea.  It hits that perfect line of ""easy to pick up yet difficult to master"", and provides something you can either spend hours on or just pick up for a few minutes at a time.			"

												Shatter is a game in where you control a paddle and try to break all the blocks on the screen. A simple task that gets progressively harder the further in you go. Starting off most of the modes are locked so your only real option is Story Mode. It starts off with your tiny robot paddle breaking out of confinement and going off to shatter the cells containing your brethren, as well as taking down the giant robotic wardens guarding each world. After that there are no more cutscenes until the very end and it’s pure gameplay. Your paddle also has the ability to suck or blow air to interact with objects or to alter the course of your ball. It can be used to collect the shards that break off of blocks for a large amount of points but you also have the risk of drawing a block in a crash course towards you. Getting hit by an object will take you out of the action for a few seconds which may prove deadly if the ball comes your way and you are unable to bounce it back.Balls are basically your lives and losing all of them means you start at the start of the board and lose all of your points. It is not a hard game however, it seems very intent on keeping you alive as when you are down to a single life they will sure as rain throw a 1Up power up to keep you going. You really have to go out of your way to get yourself killed in Story mode so it feels focused more on the fun and the score instead of having any real challenge. In addition to the 1Up power up there is one that makes your ball into an unstoppable force that can break through any bricks and one that makes the ball smaller but allows you to easier control it by manipulating the wind. The blue shards that appear when bricks break serve another purpose other than just being there for points. Once you collect enough of them you can activate an attack that causes your paddle to fire a ton of projectiles wherever you aim and is very useful for damaging bosses. Blocks themselves can also be a danger to you if you just break without strategy in the later levels. They have their own physics and some can become unhinged from the cluster and come falling toward you. You could simply dodge them most of the time but you will be losing out on points if you are trying to compete with your friends.Sometimes your paddle will be on the left side of the screen or on the bottom depending on the level. Some levels are even spherical and the variation in them really helps keeping the game from getting stale. That was a very real danger as the story mode is quite long and will take multiple hours to get through, though it managed to be just as fun at the end without feeling drawn out. Each world has a different background but none are really interesting. What truly separates them from one another is the boss at the end of each one and the ways in how to take them down. All bosses are unique and have different weakness that you must find in order to take them down. They are pretty fun to fight though the battles do suffer a bit from the amount of damage they can take making it feel like a test of endurance over skillful shooting. A lot of creativity went into these bosses and do not feel like a gimmick. These fights are likely where you will lose most of your lives so it comes in handy to have your shard meter filled in case you may need it. They are the only enemies in the game and the majority of the time you will be breaking blocks. In between levels there is a bonus mode where you try to keep three balls in play all at once in order to gain some extra points. This is a rather variation that can be played all you want once you unlock Bonus Mode after beating the game.Graphics do their job, nothing impressive but it is very colorful. The highest resolution it goes up to is 1080p unfortunately. You can set the game to a higher resolution by tweaking a file but it is still something worth mentioning. Another problem is that you can't rebind keys and the button to shoot shards is “crtl” which can be troublesome to reach when you are playing with the mouse. One gameplay annoyance I have is that you can't choose when your ball will be shot from the paddle so you have to either rush for an opening or hope it shoots while you still have a good shot. And those are pretty much the only flaws I could see in this game. The frames will be as high as your monitor will allow them to be making the game feel even more smooth and responsive for those with monitors over 60hz. Music is pretty catchy and definitely a soundtrack worthy of a purchase. There is no voices or text, just one small cut-scene during the end and beginning then it is all arcade action without interruption.From start to finish you will be doing the same thing which is breaking blocks, though they somehow managed to create a lot of content out of that simple concept. In addition to the lengthy story mode you have a couple of other modes to choose from. These include Endless which has you trying to survive in progressively harder waves of blocks and Endless coop that adds another local player to the mix. The second player controls his paddle with the “wasd” control scheme and the first can use either the mouse or arrow keys. You also have a Time Attack mode that has you rack up as much points as possible in five minutes and the previously mentioned Bonus mode where you try to keep three balls in the air for as long as you can. Boss rush mode is easily the worst one as fighting the damage spongy bosses wasn't that fun to begin with. All in all there is quite a bit to keep you entertained if you are into the brick breaking genre. It has a few flaws like non rebindable keys and the bosses that take too long to go down but other than that it is great. Great music, great gameplay and lots of content makes this a solid buy for anyone looking to buy a fun and simple to pick up game.			"

												An experience that can best be described as ""Breakout on acid"", Shatter combines the familiar bat-and-ball destruction with some welcome twists, beautiful graphics, and an addictive and unobnoxious soundtrack. You control a bat and hit a ball against all manner of blocks, breaking them so you can suck up their powers. This game adds a suction power and a pulse power that respectively push and pull the ball, allowing you greater control and a unique way to approach the original formula.Among the wide array of blocks you break are explosives, blocks that exert force, blocks that attach or free-float, blocks that generate shields, and others in all kinds of unique formations. In addition, you've also got levels with different orientation, from your classic up and down, to left and right, or even circular. Add to all of this a challenging boss encounter at the end of each world and you've got a game chock full of twists and turns. With this in mind, another way Shatter could be described is ""Not your momma's breakout!"" Breakout is intense in its own right, but for the most part the original formula is rather slow and homogenous. This game is not for the casual. It will challenge you, and you will have to think strategically as well as on your feet.That's not to say this game is Super Hexagon-level hard. You walk a thick line between frustration and challenge, and the game throws lives at you the moment you hit under 3. It's not a difficult game if you've got the coordination, and there's no real punishment for losing all your lives other than restarting the current level.All in all, Shatter puts a fresh new spin on an old game, managing to feel unique in its own right. It's not for the casual gamer, but if you want a simple game with eye-popping visuals and lots and lots of chaos on-screen, Shatter is a good purchase.			"

												Nice gameplay and absolutely fantastic soundtrack. Pretty standard breakout game with a couple added features. I don't really have much more to say.Oh right, the eighth boss is made entirely of death and the tears of orphans. The rest of the bosses are alright, though.			"

												It's been a long time since I played a Breakout/Pong clone that caught my eye. Shatter blends a classic genre with some interesting physics and dynamic control to create what is at once an homage to a key part of gaming history as well as an original and impressive game in its own right.In addition to a just-the-right-length campaign mode, there are a slew of additional modes and same-machine co-op, which should let anybody easily sink tens if not hundreds of hours into Shatter.In terms of downsides, the lack of networked multiplayer means the co-op mode will likely get limited use (understandably, the game would be a nightmare to sync across the internet). Beyond that, I can't really find anything to complain about in Shatter.Oh, and the soundtrack is very awesome too.			"

												Shatter is a 3D Brick Breaker game.You control the brick breaker panel and have to keep the ball in the level and destroy blocks.Nothing new actually. But the way how this game does this is really good.There are many gamemodes.One of them being the Story mode, the ""main"" mode of the game where you can unlock other modes or levels.The game itself is simple, it leads you through several levels, many different. Also boss levels where you fight against big bosses.You have special skills like blowing or shooting. You can also transform your ball into other types with special drops.There are many block types with special skills that you have to destroy like bombs.Also the game has physics! Great physics. I really like it.I have a lot of fun playing this game. It has a nice futuristic drawing style.Furthermore it has a coop mode for you and your friends.The best about this game is probably the soundtrack.Its produced by someone named Module.A really good electro soundtrack with a lot of different styles.If you are a brick breaker gamer or simply wanna try retro games again, this is the first you should play!Definitely worth being played!9/10			"

												Shatter is a visually amazing brick breaking game with the best soundtrack of its genre. Whether you keep it old school and rely solely on your skills of maneuvering the ""bat"" and hitting the ball at the right angle or if you use the new ""Suck"" & ""Blow"" gameplay mechanics to help guide the ball where you need it to be, this easy to play yet challenging to master game will give you hours upon hours of enjoyment. And don't forget the ""Shard Storm"" should you need help taking out some bricks or just want to eliminate the bosses faster.But wait, there's more! Should you get bored with Story Mode, there's additional modes to play, even more than what the PS3 version of the game has. Boss Rush has you facing off against Story Mode's bosses, one right after the other, keeping track of your time. Bonus Mode consists of 3 stages where, with three balls out at the start and each gaining speed after every hit, you go thru each stage aiming to achieve the highest score you can. Time Attack & Time Attack Co-op has you racing against the clock as you try to increase your score as quickly as possible. And there's even an Endless Mode (Co-op available too) if you can handle staring at your monitor and losing track of time for hours on end.Highly recommended, and I'd like to suggest the soundtrack as well. Steam has the mp3 version available, FLAC and other formats are available at http://sidhe.bandcamp.com/album/shatter-official-videogame-soundtrack "

												I absolutely love the breakout (brick-breaking) type games, and Shatter is just that, except on steroids.  It's really addicting, fast-paced, flashy, and much more involved/interesting than your typical brick-breaking game.  Instead of your paddle being restricted to the bottom of the screen, many levels have it on the side.  Also, there are levels where your paddle is allowed more freedom than just one side.  The bonus levels are fun, and the soundtrack is great.  I also like how there are really cool bosses for each level.  There have been many times when I lost track of time while playing.			"

												A lovely refreshing take on the classic arkanoid brick breaker type game...Not only do you play levels in the classic vertical orientation, but in horisontal and also spherical layouts which keeps the level design from being repetative. A great added feature is that your ship hasa blow/suck function which you use to collect shards which are released after blocks are smashed to rack up your points. This feature also enables you to control your ball in the play field, allowing you to curve the ball to specific locations which adds an added element of skill needed to master this game.Did i mention boss battles? Oh, no? Well yes, theres boss battles :D!!!All in all a very nice polished game, great to pick up and play when you not looking to get into anything deep....i recommend this one if you like this genre of game.

												Shatter is a great game. Its soundtrack is amazing - 'Module' did a very nice job! - the gravity influence over the block breakers feels good, discharging all the `cristals` at once as a special and using the shield for protection or to turn `cristals` into projectiles made this retro styled game a very enjoyable experience.I saw a lot of replayability value on this game. It is simple if you just want to break blocks without paying attention to your multiplier or thinking on how to break 'em all maximizing your score.It would be much better if it had online multiplayer though.P.S.: A gamepad is recommended for general stages and game modes, but I'd advise you to use your mouse to play the bonus levels or the Bonus Mode after unlocking them.

												A wonderful modern re-imagining of the classic brick busting game that started with Arkanoid, Shatter adds lush graphics, new game mechanics and a campaign mode with imaginative boss battles that firmly brings the genre into the 21st century.There are plenty of similar clones out there, but Shatter does it with style. With an award-winning soundtrack that perfectly complements the game (I loved it so much I bought the album), and you're on to a winner.Verdict: Cheap buy, great casual gaming, to perfect music.

												Without a doubt one of the best games all time for the exact same reason that hotline miami turned out as such an immensely awesome game.I've been playing this on and off since it first launched on steam and it's been my guilty pleasure over the years.First off, the gameplay:It's a take on the ""breakout"" game we all know (and love) but while the core mechanic might be the same, pretty much everything else isn't. The gameplay elements themselves vary wildly from the classic take and they could not have done it any better. Control and precision are tremendous for a twitch title, but that's only part of where this game draws it's strength from.9/10.The Graphics:While there isn't much to be said about this beyond ""yeah it works"" the overall backdrops and general effects are pleasing and not overwhelming, which is great. Simplicity meets functionality and it's done so in a smooth and sensual way for lack of a better description. 9/10.The Controls:As quickly outlined in the top section, the controls for this game are superb. You are at all times fully in charge of what is happening on screen and i personally have had absolutely no issues with irresponsive controls or ""lack of X feature"". Everything you need, you have and it works. All of it.10/10The Sounds:They're sounds right ? They work. There isn't much to be said here but it's great sounds. Great game, great controls, great concept, great sounds. Wait for it...10/10THE MUSIC:OH MY DEAR GOD THE MUSIC... Human words cannot adequately describe how well this ties everything together. People that shared this game with me all agree and there can be absolutely no doubt that this soundtrack is instantly legendary.It's worthy of an essay on the effects of music and the human impulse response but in sight of this being a review and not the second testament of the origin of mankind, i'll spare you that.Just know that whatever you have played in this genre, whatever you will play in this genre and whatever you plan to do, this soundtrack alone is literally the key aspect of what ties all of this together in the same fashion as hotline miami does. Rhodium/Metal. (9001/10)Final verdict:Get this now. Get this and invest in a proper audio fidelity set, then literally sit down and cut off all outside influence that might disturb with this experience for a while, and emerge a different person. I say experience because that's what it is to me. It's something you do and you become a better entity for doing so.In normal people language, i'd say this is absolutely the single most important title in this specific genre you should ever have played because it can show you what it's like to play a game that's done right in every aspect.TL:DRThe amount of reccomended is too damn high. Praise Sidhe.			"

Scripted Video CritiqueSummary: Shatter tries to reinvent Breakout by giving new mechanics, shiny and fancy graphics/presentation and novel block types and formations, but these fail to add any depth to the genre. Which is a huge issue as the remaining core of the game itself leaves a lot to be desired as well. You have so much control over aiming it becomes a joke, the slow one speed ball and blow mechanic make defending a joke as well, The physics objects fail at making breakout more dynamic, there's nothing to make the stages feel different there's a huge lack of powerups, and the new mechanics add nothing. This game barely has anything to offer, making it very boring. If you want to be elaborated on why I think these things, It's all explained in the video.			"

												This is an interesting take on the breakout type of game.  It's nice and slick, it runs really well on lesser computers, and really balanced.  With a combination of beautiful visuals, and a glorious soundtrack, the atmosphere is perfect.  It's fun to play, whether you aim for a high score, or just to enjoy the levels.  It's not common you see a game designed in such an elegant way.			"

												Remember good old Breakout? Simple bat and ball games, clearing the screen of all blocks with that ball?Well this is that game with lots of twists! Satisfying and fun to play, nice mechanics letting you change the direction of the ball a little, a special emergency weapon thing to help clear out pesky blocks, and even bosses! Also nice techno/electrical music to go along with it.So if you like Breakout games with a twist, give this one a look!			"

												Arkanoid clone where you can ""suck"" or ""blow"" objects around the arena. Although there are many game modes and a lengthy campaign I don't feel this has much replay value considering the base game doesn't introduce anything new besides the physics mechanic. Nothing special apart from the music; I wouldn't recommend it to outsiders of the genre.			"

												If there was an alternate ""maybe"" option for steam reviews I would've honestly rated it that. It's not a terrible game but definitely suffers from a few poor design choices and misfires that could've made it great. The blow and suck mechanic are interesting but quickly fade out due to how weak they actually are. The bosses were an interesting choice but the bullet hell seems to be added to workaround the actual brick breaking gameplay itself, adding a seperate shooting mechanic which by itself isn't fully realized and just turns into ""charge this to shoot X"", which is kind of boring after doing it so many times. Despite the great visuals and music, it doesn't hold up as well on it's own, even with it's few gimmicks and suffers from many of the classic problems which breakout games have suffered with for years (and a few have actually solved). Overall for me in my own personal opinion it's just steam sale material but nothing too amazing.			"

YouTube™ Video: Shatter - Best Breakout Style Game Ever? - REVIEW!

			Grab this game on Steam for the PC right here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/20820/		

Insane Action in glorious vivid colors with awesome tripping and frequently changing music as you play!I have played probably hundreds of these break-out style games since I was a kid on my Commodore 64 as a kid in the early 1980s.. and Shatter is easily the best one I have ever played!  That is saying a LOT for this little gem!My review for this game breaks down as follows:Value (worth 40 points):This game offers a TON of value with super addictive gameplay that will have you wanting to play again and again.  With all the different modes of play you will unlock and the fact that no two games will ever be the same, I give this game a 38 out of 40 for value for your money (even at the full $9.99 USD price)Fun (worth 30 points):This game also delivers in this facet of my game grading criteria.  It's simply a helluva lot of fun to play, period.  I give this game a 28 out of 30 possible points here.Controls & Bugs (worth 20 points)No bugs at all that I've found, and the controls are amazing.. perfect to be completely honest.  I prefer playing Shatter with a mouse and keyboard, but you can play with a controller too!  Everything can be configured to your personal preference! (From your Steam library, right click on Shatter and choose the Shatter settings editor to change any setting at any time)  20 out of 20 possible points for Shatter in this aspect of the game!Graphics & Sound (worth 10 points)The music and sound in Shatter is beyond amazing, and the colorful and vivid graphics are also super attractive! Could the graphics be a little better?  Sure.. I think so!  If they had only added shadows to the ball and bricks or somehow gave them a sense of 3D depth, they graphics could have been even more beautiful then they are!  So I'll knock this score just a little and give Shatter an 8 out of 10 here.Add it all up, and Shatter scores a super impressive 94% in my books, the HIGHEST SCORE of all of my Steam reviews at this point, and I've reviewed about 80 Steam games at this point!  That is a very impressive score to say the least!My overall opinion:If you haven't yet experienced Shatter, shut-up and give up the money right now!  Don't wait for a sale!  Don't think about it!  ..Every minute you wait could be a minute of super addictive, fast paced, blissfully fun gaming you could be having!  ..Any gamer won't regret buying this truly awesome game, the only problem might be having to let other family members and friends get their turn when they see you playing this eye catching masterpiece!  Just do it!  A MUST BUY! "

												For some reason this game just clicks with me in every regard. I've always loved Arkanoid-style games, but thought they were slightly too boring. This game takes the best of the classic brick-breakers, and makes it more intense with the addition of attractive/repellant forces. It adds quite a bit of strategy. Should you push the balls and point chips away, risking letting the point chips expire, or should you suck them in, pulling the balls back towards you as well? Add to that the addictive techno soundtrack, and this is a game I would have gladly paid double price for.			"

												When I was a wee fatkid, I used ot spend hours on end playing Breakout on my Atari because I lived in the stick and because I was a wee fatkid and didn't have many friends.  Also because it was a great game and breaking those little bricks with the ball was addicting and being able to hit just the right angle made you feel skilled. Then, a few laters, I was a bit bigger fatkid and I played a lot of hours of Alleyway on the Gameboy.  Alleyway was breakout, played the same, was just addictive, felt just as good to make those little block dissapear.  My mom and I played that for years passing it back and forth.  Now, here's Shatter.  This thing's the natural evolution of Breakout and Alleyway, and I see me spending a boat load of hours playing it too.  Except now, it's CRAZY! You can manipulate your balls (HURRRR!) and there's stuff flying at you, and there's mechanics, and it's just all around awesome.  It really brings back fond memories of the old days, except this one I'm not going to share with my mom cause it's too complicated and she'll call me all the time asking 'what do I do with the blowing thing' and 'why doesn't explode when I hit that one' and 'why are these things flying at me!' and I already get enough phone calls from her on how to check her email.  Don't feel bad though, she's addicted to Candy Crush, that's good enough for her.  "

												Charming brick-breaker in the style of Arkanoid, Alleyway and Tronic. Comes with its own special twists like controllable balls, hostile brick variations and boss-fights. Jammin' techno beats, cyberpunk visuals and multiple gameplay modes are the icing on the cake. Marijuanna not included.			"

												The very best arkanoid ""reboot"" known to me. There are so many very fun and new mechanics added to the game. You can manipulate your ball with sucking and blowing air (finally cutting those hours of trying to hit the last block to a very minimum). You can release more balls to clear the level faster and gather more points but it will be much harder to keep them up. The music in this game is just awesome. Graphics are fantastic, extreme crisp borders, perfect control over the pad. If you like arkanoid you HAVE TO BUY THIS!!			"

An ok game to kill time.This game is for you if you like collecting games to play for maybe an hour or so and then let it gather dust while you go do other stuff.

												Ok, so I *am* a breakout fan. I enjoyed Arkanoid, I loved Crystal Hammer and I even came to terms with Dawnbringer's BabeAnoid. But Shatter I cannot recommend. :-( The game is not particularly demanding, and with proper suck/thrust control it is actually trivial. The ""boss"" levels are nothing more than a source of free 1up's. The graphics are ok, but nothing more. Some concepts might be innovative but all in all it's pretty annoying. I played this just one time and I actually looked forward to losing all lives and closing the game.If you love breakout games and this one is on a 80-90% sale, you could give it a try, but you have been warned. All other cases - move along, nothing to see here.			"

												Je m'attendai à avoir un bonne durée de vie pour un jeu comme celui-ci mais non je pense que je préfère Ricochet infinity. ^^Pour la musique, c'est pas mal, le gameplay est pas mal non plus est le mode boss est une bonne idée.Par contre, le mode coop... L'un au clavier l'autre à la souris... Peux mieux faire quand même.Le mode infini aussi est une belle arnaque, c'est comme un tetris, en plus bordélique.Au final le jeu n'est pas désagréable à jouer, c'est juste qu'il lui faudrai un vrai mode coop, pas comme un jeu de pochette surprise, et idem pour le mode infini.

												So it's like Breakout, but the game lets you go into Bullet Time to shoot bricks. And gives you extra lives if it feels you're missing any. And has a bland soundtrack. And has the HIGH SCORE gimmick, which is always marred by some cockhead hacking the scoreboard. Also it resets multipliers between waves rather than levels, so momentum is killed easily. I give this game a Yawn out of Five.			"

												With a top notch soundtrack and upgraded breakout gameplay, shatter is probably one of the best deals you can get out there on steam, specially when its on sale.The game has clean graphics and a futuristic ""blocky"" art style that is pleasing on the eyes. The story mode is quite lengthy, it can get boring at times, more often towards the end game but the creative boss fights and good music help to make the first playthorugh very enjoyable.Story mode lacks replay value but bonus mode and boss time attack are good, entertaining options, when you want a quick game.Shatter is an amazing game that is constantly overlooked. It is not TF2, but for an indie game and its price it is quite the deal.			"

Строго рекомендуется играть со своей музыкой.В то же время, наличие физических эффектов, возможность управлять полётом шарика, а также сражения с боссами в конце каждого мира, немного добавляет очков данной игре.Но, не ""Ricochet"", ни разу не ""Ricochet"".

												Hey, friends. You like games? You like challanges? You like games which are hard?If you answered all of the above, then one last question stands in your way; do you mind if it's slightly broken?The music is fantastic (and wonderful for Beat Hazard) and the graphics are top notch, but sometimes, very rarely, you'll find the ball decides it's too good for the bat and will phase through it- it's not often though (read: one in every fifteen hits).I'd still recommend this game though, as it seems like the developer(s) knew about the problem, but not how to fix it, and thus stuck tons of extra lives in.Give it a go- it's great fun if you're not competitive!

												Shatter is a pretty typical brick breaker game.  The bosses can be quite fun, and the graphics are wonderful given the game type. What makes this game great is the amazing soundtrack. It was fully composed by Module, and it is the ONLY game soundtrack I have purchased seperately (I've gotten soundtracks in Collector's Editions and such), but this is the only game that I have gone back later and purchased the soundtrack. It is amazing, inside or outside of the game. I reccomend picking this one up, if nothing more than to extract the music out of the files.			"

												Shatter is my “Casual Game of the Year 2010.”  It is polished, has varied gameplay, and first rate production values.  Kicking music, eye-pleasing art design, and simple intuitive gameplay make this a caliber of game rarely seen outside of major studios.  The game is short – yes; but it never wears out its welcome and was so enjoyable that I can’t think of any real negatives about the game.  Certainly its typical $10 price tag is a fair price.			"

												The best way to think of shatter is that it is like an arcade game, and a REALLY good one, too. However, the keyboard controls on the PC are NOT the best and I would recommend  using the mouse to control, and if you do have this on a console also, I would highly recommend the gamepad. The multiplayer is also really fun, but there is also a ton of other modes to try as well. As for the replay value, I really don't know. The story is as follows: you are a ping pong thingy, made only to bounce a ball, then you escape, and try to give the others freedom. So, as you can tell this game doesn't really have a story, but with or without one, I had one heck of a time actually PLAYING shatter. If you liked breakout or simalar games to it, I would totally recommend this, but if you pass on those games, you may want to skip this. Overall, this game is a blast to play, with the execption of odd keyboard controls, 9 out of 10.			"

												Shatter's a fun wee game.  It plays on the old Breakout/Arkanoid trope.  In terms of gameplay it doesn't add a heck of a lot.  There's a 'ball', it bounces, you're a paddle.  Don't let the ball go behind you.. Rien ne change pas. The only difference is that you can affect the balls path using repulsion or attraction. Although the gameplay is very 80s, the graphics and music certainly aren't.  There's even some physics modelling in here for levels where blocks form chains, or 'balls' and roll at you, bouncing off each other.   The backgounds take their cue from Arcade games in the late 90s, they're vivid and interesting, the game has its own sense of very light-touch humour, and the 'story' mode is really just a way of saying ""play these in order to unlock the later levels"". Even so, it does give a sort of framework that keeps the interest level up.I've been playing it off and on for a few weeks, but needed a game to just waste an afternoon on.  Sure enough, this fit the bill.  I played the first 3/4 of the game without needing a ""Continue"" (or using any of the powerups).    As far as games go, it's quite easy, and very approachable.For under a fiver, it's a good wee game.  I doubt there'll be anyone in twenty years' time on one of those retrospective TV shows bragging over their ""Shatter Score"", like you get with people bragging about Arkanoid or Mortal Kombat, but it's a fun game nonetheless.   Pick it up.  Unless you're a completist, and want all the achievements (which could take literally WEEKS of co-op play to achieve), you can finish it in a few hours.  Doing the extras can add another few hours.  Thumbs up from me! "

												An impressive new design in a traditional game genre.Shatter is basically a brick-breaking game, but filled with brilliant, innovative ideas: 1. You can control the ball to some extent by pressing and holding left/right mouse button for pulling/pushing the ball to/from your board, which make the game course more controllable and less frustrating, especially in the case where only a few bricks left on the screen that are extremely hard to hit. 2. You can collect the energy awarded after hitting bricks and then using them to your advantages by triggering a bullet time or by protecting your board against falling bricks, and sometimes these abilities are essential for winning certain levels. 3. The bricks are of various types, such as stationary bricks, freely movable bricks, partially fixed bricks, and bricks that fix or moves the other adjacent bricks, and they moves on a physical and dynamic basis. 4. There is also a boss fight at the end of each stage. Each time you face a different boss with a very unique moving pattern and vulnerability.Apart from these creative points, the level design is also excellent: the time and difficulty for each of the levels are managable and never reach the threshold for being annoying or tendious, making you always want ""one more turn"".The visual and sound effects are good, both in terms of aesthetics and game-playing.This game is a must for anyone who likes this genre of games, even at the original price.  For other players, trying Shatter when it is in discount would not disappoint you.			"

												Shatter is a game taking on one of the older games, Breakout, and reventing it to the 21st century with its new gimmicks such as able to push and pull the ball or objects, using a special attack to clear out some of the more bothering blocks, or playing on a circle area.The game is simple as that. The story is minimalistic, so it's all about the gameplay, which is really good; addicting yet simple. Going through story mode you do multiple stages at once, and in the end there is a boss you need to fight by getting your ball to the boss' weakness. After each stage you get points depending how well you did. The point system is probably the bigger one which makes you want to re-do some of the story stages to get a better hi-score against your friends or globally. The game also has endless mode as well as co-op mode if you want to play with a friend, though only locally.The Graphics are actually quite beatiful but simplistic. Even the game runs really well on 60 fps see all explosion effects and such.The music is very, very good. Not a single bad music in it. Definitely one of my favourite soundtracks ever.The gameplay is great however the replayability is a bit so-so. It is a game which you play for a moment, then forget about it for a while, then when you look at your Steam library and see Shatter, then you pick it up and play again.I still recommend this game, especially if you can catch it on sale. If you are a fan of old games done anew, this is definitely a game to play.+ Gameplay is simple but addicting+ Music+ Graphics+ Runs smoothly- Low replayability- Minor story			"

												Shatter is a varient of Arkanoid and Pong. The key difference is, you can manipulate gravity in the arena as you play. Your paddle is controlled by the mouse; the left-mouse-button draws your ball/powerups towards you while the right-mouse-button repels them. The game's leaderboard system seems fairly comprehensive, so I encourage everyone to try to beat my scores. :p			"

												Fun. Has some of the best brick action since Breakout. But replay value as it goes isn't super. The amount of room to move your paddle is small compared to similar games. This makes most levels feel very compacted. Once you've seen the few different styles, you've seen them all. The bosses add some fun but are either easy to outright a pain to fight.

												Incredible game. Its like a classic breakthrough with some revolutionary things. The idea is like breakthrough but you use wind to push/pull the ball around and hit angles. So now that blasted last piece is not so hard to get. Be carfull for objects that come at you, while they do not affect your score if you get hit, it takes time away for you to retrieve the ball. The added bosses are interesting because you are having to hit specific spots or hit areas to open the spot you need to defeat him. Once you have enough ""power"" you can either use it to sheild yourself from objects that get too close, or if it is full you can fire destroying blocks you cant hit easy or on bosses. 9.2/10 :DOnly negative thing is sometimes controling the ball does not go where you would think it would, but this is a VERY slight problem and does not ruin the exp of this game :)			"

												The music is amazing, certainly worth a listen. The gameplay is relaxing and cathartic, except when everything's coming right at you, then it's just cathartic. The visuals are appealing, forming one nice cohesive whole. The controls are tight and responsive.It's still just arkanoid, but it's among the top arkanoid-like out there.

												The music alone is worth the price of entry.  And then you have a modernday arkanoid with a couple of  nods to Geomtry Wars but a nuanced perfectly controlled arcade score chaser which allows you to tactically push and pull the 'ball' midflight, add risk/reward by lobbing in multiple balls to the arena and strategically decide when to unleash the powerup for maxium effect.  There's a lot going on, but it never feels the wrong side of overwhelming and as the best arcaders do - gives you an immensely satisying feeling of control and progression.Defintely recommended.

												Average Breakout-type puzzle game that only is saved by some nice backgrounds and the soundtrack.Physics engine feels a bit sloppy and random at times, with some hits in the same area going different directions for no reason at all. The game uses lives and continues, yet once you're down to 1 or 2 lives it drops them like crazy anyway to excuse the absurd boss and level design. The overuse of physics with the push/pull, the ability to be stunned from hits by falling blocks and a delay on the shield to prevent that stun leads to mostly frustration, and clearing levels often feels like random luck than skill.This type of puzzle game usually works best with tight physics and controls, along with creative powerups and level designs, but this lacks in those areas too much to be considered a good entry to the genre. Cleared the way to the last world and dropped it, and I can't recommend it as being worth the time.			"

												Shatter is a varient of Arkanoid and Pong. The key difference is, you can manipulate gravity in the arena as you play. Your paddle is controlled by the mouse; the left-mouse-button draws your ball/powerups towards you while the right-mouse-button repels them. The game's leaderboard system seems fairly comprehensive, so I encourage everyone to try to beat my scores. :p			"

												Fun. Has some of the best brick action since Breakout. But replay value as it goes isn't super. The amount of room to move your paddle is small compared to similar games. This makes most levels feel very compacted. Once you've seen the few different styles, you've seen them all. The bosses add some fun but are either easy to outright a pain to fight.

												Exactly how you'd expect a game like Breakout to evolve! All of the design choices in the game are very reminiscent of how a new installment of the older generations of games should be. Simple, yet effective and inventive gameplay mechanics, sequenced and themed level structure with great soundtracks, gradual introduction of enemy elements sparking intruige into what's next, and consistent and inventive bosses at the end of each stage. No story, but yet nothing feels arbitrary or irrelevant. Elements of shmup gameplay also present and It's even more reminiscent of sonic gameplay than modern sonic games are!Any criticisms? Not really, although some improvements are possible, but that you'd only really expect through expansion from a sequel. 9/10			"

												It's an invigoratingly modernized, supercharged and expanded take on good ol' Breakout. One of the fundamental alterations to the classic Breakout formula here is having an enhanced influence on the ball's trajectory by means of drawing in and expelling air; abilities that can also be used to scoop up valuable objects and in some cases are mandatory or otherwise handy to use in order to defeat bosses. This is a concept that will probably be welcomed by the majority of players but possibly disliked by some purist veterans.Another ability that changes things up is a stream of bullets that initially requires charging up and is then unleashed on request in one go to wipe out blocks with ease, helping to prevent the pace of the action and your progress from turning stale. These bullets can also be used to inflict damage upon bosses in addition to striking them at their vulnerable spots with the ball. Another way to expedite the rate of your block-breaking, as well as heighten the challenge is to release multiple balls into concurrent play, thereby giving yourself more things to keep track of and juggle.While the visuals and sound effects are fantastic, the soundtrack is arguably in a league of its own, consisting of talently crafted melodies with intriguing and imaginative synthesis that warrant the price of this title even if there were no gameplay content. All in all, a fantastic and energetic package for a modest price.			"

												Can basically be described as Breakout: Improved. The core gameplay remains the same: bounce ball off paddle to break bricks. But while remaining faithful with the gameplay, Shatter adds in a new twists in the forms of power ups, special bricks (such as bombs and vortex), boss battles, and some special abilities for the paddle as well. Not only is Shatter fun to play but it also boasts pleasant 3D graphics, an energetic soundtrack and fluid gameplay. Boss battles, while they may seem corny in such a game, manage to break up the monotony of the core gamplay with a pleasant twist of the gameplay. Each boss is equipped with a ""weak spot"" which must either be opened by the player, or by the boss (usually to use a weapon) which then must be hit by the ball to deal damage. All in all I highly recommend this game.PS: Use a controller, while keyboard/mouse is good, controller is more fun.			"

												An excellent breakout game.Shatter is an upgrade to the classic Breakout and has similar graphics and music treatments to that of the new Pac-Man releases. Much like the addictive gameplay of those classic arcade games, Shatter maintains simple base mechanics, but the twists and upgrades thrown in don't detract from the game at all. In fact, they enhance it and do a good job of keeping the modern video gamer involved in the game when fancier titles sit next to this one in the library.Some of the ""twists"" that keep the game from getting too repetitive are the level orientation changes where your paddle might be on the left or on the bottom of the screen; level shape that can change from square or rectangular to circular so that the ball trajectory patterns and paddle path are different and almost become like playing Tempest; various ball upgrades that change the way you play through a level; ""push"" and ""pull"" aspects which not only help gather good fragments and repell bad fragments, but also affect ball trajectory; and boss fights. Yes, boss fights. I wasn't sure what to expect from those, but they're extremely well done. The good fragments that you collect can be converted into a rapid-fire barrage of projectiles to help exterminate bosses.I also found the bonus levels to be quite fun - trying to keep 3 balls alive which are constantly accelerating and appear to be on parabolic orbital paths, all while an extremely dynamic trippy light show plays in the background for your entertainment and distraction.The control layout can be a bit wonky depending on the layout of your keyboard, but it's not too big of a deal.This game is massively fun.

												Shatter is a delight for all brick-breaker lovers. Each of the game modes offers plenty of challenge, featuring fierce boss fights with bosses with various attack styles. The game's controls can be mastered in no time, and the graphics are beautiful, yet manageable. I definitely recommend this game, and not only to brick-breaker enthusiasts but to everyone.			"

												This was possibly my best purchase in last Christmas' big sale.I would venture to say that this game's only downfall is that the story mode is rather short and easy. I plowed through in one sitting - but I must say it was some 2 hours of good fun!!!It takes an age-old classic and refines it to perfection. Thanks to physics manipulation - push and pull - it fixes one the original's biggest flaws and makes it nearly perfect - full interactivity. At no point in the game did it ever feel dull - I was constantly in full control and never had to wait for the ball to get unstuck, nor struggle endlessly for that last annoying block. There's even a powerup that makes the ball even easier to manipulate! (though its hard to get used to at first)As I mentioned, the game is pretty easy - it felt like whenever I was lacking lives, blocks would drop lives more often. During boss fights especially they are very generous and lives pop out for almost each fail, garanteeing I would not get game over. In fact, I never had a single game over - plowed right through story mode in 2 hours, but it was a bit difficult at times, esp. when blocks are really close to your paddle. You have 2 special abilities on top of all that - a shield and a super bullet attack, which need your energy bar to be filled to use. The super attack is so powerful that it can sometimes instantly clear a level, which is very satisfying. It may be cheap, but it require a decent amount of time to actually fill, so you can't overuse it. It also *looks* amazing.SO BASICALLYThe game looks AWESOMEPlays AWESOMEEasily handles on most machinesBUT ITS VERY SHORT AND NOT WORTH THE 11$ pricetag for what your get*******HOWEVER - it has a very decent co-op mode. IF you have a friend (or kid/girlfriend/wife) to play this with, then go for full price. Its worth it then.If on SALE, its a MUST BUY!I HOPE THIS HELPS MAKE YOUR DECISION!PEACE OUT! :)			"

YouTube™ Video: What is James Playing - Shatter 

			Views: 2		

			A review of Shatter For more of my reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/		

I had already been listening to Shatter's excellent soundtrack for about a year before I actually tried playing the game. I actually found this game through its soundtrack and bought it during the Steam winter sale when it was super cheap. Shatter is an Arkanoid clone made in 2009 originally for the PlayStation network. If you think you've never played the original Arkanoid before, you missed a classic. Or if you're like me, you played Arkanoid, but never realized it had a name. Other than looking and sounding gorgeous, Shatter separates itself from Arkanoid by implementing a slightly more complex physics engine where the player can manipulate the ball via ""blow"" and ""suck"" mechanics. This seems like an easy spot for a lewd joke, but I'm gonna try to be mature here and just keep going.Shatter has several game modes including a couch co-op mode, but the only one I've played as of this review is Shatter's ""story move"". In story move, you play through 7 or so stages of Arkanoid-like gameplay before being confronted with a boss fight. The boss fights usually consist of trying to guide the ball into the bosses' glowy weak point using the blow and suck mechanic. It was these boss fights which highlighted what I thought was the primary problem with Shatter. I found I was hitting the bosses' weak points accidently through luck or random chance just as often as I was while intentionally trying to guide the ball with the blow and suck mechanics. The developers presumably included the blow and suck mechanics to give the player more control over the ball and add more skill and precision to Arkanoid. But it really doesn't matter. The blow and suck mechanics are implemented in such a way that it's still pretty hard to tell where the ball is going to go after you incluence it. Plus the screen is so chaotic and the balls bounce off of objects so randomly that you hit your intended target just as often through accident as on purpose. In fact, I felt the levels that required the most skill and control were the bonus levels where the blow and suck mechanics were taken away from you and there were no other objects on the screenShatter's somewhat mindless gameplay is given a boost by its impressive futuristic abstract graphics and hypnotic neon bloom particle effects. But what Shatter really stands on is its soundtrack. Oh my God the soundtrack. Standout tracks are Amethyst Caverns, Freon World and Granular Extractor, but the whole soundtrack is top to bottom amazing. It's the kind of hypnotic electronic trancey sound that is a perfect compliment to Shatter's gameplay. It's also great to work to or to fall asleep to. I mentioned in the introduction I actually listened to the soundtrack years before playing the game and probably would never even have given it a chance if not for the incredible music. The entire soundtrack was composed by Jeremiah Ross (a.k.a. ""Module"") who, to my knowledge, had never composed a game soundtrack before working on Shatter. I'd love to see him get more work; the Shatter soundtrack is truly awesome. As I said before, Shatter's gameplay is kind of mindless, but I don't mean that in a negative way in this instance. It's can be a nice experience to put on the game, watch the pretty lights and colors and zone out to the amazing soundtrack with minimal interaction. If this sounds like it might be your thing, give Shatter a try. Or if you'd like to see a modern take of the classic Arkanoid, Shatter is your gameFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/ "

												Shatter plays like Breakout with the aesthetic and bullet-hell quality of Geometry Wars, plus Boss battles similar to Wizorb.  Shatter does offer some innovation with a Suck and Blow mechanic, allowing you to influence the direction of objects floating around the playfield, including your ball, things that can hurt you, and sometimes even parts of bosses.  This is a really nice addition to the genre.It's fun, challenging but not punishing.  It looks, sounds and feels good.  It'll only take you a couple hours to beat the Story.  That said, it's got loads of other modes, including Co-Op that I'm excited to try it out.  Shatter's not going to shatter your expectations, but if you like this type of game, you'll have a good time.			"

												The best way to think of shatter is that it is like an arcade game, and a REALLY good one, too. However, the keyboard controls on the PC are NOT the best and I would recommend  using the mouse to control, and if you do have this on a console also, I would highly recommend the gamepad. The multiplayer is also really fun, but there is also a ton of other modes to try as well. As for the replay value, I really don't know. The story is as follows: you are a ping pong thingy, made only to bounce a ball, then you escape, and try to give the others freedom. So, as you can tell this game doesn't really have a story, but with or without one, I had one heck of a time actually PLAYING shatter. If you liked breakout or simalar games to it, I would totally recommend this, but if you pass on those games, you may want to skip this. Overall, this game is a blast to play, with the execption of odd keyboard controls, 9 out of 10.			"

												К сожалению, весьма посредственный арканоид. Безвкусные плохо детализированные задники, которые просто не могут радовать глаза. Прорисовка всего остального тоже желает лучшего: очень бы хотелось более подробной прорисовки мелких деталей и эффектов. Музыка в игре - отдельный разговор. Она просто никакая.  Строго рекомендуется играть со своей музыкой.В то же время, наличие физических эффектов, возможность управлять полётом шарика, а также сражения с боссами в конце каждого мира, немного добавляет очков данной игре.Но, не ""Ricochet"", ни разу не ""Ricochet"".

												The music is amazing, certainly worth a listen. The gameplay is relaxing and cathartic, except when everything's coming right at you, then it's just cathartic. The visuals are appealing, forming one nice cohesive whole. The controls are tight and responsive.It's still just arkanoid, but it's among the top arkanoid-like out there. Don't play arkanoid, play this.			"

												Building on the classic bat and ball games from the 16bit era, Shatter brings the genre forward, adding physics, particle effects and a fast paced manic experience you would normally expect to find in a Japanese shoot 'em up.Well worth playing if you have ever enjoyed a game of breakout or Arkanoid.

												The music alone is worth the price of entry.  And then you have a modernday arkanoid with a couple of  nods to Geomtry Wars but a nuanced perfectly controlled arcade score chaser which allows you to tactically push and pull the 'ball' midflight, add risk/reward by lobbing in multiple balls to the arena and strategically decide when to unleash the powerup for maxium effect.  There's a lot going on, but it never feels the wrong side of overwhelming and as the best arcaders do - gives you an immensely satisying feeling of control and progression.Defintely recommended.

												It's a fun exploration of the genre, and the added mechanics are interesting yet easy to grasp. I find myself reinstalling this game every once in a while just to kill a few hours, as the gameplay is fun and the music is pretty good. It is a little easy on the default setting though, and could benefit from some more powerups. For the price, it's definetly something you should try out.Revisiting the title, I feel like there's also lots of opportunity to practice and improve your skills. Boss rush is especially fun since it often forces you to send multiple balls at once in order for you to beat it in a decent amount of time.			"

												Shatter is a pretty typical brick breaker game.  The bosses can be quite fun, and the graphics are wonderful given the game type. What makes this game great is the amazing soundtrack. It was fully composed by Module, and it is the ONLY game soundtrack I have purchased seperately (I've gotten soundtracks in Collector's Editions and such), but this is the only game that I have gone back later and purchased the soundtrack. It is amazing, inside or outside of the game. I reccomend picking this one up, if nothing more than to extract the music out of the files.			"

Chill out hardcore or multiball for an indecent number of points, the choice is yours! Fill your satisfaction meter to shield or to release a salvo of kablamo. This game will get your ears and heart pumping as you race across surreal scenes or struggle to get the last block in a circular area. Bosses are rocking radical hardcore and this game has bonus rounds.

												Hey, friends. You like games? You like challanges? You like games which are hard?If you answered all of the above, then one last question stands in your way; do you mind if it's slightly broken?The music is fantastic (and wonderful for Beat Hazard) and the graphics are top notch, but sometimes, very rarely, you'll find the ball decides it's too good for the bat and will phase through it- it's not often though (read: one in every fifteen hits).I'd still recommend this game though, as it seems like the developer(s) knew about the problem, but not how to fix it, and thus stuck tons of extra lives in.Give it a go- it's great fun if you're not competitive!

												Shatter takes the game concepts originated in PONG and then evolved in the arcade classic ARKANOID and further enhances the gameplay and visuals to create something extremely polished and entertaining.  Shatter is incredibly inventive with the PONG concept by throwing a huge variety of ""brick walls"" at you to bust apart with your ball and paddle and gives you extra abilities to manipulate the path and curve of the ball's ricochet.  You also face off against some very entertaining boss battles that you might not expect from this type of game.  On top of this the game has a brilliant musical soundtrack that easily deserves a place in your music collection.  Seriously.  This is a great game to have on hand for those moments when you just want something fun and relaxing to enjoy.  It fills the bill with endless replayability and some surprisingly addictive qualities.  Very, very good.			"

												If you like Breakout or racking up high scores, this is a nice little diversion. It has a short cmapaign mode with some interesting bosses, and the paddle wind mechanic makes for some interesting play. Some of the later levels are a bit silly, as in it throws a bunch of falling blocks at you and you cant possibly get them all. The hit detection on the paddle is a bit meh; sometimes I made a quick move to save the ball that felt like it should have succeeded, but resulted in a lost life. It's also a bit too easy to lose track of the ball in all the explosions and flying bits. The osundtrack makes this game for me. It's kick-♥♥♥. Go download it right now.			"

												This game is quite possibly one of the best in terms of ""wanting to kill some time"".  I always think any game that introduces scoring in large abundance and has competitive leaderboards, it leads to people wanting to play more.  The developers did a good job in adding the ""addictive""element to the game in terms of scoring.  The particle effects and music serve the game well also.  Shatter also features a ton of modes and co-op play to extend the replayability further.  For the price tag, I left feeling satisfied and can see myself playing the game more down the road.			"

												A wonderful little gem inspired by the classic brick breaking game, Breakout. This game brings a number of fresh concepts to the simple ball and paddle genre for an all new experience. The difficulty curve is fairly balanced, casual players should be able to trudge through but experienced players can find a satisfying challenge. The visuals are flashy and overall enjoyable to watch as many things happen all at once. Although rather unimportant in such a game, the story is cute and creative. The highest point however is the game's amazing soundtrack. Very chilling and cool, I could listen to the album for hours on end. This all adds up to an extremely cozy experience that I can't reccomend enough.			"

												An excellent breakout game.Shatter is an upgrade to the classic Breakout and has similar graphics and music treatments to that of the new Pac-Man releases. Much like the addictive gameplay of those classic arcade games, Shatter maintains simple base mechanics, but the twists and upgrades thrown in don't detract from the game at all. In fact, they enhance it and do a good job of keeping the modern video gamer involved in the game when fancier titles sit next to this one in the library.Some of the ""twists"" that keep the game from getting too repetitive are the level orientation changes where your paddle might be on the left or on the bottom of the screen; level shape that can change from square or rectangular to circular so that the ball trajectory patterns and paddle path are different and almost become like playing Tempest; various ball upgrades that change the way you play through a level; ""push"" and ""pull"" aspects which not only help gather good fragments and repell bad fragments, but also affect ball trajectory; and boss fights. Yes, boss fights. I wasn't sure what to expect from those, but they're extremely well done. The good fragments that you collect can be converted into a rapid-fire barrage of projectiles to help exterminate bosses.I also found the bonus levels to be quite fun - trying to keep 3 balls alive which are constantly accelerating and appear to be on parabolic orbital paths, all while an extremely dynamic trippy light show plays in the background for your entertainment and distraction.The control layout can be a bit wonky depending on the layout of your keyboard, but it's not too big of a deal.This game is massively fun.

												Shatter is an excellent take on that old ""breakout"" game, where you bounce the ball, get powerups, continue,The biggest thing about shatter, is unlike other games of this type, you have significantly more control over your ball using a ""suck"" and ""blow"" system, and unlike your ex, is very reliable.The number of balls on screen at one time is entirely controlled by you the whole time as well. You can release balls individually, dependent on the amount of lives you have.but lose them all, game over. This game doesn't mess around with assulting you with the blocks either. Blocks can also react to gravity, and fall directly into your little paddle if not careful.These collisions do not kill you, but rather knock your bat out of play for a little bit, leaving all of your balls vulnerable... Great graphics, great sound, very satisfactory destructions, great fun for a decent price!			"

												Shatter plays like Breakout with the aesthetic and bullet-hell quality of Geometry Wars, plus Boss battles similar to Wizorb.  Shatter does offer some innovation with a Suck and Blow mechanic, allowing you to influence the direction of objects floating around the playfield, including your ball, things that can hurt you, and sometimes even parts of bosses.  This is a really nice addition to the genre.It's fun, challenging but not punishing.  It looks, sounds and feels good.  It'll only take you a couple hours to beat the Story.  That said, it's got loads of other modes, including Co-Op that I'm excited to try it out.  Shatter's not going to shatter your expectations, but if you like this type of game, you'll have a good time.			"

												Totally awesome take on brick breaker genre, very innovative with ideas to make the game very addicting.Easy to pick up for beginners, still challenging for hardcore players especially when you're trying to get that high score/achievement(s).Soundtrack is beautiful, doesn't get repetitive, always fun to listen while playing.Bosses are tricky and require some thinking to figure out the weakness of each one.Playing with someone skilled is a totally new experience.Visually there's nothing to bad to say, I'm not a very picky person when it comes to graphics.Overall this is the must play for someone who loves this type of games.One thing that can be classified as a con would be no online 2 player mode or this option was specially left out because back in the day of arkanoid there was no online mode :DAny anmount of money spend on this gem will not describe the fun coming from playing this title.So why are even reading this? Grab the game and go get that high score in mode that's most suited for you!			"

												From a pure mechanics standpoint, this is quite possibly the best brick breaker game of all time. The push and pull mechanics allow the player to feel like they are always in control of the ball and it greatly reduces the 'takes forever to hit the last few bricks' issue that plagues this genre. The constantly changing level design, interesting physics based blocks and boss battles keep it fresh and entertaining throughout. Shatter has incredible presentation. The audio and visuals are top notch with impactful and satisfying VFX and sounds. My one major gripe and the reason I will probably never play this game again: Controls. Its always surprising when a high quality game has no keybinding options. The main keyboard buttons are (Right Shift(, (/) and (Ctrl)... really? I have never played a game with a worse button layout. Im assuming all the developers use left handed mice or they just like trolling their players. If you can get past a few poorly placed, unchangable buttons, this is an amazing game.			"

												While the soundtrack is indeed ♥♥♥♥ING INCREDIBLE, it is merely one reason why it this game is great. Shatter is pretty much a perfection of a very specific genre. It takes Breakouts base gameplay, adds fresh unique mechanics and ties them together with great level design, crisp graphics, and, of course, a killer soundtrack. While the main story is a short and sweet blast to play, endless and score attack mode is where I've sinked the most hours. It may not seem like much, but such a tightly designed game is well worth the meager asking price.			"

												Average Breakout-type puzzle game that only is saved by some nice backgrounds and the soundtrack.Physics engine feels a bit sloppy and random at times, with some hits in the same area going different directions for no reason at all. The game uses lives and continues, yet once you're down to 1 or 2 lives it drops them like crazy anyway to excuse the absurd boss and level design. The overuse of physics with the push/pull, the ability to be stunned from hits by falling blocks and a delay on the shield to prevent that stun leads to mostly frustration, and clearing levels often feels like random luck than skill.This type of puzzle game usually works best with tight physics and controls, along with creative powerups and level designs, but this lacks in those areas too much to be considered a good entry to the genre. Cleared the way to the last world and dropped it, and I can't recommend it as being worth the time.			"

												(Based on limited gameplay) I got Shatter on sale for about $3.39, which works for me, because it looks like another Arkanoid/paddle ball clone. Partially it is, but it has its own twist by letter the player manipulate the ball and loose blocks with a Push or Pull feature. Blocks also release shards upon destruction, which gives extra points and slightly increases your power bar which can be used for a shield or power full gun attack. This creates a clever risk and reward system, as you may unintentionally shoot your ball into the pit. Shatter looks pretty and so far, is a fun game with a reasonable price.			"

												It's a good game, kinda average. I have absolutely no idea why there's ""great soundtrack"" in the tags, the game's soundtrack is okay I guess but definitely not great. It just kinda falls into all the other stuff that's quite average. But still, if you see this game in a sale or in a bundle, it's quite a lot of fun for a while. I'd say the price is about 1€. Don't go higher, it's all the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again.6/10			"

												Let's just be straight: Half of the reason you're gonna want to buy this game is because of the amazing OST. Module is an amazing musician and he needs all the recognition he can get. Other than that, it's basically Breakout with physics. A cool concept with a lot of mileage, and it works a lot! However, it can get a little tiring when so many things fly at you and make you risk losing a ball because of some dodgy physics. It's good fun, but a little monotone after a while.			"
