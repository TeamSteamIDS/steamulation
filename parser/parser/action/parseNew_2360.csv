												This is a good game that happens to use an outdated executable. The most desirable way to play this game is  to delete dosbox.exe, download a source port such as gzdoom, and then rename gzdoom.exe(or whatever the executable is named as) to dosbox.exe. And then you should be able to play the game flawlessly while still being tied with Steam(logging hours and showing that you're playing the game).			"

												Remember when games were made by people who loved them and put extreme effort into making them to the absolute best of their ability? Probably not. Hexen: Beyond Heretic is easily up there with the greatest of all time. Easily. Everytime I play this I cannot fathom how once such a great industry, overflowing with talent turned into the bland, dumbed-down, soulless mess it is today. We've come down from seeing hundreds of great games and a handful of masterpieces yearly to seeing maybe 1 or 2 semi decent games every 4 years if we're lucky!Hexen, while essentially a first person action fantasy game, takes a lot of influence from RPG games of that era, offering expansive exploration that see's you backtrack through earlier stages of the game to access areas previously unavailable until aquiring a key from a later part in the game. The level design is jaw droppingly amazing, some of the best ever, consisting of sprawling non-linear layouts which are almost psychotically well thought out. There are traps, puzzles scattered through-out the levels as well as hordes of blood thirsty minions to hack into pieces. The setting is very similar to that of Heretic and the gameplay to an extent. There are different classes to choose from,  each with their own strengths and weaknesses and each with their own diverse weapons and spells, the classes consist of; The Fighter - Melee focused character with weapons more suited for striking range.The Cleric - Which is an all rounder class, mixing the ability to fight with the ability to cast spells.The Mage - Which is self explanatory, the mage starts off weak, with weak spells that are suited for ranged attacks until he becomes a badass later in the game with spells that allow him to fly.Hexen is truly a masterpiece, a work of art, a crowning achievement in gaming, if you haven't played it already I suggest you do so immediately and if you have played it I suggest you play it again. Put down your bland whack-a-mole/military shooters and play a real game!

												HeXen: Beyond Heretic, or as I prefer to call it, ""WHERE THE F**K AM I GOING"" is a game that is quite a long way ahead of it's time. I suspect this is the first game to allow you to freely come and go between levels (once you unlock them, of course), much like you can in games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (although slightly unlike Castlevania, it has a hub world). The gameplay is, well, imagine doom with more melee weapons, and magic instead of guns. It's kick♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's fast-paced, difficult, murderous fun, however it is not entirely without its flaws. I very strongly reccomend you download a mod called Zandronum, along with downloading novert, as these give proper mouse-look (well, you can't look up and down, but the game is designed with that in mind, so it's not an issue), along with letting you customise controls and increasing the resolution of the textures, unless you're nostalgic for graphics that, in all honesty, have aged poorly. Also, the level designers seemed to have a raging hard-on for levels with poor lighting.However, in spite of all that, plus it's insanely easy to get lost, I have to reccomend this game. The gameplay is, as you can tell from the screenshots, DOOM in a fantasy setting. You run around at mach 5 hitting♥♥♥♥♥♥with a lightning axe or shooting fire from your hands. Buy it, or buy the Hexen + Heretic bundle. If you like video games, fun and retro♥♥♥♥♥♥kicking action, you won't regret it.			"

												One of my favorite games. Take Doom and add some pseudo-RPG elements with a larger focus on puzzles. Set it all in a medieval world with a fantasy direction, as opposed to Doom's sci-fi/hell approach, and you've got Hexen. The music is top-notch as well. I recommend playing this in a Doom source port such as GZDoom, Doomsday, or any of the other available source ports. This will allow for a more modern control scheme and higher resolutions. (Note: this will of course mean that you won't log hours on your Steam record for the game, if that kind of thing matters to you.)			"

												Greetings mortal.  Are you ready to die?  This is one of best games ever created when you can play it in a full co-op mode.  I remember co-op each life is taken seriously since everything is lost on death so each person must survive long enough to use certain objects when you find out where they go.  A similar co-op mode would make it one of the best games on steam too!			"

												HeXen: Beyond Hereic is a FPS made by Raven Software in 1995. It can be viewed as sequel to Heretic, but only in dark fantasy idea. It's not Doom-clone anymore, instead trying to mix First Person Shooter with RPG elements that are exploration and puzzles. No leveling though.Compared to ports the only things you are missing is FMV intermissions of PS1 and Saturn, they are text-only on PC, and maybe split-screen multiplayer of N64. Otherwise count PC version as superior.There also was Hexen on CD. It used redbook music. Steam doesn't have it. But don't worry, they sounded an awful lot like MIDI, but somehow slightly less weak. There were less of tracks too. So you don't miss anything.So, DosBox was once again configured badly and will lag badly unless configured. To do that, go to ""hexen.conf"" file. There you should change output from Ddraw to OpenGL, this should fix this.You can't easily access options to change control and music device from Steam, but at least developers left setup.exe in game's directory. You can open it easily by dragging setup file onto dosbox.exe.Mutliplayer is supposed to be either coop or deathmatch. Probably isn't balanced for Deathmatch. And in coop players can be only in one level at same time. But since original multiplayer isn't something you can set up easily, or maybe not supported at all in Steam or today, I will rather recommend just using Zandronum source port for multiplayer. But this game is more designed toward single-player, multiplayer is bonus.Storyline goes is that world of Hexen/Cronos is being dictated by three leaders of three factions: Legion, Arcanum and Church. They traded their alliegance for power of unlife to Korax, the second Dragon Rider, an ugly looking skeleton creature who uses Chaos Sphere to get his power. Our three heroes, who belong to those factions, escaped the infulence of Korax and their leaders and sworn to destroy them. Trying to find Korax stronghold to defeat him, they get separated after entering the portal.No, there will be almost no storyline going during game itself. Unless you count ""after trying to forget horrors that you encounteredOHGOD what is this horrible place that you got yourself into? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT ALIVE?!"" intermissions. It's mostly just an excuse of why developers decided to put use of player classes sprites as bosses in the final world.So, the game tries to be less like Doom. It's not about speeding and rushing through series of linear levels. It's about getting hopelessly lost on hub consisting of few levels and then using Google. And pushing switches. Many switches. Switches are puzzles. Switches are everything.But yes, it tries to vary up things with more exploration. You will have to search corners and walls of levels, trying to find hidden passages and switches. You will also have puzzles, which is either bring ""key"" item to the needed place or pressing switches. Sometimes it's not about switches, but it's a rare occurance. I also should note one single flaw: for majority of the game you can place the needed item automatically into place where you have to place them by pressing ""open/use"". But for Yorick's Skull you will have to actually use it from inventory by ""use inventory item"". That confused me for a while.Levels are connected to each other into hub worlds. There are five hubs in the game, each with around five or more levels. If a switch will do something important on another level, you will be notified. And thanks to more complex scripting, there are some traps or interesting things will happen occasionally. Second hub world is one of the most confusing ones and yet it's the best one when it comes to atmosphere.But, as said, no RPG elements like leveling or NPC.Glitches also happen sometimes. Like, on the 4th hub the boss may sometiems not spawn. Or magic bridge in 2nd hub may not spawn if enemey blocked it. They sure ruin the fun. Especially when you have to check walkthrough to realize that something went wrong.The game lets you choose one of the three classes: Fighter, Cleric and Mage.- Fighter is best in anything aside from magic. At least this is what stat image says. If forget that ""magic"" isn't really a thing there. Anyway, he is melee class, will not get ranged weapon in a while. His blows are strong, he is fast and he can tank damage up. He is the fun with who you will have fun playing as. His flechette, very common item for the game that does different things for each class, is just throwing it forward like explosive.- Cleric is average class. His stats are average. At least he is not a bad ranged class. His second weapon even has special property of healing you up while used in melee range. His flechettes are most powerful, blowing into poison cloud. This poison will painlock any enemy and will keep doing a damage on them, while you get to just watch them slowly get hurt. But the bad thing here is that his playstyle is tedious. Game's biggest problem are centaurs that always shield up after getting single hit. They are annoying. Fighter don't have to hit them much. But Cleric will either have to fight them for some long time or he will have to use flechette and then wait some time for them to die. Thus, it's not so fun beating game as him. Pick Warrior instead.- Mage is has low class on everything, but has highest ""magic"". That means that even his basic weapon is magical peashooter. And his second weapon feels the weakest. While the third weapon is quite powerful. But all of them waste a lot of mana. And he is quite slow class too. His flechette are weak, just working as timed bomb. What I am saying is that he isn't much of fun to play either. But at least he doesn't have as much of problem with shielding centaurs as Cleric does. Unless you don't have ammo for the third weapon, then gameplay becomes tedious once again. Pick Warrior instead.So yea, Hexen is fun, but only with Warrior. Every other class will have tedious parts.Game also doesn't bring any good variety during walkthrough. You got three classes, each with their own unique four weapons. But the catch is that you can only play as one class for over 30 levels. As a result, you have only four weapons for whole game. First one is basic and is never used. And 4th one is super-weapon. And third weapon is usually better than the second, even though second and third weapon use their own manas types. So, there is not much thinking involved in picking needed weapon. I can say that it's not as much of thinking or fun in single walkthrough as in Heretic.There is a good variety in enemies though. Some are melee. Common and weak. Others are tough and shoot. And there is a blocking centaurs. As said, it's a common enemy, that brings game down with his tendency to become invincible after getting hit by bringing shield up for a while. Game would have been good without them.But hey, at least there are some bosses. Like, three of them. Eh, yes, it's not much. And one is reused again.Graphics is a step-up on technical side and step-down on artstyle. It uses much more high-resolution sprites. Everything looks bigger and taller. But on bad sides they forgot about color. The unique awesome colorful world of Heretic was tossed out and was replaced by something brown and green. Which looks good sometimes, but most often not. It can be agrued that it fits to dark atmosphere. Well, second hub atmosphere was nice, but after that I surely was missing Heretic.Music also took a step back. Probably more fit to exploration, but it's not catchy. I hardly can remember any good track outside of the first level.Hexen is a mixed bag. It's puzzles and combat get tedious at times. I only recommend beating it only as Warrior and pay attention to what switches do. I found enjoyment in that way. Otherwise, it's a bad game.			"

												Hexen is the successor to Heretic, and Raven Software worked really hard attempting to make it a superior experience in numerous ways.The biggest are the addition of character classes. In Hexen you can pick between playing as a Warrior, a Cleric, and a Mage. Each of these classes has different weapons, playstyles and powerups affect them differently. This greatly adds to the game's replayability and the multiplayer. Alongside that Hexen has hub levels. However part of my gripes with the game revolve around the level design. Hexen requires a great deal of backtracking in it's level design, and you can expect to have to return to prior levels regularly inorder to solve puzzles. This can get very confusing as the game goes on since you can get stuck very easily and have to constantly search old levels for the solution to a puzzle.However the game does redeem itself by how great it's combat is. Once you get beyond the sometimes annoying level design you have a very enjoyable hack and slash, not one of Raven's best games mind you but still worth playing.

Hexen			*7/10Developed by Raven Software, Hexen is an indirect sequel to Heretic, which is based on an improved id's DooM engine. So this essentially is another FPS With a Fantasy atmosphere like its predecessor, Heretic.Unlike Heretic this time we won't be impersonating Corvus as the setting is totally different. We are in a different world Dominated by the second Serpent rider, Korax, and his minions. And here comes the first innovation: we get to choose our class before beginning our game. Warrior, Cleric And Mage are the three classes we might choose, and this is something that really affects our gameplay because each class has its own weapons balanced by different characteristics. For example, the warrior is stronger and faster, so he can take more phisycal damage and move faster because most of his weapons are mostly hand weapons. On the other side We have the mage, weaker and slower but his weapons are magic based and they all can do damage from the distance. The cleric, as usual is the middle class, Not as weak as the mage, nor strong as the warrior and almost all his weapons can hurt from the distance.Just like its predecessor, Heretic, You have a wide variety of items (powerups or tools) you can store to use at will in other moments.However, the biggest revolution in this title is its structure. Unlike any other previus FPS where you have a sequence of levels to play, in Hexen you have ""Hubs"" which can be seen as ""stations"" where you can unlock passages to other minor closed levels for the purpose to solve elaborated puzzles that will ultimately unlock the passage to the next Hub. This gives the game a bigger depth even though I admit I've never liked it and because of this I lost motivation and never actually finished it (at the time, about 20 years ago).As usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.+++PROs+++ STRUCTURE. Clearly the all new structure of the levels is an innovation that, paired with puzzles in the minor levels, gives the game a big playability by making the player moving back and forth from more maps. This way, even though you will end up re-visiting the same place many times you have the illusion of a bigger world. Honestly this always had the look of a maze to me, but I've never really tried that much. FANTASY. Following the fantasy atmosphere from its predecessor Hexen does a bigger job by renewing the locations and making the game with a bit darker tones. in my opinions it's a bit scarier and ominous than Heretic.  GAMEPLAY. Besides the ability to look up and down already introduced in Heretic, Now you can jump as well. Nothing too useful but at least that's a step forward XD. And just like Heretic you still have the inventory system with some old items already seen in Heretic and other useful and interesting tools. Note that some of these tools have a different functions according to the class you choose. Another innovations relies in the interaction with ambience, you can find glass mosaics that can be broken revealing hidden rooms or bonus items and besides that there are some jars that can be broken to find more bonus items. MODS & COMMUNITY. You can find mods, and other stuff. But most importantly, there are custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with tricks and advices on replacing DosBox with better ports and implementing the Steam Overlay.---CONs--- MUSIC. Unfortunately i didn't enjoy that much almost any of the tracks in the game, unlike its predecessor Heretic. STEAM OVERLAY. As usual, like on every other old steam release running on DosBox, there's no Steam Overlay. STRUCTURE. Even though this is a new kind of structure I personally didn't enjoy it too much because it forces me to visit and revisit the same leves again and again before proceeding to the next hub, resulting in a repetitive gameplay.

The levels can be a little confusing sometimes but that is just a minor setback. The level design is really good and the level system goes by hubs which can have many portals, that take you to different areas of the map. All and all i would say it is worth the money.			"

IMPORTANT: This version of the game is in its native DOS state, and frankly that hasn't aged well thanks to low resolutions and clunky controls. I recommend getting GZDoom to run this, put its compatibility mode on Doom (not the strict version, just the regular). For gameplay options, make sure jumping is enabled and crouching disabled, as levels were designed with that in mind. You can tighten up the shooting by turning autoaim off. To keep the art style of the game as it was intended, turn all texture filtering off, and use square pixel particles.Short OpinionComplex level design and solid action. Not the kind of game you play for the story. Decent game, but maybe not for everyone. Recommend playing Heretic first.Full OpinionThis game is the sequal to a game called Heretic. For those familiar with Heretic but not Hexen, this game has the same ""feel"" to it, and yet changes things up a fair bit.Level design:In Hexen, levels are broken into hubs that consist of several maps each. Key-hunting and solving puzzles makes up a large portion of this game. Individual maps can cause changes in other maps of the same hub - it is imperative to pay attention to the level design and recognize clues or you risk becoming lost. Maps are usually quite interesting and fun, but can be confusing. If lost, head back to the main map of that hub and try to figure out what your overall progress is.Combat:When beginning a game, you choose from three classes. Ultimately, these classes are really just a choice between which weapons you want to use. Each class has four weapons - the first, an infinte ammo weapon, then a weapon that uses blue mana, a weapon that uses green mana, and an extra-powerful weapon that uses both types of mana. There are many items which you can pick up and carry up to 25 of each type, including health potions, weaponized potions, flight, and various others. Health potions are absolutely vital, as this game is punishingly brutal, throwing many powerful enemies with difficult to avoid attacks at you at once, with alarming frequency. Combat is typical run-and-gun style of the 90's shooters, however it's not quite as polished as it was in Heretic. Enemy variety is rather small, and you'll only ever have to worry about projectile and melee attacks - no hitscan enemies to be seen in this game. There is however, one enemy type that is guaranteed to cause frustration for the inexperienced, and that is a creature called the Centaur, that can use their shields to reflect your attacks. They are extemely common, appearing from the first hub, and often appear in large groups, so learning to deal with them is important.Audio and visuals:Graphically, this game is far from photo-realistic. It does however have a charm to it. Basically a dark fantasy world with nice looking, albeit low-resolution sprites. If this art style is not to your tastes, there are texture and sprite replacement mods available. Sound design is decent, with weapons and monsters sounding pretty good and with plenty of ambience in each map. Music is also designed to be ambient and mood-setting.Story:Honestly the least important element of this game. The story is loosely connected to that of Heretic's. The Serpent Rider known as Korax has taken over your world and must be defeated, so three heroes must embark on a journey to bring him down. Korax will briefly taunt you at the beginning of every hub. That's it, really. Just a simple backdrop for a dark fantasy FPS.Conclusion:If this sounds interesting, I would recommend playing Heretic first. Simply because secret hunting in Heretic will help develop the skills you need to find your way through the complex levels in Hexen. This is a good game, but it may be more of an aquired taste than something anybody can just pick up and play.			"

												This game is not for people who have only played DOOM-cubed. This game is for people who played ClassicDOOM on DOS. Released during the same era of gaming, Hexen is, as the title suggests, the sequel to Heretic.  I actually never played this in its heyday, so this is actually a new experience for me.  I didn't understand the hub system when I was younger, so never actually touched Hexen until just recently.In this game, instead of being just one ""DOOMguy"" or ""Corvus/Hereticguy/FantasyDOOMguy,"" you can choose one of three classes: a Fighter, a Cleric, or Mage.  Each have their strengths and weaknesses, and will actually use certain items/powerups in the game differently, most notably the Flechette.  The demos that play if you don't create a new game are a bit misleading, as they suggest that each class has a different set of levels to playthrough.  Or, they did for me anyway.  I quickly figured out that is not the case, and was a little disappointed at first, but quickly got over it.  Now that I'm older, I understand the Hub system better and am able to navigate through the levels easier.  One thing I would stress: explore everywhere.  Don't leave any portion of your maps blank if you can help it.  Some important switches are hidden in easily-disregarded places, and you will find yourself stuck if you don't throw/flip them.People looking for ""new and exciting ame mechanics"" will likely be very disappointed.  As far as I know, this particular iteration of a hub system has not been recreated for any other (popular) FPS-type game outside the Heretic franchise.  But, if you played these games and similar during their heyday, I would highly recommend getting them for a trip down Memory Lane.(Also, the price of these games in the bundle can't be beat.  Ten bucks for four games?  That's $2.50 USD per game!)			"

												!!Important note!!  To have the best experience with Hexen, I highly recommend you download a source port called zdoom, which will provide loads of customization to the controls and will improve the gameplay experience (link below). On the 4th hub, on one of the sub-levels there is a glitch which stops two doors from opening, this stops you from finishing the 4th hub. I loaded the last auto save and tried again and both doors opened. If that doesn’t work, I recommend using the noclip command to kill the enemies in those two rooms.     What I liked about the game •	I liked the concept of the game. Instead of having a level to level game like Heretic, which can be quite linear, you now have a hub with sub-levels, you have to solve one big puzzle to move onto the next hub.•	You can choose your character, you can either be a warrior, a cleric or a mage. Each character has his own unique weapons. •	The items you use and store in your inventory can be very useful. The porkelator is a fun item to use. •	Good level design, I liked the little things they added to the game like the leafs falling of the trees, bats flying out of dark caves and the wooden doors making creaking sounds then you opened them, it added to the games atmosphere. There are also secret sub-levels.What I disliked or was disappointed with•	The game can be confusing, especially when you first start playing it. It took me a while to get into the game, because I thought it was going to be like Heretic with level to level gameplay. •	Sometimes I got stuck and had to resort to looking on the internet, to find out what to do next. •	Very challenging, lots of traps and some hard to beat enemies like the Heresiarch. •	Final boss is way too easy to defeat.My conclusion A good game, with relpayability. A bit confusing at first and maybe a bit too difficult, but overall I enjoyed it. If you are bored with level to level fps, I recommend you try this. 65/100 Zdoom (source port) http://zdoom.org/News "

												After far too long, I have finally completed HeXen. It's the sequel to Heretic, but while Heretic was a fun DOOM reskin, HeXen gets away from DOOM's influence and becomes more of its own thing, with multiple player characters, hub-based level structure, more puzzles, and a far darker tone. These changes bring plenty of pros and cons, and certainly create a unique experience.There are three characters to choose from at the start of the game: the Fighter, the Mage, and the Cleric. (They have actual names, but they're not worth remembering.) The Fighter is a melee character, the Mage is ranged, and the Cleric is a mix between the two. I played as the Fighter because I'd heard that he was the best, and it's fun to just run around punching hundreds and hundreds of monsters with wonderfully cathartic gore and sound effects. The punch is the starting weapon (there are four total per class), and it's strangely effective; I got by using it almost exclusively for about 60% of the game before the challenge ramped up enough to necesitate use of the other weapons. I may go back and play as the other characters at some point, though, because the game makes it clear that the playstyles differ enough to make repeats worthwhile.Heretic's 4-episodes-of-9-linear-levels-each structure has been replaced with a hub system in HeXen, the first of its kind that I can find reference to. There are 5 hubs, each with various levels connected to it by portals. Once the player completes whatever puzzle the hub was based around, another portal opens and the player moves on to the next hub (this is a portal-heavy game). It's functional, and it does facilitate the increasingly elaborate puzzles the game is based around. There's not a whole lot to say about it beyond that.Those puzzles are the main addition to HeXen from Heretic, and they're a mixed bag overall. They're mostly find-key/button-to-open-door-to-go-to-new-place-to-find-key/button affairs, but they usually work pretty well, and the game settles into a nice groove with them after a while. Occasionally, though, there's a puzzle that involves something completely unintuitive, ridiculously well-hidden, way too far away from where one would expect, or just plain stupid, and those bring the entire game to a screeching halt. I had to consult a walkthrough a few times, and while I probably could have figured the hard parts out without one (as my 90s PC gaming predecessors did), it would have taken far too long and been completely devoid of entertainment in that time. The first hub is by far the worst in this regard, and I'm sure that this has turned away many prospective players over the years. Most of the time, though, the puzzles are pretty inoffensive.The tone of HeXen is also far darker than that of Heretic, although this is mostly reflected in the environment design. It's wonderfully grim, grimy, and foreboding, though, and I like it.Of course, not everything has been changed from Heretic. The inventory system is still there, and the items have gotten even more ridiculous in scope and variety, including summonable allies, repulsion discs, speedy boots, and a thing that will turn you into a pig (although sadly no Tomes of Power). Besides the health-refilling Quartz Flasks, however, I only ended up ever using any of these items twice: once I used a Chaos Device to free myself when I glitched into a floor and got stuck, and during the final boss I drank a Krater of Might to refill all my mana so that I could use my ultimate weapon to kill him in just a few hits. Apart from those occasions, I never felt the need to use any items, so I guess the entire inventory system is kinda useless. I haven't tried the higher difficulties, though, so it might be more necessary there.Also returning from Heretic is the idTech 1 engine, which has been further improved. You can look up and down now, and there are walls that can move horizontally. There's also a jump button. Unfortunately, the somewhat slippery movement is still there, making HeXen's platforming difficult at times. Additionally, the plot has continued on from Heretic, and the goal of this game is to kill the second of the Serpent Riders, Korax, who never rides a serpent anywhere in the game but does try to bother you from pictures on walls which don't resemble his likeness at all. Finally, HeXen shares Heretic's easy-to-understand levels, making sure that the player is never lost.Overall, HeXen is a pretty damn good game. The puzzling is decent, the combat is basically fun and cathartic, the atmosphere, sound design, pixel art, and monster variety are all good, and I actually wouldn't mind playing it again, which is uncommon for these old games. Give it a shot.			"

												Hexen: Beyond Heretic is the sequel to Heretic and the second game in the Serpent Rider trilogy, released a year after the first game. This time you go to the human occupied world of Cronos, one thousand years after the events of Heretic, for it is said that every 1000 years a Serpent Rider will visit a world and attempt to overthrow it (or something like that in the lore). This time its Korax, the second oldest Serpent Rider and reputedly more powerful than D'Sparil was. He was able to subvert the shakily-ran three organizations that ruled all life on Cronos: the Legion, responsible for military power and watching over the populace with an iron fist. The Arcanum, who have untold access to arcane knowledge and other magical studies. And the Church, who are something of a bridge between the other two while furthering their own agenda. All three organizations are spearheaded by three Masters: unruly and cold men who are only concerned with the advancement of their own status and nothing else. They agreed to be in allegiance with Korax, in exchange for the dark gift of Unlife: supposed life after death, effectively immortality, granting them power beyond mere mortals. This world shattering shift in power had swept everyone under, and none knew the wiser, for they'd fallen under Korax's spell of trickery and guile. Or so it seemed. Three heroes had risen in these perilous times, each belonging to a branch of the Masters they once served. They would take everything they've learned and apply it, together or alone, in their simply understood yet incredibly dangerous quest: ridding the world of Korax.If you've read my Heretic review most of the basics apply here, it's a modified Doom engine with all manner of new behavior and features. Most of what was introduced in Heretic was carried over to Hexen, in addition to more: Scripting via ACS, which Hexen largely depends on to carry the journey along via its many ever-changing environments as you explore and complete objectives, usually by solving puzzles in order to progress and the occasional key or two. But ACS is also used for most basic functions, like doors that split open in the middle, breaking stained glass windows, and even a couple bosses depend on ACS in order to function properly. Hexen also isn't really a straight shooter this time around like Doom, but a pseudo-open world, pseudo-RPG FPS mix. The player can choose between three different character classes: Fighter, Cleric, and Mage, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. These ultimately decide what kind of weapons you'll be using, as each class has a different starting weapon, two additional weapons they'll find along the way, and three pieces of a fourth 'ultimate weapon' they must assemble over time before they use it to its full potential. Gone are individual magical ammo pickups for different weapons, Hexen uses Mana in two colors: blue and green. Starter weapons don't require any, the second one uses blue, the third need green, and the fourth demands both to operate. Levels are no longer sequential, you will visit several sub-levels within a main level known as the hub. Hexen has five hubs and each have a handful of sub-levels that must all be explored in order to solve problems in the hub itself. Once the requirements are met you can move onto the next, more difficult hub, and be closer to taking down Korax.The inventory system makes a return but unlike Heretic which took away any extra items you had (you could only transfer one of each to the next level) Hexen lets you keep them all. The Wings of Wrath however will not transfer to the next hub and are always placed at the end of a hub as sort of a novelty, using them to explore the hub at ease and look for anything you might've missed before leaving. As such they no longer expire after 30 seconds but they're largely useless this time around in the grand scheme of things. The Tome of Power sadly does not return in Hexen, but there's a plethora of new items that make up for its absence: the Flechette, a curious item that reacts differently depending on the class that uses it, for offensive purposes. The Disc of Repulsion that will shove enemies or their projectiles away from you when activated, good for defense and can be effective at cheesing some bosses (wink wink Traductus). Items like the hilarious Morph Ovum makes a spiritual return in the form of the Porkelator, transforming once proud legonnaires and powerful mages into lowly pigs! And the Krater of Might, which refills both Mana types to their maximum capacity.Environmental hazards are more than doubled this time around thanks to ACS, you can now be injured or outright killed when falling from a high place. Earthquakes, shifting glaciers, clouds of poisonous gas, wall mounted shooters, and falling bridges can lead you to your demise. The world of Hexen is a dangerous place and Korax's minions will ensure you know this quickly. The bestiary is more or less on par with Heretic's in terms of overall variety, but the monsters are generally more interesting in behavior and cooler to look at this time around. Unfortunately some of them can be very annoying for the less experienced players and their choice of class: Centaurs are hard to kill with projectiles, often deflecting them back at you, whereas Wendigos are extremely deadly without ranged attacks. Most monsters aren't too tough to bring down, and are less of a meat shield than they were in Heretic, but they still work pretty well together and most projectiles do some hefty damage. Spiritually returning enemies include the Gargoyle from Heretic, now the Afrit, and Ettins are replacements for the flesh Golem. Environment specific enemies are a new addition to the series and appear in the manner of ice locale dwelling Wendigos and swamp infesting Stalkers that can disappear and reappear just as quickly. There's a few bosses sprinkled throughout but I'm sad to say none of them are as challenging to fight as the ones in Heretic. More on criticisms in the moment.Visually and audibly the game is consistent with Heretic and mostly uses the same palette, with the lighter colors absent in favor of a darker looking game. If Heretic is typical medieval fantasy then Hexen is dark fantasy, it's a much more forboding looking game with a really evil atmosphere. The sounds are more meaty and punchy, the music sounds frightening and sometimes tragic in tone, the monsters look bigger and scarier, the deaths are more gory, and the environments are mostly in shades of grey and brown and capped off with a blood red or diseased yellow sky. Artwork is once again very detailed per pixel and small details are present everywhere, whether its leaves blowing in the wind or clouds scrolling in the sky. There's more ambient sound FX that bring environments to life than there was in Heretic too. All in all really cool stuff.My criticisms are with the sense of progression and the boss fights. Levels themselves aren't much more difficult than the ones in Heretic to traverse but the placement of switches (which serve largely as the 'puzzles' in Hexen) are often haphazard and it's not always clear what they do, leading to a lot of backtracking and confusion in navigation. As for the latter bosses like the Death Wyvern are completely defenseless when its not facing you, the Heresiarch can be very nastily exploited by spamming the Cleric's Flechette, and the Masters and Korax himself are massive pushovers with each classes' ultimate weapon. Especially the Cleric's Wraithverge, its borderline game-breaking with how much havoc it can wreak compared to the other classes' 4th weapons.Altogether Hexen is a vastly expanded (at least when compared to its predecessor) sequel and still good fun. It's not that much better or even that much worse compared to Heretic IMHO, as both do their own thing quite well. I recommend it, especially if you liked Heretic and want to see where Raven goes next.3.5/5			"

												This has to be one of my favorite games of all time. Yes, it can get monotonous at times, and yes, those are the only weapons you get for the whole game, but combining Heretic's inventory system with a pseudo-RPG class element and a borderline open world like something from The Witcher makes this a good experience for any fan of rougelikes or adventure games with a dash of simple puzzles thrown in. Like Heretic, I suggest you run this using GZDoom, as the battles can get pretty hectic, and trying to aim in Dosbox will make you pull your hair out.			"

												While it hasn't aged that well, it hasn't aged terribly either. All the core things that made this game interesting and fun to play are still there today. Interesting usable items, strange puzzles that can often lead you to an early grave, and vicious enemies waiting to club you to death, or burn your corpse to a crisp.There are three classes you can play in this game, and all have weaponry and stats unique to them. All of them offer a slightly different take on playing through the game, and after trying them all out for the first area or so, you'll quickly choose one as a favorite.Interesting level design, cool weapons and items, surpise enemy attacks, and fast game play keep this game going strong until the end. If you're looking for an alternative to Doom, or maybe even Quake this would be it. Especially since it has the whole fantasy genre twist to go with it, and a bit better level design and interactivity.If you can figure out how to get multiplayer going in this game, it is definitly worth it. There's nothing quite as nice as slaughtering tons of demons with a buddy, and having help figuring out puzzles and finding keys strewn through out the well designed levels. However don't expect to have an easy way to do it. All the methods I could find seemed some what difficult to attempt to set up a game, even with third party programs such as Hamachi, it's a bit difficult to figure it out, and get a game running with a friend. There's probably a guide somewhere out there that will assist you in this, if only playing with friends is a deal breaker for you.Pick this game up if you enjoy playing old school FPS shooters. This one might suprise you, and keep you playing to the end. If you've played it before, it's definitly worth having on here just to blast through a few levels every once in awhile. If you've never played the game before, give it a try, it's worth a spin if you never got to experience it before.Avoid the N64 Port AT ALL COSTS. It was terribad.			"

												Let's take a moment to travel back in time. Far, far back in time when a door opening horizontally in a Doom game was considered impressive. Seriously, in 1995 that was an excellent demonstration of the improved Doom engine. So was the fact that levels spanned multiple maps, and you could return to previous ones. Hole. Lee. ****.Ok, so, not so impressive these days. However, it is still a fun game. You choose from three different classes - your generic brawler, your clichéd wizard, and an in-between cleric. Each character has four different weapons and two different types of mana to power the weapons. Gameplay is very much like Doom, in that you are searching for the exit to a level, which you get by finding secrets and keys. While the plot (yes there is a plot, just not much of one) doesn't change at all based on your characters, the gameplay does. The brawler uses mostly melee weapons, while the wizard uses projectiles. The game is broken into five episodes, each of which contains several maps. You'll need to get through a bunch of locked gates by finding keys and magical items. There's a wide range of difficulty, both from your character class as well as a difficulty settings.While the game obviously isn't going to be offering anything new, it isn't just for people who played it 20 years ago. It's still a fun game with great atmosphere and some interesting puzzles. After downloading it, just make sure you get the ZDoom engine for it. It wasn't updated at all for the Steam release, so it looks really ugly out of the box. ZDoom increases the resolution to modern standards and adds a bunch of new features as well. "

												Remember Heretic? That DOOM clone? Apparently Raven didn't like their game to be called that way, because they did everything they could to differentiate their next game as much as possible from DOOM.What was originally intended to be a sequel, turned out to be something else... something... ...Beyond Heretic With a hub system, polyobjects and some other neat stuff, HeXen made another step forward for the FPS genre... and another step towards confusion, as you'll have to be constantly going between levels looking for keys or switches, with pretty much the only help being your memory.Another interesting addition are the three player classes:Fighter: A tank made out of flesh that takes down its enemies by brute force.Cleric: A guy who doesn't know what to be.Mage: A dude with cool and powerful spells, but with a laughable physical state.In closing, Buy it if you like the rest of FPS games from the 90's, but be warned, you will need patience, a lot of it.It's possible that you fall into frustration or even rage because you can't find the damn switch. Calm down. Take a deep breath and think what place haven't you explored completely, and if you don't remember, TOO BAD! Go and check the whole hub again! But don't worry! The Ettins will always respawn to keep you company :)			"

												HeXen: Beyond Heretic is basically the sequel to Heretic, and it is definitely Beyond Heretic with its freaking puzzles! Heretic had DOOM like puzzles (find the key to unlock a door), but HeXen has VERY confusing puzzles. When you do something involved with the puzzle the game will tell you ""one third of the puzzle has been solved"" (or ""one half"") and then you have no idea what to do next! Then when you solve the puzzle all the way you don't know what you did, or where you are supposed to go now! Plus, the levels are made of multiple levels. So to solve the puzzles you will need to travel back and forth between levels! But other than puzzles HeXen is actually a pretty good game (for 1995). Unlike Heretic that was just DOOM with new paint, HeXen is a new game with new mechanics. But I found the puzzles WAY to confusing. If you have a TON of patience then you might like this game, but if you don't then you may not.5/10			"

												""Greetings, mortal. Are you ready to die?!""Warning: This game is SCAAAARY, So we'll probably see a horrible Pewdiepie let's play of it soon. Nah, I don't think I can really call this game scary. It does though have a very complete and dense atmosphere, heavily saturated by its sound design and soundtrack. Atleast, that's how I remember it from when it was probably the pinnacle of my childhood. When I improvise a melody, the arrangement will usually be similar to the overall theme of Hexen's OST, infact.But I digress. I will actually warn you about this game, jokes aside. Through Steam, this game may be completely unplayable for you as it was for me. Wanting to dig up old roots, I found myself disappointed, as the controls were all wrong and broken. If the same will happen for you. I can't say.I've heard some call Hexen as shooter. This I feel is out of place, though granted there's ranged weaponry that could work in favor of that statement.The game plays as sort of an RPG in first person perspective. Where each level is a hub that has smaller levels or dungeons that have secrets, and you wander back and forth to open up new areas here and there. It all unfolds the hub area progressively til you have ""solved the puzzle"" and can move to next level.You choose between three characters. One strong in magic, one less o' that but resilient and punchy, and then the middleground.At times this can be very difficult, and one late boss fight always had a tendency to bug out, to much frustration.Strong aesthetic, and I owe this game thanks for many hours of mystery and great gameplay.It's truly been very inspiring to me, and while it's old it still deserves appreciation among newer games.Til next time.

												GET IT OR ILL FK YOU ....This game is from the good old times before the Obama reign of terror. If you don't like George W. Bush well this game is before him too.It has a spooky, lonely but heroic feel. It is hub based sexiness. Comes with great universe of great medieval feel, characters, and weapons and classic graphics and sound that will bring you back to the nostalgic sexiness of quality games. This game is based off the DOOM engine, so that explains the graphics basically. The game is part of a series which includes Heretic: Shadow of the serpent lords, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, Hexen: Deathkings of Dark Citidel (DLCish), and Hexen II. There is a bundle which is cheap as hell ($9.99) so get it for the most fun you will ever have across any platforms you have played on.			"

												Hey guys and gals!  So I just downloaded the amazing 90's classic Hexen and the whole series for what I thought was a reasonable $9.99.  Boy was I wrong!  It was obvious that no effort was put into syncing even one out of the five games I downloaded with their online software.  Every single one was unplayable.  They made a good choice using dosbox, its exactly what my friend would do, except it doesn't even work with their format.  I had to download dosbox on my own in order to run Hexen, and I can't even save my progress.   Oh, they offered me medievil chivalry free and comes with a monthly fee and that one ran great. go figure			"

												Set on another world besieged by another Serpent Rider, this game sees a complete change to the linear level progression and has hubs instead. Each hub has several levels branching off that you must journey too and solve puzzles that will allow passage to the next hub. Also, you have a choice of a warrior, cleric or mage as a class to fight as. Each one has speific strengths and weaknesses and each have their own weapons. The levels are interesting and different as you progress, though the colour scheme has much to be desired. Also, due to the age it can be rather cumbersome to play.			"

Pity it looks old as well. It runs well on the DOSbox emulator. Only problems are I cannot configure the keys to suit me, and when I accidentally hit the windows key (a real possibility given that both ALT and CTRL are important keys in the game) it has a tendency to crash or freeze.

												Filled with details and atmosphere, Hexen is one of the best Doom-like in my opinion. Less fast paced and action oriented than his id Software cousin but more exploration based. You'll have some pretty complicated puzzles to figure out so it might not be for everybody. (I suggest playing it with ZDoom so you can re-map keys and play it in the resolution you want.)			"

												Hexen is a great Co-op shooter. It is definitely a must try for any RPG, fantasy, or shooter fan. I enjoyed this game on the N64 and I am very glad to be able to enjoy it on Steam.The story of Hexen takes place after Heretic, the first game in a series of three about the Serpent Riders. The main character from Heretic defeated the first Serpent Rider (SPOILER IF YOU WANTED TO PLAY HERETIC) and now, in a different world, three heroes must fight through their world to defend it from the second Serpent Rider. It may be a cliche fantasy story, but it's cool that it spans three games.The gameplay, however, is far from cliche. Hexen is, if I am not mistaken, one of the first FPS games to combine puzzle-solving with the shooting that Doom incorporated. It works really well here! One gripe I do have though is that the level design is a little weird so you might get lost easily. There's also a class system that Hexen has. You can play as either a mage, a fighter, or a cleric. The only real difference between the classes is the weapons they use however. All these classes do have an ultimate weapon. To get the ultimate weapon, you have to get three pieces to the weapon that your class has.The mage is more of a long range character who starts with a magic staff, which can be used to shoot the bell in the tower in the first level, and the mage can also grab an ice spell, which can freeze enemies, and a lightning spell which can clear rooms in a matter of seconds. The trade-off is that he moves slower than the other classes. The ultimate weapon for the mage is a more enhanced version of the regular staff. Kind of a let down since the third weapon already does so much already.One of the other characters to choose from is the Fighter. He's the class that has a lot of CQC. The fighter starts out with spiked gauntlets. He can upgrade to an axe that shoots and also a hammer that can throw other hammers like it's Gauntlet! The fighter's ultimate weapon is a really sweet ranged sword that can throw fire at enemies.  Now these weapons have some low range, but the biggest strength of the Fighter is that he can run fast, so he can fight his enemies up-close and personal.The last class is the cleric, which is my personal favorite. He starts with a lame mace but then upgrades to an insane weapon right afterwards. After that, the cleric gains fire hands that can burn your opponents into piles of ash. Then comes the ultimate weapon. And the cleric really puts the ULTIMATE in ultimate weapon. It's a...thing...which fires ghosts that literally rip apart the enemies. Thought the mage's third weapon devastated enemies? This thing can clear rooms in mere ten seconds! But remember that this is pretty much the mix between the mage and the fighter, so it can move faster than the mage, but slower than the fighter. But that won't be a problem because this game has...CO-OP!! Yep! You and three friends, you can have more but I recommend three, can take down the enemies and hunt down the second serpent rider! I recommend Zandronum if you're going to play online though. It's the best port for online play. I also recommend the Wrath of Cronos mod. It will add some new RPG elements to the game and will add new reason to attack. If you were a fan of the N64's music, you can find a mod that will replace the music with the songs that were on the N64 version of the game.All in all, this game is great. It's a really good FPS with some puzzle elements that will have you going through the hub worlds on your quest to defeat the second Serpent Rider. Hexen is a great game and I totally recommend it, especially with a few friends on Co-Op play.			"

												Hexen, with all its flaws, is a very great game. The story is barely existant but you don't feel you need it anyways. Everything is, well, sprite images. But its not bad really because they are higher quality sprites. Good sprites in my opinion hold up better than primitive polygonal 3D objects. Also the puzzles are very obtuse and confusing, you will be visiting Doom wiki alot. The real caveat is to not play it in the Steam executable, just download the source port GZDoom or the like and start playing!Its a great game but its not for everyone. If you liked Heretic, you will proably like Hexen. If you like Doom 64, you will probably love Hexen. If you liked both of those games, yoou will absolutely cherish Hexen.			"

												Hexen: Beyond Heretic was a very surprising game for me. After finding out that, much like its predecessor, Heretic, Hexen ran on the old Doom engine, I expected a typical Doom-esque episodic campaign system. I was wrong and pleasantly surprised when I found out that the game differed noticeably from the other Doom engine games.You can choose from three different classes to play as, each with their own weapons and stats. The Fighter is obviously the most melee-based class, while the Mage's attacks are all ranged, and the Cleric is sort of the in-between guy.Unlike what I expected, the game's levels are open-ended (to an extent) hub world with several portals to different areas, giving a unique spin on the gameplay. The game has some parts where you have to solve some puzzles or find semi-hidden switches or interactable walls to advance or perhaps unlock something in another area of the current hub world. The game contains 5 large hubs with about 4-6 sub-areas per hub. I found myself getting stuck often because I would miss a switch somewhere and not be able to find it for a good while, forcing me to revisit every area to double-check every wall and corner for it.In Hexen, you only get 4 weapons throughout the adventure, your starting weapon, a weapon that uses blue mana, a weapon that uses green mana, and the ultimate weapon for that class that uses both blue and green mana upon use. Similar to Heretic, I found myself often having more mana and inventory items than I would have ever needed, but the game was still quite challenging on Skill 4.I definitely recommend this game. It has a bit of an RPG spin on the old Doom system, which is refreshing.			"

In the masterpieces from Id software, I always loved Doom but preferred Hexen. You love Doom likes and never tried Hexen? You HAVE to play that game. Amazing atmosphere, very dark and deep.

												""Greetings mortal. Are you ready to die.""-KoraxStoryKorax(the second Serpent Rider) has taken over the world of Cronos and has corrupted it's leaders. Now one of three heroes must go kill Korax and save the land. Once again I have nothing to say except that Korax actually insults you in every hub. I like that.GameplayThe game has three characters you can play as: the Cleric, the Mage and the Warrior.The Cleric starts out pretty bad with a weak weapon but soon gets some of the best weapons and the flask can really destroy groups if used right.The Mage is my favorite as he has good range with weapons and while I didn't like he's ultimate weapon, his other weapons can carry you.I didn't finish the Warrior as while he does have a good starter weapon, I knew I wasn't gotta have fun with cause I like range in my FPS.One of the unique gameplay features is that the game use a hub system. Every hub is divided into several levels and you have to go back and forth to pull switches and find keys. While I don't mind this as it encourages exploration, there's no way of no knowing what the switch did and you might have to be lucky in finding the level that has the next key or switch that you have to get and you might get lost.You have twelve weapons in the game, but each class has four. a starter that use no ammo, a blue and green weapon, I called that they use blue and green ammo and the ultimate weapon which can only be used when you find the three parts to it. The enemies, while simple, are varied and can be difficult if you don't know what you doing. Ex. you first fight with two headed goons that just wack you with club, but in the same level, you meet flying imps that rapidly fire fireballs, and these things tend to appear in groups. and these are the foes you start with.The inventory is still here with some old toys like the health potion and the one that turns enemies into animals(this time pigs.) and new ones like the flask which is a different bomb for each class and one toy that can summon a MAULOTAUR!!Also, there's jumping and some minor jumping parts.PresentationDon't care much about the music, it's just there. The art design and presentation however is great despite being dark and brown and grey. Each level has a different theme to it and you can tell where you are by knowing what design it is. In the first hub, each level portal is surrounded by the textures you see in the level, but when you see fire themes and textures in the ice level means there's a portal to the fire level nearby.This is both a minor and major point both there's a lot a little details added like destroying glass leaves some shards on the ground or when you overkill a grunt, his club will be laying somewhere away from the corpse. Heck, even the way some doors open is pretty cool for a DOOM engine game.VerdictI like this game and while I would personally give it an nine, the lack of direction holds it back so instead it's:7/10			"

												10/10, this game is quite awesome and makes you feel like a battlewarrior fighting through group of enemies alone. Especially in the beginning level where you use melee most of a time, bashing through enemies to the next level and then later earn weapons. The weapons in this game is quite challenging to obtain, but its quite the effort to get through. Rather than getting a weapon just at the beginning level like other games.The controls are classic, but you can modernize some controls and you can disable mouse movement.I had a hell of a time fighting through enemies and fighting bosses, it was quite a struggle even on highest difficulty.Important note, there are indeed glitches in this game and remember to get a backup save file if you dont want to end up being stuck in the level forever and end up having to start over.Other than that, i had a great time playing this. Classic games these days really know how to pull this off back then.Those who plays Heretic, will definitely enjoy this nonetheless and pretty much know what i'm talking about with the controls if you have experience it.With all that said, enjoy the game if you have thoughts of buying it and you wont regret it once you buy it. Just remember to search up google or search the Steam Community regards of the controls.Have fun!			"

												Hexen: Beyond Heretic should be called Hexen: Beyond COOL, AMIRITE?! Am I? Anyway, it's a confusingly named sequel to Heretic, but outdoes it in almost every way. I adore the class system, the character progression (which is pretty limited, but cool nonetheless) and the setting, but the icing on the cake is the co-op, which can still be played today with external Doom clients. Man it's rad. 5/5			"

												I played the hell out of this game when I first encountered it on N64, and on PC it's even better. I'd say the only real downsides are that it technically runs in a DOS emulator resolution wise it is lacking, and controls need tweaking. Overall a fun game and really set the bar high when it originally released.			"

												This is my Favorite game made in the Doom engine.The game controls like Doom, but the level disgn is much more complex with it no longer being get to the end of the level, but rather get to the end of this world, making progress through revisting the levels that remain opened with parts unlocking as you make progress in other levels. this causes my favorite part of the game. Exploration. You feel like an adventure, with puzzles that need to be solved remembering prior levels. the weapons feel rewarding, the monster offer enough challange to give them heed, but still being able to knock them out with the right thought. Items stock pile until a high stress sittuation ,where you ten potions keep you from dying with only 2 life left.Another positive is thatt you have 3 different classes to play from, making the game more open ended, and with each class having to fight and interect with the levels at different paces, the game feels fresh each time you play.only downside is the doom engine, being unable to jump limits to game greatly, and the potentail of the game is ultimately wieghed down by the the lack of control tkane from the Time the game was made.  saddly, you can't play the game with the DOSBox it comes with, it requires you to download GZDOOM to play it. fortnately, the game find the game qutomatically, so it's not a hassle to use.9/10Great level Designgood enemiesitems are Very useful and have a perfect amountPuzzle make you think with the whole world you're on in mindDoom engine wieghs game downRequires GZDOOM to play on windows 7+			"

												Though I originally played this for the N64 back in the day, the game has kept my attention all these years. Hexen (a continuation of the Herretic: Legend of the Serpent Riders) is an early first-person Action Fantasy. A good comparison is the Fantasy version of titles like Doom and Quake, with a storyline similar to the idea of Diablo. The multiplayer was also wicked fun on the console, though I'd love to see if the PC version supports a multiplayer just as good. There are 3 classes (Fighting, Magic(more ranged), and a ballance between the two), each with their own unique weapons and play types. If you're looking for a nostalgic pixilated First Person Fantasy, I highly recomend Hexen!			"

												Love this game! Brings back my childhood to play it again. Well worth the $5 at time of this review.Note that you will need to install the latest version of DosBox (free, just google it) on your PC and copy over dosbox.exe to the steam/steamapps/common/hexen/base folder and rename/delete the dosbox.exe that comes with the steam install. Then just rename/delete the hexen.conf file that's in ...hexen/base. Game runs as normal with no issues this way. I tried running the game as steam installs it but it would freeze w/ no sound and have loading issues before you even get to the menu screen.			"

												This game plays for me,But im useing windows 7 I believe, Though 1 thing to note idk why but whenever i close the game it messes up my screen, it like super zooms everything in and makes the desktop icons and everything else much much bigger.had this happen before and im pretty sure when i turn off this comp and turn it back on it will fix itself.Still all in all would recomend this game. UPDATE: I  found out i can change back the proper resolution in the control panel menu, and its very very easy.  would recommend this game even more so now.			"

												Hexen, with all its flaws, is a very great game. The story is barely existant but you don't feel you need it anyways. Everything is, well, sprite images. But its not bad really because they are higher quality sprites. Good sprites in my opinion hold up better than primitive polygonal 3D objects. Also the puzzles are very obtuse and confusing, you will be visiting Doom wiki alot. The real caveat is to not play it in the Steam executable, just download the source port GZDoom or the like and start playing!Its a great game but its not for everyone. If you liked Heretic, you will proably like Hexen. If you like Doom 64, you will probably love Hexen. If you liked both of those games, yoou will absolutely cherish Hexen.			"

												Improves on Heretic's ""Doom meets D&D"" formula, but you'd be wrong if you expected a rehash or new lipstick on an old hooker. Instead, Hexen adds a surprisingly challenging puzzle element, fittingly frustrating deathtraps (meet Dark Souls in 2D) and a non-linear hub system not that common in the FPS genre. Three classes to choose from, offering choices for whether you're the glass cannon type who nukes from afar (Mage), the melee-oriented powerhouse who charges in and wrecks sh|t (Fighter) or the middle-of-the-road dilettante with self-healing options for the defensive-minded (Cleric). As a fantasy/RPG fan first and foremost who prefers to slaughter things with battleaxes rather than boomsticks, I cannot give high enough praise to what I personally consider the most enjoyable FPS I've ever played. 360 noscope can suck it.

												This game is a classic, all around. Think of it as Doom, but with intense fantasy elements, mages, witches, more demons and unforgivable puzzles. Don't forget better level design. Took a couple of searchs on the internet and toying around with it to work on my computer but was definitely worth it. My only complaint on this game is that the controls are a tad outdated and uncomfortable. The best version of this game however, is on the emulator (Project64, N64 emulator) Edit your controls to your desire, bring a friend over and plow through the game as it has four player local co-op!P.S: If you are having difficulty running this on a modern computer (for ex. game freezing, won't start and crashes. Go to the Steam folder and then to steamapps\common\Hexen\base. Open hexen.conf with notepad or another editor. Edit fulldouble=true to fulldouble=false. Save and start the game again. You can also modify your screen size and make it comfortable to play. Have fun!			"

												This is a dark magic styled doom clone and sequel to Heretic. It is even harder then Heretic to navigate and is more complicated then Heretic. The art style is still fantastic. 7.5/10 is good for the even more niche (than Heretic) target audience everyone else should run.			"

												Yes, that is one of the best Doom like (yes, in our times we used to say Doom like) of that time, it creeped me out and excited me on my chair when I was a teenager, when it came out, now it just excites me when I make a ride up to the end once every X years. In the masterpieces from Id software, I always loved Doom but preferred Hexen. You love Doom likes and never tried Hexen? You HAVE to play that game. Amazing atmosphere, very dark and deep. I do not think I would recommend to young and/or not open minded players, but for others, I do.			"
