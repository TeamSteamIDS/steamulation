												What once was a very impressive little title has now turned into one of the biggest franchises for Square Enix and a Cult Favorite among the fans, so let's see how it all began shall we ?In Just Cause we play as Rico Rodriguez. He is an agent sent in to the island San Esperito. Our mission is to kill a dictator Mendoza and free the island from his reign.Back when this game came out I found it quite impressive. The Island is massive, but it doesn't matter cause there is nothing to see there. All of it is just a big jungle which all of it looks the same. There are small villages which act as outposts and you can clear them out.  The city is uninspiring and there's nothing to do there.The gameplay is by far the weakest third person shooter I have ever seen. The shooting feels clunky and sometimes my shots don't even connect with the enemies, not to mention most guns are weak as hell, and the better weapons have low ammo counts.The graphics (apart from the CGI cut scenes) are still great. The lush island is awesome and getting a boat and going through the rivers is really fun, but as stated before there's nothing to see, but it's still fun. The driving controls are some of the worst driving controls I have ever seen, they even top the driving controls in Watch Dogs. Since unlike in Just Cause 2 you can't travel with the grappling hook, so most of the time you will need to use vehicles.The game also has side quests, but most of them are boring as hell and you can grind them since they never end. So if you want something more with the game after you're done you can do the mundane side quests.The game took me 6 hours to finish, once the game is finished you can explore the island, but as stated before there's nothing to do there.The game also has a major spike in difficulty in the final missions, so be prepared to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Overall even though the game didn't age well, it's still fun to play for a bit, but it's the weakest in the series. In the end I will give this a positive review, but I still suggest playing Just Cause 2 instead.Final Rating:6/10 - OkayIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Before you buy, consider..- Limited resolution supportGame displays optional resolutions as low as 640x480 to 1600x1200, but only 1280x1024 is the max, selectable resolution for the game. And editing config files won't do crap for you.To get your game to run in your monitor's native resolution, you're gonna need one of two versions of this program called res changer..http://steamcommunity.com/app/6880/discussions/0/846959520923192823/http://steamcommunity.com/app/6880/discussions/0/594821545181783362/Version 1 or 2. Try 2 because it's newer. If it doesn't work, 1 might. 2 didn't work for me, so I had to use 1. Only drawback to having to use 1 is that it has no support for windowed mode like 2. And that alt-tabbing with 1 crashes your game. But, hey, it works. And I almost refunded my game. Looked awful downscaled. Game may be old, but still should have had more resolution support.- Very few graphics settings.You're gonna need to force AA, AF, etc on from your video driver control panel. Everything in menu only affects quality of textures, shadows, and post-processing FX.Overall, the game is a good game. I have less than an hour on it over Steam, but I speak from experience from having played it on console years ago.			"

												A terrible, clunky mess of a game. And I enjoyed every secnond. Definitely play this before the second one, or it becomes unplayable.But I can't remember the last time I laughed this hard. Whether it was at the broken AI who often charge bravely into the sea in their police cars, to the random ambient voices that seem to come from nowhere ( driving at 90 mph and all alone with no heat level, you can still hear guards shouting ""Stop right there, citizen!"" at the oppressed masses as if they are in your car shouting it in your ear) to the ridiculous combat (the body count will be in the thousands by the end) to the completely schizophrenic story, Just Cause 1 was an unforgettable experience. The second game was great, but it didn't make me laugh nearly as much as the first.			"

												Just Cause felt like a GTA game in the nature wich is quite fun. But...The storyline wasn't that good, it was really short (only 21 story missions) and nothing like a good storyline.I also came along soem bugs, not that many, but they were there.The missions weren't that great either. The first ones were fine but they were -pretty much- all the same throughout the story.The graphics were ok for a game from that time, it looked a little bit like GTA Liberty City.And now you are probably wondering why I gave this review recommend? It's because I like explosions, and this game has a lot of explosions... Exept for the last mission wich I didn't understand (but that might just be me) and I got shot at by around 2 million tanks. But then again I really enjoyed it! So, concluding to this review, I would recommend this game to people who like explsions, action, explosions and a freaking large map.This was my first review and I hope you enjoyed it :) "

												I don't know if I should recommend this game or not.Let me start with this, I love old games in general, some games were bad though, even back then.This one, it was good, before Just Cause 2 came.It's the case of ""it aged badly"".It's not bad, it's really good but Just Cause 2 does it better, it does everything better.Or almost all of it.A reason to buy this? Well, I'd say, different map, collection, or you are a Just Cause hard fan.So it is not bad, it's just that Just Cause 2 is worth so much more in every aspects.There are flaws in Just Cause 2, such as the driving, but they're worse in this one.8/10 before Just Cause 2 came out.6/10 now that we have Just Cause 2 and Just Cause 3.Still worth the buy In my opinion, but you'll probably be spending more time in Just Cause 2.Similar games like this: Mercenaries series, and Red Faction: Guerilla.

												It's a fairly decent open world game, but it has quite a bit of frustrating and unforgiving parts, especially near the end.

												Pros: As GTA3 clones go, adding extreme sports and OTT stunts is one of the ideas that make it worthwhile, introducing things that you find yourself wishing were in GTA3. Tremendous freedom, with multiple approaches to two thirds of the main missions(parachute in, burst through the front, sneak in, etc.). If you're in a vehicle moving fast, or you make a vertical jump of about a dozen meters or more, you can engage your parachute, from where you can comfortably shoot or grapple to any vehicle. Shooting is like a proper third person shooter, not like GTA3 and Vice City. Vehicles include cars, motorcycles, boats, helicopters and planes, all of these types can come armed with machineguns and/or rockets, and all of them useful: sail, since you're in an island paradise, and going across water may be the shortest distance between two points; helicopter flight is easily the most flexible way to travel, because of mountains and sea; and planes are by far the fastest way to travel far. Control is great, no matter what you travel by. Fairly challenging. Limits on ammo and weapon carry capacity(two pistols, two types of C4, and another two guns - choose carefully between SMGs, assault and sniper rifles, RPGs and a grenade launcher) ensure that you are careful in shootouts. A fun arcade game.Cons: Very clearly rushed, with glitches and bugs. Nothing to do once you've completed the short story and liberated all enemy zones and/or completed a certain number of the uninspired, crushingly inconsequential and repetitive side-missions. Characters are bland, and there's little to the story, meaning there's almost no ""meat"" to what's going on(the fun stuff is all in the game-play). Over half of the large island nation is forest and sea. Too many story missions are samey.My recommendation: If you can live with its rather rough edges, this is among the most fun open-world games.			"

												I don't understand some people here. Why are you saying JC1 is bad because JC2 is better? We are rating JC1 now - it was the first part of the series, so let's not talk  about second, ok?This game is just awesome. Nice graphics for 2006 (LOOK AT THIS WATER), works stable and has great soundtrack. The gameplay isn't linear, you can do whatever you want, and main quests are all different. Buy this if you like GTA series or action games.I would give it 8/10, it's a great game for this price. "

												Just Cause 2's predecessor. You explore San Esperito, but without the ease of travel of Just Cause 2, an empty world is a much larger problem. The game also feels clunkier, and the missions are insanely repetitive. In addition, it doesn't look good at all compared to modern standards. Cars are also ridiculously overpowered, often killing you in 1-2 hits. It's a fun game, but I wouldn't pay full price.			"

												Get Just Cause 2 instead. It's basically the same game, except actually finished. This one only has inklings of ideas which were never developed, and simply has no polish whatsoever. For example, take the settlement takeover missions, which are a cool idea and which you'll probably be doing a lot. ""Missions"" might be too generous. There's basically only one (shoot enemies, destroy roadblock #1, shoot enemies, destroy roadblock #2, shoot enemies, destroy roadblock #3, rush to flag / kill a specific enemy - the only difference you can spot between them is that when taking over cities you don't have to destroy roablocks), which you will be doing over and over and over and over again. Do you at least get something cool for your troubles? Nope, just a new save point and a color of some pixels flipping on the map. Or take the combat, which you'll be doing a lot of. The game has only two levels of enemy threat. ""Light drizzle"" if they are using bullets, ""instagib"" if they're using explosives. For your own part, you'll have tiny, hard to see crosshairs (if you play at any real resolution)... or extremely intrusive autoaim which kicks in while you're manning vehicle weapons (which are another cool idea on their own) and which will actually very often prevent you from shooting what you want to shoot (say, the barricade rather than all the random soldiers all over the place). Or take the grappling hook, which is an amazingly fun tool in JC2, and which is an unreliable and unwieldy piece of crap in this game. The whole thing is just extremely rushed and upolished.Again, just get JC2 instead. I can assure you, you will not miss out on anything by skipping JC1.			"

												I can safely give this game the ""Meh"" Seal of Semi-Approval.--Just Cause is a series about blowing s$#@ up and having fun, and it all started right with this unpolished world of cross-gen mediocrity.  Yet, everything wrong with this game somehow works in its favor.  It's fairly easy to get lost in the world and start collecting things only to be interrupted by military forces, in which the surprisingly excellent gunplay grants you access to their car and a massive chase sequence that usually involves hilariously bad AI, being absolutely swarmed by enemy vehicles, and lots of stunt jumping.  The missions are solid, the voice acting is cringeworthy, and overall the game is somewhat enjoyable as a budget title.The biggest flaw, however, is its lack of polish and special mechanics.  My problem with this game is that I can't help but compare it to its legendary successor, Just Cause 2.  I know the hardware was limited and they really did make the most of Xbox/PS2 hardware, but it doesn't change the fact that after so many hours of JC2, the upgrades from game to sequel definitely hurt in trying to go back.If you have a crappy computer, want some time to kill, or just want to see where this series began, there's a fair chance you might get your moneys' worth here.  On any half-decent computer, however, I'd recommend skipping straight to its sequel.  JC2 is a damn near perfect game, and there's a reason it outshines its predecessor.			"

												This review is for the game ''Just Cause'',an open world third-person shooter video game,developed by the video game company Avalanche Studios.The game was published by Eidos Interactive and released in Semptember 22 on 2006(in Europe).The game can be run through Microsoft Windows,Playstation 2,Xbox and Xbox 360.The game uses the Avalanche Engine with Havok physics.Genre(s):Action-AdventureMode(s):Single-playerDistribution:Optical Disc,downloadPlotYou take control of Rico Rodriguez,an agent for an unkown organization called the Agency,who is being dropped to a tropical island(called San Esperito)by the order of the commandingofficer Tom Sheldon in order to help overthrow San Esperito's dictator,Salvador Mendoza,whom the Agency thinks to be in possession of nuclear weaponry.Soon after your arrival you rendezvouses with Tom Sheldon and his partner Maria Kane who allythemselves(as well as you) with a Guerrilla group starting a rebellion against the dictator andthe Rioja drug cartel(even though they are enemies with the government).Eventually Rico will have to facethe corrupt officials(Black Hand mercenaries)  and the Montano cartel(Rioja's drug cartel enemy).Lastly,Tom Sheldon discovers that Mendoza has in fact nuclear weapons and with San Esperito politically unstable the president is forced to retreat to his private island.He makes a last attempt to escape after he is being discovered by Rico but the agent risks his life and gets into a flying plane after a ridiculous stunt,kills the Black Hand officials and destroys the President once and for all.GameplayThe game incorporates basic third-person shooter elements in a huge driving open world environment to interact in.You are capable of walking,swimming,jumping and use a wide variety of vehicles including:cars,boats,aircrafts andmotorcycles.Rico can also perform stunds,choose when to open his parachute(of course while in air) and use the exceptionally useful Protec Grappler G3 which is a high-powered magnet harpoon device and can stick to metalsurfaces.That allows Rico to engage in a wide variety of stuntsand immobilize vehicles as well as many other things.RecapI find this game awfully boring and repetitive.Story missions are dull and uninspiring.Side missions given by the Riojadrug cartel are even worse.The graphics are exceptionally bad even for a 2006 game.And to make things worsebugs and glitches swarm about the game making it almost unplayable.Settlement liberations not challenging and alike(Kill some soldiers,destroy the roadblocks,repeat again 2 times and the capture the flag).Cliche catchphrases are pretty lame too.Q:If that's the case why bother buying or even playing the game?A:That is the video game developer's first attempt into the gaming industry.Of course there would be some mistakes.You should also take into account that it was rushed to the market for unkown reasons at least to me.Personally I played the game and completely finished it before getting to play Just Cause 2 which was released four years later.I recommend this game only if you are a completionist like me and want to explore everything that involves a gamingseries like the Just Cause series.P.S Support the developers!

												Just Cause is a decent sandbox game with some fun yet not very polished gameplay mechanics. It was released in 2006 and I remember lending it back then and having some fun with it, but in all honesty: it hasn't aged very well. Avalanche improved the sequel greatly, so you're better off buying Just Cause 2.Oh, and if you're wondering why I own it on Steam: I bought it with Playfire credit for nostalgia reasons. x)			"

												Just Cause is a cool open world game set in the fictional country of San Esperito. The story is like what you'd expect from an action movie: you play as a secret agent working to overthrow the dictatorship of Salvador Mendoza, and there's tons of explosions and stuff in the process.As far as gameplay goes, well, it's mostly fun, but there are several problems in my opinion, one of the most important ones being the driving. Driving anything in this game is pretty much impossible, as you'll soon find your vehicle going everywhere except where you want it to go. On the other hand, flying seems to be a pretty good way of getting around, as helicopters are pretty easy to use, and you can jump out of them and use a parachute to land safely. You also have a grappling hook, but using it is somewhat difficult.Besides the main story, the game also offers a few types of sidemissions, including races, side quests, and liberation missions, and there's two factions which you help during the course of the game, the Guerrila, opposed to Mendoza's government, and the Rioja Cartel, which supports the Guerrilla. Races are pretty straightforward, you only have to reach the checkpoints before the time ends; what's interesting is that you can use practically any vehicle, so if you're having difficulty with one, you can just grab a helicopter and fly around the track. Liberation missions are divided into Guerrilla missions and Rioja missions, and they consist of fighting against the government troops (in the case of the Guerrilla) or the Montano Cartel (in the case of the Rioja) in order to liberate a settlement. They all play out the same, however, with you having to kill a certain number of enemies before the next objective becomes available. As for sidequests, once again, both the Guerrilla and the Rioja offer them, but they're really repetitive, and the faction relation system is somewhat unbalanced, as it requires a lot of points, and most missions only give you 30 points.The game world is huge, with tons of towns, cities, and small villages, and plenty of jungles (maybe too many jungles) here and there. Even though there's not lots of things to see, as it gets somewhat repetitive, it's still nice to simply grab a helicopter and fly around, seeing the island below you, while the Sun sets on the horizon.The soundtrack is pretty good, adding a lot to the atmosphere during those high speed chases. As for the dialogue, well, not so much. I wouldn't say it's outright bad, but there's a few details here and there when it comes to characters speaking in Spanish.Even then, with all its flaws (including some funny glitches here and there, and a huge difficulty spike in the last story missions), I'd say Just Cause is a pretty fun game, so I can recommend it.

												This game is a buggy, unpolished, and sometimes downright boring abomination. And I love it for that.You'll get to experience a laughably primitive version of the Havok physics engine. Hell, it can't even handle a tank's turret turning without sending the tank spinning into the upper stratosphere, and other vehicles have a tendency to go flying for no apparent reason. (Looking at you, monster truck)Enemies spawn in at complete random, more often than not have I been cut off during a car chase because an enemy car materialised right in front of me. I don't know why this is a thing, but hey, more mooks to kill, amirite?Rocket launchers aren't unlocked early, I got the first one after almost 7 hours of playtime. The ammo count is pathetic and sometimes they refuse to lock onto enemies. This is a game where tanks are scary, beyond scary, actually. Because they deal a lot of damage, soak a lot of damage, and sometimes they enter hyperspace and chop your head of with a turbocharged swivel of their turret. Expect to engage in vehicular combat more than infantry vs tank combat, because your AT options will be limited at best. On the other hands, rocket-armed vehicles can decimate anything in sight in style.The story is as deranged as it gets, nothing makes any sense and I've yet to figure out what the hell is going on. On the other hand, it provides some of the silliest and most enjoyable cutscenes I've ever seen in a videogame. Expect PS1-tier facial animations. (only in cutscenes, there are no facial animations in-game)However, this game still succeeds with something, and that's providing those unscripted action-movie moments. Just as an example, here are two highlights from some of my boat shenanigans: http://plays.tv/s/Kr8ZOcCJLREWYes, it is primitive. Yes, it is buggy. Yes, it is unpolished. Yes, it is repetitive. However, if you're willing to try different things, this game allows you to create more fun for yourself. There are different ways to attack bases, you don't have to bring an attack helicopter every time, and it can be fun to get involved in a massive car chase with helis and explosions just for the hell of it.Do you want to blow things up and can come up with many ways to do it? Can you deal with wonky physics and dated gameplay? If so, this game might be something for you. I'd not pick it up outside of a sale though.			"

												I really am enjoying this game, I still haven't finished the main story but I'm having fun with it, but I'm not saying the game doesn't have any flaws, here are the pro's and con's of this game in my opinion:PRO's:-Open world game-Non linear (you can play the story and explore the island without having to quit)-Wide map-Side missions and objects to collect-Wide array of weapons and vehicules-Great graphics for 2006CON's:-It may have a wide map but sometimes at some areas it feels too empty-You can't have a personal garage with all your favorite vehicules and cuztomize them (there is a garage but its only 1 per camp and you can't repeir or cuztomize the vehicule)-Side missions are a bit repetitive-Its a bit hard to get around the island-No Multiplayer!Overall this is a good game, the graphics are very nice for the time and even today. Sometimes when exploring the island you can get stuck in some areas and at some moments of the game it felt like a desert, like no NPC's until the next gas station or village. Also the grapplin mechanic is a bit hard to get used to and this game NEEDS multiplayer. But overall I've had tons of fun exploring the  island, flying planes and parachuting around, I would defenitly recommend this game to anybody looking for a large open world with good graphics that doesnt need a beats PC to run.

Sadly my opinion of it has not improved this time around.The game basically consists of a giant and mostly empty island with some (very) repetitive missions/stronghold takeovers. Not horrible looking for its age but nothing else is worth noting.Just Cause is one of the few series in which I'd recommend not only playing them out of release order but just skipping the first one outright. Even ignoring the sequel you might as well not bother with something so bland. Indeed I actually played this game first so it isn't just a case of a superior sequel outshining the previous game: JC1 is boring judged even on its own merits alone.			"

												This game won't keep you entertained for too long, but if you have any interest at all in gaming history this is probably a must-play. You can trace a lot of elements of modern games back to this particular title, both good and negative ones.On the other hand, I personally just played it because I feel a compulsive need to start with the first game of any franchise, and I think Just Cause 3 looks like a lot of fun, so 1 and 2 have to get ticked off the list.What does the game do right?- Humor so bad it's good.- Dialogue so bad it's good.- Gun play that is fairly satisfying and fun.What does the game to wrong?- Visually it's very bland. By that I mean that the graphics are as you'd expect from a 2006 title, perhaps even a little sub-par, but all throughout the game you see the same assets, the same jungle, the same tiny villages over and over again. - The gameplay is extremely repetitive, and if you're just playing this to get it off your bucket list and be able to at least claim you've done it, then there's no reason to go clear out all the outposts. When it comes to pointless sidequests and activities to keep you playing, this game makes Far Cry 4 look reasonable.I will recommend this game purely on the basis that it's two evenings of cheesy fun that can be bought for a it of loose change on sale.

												The fall of El PresidenteWell, a week ago i bought Just Cause 3, but i'm one of those who appreciate the storyline and characters, so i decided to buy on steam the first and second game, and i must say that i finished the game quite impressed.I read a few reviews before playing the game and i thought that i was going to find something worse. Yeah, the game has its bugs, for ex, i found myself inside a truck... on my motorbike, and also the clumsy gameplay when driving a vehicle.But even though it's 5 years older than GTA III and 2 older than Far Cry, it's a sort of mix of both with a good variety of vehicles, guns and missions (mostly the main ones, the side missions are kinda repetitive).The grappling hook is a great accessory, which is really hard to dominate (but if you do, it'll make the game a lot easier), like the game itself... this is one of the points that i like the most, its difficulty, i died over and over in several missions, a real challenge, and that's a ""thing"" that has lost in time.Like an argentinian guy, i saw Rico as an latin american Ethan Hunt, where he faces a whole army in different situations to get to the head: El Presidente Mendoza. Your ""team"" is Tom Sheldon and Maria Kane, just to let you know... they don't like to get their hands dirty, so you have plenty work to do...My score for this game is a solid 7/10			"

												You will get this in the JC2 DLC bundle. And you will be pleasantly surprised if you try it. Because, even though it predates the physics-defying grandeur of JC2, the original JC is less of an action adventure title and more of an absolutely crazy open-world third person shooter. As its specs are floored, it runs on anything made after 2007, and the mouse input is not to be sniffed at, neither is the gunplay. While it doesn't have controller support or native support for non-4:3 resolutions it is nonetheless a solid shootbang title for when the grandeur of Panau is a bit too much.Plus the main character looks like my cousin when he was about my age, minus a few years.

												The game was ambitious for its time but it has too many problems and most of it has to do with gameplay. It tries to have Rico Rodrguiz topple a dictator by unleashing chaos, but it plays too much like a generic open world title of its era.Unlike its sucessors, this game dons't function right while its too clutered in the mechanics for the player to actually function. The parachute and grappling hook combo are not that polished. Also if you played Just Cause 2, then playing this would be a step back in terms of quality. If you havn't played Just Cuae 2, it fixes all the problems this game had. Overall this would be a big pass. If your curious, still don't bother as it will make you wonder how was this even a game.

												This is THE Just Cause Game and I've played Just Cause since the beginning. This game brings me back memories when I used to play this all the time on my PS2. Good times. But yes, if you guys want to know the beginning (or should I say the dawn of Just Cause), start with this. I believe, in some ways, Just Cause 1 is way better than Just Cause 2 AND 3. But then again, it is my opinion, but yes. Start off with Just Cause 1, because I guarantee you that this game will not disappoint you, fellow gamers. Do not be turned off because of the graphics, give the government a Just Cause....			"

 Just Cause 1: A cause for celebration  Just Cause 1  was undoubtedly one of the best foundations for a succesful storyline, trilogy to be precise. It gave a simple development of the Agency characters which is then later advanced in future games, which was a very good judgement on The Studio's behalf. However, in JC3,  the whole concept of The Agency is abandoned, since Rico is dropped off at his supposed home nation and joins forces with the local Guerilla fighters, but we will talk about his nationality later on.  The Gang System I really did enjoy the gang aspect of the Just Cause Franchise, JC2 had a good selection, but  it was only limited to gangs vs government rather than the Gang vs Gang aspect, which was unfortunately missed out and undeveloped - Razak says that ""If you cross me, I will kill you"" or something like that, surely if you were driving a Roaches car into the Ular Boys Stronghold, it would say ""Your cover was blown"", geez, I should have written more in the JC2 review now that I think about it...  I loved the fact that in JC1, conflicting Gangs like the Riojas and The Montanos would start to fight in the streets because they saw each other, but the uncalledfor attacks by the other gangs when you are driving a school bus at 30mph are not really helpful... The AI The Gang AI is quite clever, they kind of adapt to your actions, but nothing like MGSV:TPP, when they overdo that AI aspect slightly too much. The Government forces are quite odd because you can hear them shouting  ""Stop right there, Citizen!""  when, yet again, you are going 30mph in a school bus! In effect, the AI could have been more well done.  The graphics Since this is a Just Cause title, you would expect the graphics to outperform any other competing game in the market at that time. And so it did. The graphics were absolutely insane - the sunsets can be absolutely phenomenal and the sea, oh wow! Summing up, JC titles will always grab that no.1 spot for ""the insane graphics award"". The physics This is where JC1 kind of fell down. The driving did not feel as realistic as it should be, but that mistake was rectified in JC2. The grapple gun was a weak invention, but deep down, the main motif in the JC saga is the evolution of the grappling device, and that is supposed to sybolise some deep s**t. The soundtrack The best part of JC1 is, by far, the soundtrack. I always loved, and still love, listening to the Hispanic Music everytime you completed a mission, however, the music does get a little excessive when you get in a helicopter and, this is an XBOX 360 example, press RT on the controller, suddenly some inspiring music starts to play and you end up crashign down to the ground because it caught you off guard. Yep, That's JC1 for you. But in JC2, that mistake was rectified  so that the music doesn't bombard you every second, actually, it is quite a rarity to encounter music during a playthrough, it only happens when you float through the air with your parachute deployed for 10 minutes or so.  To conclude for this section, I would say that the soundtrack was well composed, but the timing could have been an improvement. The messup. --This whole section is about the storyline of JC and its routes, if you do not wish to read this, please disregard and head straight to conclusions--  (It is marked as a spoiler) So as you may recall, I spoke about Rico Rodriguez's identity in one of the previous sections - I say that ""he is dropped off at his  HOME COUNTRY  - which is supposed to be Medici, surely - it is NOT Medici! It was stated that apparently, Rico is from San Espirito, but that is entirely debatable since JC is not know to be a ""Story Rich"" franchise. Maybe the producers decided to rename San Espirito and make it better, which explains the Provincial settings which requires a liberation aspect, which has been omnipresent since JC1. I'm not sure if it is stated in JC2's PDA information for Rico, but I am pretty sure it says that his birthplace is San Espirito, or maybe it says -unknown-. But really, to make a whole new Hispanic or Italian island defeats the purpose of the real place -  SAN ESPIRITO .  Conclusions From my experiences with this game, I can say that it is really enjoyable and is a great introduction to the JC franchise, but really, buying JC3 due to the graphical upgrade really undermines the real purpose of the Grapple Hook evolution theory shown in the franchise, as modern players will seek out a pretty game - they will never share the experience that you will have when people ask you, remember that mission when you  Burnt an entire weed field?  - that person who bought JC3 will say, what mission, I only liberate provinces in JC3. You look at them and say, wow, this is the true definition of an idiot. Trust me, it feels so good when you find an idiot like that IRL (Shoutout to my 'end franchise joiners' out there!)Thank you all for reading this mini essay - enjoy your time on JC1!			"

												3 Days before this went on midweek madness, i bought it for the ps2 from gamestop, in my original version of this review, i touched lightly on the PS2 version, and nothing about the PC version, or why i hate the helicopters so much.Let's start by saying this: the music is great. Not much else about the music though.The gameplay? it's kind of good. being an old game the gameplay is short though, but that's okay, you can just challenge yourself to get 100%, and it's actually possible here, unlike it's sequel.So, why is it that i hate enemy helicopters so much? I'll tell you in detail.First, 2 enemy copters spawn, and spam machine gun fire at you, you must think that you should get a car to outrun the fire, NOPE! while getting in the car they decide to spam missles suddenly. 8 times out of 10 killing you. Sure, you get a grappling hook, but it's not the mystical death hookshot it is in JC2, this one lets you... PARAGLIDE BEHIND CARS! MAKING IT WORTHLESS ON HELICOPTERS!Sure, you can shoot them down with a rocket lancher, but they'll most likely just spawn in 2 more.Other than that, it's an alright game, 6.5/10			"

												Just Cause is a fairly fun game, but you can tell that it is pretty old. It's much harder than Just Cause 2, which is harder than Just Cause 3, in my opinion. If you're looking for a cheap alternative to Just Cause 3, I would recommend Just Cause 2 because they are more similar, but if you just want to play the whole series to get the whole story you should get this game. It's priced reasonably and will keep you occupied for a while.			"

												Remember this coming out in 2006 and just after playing it after a gap of 9 years. It has aged no doubt, but its still a good fun simple open world game and a fun cheesey storyline. This was one of the first true open world games after Grand theft auto so it definitley broke new ground when it was released. San Esperito is a beautiful place and it still looks good even in the dated graphics, only thing is the islands are devoid of anything really to do other than take towns and villages for the rebels. The battles in the game can be quite fun surprisingly even with respawning enemies and army vehicles flying about the place out of control. The main battle at the end of the game to take the presidential island is a mammoth one and goes on for 45 mins or more. All of the Main Storyline missions are fun and simple. I played this game to relive a bit of nostalgia from my younger days and it still holds up in a fun way with a main story not to be taken seriousily or much concentration needed. Its a recommendation in my book.			"

												I haven't played it for an hour yet and I've already: Place cars as a roadblock for the mv in the first mission, had an epic car chase, murdered everybody in a prison (until I realised they were respawning), swam away from 3 military ships by exploiting the lack of drowning, and climbed up a mountain after killing the entire police force of San Esperito by luring them off a cliff into the ocean.

I would say the only problem that I have with the game is that the Cut sceens and the audio are not synced at all!  It is so bad at times, it is like watching a delayed bad 1980's Chineese martial arts movie that is poorly englished dubbed.

												If you ever get bored of Just Cause 2 (because let's face it, everyone plays that heaps more and no-one gives a crap about this game) this is actually a decent game to start playing. You'll laugh at differences in Tom Sheldon's voice and probably cry at the fact that you still don't have a grappling hook after the first mission. Oh, and instead of stronghold takeovers, you get to team up with 2 factions (2 WHOLE FACTIONS!) to ""liberate"" a village. It's pretty fun blowing up roadblocks. You're on the fun team in the liberation by the way, you get to play capture the flag! The cops have to settle for capture the frags...Overall, I'd say this is a solid game which, while released in '06, still holds up well today for a Just Cause 2 fan. "

												This game is a classic.Now, saying it's a classic has both good and bad connotations. So I'll break it down like MC Hammer for you:The Good:-Explosions-Mayhem-Great music-Flipping out of a car only to use a parachute in epic win-All collectibles are on the map and easy to find-Hydroplane with missilesThe Bad:-Memory leaks-Sound travels a thousand times farther than in reality, so you're always looking for that one guy or helicopter-Vehicle drops can bounce and land in out of reach places-Explosive splash damage range is nowhere near what it looks like-You're made of paper-Your vehicles are made of paper-Health pickups are too rare-Enemies spawn infinitely, often behind you-Story doesn't matter and is about as coherent as Sarah Palin-Menu system is utter ballsOverall, it's a great game to try out and enjoy for a while, but don't bother playing it for completion's sake if it starts getting boring. Play it for a bit until you stop having fun, then uninstall and move on to Just Cause 2 and 3.			"

												Inspired by free-roaming action games such as Grand Theft Auto and Far Cry, Just Cause drops you (literally, out of an aeroplane) onto a tropical island that's in need of a little regime change.With silent backing from the CIA, your character Rico has gadgets, guns and an endless supply of disposable vehicles with which to wreak havoc.Rico also has the infinite use of a parachute that pops out and packs itself away in the blink of an eye. All you need do is find a lofty point from which to leap and you can drift over villages, motorways and wide channels of water.Fire your grappling gun and Rico will hook onto passing cars or helicopters for a little paragliding - handy when you need an altitude advantage over your opponents or want to catch up on a crook.However, even with this unique mode of transport, getting around is a slow and sometimes tedious affair. Reaching each new mission marker can sometimes mean at least five minutes of travel time.As with GTA, the action here involves hectic car chases, shootouts with the corrupt local officials and various seek-and-destroy missions in which you can enjoy the spectacle of big things blowing up. Typically, the player can hijack cars, bikes, boats and even helicopters, as well as kill time on various side missions that involve collecting hidden packages or performing hitman duties.Sloppy vehicle handling, some bugs in the design of the missions and the endless travel means it doesn't hit the same high notes as GTA and others, but the mindless action is still good dumb fun. An ambitious action affair that sometimes gets a little lost in the wilderness.			"

												I enjoyed Just Cause 2 enough that I decided to go back and play the first one. After finishing it I'd have to say that if you've played the second one, you're better off not touching the first installment. That's not to say that Just caise is a a bad game. It's still a pretty cool open world game with nice gunplay and the jungle setting I enjoy. It's also easy to go from story mission to story mission without all the chaos nonsense of part 2. The stories between 1 and 2 are pretty much the same thing. You're off to an island to liberate it blah blah blah so nothing to see here. Controls were nice and easy (although the grappling hook from Just Cause 2 was sorely missed here) and the missions aren't terribly dificult, other than two that made me want to pull my hair out (a special ""screw you"" for the designer of mission 17 I think it was).  If you haven't played Just Cause 2, this is a cool introdcution to the series but you're better off just sticking with part 2. It just does everything better and you don't need to have played this part to get JC2. This shouldn't be a surprise but hey, I'll just save you eight hours. Still this game gets a 7/10 from me.			"

												I recall this poing poked fun at a lot when this game first came out. The diolog is probably just the worst, the story doesn't exist, and the graphics have not aged well compared to a lot of other games.Also not helped by the buggy nature of some missions, including the last one where you have to ignore what the mission tells you. Go back to shore and get and attack chopper, and then finally begin to get through the finall 3 ending missions. Instead of going in on foot and being blown sky high.And while the graphics can be a bit of a choppy mess. It more than makes up for that fact, by having some of the best Keyboard and Mouse controlls I've seen in a Sandbox game. They felt so natural, that I never gave using a controller a single thought. Where as games like GTA3 and Vice City are far too sloppy and buggy in there controlls, as to make the game pointlessly hard to play. Even the Reical in GTA Vice City is no where near as acurate as Just Cuase.So bugs, bad voice acting, cheesy cut sceens aside. You still have a game that is plotless, but these odd quirks only help to give it a silly late 80's or early 90's action vibe. Mindless but fun. And with that, it's still very fun to play and is even compadable with Windows 10. Enjoy!			"

												it is brilliant in its stupidity. great action game for the money and is worth getting if you own and old computer and want to get into gaming. not the greatest game but what it does it does well. the driving is smooth along with the parachuting but the controls, storyline and shooting mechanics are god awful but it makes up for it with its huge scale and amazing graphics (for the time) if you want an open world game with stupid ammounts of action then this is the game for you.                                                                               7.5/10			"

												I really want to recommend this game, but there are more negatives than positive. Almost everything has a problem with it.Just Cause is the first game in the Just Cause series, made by Eidos Studios. After a few years, Square Enix took the developing rights of JC and made Just Cause 2, a HUGE improvement to the first one.Let's start off with the graphics. They O.K for 2006, but it could've definetely been improved. Rico Rodriguez, the game's main protagionist, has the most bland outfit ever. (All black. Is he Goth or something?) The cutscenes look WAY better than the actual game, but seeing what exactly the cutscenes look, I'd stick with the normal graphics. Another thing that threw me off is that they have 1280 x 600 and 1600 x 1200, but no 1366 x 768. Why not? Surely there would've been 1336 x 768 back then. Not a big problem, but a little annoying.Next, the story. Basic. You are Rico Rodriguez, Agency agent. You must fight the evil forces of the president of San Esperito, Salvador Mendoza by blowing up stuff, helping a guerilla army fight the corrupt police and helping Yellow drug cartel fight Purple drug cartel. That's kinda it. Or that's all I know, for now. I haven't finished the game yet, nor do I have any intention of. This is more simple than your regular oh-no-guy-killed-family-must-kill-all-living-things movie. Like I said, I haven't finished the game yet, but I wished the story had more depth. More complexity.The combat. Oh sweet Jesus. Where to start? If you hit a car, member, or other vehicle of the police or Purple drug cartel, THEY WILL BE UP YOUR ♥♥♥! They will send loads of cars and trucks and helicopters after you. It's fun, until you get out of your flaming car and either get killed by the explosion or the flurry of bullets. If you DO happen to survive, you can shoot 'em. But, you might be outnumbered. There are a lot of weapons, and utilizing them is your #1 priority. The problem is, when you die, you lose ALL your weapons, except for your (crappy) grappling hook and your dual pistols, which conviently have infinite ammo. And your safehouses, the places you spawn at, have certain weapons. For example, one safe house has a bazooka and shotgun, but another one has a machine gun and a pistol. So if you want a big arsenal, you're gonna cross the whole map building it up, only to die to that stray missile from that Apache.And now, the enemies. There are the police, who fight the guerillas occasionaly and mostly lose. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you might see a guerilla helicopter shoot at a police car or van and explode in a unimpressive explosion. There are also liberations, which involves storming a town with other guerilla soldiers while fighting police and SWAT and a po-po heli. There are also roadblocks, depending on the size of the town. Little ones, roadblocks. Big ones, a swarm of army soldiers. Also fighting with you is the Yellow drug cartel, who is fighting Purple drug cartel. There are also liberations here, but you're fighting Purple drug cartel instead of police. The missions are as hard as hell sometimes, like one where you have to destroy coca fields. When I completed that objective and went to a bar to complete it, I was running away on some baggage carrier modified to spray chemicals while Purple drug cartel and police are shooting me from every direction. About 400 meters from my destination, I had to leg it, chased by numerous Purple drug cartel and police bikes and vans and a helicopter. I reached the bar just in time, when I only had a little line of health.CONCLUSION: This game definetly has its good features, like adrenaline-pumped moments and blowing up stuff, but it is light, compared to the bad features. This game felt like it was an idea, not completed or polished. I definitely recommend the second JC, which is an actual game instead of an experiment like this game.FINAL SCORE: 4/10			"

												This game is not as good as I remember it back in the day.1. It's impossible to do ANYTHING in this game without infinite spawning government troops getting in the way.2. The gunplay is loose and sloppy, and it has the great tendency to feel jerky.3. It's awful trying to get anywhere since the game seems to force you to use vehicles to get around, but they control like a cement block with wooden wheels.4. If you choose to run around instead of use vehicles, it is agonizingly slow to get anywhere.This game is better left in the past. It's OK, but the sequel is better, so there really isn't much reason to play this anymore. The story is boring and feels disjointed, the characters are bland, and the voice acting is sub par. This is one that I feel is OK to skip.			"

Just Cause is very immersible, frustratingly challenging, ahead of its time, and a downright wonderful video game.Aside from some ridiculous glitches, lack of deep utilization of certain characters, and especially particular unfair situations, I continued enjoying the game within the span of the story progressing. Throughout my experience, I remained totally stoked and wowed by the depth of colorful landscapes that pertained the fictionalized tropical setting. With each passing moment upon entering a new area it felt refreshing and ultimately as a twisted exotic paradise I kept returning to despite its rampant violent nature. As an open-world game, you're given many advantages to tackle your missions creatively along with hidden bonuses to allow further replay value.Though this game wasn't intended to be perfect, or even garner a broad audience without alienating a few, the best judgment will come if you set aside your worries and become the ultimate vigilante in what would begin the legacy of the Just Cause  franchise!

												Just Cause is a great concept. The map is also huge and there is plenty of places to explore. However, there are many flaws with this game. Now, before people write comments saying ""Hes comparing it to Just Cause 2"" I have not finished Just Cause 2. I am explicitly putting myself back in 2006. This game was not half bad. But lets really look at the game. The storyline of this game is very generic and honestly uninteresting. The gameplay is really not good, I did not enjoy driving in this game at all and the grappling gun you get eventually is cool but very difficult to control. Lets be honest here, Oblivion came out the same year this did. This game was not the top game of the year. I do enjoy the game and its gameplay but after 4 hours I got so fatigued that I gave up quite honestly. The gameplay didn't want me to keep playing and the story was not interesting enough to drag me in. Because of this generally mediocre first game, I am going to not recommend this game purely because I feel that it does have good to it but the bad outways the good. A modern gamer could not go and play this and enjoy it. Honestly a fan of Just Cause as a series probably will not enjoy this. But if you watch gameplay and find it interesting, please get it, however this game did not do it for me.			"

												Yet another game I devoted a good deal of time to on the Xbox. It's an open-world game taking place on a large island nation with a variety of vehicles, missions (which are plentiful, but repetitive) and weapons at your disposal. What makes this game stand out from other GTA clones is the parachute and grappling hook, as well as performing stunts (riding on car roofs, hanging off airplanes, etc.) and of course the island the game takes place on; all 391 square miles worth of land and sea to explore.

												This was a bad game. Usually, the earlier games in the series are the best but not in the case of Just Cause, this game is absolute trash. There isn't much to do in this game except go through the large, mostly copy-pasted jungle map, blow up cars, and kill civilians and cops. Thats about it and the missions have you doing just that. It is set in an area of a few small islands with nothing much on them, which are connected by bridges. The game gets boring really quick, don't buy!			"

												Honestly... This game is a giant island with too little or nothing to do.- The missions are extremely monotonous and boring: You go from one checkpoint to another, kill an enemy and return to another checkpoint that is at least 5 km of your location and there are times that will take 30 minutes or more to complete a mission... ALWAYS IS THE SAME!- There are areas where only filled with trees everywhere and nothing else.- An annoying helicopter follows you constantly. And you can't do anything because always it will attack you as the worst way.Definitely not recommend. If you think to buy it anyway, I hope you do it on deal time this game should be under $5 these days. You must go to Just Cause 2 all time.			"

												Just Cause? Just pass. You're honestly better skipping this title and moving onto Just Cause 2, you won't miss anything. Just Cause 1 has a slew of problems, not limited to: poor controls especially when using the grapple/parachute mechanics, vehicle handling is clearly designed with controllers in mind, most notably when using the auto-aiming mounted turrets, a ridiculous cliché story including drug cartels, Nazi scientists and a whole lot of rockets, and finally it crashes alot. In my 8 hour playtime alone, I crashed six times, three of which where on the same mission, I've Got the Power [#13]. The only real positives I can think about are the graphics are moderately good, ignoring noticable copy-paste jobs on buildings and in jungle, the soundtrack is perfect for the game, and some of the missions including, Some Enchanting Evening [#15],  Dismissed Without Honors [#17] and the last two thirds of Taking Out the Garbage [#19b-c]. If you're going to play this regardless, then I recommend running through the story and leaving a majority of the optional content. The game is only 19 missions long with the last mission split into 3 parts. In summary, I'd still recommend skipping this and playing the second game in the series as it has improved the core idea/gameplay of JC1 into a more complete and enjoyable game.			"

												I recommend this game as a ""time waster,"" to say the least. That's basically what I ended up playing it for.It is certainly not near as good as any of the other Just Causes, and if you take anything away from this, take that.The game has it's fair many amount of bugs and annoyances, but none of which should be game breaking. It's also full of LOADS of old-game stereotypes. Like the blond-lady person ... Kane, I think her name is in the games ... She's useless. But on a level in this game, in comparison to the others. So is the other guy. As you can see, I'm not very into the Just Cause story. Which is why I bought this at first, when I tried to get into it.Really, why are those two even there? They basically just tell you what to do, watch what you do, slap you and have a dandy vacation in a country you help bring down through a rebel force and a ally drug cartel.Like I said - time waster. Fair game, but wouldn't recommend otherwise.""STOP CITIZEN! THIS IS THE POLICE."" Also this is the best quote that's constantly yelled at you while flying in game.			"

												Summary: Assume the role of the flamboyant Rico Rodriguez – an undercover CIA operative specializing in regime change - as he tries to overthrow the corrupt government of San Esperito. This rogue South American island is suspected of stockpiling WMDs and it’s your job to negate the threat to world peace. It could be to your advantage that this tropical paradise is about to implode as various factions vie for power – it just needs a gentle nudge in the right direction. Just Cause offers the freedom to tackle your assignment however you want: play the island’s factions off against one another; incite a rebellion among the masses; or build alliances with rebel forces and drug cartels. The game world consists of 1,225 sq. miles of mountains, jungles, beaches, cities and villages which can be explored by land, sea and air. And you will have at your disposal a varied and exciting array of vehicles, planes and watercraft. 7/10.			"

												The first time I played this was right after I completed Just Cause 2. The whole thing felt relatively unpleasant at the first half hour, so I uninstalled it, only to take another shot years later. Now I can say if someone is a bit more patient than I was back then, JC can prove to be a rather fun, though a bit repetitive game with such a vast island to explore and so much settlements to liberate. I could recommend to those fellow gamers who like to blow ♥♥♥♥ up and don't mind taking massive surprise damage in the middle of chaotic battles because the allied AI doesn't care if it blows the player up with it's target.

												Being the first game in the Just Cause series, you shouldn't expect it to be perfect, because it's not. But for all it's flaws, it's glorious because of how massive in scope and epicness it is.Something like ~365 sq miles, the world is your playground, and not because of the sidequests, which are many yet repetitive; i.e; help the guerillas take over political territory, and help the Rioja family expand and defeat the other competing/mafia type family. The side quests are many and they do have their advantages when advancing through the game for opening safe houses and extra weapons, but are otherwise unnecessary.No, the world is your playground because of how ridiculous it is. Police everywhere, villages are spread out, mountains, mountains, and mountains are all over with hills, rivers, cliffs, etc. The only thing that kept the diverse landscape vague was the color, which is pretty much all green. There's grass everywhere, you can't go anywhere without seeing grass unless you drive a boat out to sea. A game released in 2006, this could have easily been on all next gen systems, but you can tell Avalanche had focused with the Xbox and PC while also trying to transition to 360, as the models are pretty good, but the textures are certainly at the end of the Xbox and PS2 era.As for travel, you get planes, helicopters, tanks, cars, trucks, etc. There's an infinite amount of vehicles at your disposal. Again, you'll have to advance the sidequests to unlock some of the cool ones, but completely unnecessary.The plot is okay. It's nothing special, run and gun doing espionage esq type missions, sort of like James Bond espionage, but less stealthy. You are Rico and are sent by the Agency to help rid the country island of San Esperito of its corrupt El Presidente and followers. It's fun, but rather short, you can probably beat it in 4 or 5 hours, depending on the difficulty and amount of time you spend in between missions.8.3/10			"

												5 reasons you are playing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of GTA and Serious Sam series:1. You love word El-Presidente. Spanish sounds good to you.2. You bought giftable copy of the game with enormous discount for trading. You actually thought you could trade it for something else. How foolish of you.3. You like cheesy stunts.4. Your PC is 7 years old.5. It's okay that the game leaves feeling of cheap console port with targeting help.It's quite good game actually. The worst part is these giant territories filled with jungles. (Game map is huge, 1025 km².) Yes, it feels like real life, but there is completely nothing you can do there.			"

												Just Cause does not have anything significantly groundbreaking in it, in all honestly it feels pretty retro, but it Is a pretty ""big"" game mission wise, with roughly around 320 something missions to complete. What is most important in a game like this is the fun factor though and it has it, you might find yourself surprised at how much you like it. I would recommend trying it, Especially if your a fan of Just Cause 2 (the obviously named sequel).			"

												Personal Rating: 6/10On the one hand, I'm impressed with this game. Controls aren't bad, involves the player, graphics aren't bad for it's time and it provided an even greater sequel. HOWEVER, the voice acting. I muted my volume it was that bad. In previous reviews such as Deadfall Adventures, I had a go at the game for the voice acting. It's a key feature to make a gamer feel involved in the experience, not something to laugh at every time you get a cutscene. It feels like one of those really bad movies that it's actually good such as The Room, Troll 2 or Birds: Shock and Terror. (Yeah, I watched all three)Anyways, I got this from a friend in the Just Cause 2 pack, so it's definately a good game, worth a good review.			"

												Just Cause is an old game; at nine years of age it doesn't sound that old but for the things it's trying to do, you can definitely see its age in the texture quality, in the writing, in the sound mixing, in the lighting and in many different quirks of its gameplay mechanics.And yet, as an open world game from 2006, it is magnificent, full of attitude, very ridiculous and full of stupid and fun things to do and while I haven't done all the side missions - at some point I just really wanted to finish it - jumping a speed boat into a highway, running from police, jumping on a moving car before grappling into a helicopter, taking it over and flying away is just... just fun!TLDR: Great.https://plus.google.com/114700591956760977160/posts/CyX4DFaeW9z "

												When released on the 360 many years ago, this game was so much fun. If I recall correctly, this or Saints Row were the first two open world games available on the console. But this PC port is garbage. If there is native controller support, I certainly cannot find it. And if there is a way to get the game to fit the entire screen of a 1080p signal, I can't find it either. I wish I could recommend this game in it's current state. But I cannot. Other open world games have surpassed it. Get the sequel instead.			"

												I'm not gonna compare this game to current games, but to games closer to it's original launch date like GTA San Andreas or True Crime Streets of L.A.This game is not bad. It's trash, there is not one thing i can say they got it right.Let's start with the world. Yes it's huge, but that's it. It's a big boring empty world. 90% of the land is jungle, with a few excuses for a city here and there. The cities look like card boxes, the jungles are made by 2 different tree models. GTA San Andreas map was big but it also had diversity, you had deserts, big different styled cities, mountains, etc... Here is a pain going from A to B, because everything looks the same.The cars are slow, with very few different models, making it even worse to get around without feeling bored.Then you have the gameplay, and if you are expecting great gameplay, then you are playing the wrong game. The combat is boring, and most of the game you can make it with the dual pistol, just shooting at boring looking enemies, that do a little jump when they die for some reason, maybe they are jumping with joy for their part on this crappy game is finnaly over, i don't now.The driving is bad, with the phisics beeing just stupid. Most cars will act like they are on rails when you bump into them, refusing to react to the force you just applied to them. The grappling hook is useless 99% of the game, with getting chppers being its only use. The story is boring, just your defeat the evil dictator cliche. The missions are mostly easy as hell, with just a couple actually beeing hard, but mostley because you go alone up against 200 men, 100 cars with machin guns, 60 choppers with machine guns and missiles, 50 tanks and 5 jets dropping bombs on you. Oh and sometimes when you are on a car, it catchs fire so you jump out of it before explodes but some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will go all suicide and enter the flamming car and use it to run you down. Amazing ♥♥♥♥ right there.The side missions are basically all the same, just killing enemies while you destroy barricades, And for what? To get a new useless save point. This game is amazing in the way it uses useless crap to motivate you.The characters are also so damn crappy. Rico only feature is looking like Antonio Banderas. Tom is exactly like Sam Axe from Burn Notice, except he's not funny, charismatic, useful or has Bruce Campbell as his voice actor. Maria only reason to be in the game is because the devs wanted a female character in the game.So just do yourself a favor and instead of this game buy a golden fish. It's more fun to stand for hours looking at him swimming than playing this game, and he can also be used as emergency food in case of and earthquake or the WWIII			"

												Just Cause is a slightly older game (around the end of the PS2's life cycle) that boasts a massive area to explore, a seemingly endless amounts of side missions and content to take on, and much much more. I recently picked up the series on sale, and as per usual, I'm writing this review from a completionist perspective. I've done all there is to do in the game and am trying to judge it based on all that it has to offer.Now before I get blasted by hate (becaus a LOT of people like this game, and may get butt hurt because of the not recommended review I'm giving) hear me out. I will give credit where credit is due and review the game as fairly as I possibly can.PROS:-The game does NOT look ten years old unless you look at the characters. The environment is beautiful, the water physics are perfect, and all in all it just looked good.-MASSIVE area. They didn't lie here, the area is so large that it would take literal days to explore it all. There are tons of easter eggs hidden away, like a hidden temple that is unmarked, to explore that reward you for making the effort.-Some aspects of the gameplay were really satisfying, I like the concepts of taking over the islands of San Esperito one area at a time, it makes you feel like you're actually fighting a war and need to think tactically. It also gives the game a great flow for progression.-Instead of a levelling system, you have to rise through the ranks of the Guerilla faction, and the Rioja drug cartel to get better gear. This is a really cool concept for incentives, as it makes you want to do more for these factions.Now you may be thinking ""Whoa, Pokemon_Master503, this sounds awesome! Why could you possibly call this game a pile of steaming crap?"" Well...CONS:-SEVERELY underwhelming story. This game has around 21 missions (or 19, if you count the last one, which is one continuous mission segmented into three different chapters as three missions) The story missions aren't that difficult, and could honestly be beaten in their  entirety in about three or four hours. ""But you have 37 hours logged!"" I hear you say. Remember, I'm writing a completionist review of the game, therefore the rest of that time is made up of other content. -Cardboard characters and lackluster storytelling. The game doesn't make you care at all about the people's plight in San Esperito, the characters, the Agency, your partners, or the resistence. These elements take a backburner to the filler content that was packed into the game. For a single player only game, you would think story and good characters would be a must, but here they clearly weren't important at all. Which brings us to our next point.-Copy and pasted side missions. The game has 9 races, 13 collectathon missions, settlement overthrowing, and side missions for the guerilla and Rioja factions. The first two classes of missions were all unique and each individual race and mission was treated as an individual part of the game, but the last two, which are meant to help you out in the story because of the unlocks, were simply carbon copies of each other. Settlements all looked nearly EXACTLY the same, with either coastal town, rural town, city, or military base as their type. These four are distinguishable from each other, but not distinguishable within each type. For the Rioja settlements, save for a handful, they are all the exact same more or less.  For side missions, they are algorithmically generated, so the side missions aren't actually rewarding or change the world around you, like side missions SHOULD. they just advance your rank in the respective faction, but it gets worse, where they are algorithmically generated, they repeat the same missions over and over again. 200+ side questss? More like 5 of the same with varying location. On that note-Copy and pasted environment, The environment doesn't change at all. Sure, it's algorithmically generated and huge, but THERE'S NOTHING THERE.-And last but not least GLITCHES. GOD THE GLITCHES. ""gets off motorbike, motorbike goes flying across map."" ""'Tank just casually flying for no reason."" ""Spawning in a place where you can't move"" IT'S SO FUN.If you're GONNA buy, buy it on sale. like for $3 or below			"

												TL;DR More broken than a politician's promises.Unfortunately, I cannot write a proper review of this game as it is all broke to hell. Things I'm not supposed to have yet are unlocked, things I'm supposed to have are just plain unusable and I'm just having small problem after small problem build up so much that the game has just become unplayable for me. For example; I now seem to be completely unable to use vehicles - I can get in and out, I can use any mounted weapons, but they just will not move anywhere. Even in a mission specific vehicle. Also, every time I get into a gunfight, the game now stutters SO badly it's totally unplayable.I was enjoying this game (all the way up to mission 8 - Brothers in Arms), despite the small bugs and glitches, but they have now mounted up to such a point that it has now become a complete frustration, rather than an enjoyable experience. And for this reason alone (and yes, I have searched and searched the net and tried various fixes, all to no avail) I cannot recommend this game.			"

												Considering how much I love the second game of the series, I really want to like this one, but I can't. It's nowhere near as beautiful and fun and chaotic (the good kind of chaotic) as the sequel.Actually, some things made me really frustrated. More particularly the way the grappling hook works. Even worse was the physics of the vehicles. If you had even the slightest bit of heat built up, the enemies will hunt you; easily catch up and knock your armored mini bus off the tracks using a tiny scooter, making it nearly impossible to lose them.I played a couple of hours until I realised my time is much better spent playing Just Cause 2!Maybe it's just me that's bad at the game but regardless, it was still not a positive experience.

												Just Cause is a really unique game. It is a third-person FPS combined with vehicles of all kinds: motorbikes, cars, trucks, buses, boats, helicopters, planes, you get to drive them all. It is really fun as it has a unique gameplay because of the above. It has great music and gameplay too. However, it has its flaws.-The AI is very r3tarded. For example, civilians love to run into my way when I'm driving a vehicle. And when I jump and parachute down a cliff, a r3tarded cop thinks his car can fly and drives down the cliff. And at the first mission, I had to fight through a bridge guarded by cops, but I only just stopped my vehicle just in front of the security block and the cops started shooting (I haven't even done anything wrong yet). And too many instances of r3tarded-looking AI.-Some missions have ridiculous difficulty. For example, way too many police vehicles and helicopters, or missiles that one-hit KOed any vehicle I tried to use, that they don't even give me time to jump off before they blow up.-There is a bug where I keep hearing a cop's voice asking me to stop, he is the police etc. . Even when I'm flying my chopper in the air.-2 second screen freezes every half a minute or so sometimes, and only a restart of the game would fix it... for a while.My rating: 6/10			"

												Just Cause is a really unique game. It is a third-person FPS combined with vehicles of all kinds: motorbikes, cars, trucks, buses, boats, helicopters, planes, you get to drive them all. It is really fun as it has a unique gameplay because of the above. It has great music and gameplay too. However, it has its flaws.-The AI is very r3tarded. For example, civilians love to run into my way when I'm driving a vehicle. And when I jump and parachute down a cliff, a r3tarded cop thinks his car can fly and drives down the cliff. And at the first mission, I had to fight through a bridge guarded by cops, but I only just stopped my vehicle just in front of the security block and the cops started shooting (I haven't even done anything wrong yet). And too many instances of r3tarded-looking AI.-Some missions have ridiculous difficulty. For example, way too many police vehicles and helicopters, or missiles that one-hit KOed any vehicle I tried to use, that they don't even give me time to jump off before they blow up.-There is a bug where I keep hearing a cop's voice asking me to stop, he is the police etc. . Even when I'm flying my chopper in the air.-2 second screen freezes every half a minute or so sometimes, and only a restart of the game would fix it... for a while.My rating: 6/10			"

												I went the whole game and I enjoyed.We have a task to defeat General Mendoza, who exercises dictatorial governments, but before we get to the last mission we have to do a number of other missions. Additionally we can help the rebels and capture cities and military bases to get additional reputation points.Thanks to the reputation we have access to new hideouts, weapons, and vehicles.In the game, we have access to many land-based vehicles, aircraft and boats for example heavy armed helicopter.Also about the diversity of weapons there is nothing to complain. Ranging from pistols to rocket launchers.Map is really huge, varied and makes an impression.I recommend.			"

												I mainly played this, just to see how Just Cause 2 got it's roots. I can see that the roots for Just Cause 2 were well fertilized, because Just Cause OG is sh**!Well, okay, to be fair Just Cause 1 is a lot better than a lot of other games. It feels sort of like playing Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with slightly less clunkier controls and slightly better graphics. However, the game has some severe problems with both narrative and gameplay that cause it to just truly suffer.My biggest qualms with the gameplay is how easily cheated it can be. The loading screens advertize all the cool weapons and vehicles you could unlock by freeing more cities, but I got pretty much all the best gear by the end only by playing the regular story missions. And the two staples of the game- the parachute and grappling hook- both absolutely suck in this game. For one, the grappling hook is very selective. It will latch onto any vehicle or person you aim it at, but not trees, rocks, or land- which renders it basically pointless. Plus, parachuting to cars or helicopters is rubbish, since you have to reel yourself close enough to the vehicle for it to work. And Scorpio obviously has some sort of strange disease in his arms, causing them to only aim his grappling hook forward. Once a helicopter flies behind you while you reel it in, you're done. And trying to get onto cars is a massive pain, since you gradually sink to the ground (even if the car is driving at top speed).The gameplay also takes its biggest dip during the end mission. The game builds up all this variety and open mission play-style, and the end mission completely negates that. You fly in on a helicopter but can't fly it to the island. Cars attract helicopter missiles. And missiles blasting your body cause you to bounce back and forth like a pinball, constantly taking damage. And damage can only be healed by the random health-pack spawning out of dead enemies, which is very uncommon.The cutscenes are also really weird to watch. The animation studio chose some very strange character models (and some even worse voice actors), and the scenes that explain situations come off as weird, in the sense that characters say sentences in completely off tones, or come off as weird since the characters themselve look very inhuman. In fact, Just Cause has a very toy-ish feel. The cars look like Hot Wheels cars, the characters look and animate like action figures. Even the samey world of San Esperito has a kid's-jungle-themed-toy-box appeal. The game just doesn't have a very fun or realistic draw to it.I'm not saying everyone would hate this game. Between the wide variety of story missions, vast content, and world to explore- plenty of gamers will enjoy the original Just Cause. It just didn't impress me. I'm very picky with my sandbox games, and if you other 5% of Steam users that agree with my opinions are reading this, then you can be assured that Just Cause is not the game for you.			"

I love the way you can do stuff like jump off a cliff, open your parachute, use a grappling hook to attach yourself to an enemy car before jumping on top of it and throwing the driver out. There are also some seriously funny glitches like when police cars run over their fellow police officers; civilians randomly jump off bridges into the sea; and the police drive their cars into the sea and explode.

												(Full disclosure: I rushed through this game's story while doing barely any sidequests or collectible missions, just so I could write this review before I finished Just Cause 3 and wrote its review. Don't worry, I'm going to come back and do some more optional stuff at some point.)It's interesting to see the progression of the Just Cause series, to watch it come ever closer to what I call the ""Just Cause Idea"". The Just Cause Idea, for the record, is as follows: In a massive, beautiful, island nation (around 1000 square kilometers) run by a cartoonishly evil dictator, Rico Rodriguez, the world's most physics-defying Hispanic man, must use his huge amounts of mobility and destruction potential to bring down the dictator's rule by breaking everything the dictator owns. And it only gets more fun the more you play it.The original Just Cause is a fairly generic game, obviously heavily inspired by old-school shooters as well as Grand Theft Autos 3, Vice City, and San Andreas. You run around shooting and driving cars and breaking things and holding an anomalous amount of guns, constantly maintaining a baseline level of fun; enough to keep you occupied but not exactly enthrall you.However, the first stirrings of the Just Cause Idea are also apparent. You have infinite parachutes; a primitive, vehicles-only version of the later games' hookshot; no regard for civilian lives; a massive island nation run by a cartoonishly evil dictator; and more time spent in freefall than a professional skydiver. And, of course, you're (young) Rico Rodriguez.In Just Cause 2, the Just Cause Idea is advanced even further, and the game is far better for it. Your grappling hook is no longer a weapon but a permanant staple that changes the game forever, Rico's defiance of physics gets f*cking insane, the shooting becomes merely a placeholder to simply add challenge to all the movement and destruction, the world becomes more diverse, the graphics get prettier (to the point that the atmospheric effects will probably never be outdone), there's more and cooler stuff to destroy in cooler ways, the villain gets even more cartoonish, and the game is overall more engaging, fun, and just...wonderful. The Just Cause Idea proves its worth in this game.Just Cause 3 is probably the most perfect and complete realization of an idea ever, but I'm saving that for the review.If I were to use a metaphor to describe the series' progression, it'd probably go as thus: Just Cause 1 is a flower starting to bud, the colorful petals just beginning to show from in between the sepals; Just Cause 2 is that flower in full bloom, its colors open for all to see; and Just Cause 3 is the flower if it were to detach entirely from the plant it budded from, becoming a spherical mass of petals and floating off to live in its own little world of explosions and madness.Anyway, Just Cause is still a fine game in its own right. Great? Not quite; it's the weakest of the series in my opinion, with its technological limitations and conventionality preventing it from reaching the same dizzying heights as its successors. But it's pretty good, and I guess it's worth buying, especially if you're as invested in the series as I am or if it's on sale.			"

A lot of stuff will bother you... scratch that, it'll ******* ♥♥♥♥ you off - even the way aimming works is awful.

												Some things just don't age well, the game is alright but clunky and oh so cheesy. Though it must be said the cheese was to my taste.The game only supports older resolutions, which is fine for the most part but I gotta say that on the parachute it was extremely disorienting and vomit inducing.Gameplay is similar to older GTA type titles like San Andreas with the same questionable gun accuracy and some auto-lock on aiming. The grapple gun is cool but almost never works as you would hope, sometimes taking thirty odd tries to actually board the vehicle you grappled. Fast travel is absolutely necessary to get just about anywhere as the map is truly enormous and for the most part empty.If you were wanting to get this game for the story so you could go into the sequels, I would give this game a pass. The story consists (no spoilers) of nothing more than eliminating a dictator and a drug cartel and the side characters are mildly funny but shallow.			"

												I remember playing the demo for this game years ago, I was quite impressed. Now so many years later I've got some time to spare and thought:""why not finish this game and see if it still holds up."" Sadly it does not hold up. The story is so bland and direct it doesn't make any sense. I'm quite impressed by size of the map, but what's good about having a big map if it's just empty and boring? Missions aren't very interesting either and feel repetitive.Yes, I've played it for almost two hours and I'm already tired of it. Especially when the missions are broken most of the time.An example: you have to steal a truck with coca and bring it back to a garage. The truck may not be destroyed, but in order to keep it from blowing up you have exit it a few time kill some cartel guys and some cops and enter again. Guess what happens if you exit the truck for too long? It dissapears.... FUNTo be honest, I'm not very impressed by the graphics, even for a 2006 game. The bloom effect in this game is so strong it hurts my eyes.In short, just skip it, it feels a like frustrating chore. Already installing the second one while writing this and hoping that one wil be good. 4/10PS:Just a quick review, just quickly expressing my feelings about this game. Might write a decent review later...			"

												This is the most horrible game that I have purchased from Steam to date. It has such potential to be fun but was incredibly frustrating, primarily due to the vast multitude of glitches. The most recent is that I was unable to save my game. I went to several different satellite uplink stations but it would not give me the save option. Add this to the other glitches which cause the game to crash or the one that I encountered which makes it impossible to blow up the objective if you extract to get a more versatile vehicle, requiring you to either use the vehicle provided which is not suited to the task or traverse an incredible distance to get a better vehicle and all of the other times that you must traverse incredible distances just to give yourself a decent shot at completing the mission, and the result is a game on which I would not recommend wasting any amount of money.

												If you love Just Cause 2 then you have to play the original. Whilst JC2 is all about causing as much chaos as possible, JC1 is all about the story and the missons. The game still features a massive map in which you are free to do as you wish, and also includes lots of cars, aircraft, boats etc. Whilst you aren't exploring the massive island, you'll be liberating towns from the government, doing side missions such as assisnating key government figres, or even simple things like collecting cars or drug deals. JC1 feels a lot like earlier Grand Theft Auto games, You have a safehouse where you can store weapons and cars etc. And whilst this game does feature a paracehute, and a grapple gun, yes a gun, you have to equip it to use it. You shouldn't count on it to get you around. Overall the game is very enjoyable, despite showing its age in the graphics department the fun still remains. So, if you enjoy Just Cause 2 and maybe you are interested in seeing where JC2 came from, Maybe you want to go back for the story, Or maybe you ae just looking for another game to add to your Steam Libary, I would absoloutely recommend this. Even better if you can get it in a steam sale ;) "

												This game is... meh. For a 2006 title this is good but it really aged like ♥♥♥♥♥. Controls are awful and animations aren't the best. You might like it to play for an hour or two , kinda how you liked wreaking havoc in older games like GTA but besides that I would advice you to pass this. You don't need to play this game to play the others as the story is pointless. There are better games to get  at this price.4/10 is alright mostly but not that good as you would expect.			"

												I rate the game Just Cause 4/5. Overall this is a Good game. It is a fun but flawed, third-person perspective, grand-theft-auto style, open-world adventure game. It has aged relatively well for a 10 year old game.Incredibly ambitious but terribly flawed, this game is still quite a bit of fun to play and features some very pretty tropical landscapes which shine through despite what are, by today's standards, generally mediocre and somewhat buggy graphics. For the current price of 7 dollars or so, this game gives you a lot of fun for your money. +Good graphics which adequately depicted the heat and humidity of the game's tropical setting. The colors used by this game were bright, hot and at times, even muggy but consistently beautiful. The graphics were always very cartoony however but perfectly matched the game's silly sense of humor and ludicrous stunts and physics.+This game gives you tremendous freedom and the landmass of the area you get to explore is truly humongous. No spatial compression here (like in Skyrim where the place looks larger than it actually is), unlike in Skyrim, this game really is as huge as it looks and you will usually need a helicopter or airplane to get around from place to place in a timely fashion (which gives you the most beautiful views of the game anyhow). Unfortunately, there isn't much to do in the big environments you have available to you.+Trying out all the vehicles and zipping all over the island and off of cliffs is a LOT of fun. Finally getting into a helicopter and flying around is even more fun especially since the game becomes even more beautiful at that altitude (fewer visual bugs caught my eye at high altitudes). The vehicle stunts were fun (but the grappling hook gun thing was always cumbersome). This game has great controls and makes it easy to reconfigure those controls to suit your personal taste once you figure out how the control menu works (and that its perfectly ok to have key conflicts).+/-Severely buggy. Physics bugs are particularly prevalent. Doors of cars fly off and into the distance at tremendous velocities when you open them. Traversing a turret on an armored car causes the car somersault crazily up into the air. Rotor blades ignore tree branches as if they aren't even there. The physics engine isn't remotely realistic and in many ways seems more similar to the physics in loony tunes or something than to real life. Rather than causing frustration however the bad physics leads to a lot of laughter and unexpected funny moments wherein stuff that should not possibly happen, happened. Mostly (except for the problem with traversing turrets) the physics problems actually make this already easy game even easier.+/-This is a very easy game and there are few missions which will prove challenging. Unfortunately the final mission is much, much harder than the rest of the game (I had to try if about 7 times or more before I got through it). For the most part though the game will seem too easy rather than too hard.+/- Merely adequate sound effects and mediocre (at best) music which quickly becomes repetitive given the potential length of the game. The voice acting is good (your character looks and sounds like Antonio Banderas, but he repeats his little taunts too often. Enemy taunts and voices are repeated too often also. There is no GTA style fake radio and you cannot apparently insert your own music into this game making for a very boring soundscape throughout. This meant I turned the volume down pretty far most of the time making this a very quiet game for me to play. The sound effects aren't that great when turned up far anyhow.+/- The game's main plot/story isn't totally boring but it's not nearly as interesting as it could have been. The major problem is that none of the characters explained in any great detail nor is the overall situation. Maybe there's more background information in an instruction manual somewhere which I didn't bother to read.-The side missions are generally repetitive and boring. The best thing about them is that they are entirely optional. You don't have to do them at all in order to play the game and the rewards they yield don't hardly make them worth the effort of doing them anyhow.-The enemy AI is about as good as it was in GTA III. That's not so good, which makes the game even easier. Enemy soldiers run around fighting for themselves with no squad-based tactics like a senseless mob. This helps make battles feel chaotic (because this way they actually are) but they don't feel remotely real.-You can explore but the HUGE tropical island environments are ultimately mostly uniform and boring and not very interactive. The civilian population is not very interactive either. You can hit them with cars or not or whatever but it makes no difference. You can't have sex with them or anything like that (like in GTA III). There's no sense of morality and no consequences for wantonly killing bystanders. There's no multiple ending structure to this game either. The island population is just there as random bystanders and to provide you with ample vehicles to hijack. Asides from tooling around in various vehicles and doing repetitive side missions or the games relatively few main-plot missions there just isn't much to do given the truly massive amount of geographic territory the game gives you access to. This is Just Cause's biggest, most critical flaw.-Given how remote many of the locations in the game look the tropical nation's dirt and non-dirt roads alike are all too packed with traffic. There is almost an inner-city level traffic almost everywhere you go no matter how deep in the countryside you are which always seemed really weird.			"

												Very fun game if you have terrible integrated graphics.*I have played a lot more offline so don't judge this review by the amount of time played*STORY: The story is very... strange. There's some nazi scientists and a lot of missiles. The voice acting is also terrible.GRAPHICS: For a 2006 game it looks very nice. It runs well on integrated graphics.SOUND: Very nice South american-sounding soundtrack.GAMEPLAY: Satisfying shooting and a cool grappling hook mechanic. Very fun to play.Now for the cons.* Alt tab crashes the game* Save points can be inconvenient* You have to add a file to enable widescreen support* Driving is very slipperyFor the $5 I spent on this as part of the Just Cause Collection I would say it was worth it.

												I bought this game to tide myself over until I could muster enough money to buy a machine that could run Just Cause 2 at any decent frame rate, and I definitely can't say I regret my purchase.For a 2006 title it has a huge sandbox. Even some recent  titles struggle to compare- it is visually stunning; the  screenshots on the store page don't do it justice, on higher graphical settings it feels like you're on holiday, the most danderous holiday you'll have. Although saying that, there is very little variation from mountainous forest to tropical beach,and the cities are not quite GTA V's los santos. The in game music is very nice, I could listen for hours. It captures the Caribbean setting perfectly, in my opinion.It never won't be fun to fly a plane close enough to the ground to see  the foliage and then hastily disembarking to watch the carnage unfold, and this game, for it's time, gives a decent variety of planes, helicopters, cars, boats, guns, and explosives to play with. The downside being, of course, that many such toys are locked away untill you've completed dismayingly similar missions numerous times. Which may have been more interesting for much longer had the hostile NPCs been given any form of a competent AI, and the friendly AI seems to be all too intrigued about what's coming out the end of your gun, though I shouldnt complain about AI from that era. Also I can't tell if any of the guns do more or less damage. A stats screen wouldnt have gone amiss, if the different gun shapes aren't purely for aesthetics. As a result the side missions are an absolute chore and still necessary to get anything large and flammable. From the little Just Cause 2 I've been able to play, the grapple hook and parachute system is much more fluid, but don't get me wrong, the system in the original works fine. The animations in the game such as Rico's running looks pretty dodgy and can be pretty amusing at first, but is distracting from there on out. The story isn't brilliant, but who's playing games of this genre in place of a bedtime read? The greatest annoyance I have with this game are the NPC voices; the developers seemed content to hire just two voice actors for the entire civilan population, though, it's nothing a low flying plane can't fix.All in all, Just Cause is definitely worth your time, whether you dont yet have the computing power to run Just Cause 2, just enjoy the genre because this is a great game in it's own right, or have already completed the Just Cause 2 and want to experience it's roots, and for under £5 is a bargain. If you can get it on sale, all the better. however if it's between Just Cause and it's sequal, Just Cause 2 would be a better use of your cash.			"

												TL;DR? Pros: Big world, Fun gameplay, Exciting Music, Badass charactersCons: Too easy, Too short (6 hours), 'Meh' driving, A bit repetitive'Wow!' was my initial reaction to playing this game. This game is really good in my opinion, but not amazing. It is too easy unfortunately but you can easily get past that with the bada$$ story and fun gameplay. The driving isn't particularly great but it is still much better than Just Cause 3, which had some of the stiffest driving in a modern openworld game. Music is excellent too. Graphics wise, I got no complaints, this game is aging but it still looks decent. The map is actually rather big but not cramped with things to do. It is REALLY short! It is about 6 hours, but on a sale (of which I bought with £1.24) I can safely say it is worth it. However, do not expect very much content if you buy this game for £7. There is also a feeling of repetitiveness in the game which is certainly not amazing, however in short bursts (1 hour a day) you can have as much fun as you damn well want. Storywise there isn't much to say really, and I won't spoil anything huge. The story is basically you are assigned to kill a president (like you do in every Just Cause game). Even though that idea might sound a bit boring on paper, the quest is thankfully filled with cool characters.I played this game first on PS2 for 10 minutes and never played again because of its lackluster technicality, so I can safely say that this game is recommended on PC other than on anything else. Overall I give it a 7/10 but I definitely recommend it on a sale! "

This game isn't for everyoneIf you are looking for something with a great story, deep gameplay and well written dialogue, look somewhere else. But if you just want to have ""dumb fun"", this is your thing.Best comparision I can make is with the movie ""Shoot 'Em Up"", but with tons of explosions and a huge tropical setting.Technical aspects: The plot is *rse, the sidemissions are repetitive and *rse, the gameplay is repetitive and *rse, the physics are bugged, the graphics are mostly *rse (the environment is good in my opinion, everything else, *rse), the soundtrack and dialogue are absolutely *rse, side missions aside the game is short (6~8 hours if you are lucky and don't keep dying because every brainless army in the game decided to just spawn at your location at that given time) and the open world is empty.However, this game is incredibly fun, it has a huge map where you blow things up, a variety of vehicles for you to drive and blow things up and some variety of guns for you to shoot and blow things up and you can have some good navigation and vistas opening your parachute at any given time (height and/or speed provided that is).As I said, buy it if you like dumb fun.*a			"

												As I await my new computer, I have found this an awesome distraction. While its storyline may lack, for those of us who lack a beefy computer for the computer, this one is an enjoyable pastime. Good for its time, and still very fun. While not as expansive or immersive as the previous game, I'd still get it, if only for its good price and the experience of seeing whwat spawned the famous JC2. Give it a shot, you might just love what you see.			"

												I got this game, only because I bought the Just Cause collection, which included this first part of the series. Very old game, with poor graphics and sound effects. Gameplay could be good at the time of its release (2006), but I remember playing better games even at that time. Just Cause 2, which was release some years after is a much better game for sure.+ none imo...- Graphics- Sounds- Gameplay- Controls "

You could tell he was cocky but got the job done. If you have not yet, try this game for sure. - massive map- loads of vehicles- multiple airports to fly to and from- explosions and chaos everywhereEverything you would expect from a JC title. 10/10.

												It's like Grand Theft Auto but on an Island, with a grappling gun, and can eject yourself from moving vehicles and skydive and use a parachute. There's also a lot of trees.Enemies appear out of nowhere and disappear in front of your eyes on occasions. You can steal a car and have the whole islands army on your ♥♥♥ with no stars to indicate when the assault on you will ever end. (It won't). They will gun you down to the end of the earth or until you reach your objective and then it's mission complete.Cars stick to you when they are chasing and ramming you, can be a pain to shake off and driving uphill is a struggle.But then, when you can climb out of your vehicle and jump in to another. Who cares about the bad things. I drive my pickup and then climb out on to the roof and jump in to a sports car alongside me. Then I race to the edge of a cliff and surf on roof, leaping from it just as it goes over the edge. Free falling for a moment and then releasing my parachute, I float down to the sea, hop in a boat and speed off to another island, and on my way, spot a plane that takes my fancy. Very short game if you only do the main missions, which is what I did. There are side missions which are like Assassins Creed or Far Cry where you take over the area by destroying blockades with your team of rebels and then eventually once enough damage has been made change the flag in the town centre. I didn't really care for these as they are very repetitive.A nice feature which helped to navigate the map easier and a lot quicker was the extraction option that is in the PDA menu, which can be used at any time (even whilst on a mission) as long as you are not under attack. Where a helicopter will pick you up and take you where ever you want to go, be it to a new mission briefing or just to one of your safe houses. You can also have vehicles dropped off to you using heavy drop from the PDA.Kind of hard to say if I should recommend this or not.It has some very good positives and being an open world game has the ability to bring a lot of hours of game time just roaming the island and getting up to mischief. However there isn't a massive amount of vehicles and all of the terrain is pretty much the same (lots of dirt roads, few tarmac ones, trees. mountains) and not much going on the street in general unless the army are after you (which is kind of all the time) The game is a bit of a bad port from (what I've read) the XBOX (not 360)/PS2 version of the game. When in the menu there is no mouse cursor to select options and navigating must be done from the directional buttons on keyboard and return and No controller support (although I didn't try). The games display aspect ratio is 4:3 at 1024x768 with no support for widescreen monitors by default. (To allow the use of 1920x1080 16:9 you need can get a universal resolution changer file from WideScreen Gaming Forum which is easy enough to add to the games install directory in order to change this - http://www.wsgf.org/dr/just-cause) Although this does stretch the HUD, PDA and map screens noticeably and the cut scenes more so.I played at 5760x1080 res using this fix and in game the resolution was fine. If you see this game on sale grab it. I got Just Cause and Just Cause 2 with DLC for £3.24 in the sales. For that price I would recommend this game all day. Even if it has got a few flaws, its still a fine game with around 21 missions, lots more side missions and being an open world game is more what you make of it when not doing these. 69/100  "

I assume this was the devs first game and that the PC port was and after thought. While it is interesting to see Just Cause 2's roots this game isn't worth anybodies time and money. Just Cause 3 is worth a shot too but it's port is awful.

Everywhere the same forests and citys.-The missions are pretty boring and repetitive. All you do is blow up some vehicle and kill swarms of enemies, which becomes really boring after the first few missions.-The side missions are just meaningless and aren't rewarding. There is no end to them and you don't gain anything special when you do them. Also they are really boring and same.-The characters are too cheesy. It was fun in the beginning but then it is neither funny nor logical.-Liberation missions are all the same and becomes very boring really quickly.-The game is too easy. There was only one mission, that I found hard to do and it is really hard to die.As summary, if you want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up and kill swarms of enemies, while you magically stay alive, buy this game.

												5/10. This game is the first in the just cause series and it is not hard to notice. The open world adventure doesn't miss with airplane jacking or helicopter stealing using a grappling hook to reel yourself in. Though fun, the tight controls and awkward camera angle, when an air vehicle flies by, makes it difficult.             The problem I had with this game is the many many glitches and high difficulty spike,early-mid game. The enemy helicoptors will gun you down without hesitation immediatly, whether you see them or not. Even while parachuting I found that the enemy is more accurate at hitting me when im in the air, than when i stand still. It gets even more fustrating when you finally steal a chopper from the AI, only for it to be immediatly crashed, as the chopper accelerates the opposite direction when you latch on, or having it shot down by the enemies Anti Air. Another time I spawned in a garage where there is no exit, therefore, I had to load my last saved game. The resolution options are garbage, I had to go and customize the settings in order for the game to fit my screen, but it causes the game to not respond when minimized.           Other annoyances are the constant and repetitive AI speech ""stop right there citizen!"" as your freely roaming around. The driving mechanics seem as though your driving on ice. The auto aim in vehicles does not let you choose your target, unless you move the camera to the edge of the screen and it auto locking onto whomever is in the middle.            The side missions and pick up collectibles felt useless as it only builds your rank within a faction. The resaon it seemed so pointless is because 3/4 of the unlocks are weapons the enemies drop, while at the final stages of the rank is when you unlock the chopper, or rocket launcher. By that time I hadnt needed the extras, since I was already done with the story. It would have been better to preview the weapons before, to have fun with..before the unlock through the faction.

												This game created a massive challenge for me in scoring it, and deciding on wether or not I should reccomend it. On its own merits, it provides large amounts of fun and entertainment, at least for a while. The issue is, however, that there are better alternatives. Look, this review will 100% grade it on it's own, however, I am under the belief that if there's a better alternative, why get the lesser?StoryThis game has a typical Just Cause-esque action story, where you bring down an evil dictator ruling over a strong island. What I find unique is the inclusion of drug cartels, and being able to rank up with them and rebels in order to get better weapons. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a dictator removal specialist, and go through many missions in order to eventually remove the dictator.GameplayI actually haven't finished the game yet, but I have almost 10 hours of gameplay, so I can speak relatively well in this department. First, the cartels are essentially a carbon copy of the police and rebels, so there isn't too much interest there, aside from a little variation in missions. To gain their trust, you capture settlements owned by the purple cartel, or government. While it's fine at first, it's extermely repetitive, as it works the exact same every single time, with absolutely no variation aside from difficulty and weaponry, and perhaps the setting. The missions are fairly interesting, if not a little dull, but can provide some entertainment. Causing mayhem in this game is possible, with stealing cars, exploding police, etc, but can get a bit dull after a while, without enough variation. Exploration of the island would be great, as there are a few landmarks and interesting locations, but it's mostly boring and all the same, jungles and small towns.

It looks pretty fine, and never gets too distracting, unless your used to gorgeous looking games.

It really gives a good feeling, and fits in perfectly. It sounsd great. The sound effects work well, they sound exactly as they are and have fairly good quality. Dialoge is a little iffy, but it works alright. The only issue is when a random cop yells ""Stop, Citizen!"" over and over, it happens surprisingly a lot.CharactersThe characters are fairly generic and forgettable, with a few exceptions. Sheldon seems fairly interesting, with his generally secrative nature.Final VerdictJust Cause isn't a bad game by any means, but it's not perfect. It's a lot of fun to play, and enjoyable, however, there is a far surperior alternatives. Just Cause 2, for about 7 more dollars, provides much more gameplay and entertainment, and a much more polished game. For some more, buy Just Cause 3. It's a perfection of the idea, and delivers thousands of hours of potential gameplay. I would actually get the Just Cause Pack, selling both Just Cause 1 and Just Cause 2, on sale. You could grab it for about 2-5 bucks, and get 2 pretty fun games. If it isn't on sale, however, I can't recommend it. It isn't a bad game by any means, just too mediocre for the price and considering alternatives. I may change it to a reccomendation if the price for JC2/JC3 raises, or if Just Cause's price gets reduced to maximum 5 dollars. Just Cause gets a 6/10, grab it with Just Cause 2 on sale, or just get JC2/JC3 and skip it.FOOTNOTE: Guys, there is a difference between disagreeing with a review, and it being an actual terrible review. By no means do you have to agree with everything I said, but I was as real as I could be in it, not just giving 1 sentence of ""it crshed for me!"".			"

												I was at least 5 years too late on this one - pales in comparison to Just Cause 2 and with its dated graphics, I could not become invested in the world especially when it was so much better in JC2 (and possibly JC3).

												Just Cause.This game is good, but not memorable. It's an old game, and unfortunately it really shows it. Vehicle driving is far from fun, and while it *might* be better, with it a controller, good luck with that because there's no controller support.The game also feels rather unbalanced, with the majority of missions being completable with just the primary handguns, due to the fact they have infinite ammo and basically shoot as fast as you can click.The police are also a huge nusiance, they seem to be nearly aimbot accurate, and pursue you with a fierce passion and seem virtually unescapable, combine that with the unsuable vehicles and police chases are far from fun.Unless you wanted to experience the first game like me, or are going to get the game as part of a bundle, I'm just not sure I can recommend this game, with the exception of if it goes on sale (which it thankfully does).

												This game created a massive challenge for me in scoring it, and deciding on wether or not I should reccomend it. On its own merits, it provides large amounts of fun and entertainment, at least for a while. The issue is, however, that there are better alternatives. Look, this review will 100% grade it on it's own, however, I am under the belief that if there's a better alternative, why get the lesser?StoryThis game has a typical Just Cause-esque action story, where you bring down an evil dictator ruling over a strong island. What I find unique is the inclusion of drug cartels, and being able to rank up with them and rebels in order to get better weapons. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a dictator removal specialist, and go through many missions in order to eventually remove the dictator.GameplayI actually haven't finished the game yet, but I have almost 10 hours of gameplay, so I can speak relatively well in this department. First, the cartels are essentially a carbon copy of the police and rebels, so there isn't too much interest there, aside from a little variation in missions. To gain their trust, you capture settlements owned by the purple cartel, or government.

												This really feels like a PS2 game that belongs on mobile devices, but at this price that's really all you can expect. It must have been a pretty lousy PC port when it was being sold in 2006 at full price though, as the character models, cut scenes and physics are very poor compared to titles of the day. Its also very buggy (presumably little to no effort was made to patch it after release) and it lacks controller support which is weird for a console port.So, if you're looking to kill some time or you like retro game mechanics (no recoil, carrying 10 weapons at once, horrifically wooden animations years behind the game's peers) then this might be a cheap distraction. Just don't expect it to hold a candle to the GTAs of several years before.			"

												I wasted 1 day of my life to complete the game and be able to give this game this review. But before I get on to why this game is bad, allow me to share with you the good points of this game. First of all, there are many awesome vehichles, some better than others. Then, you have the different voices and attitudes of the Civillians. With these two good parts comes many bad things. The grapple is extremely glitchy, so 80% of the time you spontaneously die when grappled to helicopters/planes. It also will constantly detach, so the grapple is less of a fun and awesome tool and more of a chore. Speaking of planes, the planes will explode if you barely touch a tree or water. Also, you are a hippocrate. You are trying to overthrow a govt. that works with drug dealers,  uses violence on citizens, uses propaganda, and is perverted..... By working for a govt. that works with drug dealers, uses propaganda, and is perverted. (You are the one using violence on civillians). Also, your dialoge is horrible, as well as your jokes. Some missions in this game make no sense, such as protecting a car filled with money from destruction, than proceeding to get rid of said car and burn the money. All in all, this is Micheal Bay: The ""Game"". Kill it with explosions.			"

												Because whatever why not is a fantastic gaming concept executed very wrong, the game features a sandbox world where you take on missions to overthrow the local goverment and side missions to help the rebels take over city districts while combining cool stunts to vehicle exploration, but this game just doesnt pull off the sandbox world like jak 2/3 and gta of its time, helping rebellions take over towns can get you some better gear at safe houses but it really doesnt change the dynamic of the districts, goverment autoritys still go after you and rebels dont help you during story missions like they should(This game tries to do what inFamous perfected). This game hasnt aged well and I'm not comparing it to newer games when I say this, but older ones, playing this game in 2006 would have made me say the same things. The physics of the cars, the bahavior of the ai, the shooter mechanics, lack of ducking and cover, uninteresting guns and useless sniper rifle, rediclous mission setups, uninteresting side characters, protentious and steriotypical spanish hot shot as a lead character with horrible one liners. The game just doesnt stack up well, you cant save when you want half the time and are usually forced to complete missions to save your progress, the only practical way to beat somee missions is to abuse exploits, sometimes your weapons will disapear for no reason, glitches appear with every ai interaction, you randomly appear in off places after some missions, oh Lord the missions.. There is some unbalance to be had in the missions, either so hard that it's random or easy that you know they didn't go through to iron some missions out, but NOTHING compares to the final mission, it expects you to traverse a entire warzoned island with bombs soldiers and tanks blowing everything up at complete random with no check points, and fly a high speed jet and sky dive on a air plane, it's all luck and no skill which all ends with a horrible and cheesy boss that you didn't even know was a villain until the end.While fun and stunt worthy this game can be, the bad piles up to high. Avoid.			"

												Probably the worst game I have ever had the misfortune to play. Do not bother with it, skip straight to Just Cause 2, forget this was ever made. The side missions that let you gain control of regions are hugely repetitive. There seems to be no advantage to gaining control of regions, or doing tasks for the two factions you are supporting, other than getting better vehicles and access to safehouses. The driving mechanics feel floaty and leave you sliding all over the road. During these side missions, there is no checkpoint system, if you die, you will be transported to the nearest safehouse, leaving you often taking several minutes just to return to the area you were in, where you will promptly be randomly exploded again. Despite the somewhat random nature of death from vehicles or explosions, you can take ridiculous amounts of bullet hits before appearing injured, at which point your health will regenerate, but only to around 20%. Although your health doesn't regenerate, apart from some NPC drops there is no health-pack system, meaning the only way to return to full health is to go back to a safehouse and use a medical box there. The almost invulnerable period and the total lack of anything even remotely approaching a cover system means often the best technique when liberating settlements is just to run in and destroy the necessary items before capturing the flag, almost completely ignoring the enemy NPCs to complete it as quickly as possible. It doesn't feel like any progress is made when you're fighting the NPCs as not only can they take a huge amount of bullets too, but they seem to endlessly spawn, and will quite happily do so behind you, leaving you running around in the open shooting randomly (at which point you'll likely be run over and die). I'm not sure if they're glitches, but the police will constantly be shouting at you even if you have no ""heat"", and there is permanently a helicopter hovering somewhere near you. Which sometimes decides to shoot at those nearby. This probably wouldn't be a concern if I knew why it was there, if only I didn't have to constantly listen to a helicopter, which means if I'd like to peacefully explore the game's huge and impressive environment, I have to do it chaperoned by a damn noisy hovering annoyance. It's annoying when it turns out to be a police helicopter, which will start raining down missiles when you scratch someones car. There's a bizarre targeting system too, which sometimes auto-aims, and sometimes doesn't. Several times I blew myself up when the game decided I was aiming missiles at the guy who had just appeared three feet to my left, rather than the fuel tank which was my objective 50m away.			"

												Just Cause is a 3rd person shooter with a forgivably cheese ball story and a lot of cool ideas. You play as Rico Rodriguez, a suave secret agent type on a mission to overthrow the dictator of the Caribbean island San Esperito. There's a giant open world, a set of factions warring against the currently established government, a grappling hook that can shoot you towards cars/boats/planes/etc, and a parachute you can pull anytime your high enough off the ground. Unfortunately, it is in the execution of these ideas that the game starts to fall apart.     To start, the world of San Esperito is truly massive and pretty impressive for such an old game (2006). This seems great until you realize that it consists mostly of long stretches of dense forests and tall mountains that make traversing it a huge pain. The various planes, jets, helicopters, and boats all do a well enough job at getting you from point A to point B, heck even jumping off a high mountain and gliding with your parachute is a pretty quick way to get around, but running on the other hand is completely off the table and the ground vehicles are arguably just as bad of an option with crazy amounts of oversteer making driving less of a convenience and more of a challenge.     San Esperito is also populated with a few cities, some villages, and a couple of army bases. These all start off as government/cartel controlled but can be taken over. This is accomplished by first completing the story mission in the given area which will shift the surrounding areas from ""Government stable"" to ""Politically unstable"", unlocking the liberation missions for the respective group you will be aiding in the takeover, either the Rebels or the Riojas (an anti-government drug cartel). During these mission you run in with your allies and try to raise hell by shooting as many enemies as you can and generally blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. Again, this is a pretty cool idea, except in practice it can quickly turn into a ♥♥♥♥ show. Accidentally shot one of your allies while he was running around wildly in front of the enemies you were trying to take down? It is now his sole purpose in life to kill you dead. Did an ally bump you with his slow moving car when riding in to join the fight? The wonky vehicle collision will almost ensure that even at full health, you wont be getting back up. All of this gets even more chaotic in later portions of the game when both the police/army and your allies start bringing tanks and attack choppers into the fights and a stray missile sends you straight back to your safe house. Your reward for soldering through these missions is an area full a friendly faction members and some faction points which you accumulate in order to rise through the ranks of that particular faction, unlocking bases, weapons, and vehicles along the way.     Aside from these issues, the combat can actually be pretty fun and creative. The shooting is pretty basic (Headshots aren't a thing? come on!) with dropped health packs in favor of regenerating health, but cool tricks like throwing a grenade and then shooting it in mid air or raining bullets from above as you parachute across the battlefield help to spice things up. You can also highjack anything with an engine by aiming your trusty grappling gun at it and then reeling yourself in close enough to jump in the drivers seat, or just hitching a ride. This can add a whole new layer of mobility and strategy to large scale battles that you don't really see in most games. Its a shame that you can only use the grappling gun directly on vehicles as this could have led to some very inventive stuff.      Just Cause also makes sure to include the obligatory racing missions and collectables we see in most open world games. The races are pretty basic; you are the only participant racing to get to the next checkpoint on the map before a timer runs out. As tacked on as these are, I actually found them somewhat fun even though 8 of the 9 races involve the previously mentioned terrible driving mechanics. The collectables are out in the open for the most part and kind of a bore to collect. They don't really add anything to the game but you do get some faction points for collecting a full set. Speaking of which, before and after a liberation becomes available, the factions contact will be waiting nearby the settlements they are assigned to and will allow you to partake in side missions for some faction points. These boil down to fetch quests and ""go kill/blow up X/Y"", which are far from the most exciting things to do but will once in a while lead to an interesting offshoot, like ""go kill X"" but this time he's on a lightly guarded tanker on the ocean.     The core game is pretty short taking less than 5hrs to get through if you choose to ignore the fluff, like taking over settlements etc, in favor of rushing through the story missions. I also ran into problems with the games sound where I would be miles above the ground in a plane and hear a police officer shouting as though he was standing right next to me; not to mention not once being able to tell where a helicopter was in the sky based on the blaring propeller noises coming from seemingly nowhere. There were a few glitches as well where I would spawn inside buildings, fail to respawn completely, or have my helicopter zoom off into a wall or the ocean on its own after landing and getting out, but these were infrequent enough not to be much of a problem.     Overall, Just Cause has not aged very well. It can be a fun game when everything works as intended but it's short story with repetitive side content and a general lack of polish in some key areas all wrapped up in an 8 year old game keep me from being able to recommend this. 4/10.

What a game.-----Pros------Water and underwater are aesthetic.-Big map.-Plane controls arent that bad.-Hours (or minutes if you're a hax lord) of fun with main missions.-----------------------------------Cons-------Diving is extremely clunky.-Helicopters destroy your vehicle in 10 or so seconds.-Repetitive side missions.-Does not stand as it's own game without Just Cause 1 and 2.-Mostly jungle terrain with nothing to do.-No widescreen support (?)-Holy hell those cutscenes.---------------------------------------------------------------Sounds also seemingly come from no where at times. Or maybe Rico's just on a trip.----------------------------------------------------------------Overall, I give this game 2 chihuahuas out of 5.Get Just Cause 2/3 instead.However, if you just want some old fun, get this game.

												This game is fun and can be addictive, but things like the crap auto aim that cant be turned off, the so called ""grapple"" that just seems like a rope that shoots from a gun (and can only attach to vehicles that are moving), and the fact that you cant save when you want... they have to give you the option to do so. So if you liberate something and then on your way to another place to liberaate that, and then you die on the way there, you have to start from before you liberated the first place (from the last save). I want to love this game, i really really do, but the cons outweigh the pros soo much, the best part i can find about this game is the parachute and even thats a little iffy for me, i cant wait for my pc parts to come in so i can play just cause 2 its gunna be so much better than this.

												Firstly, for it's time this was an ambitious project and would have been impressive. That asside I am reviewing it as it is now, for sale here on Steam.You play a preset character but there is hardly any example where you exhibit any personality at all so picking a character would hardly effect your experiece.You start immediately, thrown into the action, which is awkward. You'll find instantly that you have very limited options when disposing of your enemies which is a shame because it has the endlessly funny old ragdoll physics similar to Spiderman 2 and Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction. You need more tools and things to play with for combat, or murder, to be of any interest.If you're like me you'll do some research on the story as you play as putting things into context is important but the story is not likely to immerse you or entertain you.With this in mind you will be given a large map to basically capture by yourself. You will have followers that come and go... mostly go as you they try to protect your grenades from loud noises.There is no real reason to capture the map, it's just pointless busy work - you gain access to better weapons and vehicles but personally it didn't change much for me. You don't have to capture everything, however, you can follow the story (which does have you completing side quests) and you'll get through them without much trouble.If you must know, should you play Just Cause 2 without playing this you will not miss out. Read up on the game on Google if you wish.Overall I cannot recommend this game based on what I have played - note that dated graphics/physics don't bother me so long as the mechanics are fun. Just Cause 1: 3/10 - Ambitious, sometimes fun yet asks too much with far too little.Recommended alternatives: Mercenaries: Playground of Destrution - 8/10Just Cause 2 - 7/10			"

												This game i played for about 5 hours before un installing it. if you make the mistake of buying it for the first 30 minutes you will wander round the island going through about 20 diferent vechles realising that there is nothing really unique about any of them apart from their different textures. Then you will realise that there is not much to do. So the you will shoot at an unfrotunate civilian who reacts in no way but to run away from you. the police and army will come and you will fight them for 5 minutes finding no enjoyment in the combat whatsoever. npcs do not react to bullets in any interesting way and the after a cretain point they will do quater of a backflip before dissapearing after a few seconds. then you will go through a series of weapons finding no iteresting diference in them. Writing this in narrator mode is going to take too long so i will make a list.- cars are undrivable and will spiral out of control too often- boats will come to you if you are in the water for no good reason- combat is too easy and there are very little ways you can deal with the enemies- missions are much to simalar, there is fatch and retrieve kill this guy kill theeses guys drive this to threre etc...- physics are terrible and boring- much of the map looks the same- the story is not that great- enemies are all the same despite different skins and you will be attacked for no apparent reason- sound effects are bad and soundtrack and sound effects are repeditive too muchThis is just an unfinished game im affraid. get just cause 2 they did a much better job on that one.

												Got this game to catch up with the story of Just Cause before gettings started with Just Cause 2.Had I gotten this game around 10 years ago I might have spent some time with it. Now, having played JC2 demo beforehand JC1 feels like choppy knock-off of GTA3 (in a jungle) with not so decent controls. Half an hour later I decided to skip this and go straight ahead to JC2.The game is not bad but so much has been improved in recent years that game play of Just Cause doesn't feel smooth enough to keep me captivated. Therefore I cannot properly justify nearly 8 GB download for this game but rather get JC2 instead. Why? Just 'cause.			"

												Before I begin, let it be known that I bought this because I loved Just Cause 2 so much. Had I experience this game prior to that one, I may have felt very differently about the original. This game feels very unresponsive in comparison to Just Cause 2. The engine just doesn't seem to know how to handle a car crash or a parachute landing. While the gameplay itself isn't completely horrible, the aiming is. The driving is. The crashing is even bad. The whole thing just feels terribly unrealistic (moreso than most videogames, anyway) and somewhat incomplete. I feel like they could have tweaked many little things to make this into a great game, but the finished product that was released is just garbage. If you want to try it out, wait for a sale. A good sale.3/10			"

												A decent GTA clone, most of it was a breeze, only very moderately challenging at times. Except for the last mission... the game dosen't prepare you at all for the finale. It's like giving a toddler a gun and telling him to kill the top ten individuals on the FBI's most wanted when the kid has only ever once handled a nerf gun. I swear it's a miracle to complete even the first part of the final mission, I only got through that part by going to the other end of the country to grab a jet so I could make it to my destination without dieing. It was fun while it lasted I guess, but there's really no poit in buying it unless your computer can't handle the second game. So yeah, lots of easy, and then the metaphorical stair builders make the last stair like, the height of all other stairs combined. I'm really torn between a thumbs up and a thumbs down, on the one side it was enjoyable but then again... Im talking in circles now, buy it don't buy it whatever.			"

												Considering how cheaply you can buy other FPS games, I really don't see a reason why JC would be a choice. Sure, if you wanted to fill out the JC collection, etc. But as far as gameplay and story line go, there were much better games that came out in '06 and since. If you liked JC2, this isn't really a ""how it began"", as I found the gameplay of JC2 to be far better (yes, more modern) but even games like HL2 (released two years prior) had better graphics and storytelling. Gotta say Metacritic was more favorable than I am.			"

												Honestly, Just Cause 1 is bad compared its sequel. Rico runs/walks like an Italian Mobster with a limp (which annoys me to no end), and for some reason, it lags while the second game runs flawlessly on my system. For a couple bucks extra, please buy Just Cause 2 instead (no major continuing storyline that needs to be followed, anyway), but if you're low on cash and dying to play an open-world game for a low price, there's nothing stopping you from buying the first game.

												I normally try to write a decent-length review of any game, but I just can't with Just Cause. I doubt I can even bring myself to finish it. One can summarise this game in a single word: Unfinished.The gameplay is utter ♥♥♥♥. The A.I. is buggy at best, and at worst (believe me, the worst does happen most of the time with this game) their poor programming will end up killing you. For example, I got onto a mounted machine gun on the back of a rebel (ie. friendly) truck. The driver immediately drove into a wall. I waited for about a minute for him to reverse, but he didn't. Therefore, I got of the truck. He then immediately reversed, ran me over, and stopped the car on top of me until I died, then drove off. Most missions are nearly identical, with only a change in scenery. The open-world is empty, which isn't necessarily a bad thing as long as there's something to look at. Unfortunately, there isn't. Enemies are impossibly easy to kill, and vehicle handling is atrocious.There basically isn't any sort of story, and there is definitely not a single ounce of characterisation. What story does exist is poorly written junk. I initially thought Just Cause's story was trying to be humorous and parodic of awful action movies, but then I realised it was just poorly written ♥♥♥♥ trying to act serious, when all it could do was move from cliché to cliché.I bought this game on offer, thinking that I couldn't go wrong with 80% off. I was very, very wrong.3/10			"

												This is a very good game on it's own. Why am I not recommending it then? The answer is the sequal. JC2 is better in almost every way.This game has auto-aiming guns, slower action, bad graphics, grapple hook limited to vehicles and you will go flyind out of your car whenever you hit something. Seriously the driving is terrible. I would only recommend this to someone looking for a bit of fun for 5-10 hours, after that it is just repetitive. The action will bore you fairly quickly. The map is basically the same, just forests and a few cities. Their is really no point in playing it now. Instead, you should buy GTA SA or JC2.6/10			"

												When reviewing ""old"" games, I tend to be tolerant in regards to technical aspects such as graphical fidelity, animation quality and overall presentation.Just Cause, released in 2006, is not a bad looker. Cranked up to the max, its video settings allow for some pretty stunning vistas in the huge tropical island of San Esperito.However, that's pretty much where the praise ends.The story has no depth at all. You're a US agent and your mission is to overthrow a Latin American dictator. Along the way, you'll be assigned some the most forgettable seek-and-destroy missions the gaming world has ever seen, usually consisting of:1. Being briefed by terribly voice-acted, stereotypized characters;2. Getting to terms with the nearest vehicle's shoddy handling in order to reach your objective as quickly as possible;3. Storming a government base, guns blazing (forget about stealth), walking through fire from a hundred mindless, respawning enemies (good luck getting cover from helicopter miniguns, though), planting a few C4 charges and leaving.That's it. Very simplistic gameplay coupled with terrible artifical intelligence. That's Just Cause in a nutshell.I wouldn't recommend it by 2006's standards, and I most certainly won't recommend it now.			"

												i am writing this largely because i have not seen anyone mention the god awful keyboard mapping which i know sounds impossible for a pc game just for simply including it....but no its worse than the usual console port.first of all it does not show every action particulary for vehicles having a number of actions being hard set on the mouse.............which brings me to the worst part it maps mouse movement which sounds great...........but it's not.....it's really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ not. If you want to map anything, if you so much as glance at the mouse it will input a mouse dirction instead.Also they have EVERY menu contol be controlled by the arrow/directional keys.......and you can't change it so if you use WASD for movement (which most do) you can go ♥♥♥♥ your self.This might be worth it if this was a good game but as others have clarified it is just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ verison of Just Cause 2.i could go on about the game its self but others have already talked about most of the problems.DO NOT BUY even on sale as i did.

												This game has too many problems with the gameplay.The driving it's one of the worst I've seen on this genre. In GTA III it was stable but ""jumpy"" on some parts. In Saints Row 1 & 2 they weren't good but at least you could stay on the road. Here the vehicles have low gravity.You can't use your weapons in any vehicle while everyone else can and the only way to do so it's by getting on top of the vehicle while driving and -for some damn reason you can still drive the car- be a target practice for them.The Army helicopters are a nightmare and the only way to survive them in the missions it's zigzagging down the road until you get to a checkpoint or finish it. Because by just trying to get in a car they will shoot rockets at you like there is no tomorrow. Rocket launchers have a very small limit of 4 rockets and it's not worth using them against the choppers because they will always come back.Doing a mission on foot it's the worst idea you can have, unless it's the only choice you have. You can't run, you are an easy target and you will never get to destiny if you are on a timer.The last missions can ♥♥♥♥ you up in ways you can't imagine. All the enemies going bumper car against you, helicopters spamming rockets, and then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tells you to escape before the island explodes while all of the previous things happens. If you don't have a vehicle, it's game over.And then there is the  island assault  on the last mission. Sometimes you don't even get to the actual part of the mission before they blow you up. And if you get lucky, you are going to need more than that because It's ♥♥♥♥ing WWIII and it doesn't help that you are not alone fighting over there. They don't protect you from the missile rain of the jets and helicopters.Overall, this game flaws will frustrate you at the end. But it's good to see that it's not a GTA clone in any ways.  Looking at you SR 1&2. I don't recommend buying this game at full price and alone. Buy the Just Cause Collection on discount and you will not feel ripped off.			"

												This game is one of these titles that are good, but just not good enough..Simplifying my experience and trying to be short:pros:-A very nice setting, the nature design and the size of the map are nice for a 2006 game of the genre. Note huge, but not small either.-Pretty nice graphics texture and color wise, the sea and the jungle were very beautiful and offered a great tone during the gameplay.-Great variety of weapons and neat explosion effects.-Though simple but satisfying enough weather effects.-Faction based minigames and side missions that offer some replayability (though it depends how easily bored you can get consider the whole)cons:-The sound quality is a buggy mess. You can keep hearing shouts ""freeze citizen!"" and ""alto alto! this nis the police!"" even if you are like alone in the freakin woods, hell you even hear them when you are driving a plane 10 miles above ground. You also get to hear vehicle sounds that are unnaturally far away from you.-Too many helicopters flying around. I mean seriously, TOO MANY.-Grappling hook only works on moving vehicles. For some reason anything esle is pure glass surface (thankfully this was fixed in Just Cause 2)-Cheesy characters with stupid lines, hard to feel any urge to connect with them. Even the main hero is so out of interest.-Physics that are not good at all.. You can't have rock hard car suspensions and airplanes that fly like pieces of woodsticks when games like GTA San Andreas have already been out there setting the example.-A main story that's not interesting at all.recommended?Not really sure.If you are a fan of the genre and you like trying old games, juicing out ideas and gain opinion on some things, its not a bad title to play. In any other case I can't recommend this game. I doupt it's even worth buying even if its cheap as hell right now. There's so many other titles out there that can offer you a far better experience and you get nothing to lose story-wise about the franchise since Just Cause 2 stands alone on that matter.			"

												I bought this game on sale /after/ having played through the sequel (one of my favorite sand box games, btw). I played a bit of it, out of curiosity. It's not a terrible game, but it's not a good game either. The latin style to the game (found EVERYWHERE in the game) is a nice change of pace from the GTA and GTA clones, but not enough to compensate for flat gameplay and dumb-as-they-come AI. I don't think I would have liked this game at release - in fact the only reason I'm being ""as kind"" about the game is because of how much I enjoyed the sequel.			"

Just Cause leaves little reason to buy unless it's 'just cause.'Pros: GraphicsCons: Controls, Story, Gameplay, BugsFor a game released in 2006, Just Cause looks great in some places: the water and the sky look amazing.  Other places, however, are best rushed over.Just Cause is simply a bad port of a relatively old and mediocre game.  The controls are awful; even the AI seems to have trouble driving.  The story is copy-paste: military badass defeats evil dictator and his lackeys.  The gameplay is boring and unbalanced.  Huge stretches of terrain separate virtually identical 'liberations' that have no impact on the story.  Enemies can deliver small scratches or one-hit kills.  There are no difficulty settings.  As previously mentioned, the game is a bad port: no resolution support, no controller support, and a number of bugs.As the game's cast may put it, Just Cause is a 'gigundo' mess.6/10			"

												2 / 10 - I won't say bad, I'll say ""utter lack of fun"".So I tried to be fair. I gave it over two hours, and kept thinking ""give it time, it'll improve"". Well, it doesn't. The story is a mess, with structure being kept as a mere illusion, feels like the only reason there even was a story was so that they could say ""has single-player story mode"". The graphics are ok I guess, but the interactions are primitive at best. Enemies (which aren't easily told apart from allies, all wear uniform) have two modes - alive and dead. Shoot one in the chest/leg/balls/head and the only indication for a hit is a small complementary blood splatter. Headshots only work for innocent civilians. Besides, the entire health system is too unreal, even for a game. A grenade/car exlpodes right next to you - you don't die. You empty a pistor magazine at an enemy - he doesn't die. What gives? This isn't a game from the 90's, it's from 2006. I've expected so much more from the trailer... and I have no problem with old game, been playing Baldur's Gate and Starcraft 1 for the past two months. But this game is simply a let down. I usually make a habbit of playing all titles of a franchise by order, but in this case all I have left to do is try Just Cause 2 and hope it salvages the name. If it doesn't - it will have been a sad, disappointing and frustrating waste of money.			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  The promise of a fun an entertaining game is under the hood, and that is what laid the foundation for a much better game in Just Cause 2.  Unfortunetly this one is riddled with issues that cannot be overlooked.Pro's:Big Open World that encourages and rewards exploration with many things to do.Full City Liberation missions are fun unlike the military base ones.Cons:Horrible A.I. for both friendlies and enemies.  Friendly A.I. will run you over in cars they took during liberation missions meanwhile enemy A.I. is just a tad bit more intelligent than the A.I. in Aliens Colonial Marines which has one of the worst enemy A.I's of all time.Enemy Helicopters can follow you around the whole map and can pinpoint you even under heavy foliageSide Missions are highly repetitive and lose their lustre,  especially when trying to liberate a military base where you can't tell who's friendly or enemy based on clashing color schemes.Vehicles handle like garbage.  Seriously why does a light tap on the keyboard induce a power slide on a jeep.This game stutters during combat after about an hour of gameplay and this issue can only be fixed with a restart.All in all this game is best left unplayed.  If you want to play a finished and more polished version of this game than I recommend you just play Just Cause 2.			"

												Really?I load up GTA Vice City, and I am able to reasonably begin playing. San Andreas and many more titles from this time period have recieved at least a bit of controller support updating. (even if it was usually a community effort)Obviously people are going to WANT to play this game.  I absolutely love JC2, and I want to be able to play this game.  It is beautiful and much more appealing than GTA as an open-world title I can share with my kids. (GTA has too much bad language and insinuations I prefer my kids don't hear at their age)I can't even select the top resolution 1600 x 1200, and I needed a quick file from the web to 1920 x 1080 it.Even with a KB mapper, my controller is not gradually easing on a curve, or slowly accelerating.  It is an ON/Off thing.You are either FULL ON or FULL OFF on what would normally be an expected analog experience.  driving is a nightmare once up to speed, and I try to save my wrists from extra KB&M work.  This is not comfortable AT ALL.The game loads great, and with the fix it is really beautiful to look at.  I played a very short time before I just couldn't take it.  There is nothing about this that is going to make me want to finish the title.With so many people gearing up for JC3, don't you think a big name company could afford a little bit of effort to bring this experience up to standard?This is yet another time where I have attempted to go back to earlier titles and have been let down due to lacking support.  Plenty of big IPs have received some sort of touching up, there is really no excuse.  Outdated visuals are fine, but lacking basic controller support is unfair.  How is there not even support for my older Gravis or other gamepads?  The game seriously came out back then WITHOUT ANY CONTROLLER SUPPORT??? Why would a company decide to release a game on a console, and then not offer PC players the comfort of a controller?  This is junk thinking.Unless the game gets an update, or you don't mind KB&M or the process of KB mapping, just get the game on a console (I rarely say that)			"

												Please note: I did not play this game when it first released in 2006, so this review will be written from that perspective.For an open world game, the main story campaign of Just Cause has only 21 missions and can be completed in just 7 hours. It was originally released in 2006, but compared to a similar open-world styled game GTA San Andreas which was released earlier in 2004, Just Cause is clearly a much more inferior game in comparison.Even though the story of Just Cause wasn't supposed to be anything special other then a typical action game, but it looked like they didn't even bother to try to at least pretend to tell a story. Every single mission is about 2 people sunbathing and drinking wine and telling you to blow ♥♥♥♥ up. Yes i'm not kidding.There are alot of things wrong with it. Firstly, it is a very poor console port, where you can't even use the mouse on the main menu. Graphics look painfully inadequate even by 2006 standards especially the enemies death animations where every single one of them does this same ""jump back horizontally look"" when they die.Vehicle handling is atrocious, cars and airplanes are just way too sensitive in their controls. Also, try driving a motorcycle around, and look at what happens when an oncoming truck rams you....wait for it. Nothing happens. Your motorcycle just goes to a sudden stop. Just Cause really feels like one of those 1st generation substandard Open-World GTA clones and is a very good example of how NOT to do an open world game.That said, it introduces the now series trademark stunt hijacking of vehicles which will probably feel very fresh when released in 2006, but is let down by the fact that the vehicles themselves are really no fun to drive in. The eclectic latino sounding soundtrack however is pretty good and i did enjoy listening to that.I know it may not be fair for me to review this game in 2012, which is close to 6 years after its original release. Then again, playing Just Cause 1 lets me appreciate Just Cause 2 even more lol. I must say that I am happy that Avalanche Studios saw what was wrong in JC1 and made JC2 a much better game and carve out its own unique identity.Overall Rating: 3.0 / 10Horrible game. Don't buy it even If you are thinking of getting it because you enjoyed Just Cause 2. You won't miss out on any story elements or anything and you're better off just playing Just Cause 2 instead.

												if you enjoyed playing just cause 2 and you want to play this, then this is the game for you. At least that's what I thought in the first place, but my just cause 1 experience ended up in an incredibly laggy game. When you boot the game for the first time, Rico will jump out of an airplane and you have to land him on the nearest beach. In non-laggy mode this would take about a minute or two, but it took about 20 minutes for me to do that.My average frame rate is below 1 fps and my system (laptop) is about 2 weeks old: - Intel Core i7 @ 2.4 gHz - 16 GB 1600 mHz DDR3 - AMD Radeon HD 8870m GDDR5 2GB - Windows 8.1Conclusion:Only buy this game if your system is the best of the best and if you really want to play the predecessor of the amazing Just Cause 2.The world is big, though empty.

 Nothing special about this game. It is playable to say the best. Cons:- Open world game with no reason to explore other than activating missions.- Missions are repetitive, specially faction mission, which happens always with the same npc, giving even less reason to explore the world.- You can't shoot while on cars, while your enemies can. Or i didn't find out how to do it. You're defenseless while in car.- It has ""turret missions"" with auto-aiming. Just hold the mouse button and you'll win.- The diversity of stunts are limited.- Shooting is bland, no cover, just run and gun. Very arcade.- Bugged, some vehicles don't work. There are some physics bug that makes your vehicle fly all over the map (can be a bit funny tho').- You can't run nor can't crouch. Going anywhere on foot takes forever.- Unbalanced. Spawning feast of enemies all over you. You dont get any sort of upgrades such as armors.- Playing with mouse and keyboard is possible, but it is really bad. (i've finished the game with K+m)Pros:- It has physics for such old game (details such as car's window and doors breaking)- Open world- Good vehicle variety, helos, tanks, planes, boats. Including some armed vehicles, such as military ones.Unless you're REALLY into this kind of game and has run out of options: Don't waste your time.Avoid it as much as possible.			"

												This was truly a game that got better with the sequels. Though I am happy that Eidos went through with the subsequent sequels, it's safe to say that this game is only worth it for the terrible plot, voice acting, and trying to master the art of getting into flying vehicles with the grappling hook. Aside from that, the side quests are tedious and not worth doing, the travel time from key mission to key mission is mind numbing, and the countless glitches. I'm currently stuck on the second to last level of the game because it's missing key cutscenes. As for other bugs, certain cars with turrets will glitch by rotating uncontrollably and messing with the turning mechanics of the car. I would switch to the rocket mode of the tank, and it hurled me into the sea with its violent rotations - like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonsensical helicopter. Also, sometimes when you try to steal someone elses car, the door comes flying off. The resolution is a minor gripe, but the game is still beautiful for the time that it was in.  Just Cause this game will be cheap as hell, doesn't mean you should buy it. Really - skip this one. You'll save yourself hours of frustration over a plot you don't care about.			"

It was better in every way this game is like a GTA only while driving you have the option to ""Stunt"" at any given time the game expects you to utilize this Lame ""Stunt"" option to get around the game at 4x speeds and to enter certain camps it really makes the game look and feel unprofessional and linear AF Mercenaries is the EXACT same game but more love was put into making it Destructable buildings Decent Story NO ""Stunt"" option just barel roll out of a flaming vihicle the reason Im writing a review for Mercenaries on this games page is because this game was stolen and they did a terrible job.

												Heard good things about it's sequel, but I would strongly advise against buying this one. I bought this real cheap, but I still have to say it was a waste of money.Gameplay in itself might not be bad, nor the graphics considerings it's age (the best bet to find an enemy is actually tracing back where the bullets come from, as people tend to be really hard to spot for some reason), but controls are just really really sloppy. The one thing that comes to mind when having to control your character is syrup. Figure that would give an idea.Some people I know like it though, but I can't really see why.So my advice: even for a real bargain, leave this one in the shelf and spend your money on anything else (possibly Just Cause 2).

												I'm just going to say this now, Just Cause is the poor man's GTA.When you look at this game for the first time the first thing to you come to is ""this is fun"". 2nd time: ""it's okay"". 3rd: ""why am not playing GTA instead"". 4th: there is no 4th, you're too busy playing GTA to care about this game. To be honest, after 2 hours this game felt more like a chore then an actual game. Do this, do that (the plot of the game right here). Speaking of plot, here my impression of it: you here at this island because f*%# you that's why to liberate from an oppressive government and giving control of the island to practically terrorist because F*%# you that's why. You can have fun with this as long as you don't actually play the game. Some of your mission are also impossible. If you are doing a mission where you are screwing with the drud dealers, prepare to be absolutely rekt. Hotline Miami is less frustrating then the drug dealer missions. They will chase you with an infinite set of enemies until your missions are over. Ohter than that, there are two other frustrating things about this game, enemy helicopters and the grapling hook. The grapling hook works when it wants to (which is not very often) and enemy helicopter will somethings respwn endlessly during missions. Blow it up and it's back in three seconds.story/ actual game: 0/10not playing the actual game: 5/10			"

												This game is a little bit of fun but has some problems.  The cars are difficult to drive.  The NPC's spawn 10 feet away from you.  It's frustrating having to walk/drive/fly back to your destination when you get killed.  The world is huge but not spectacular.  Unless you stick with only the story missions, the game becomes very repetitive.  The game has not aged well in terms of graphics.  Skip this game and play Just Cause 2.			"

Everything from cars that skid around as if they were driving on ice, keep in mid this game takes place on a tropical island, to bullets completly going through enemies. I've also never seen such bad driving skills by the NPC's before in a game. 30 Minutes in and I already have witnessed 5 motor accidents.

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME, BUY JUST CAUSE 2.I really wanted to enjoy this game, but while it was fun at times, it was really frustrating when cars were involved. It has some of the worst driving mechanics and physics, and getting hit by a car is most of the times instakill. Do you think bullets kill you in this game? Oh no, most of my deaths were at the hand of my allies, that decided to park their car over my body during liberations. And they always park exactly at the point I was standing on. So the most important advice for this game is: NEVER STAY ON THE ROAD DURING LIBERATIONS.When it comes to the map, Just Cause devs thought that having a bigger map would make the game better, but it backfires right at the beginning of the game, once you realize that locations are too far from each other and going from A to B is a chore. Wouldn't be too bad if the map wasn't so lazy. All settlements and villas look almost identical with slight differences. There were some interesting points on the map that felt like a mission would take place there, but were completely unused. If the map was halved it would have been much more convenient and enjoyable. It's really not worth playing, unless you just want to breeze through the story, which is pretty short. I ended up 100% the game, which is not worth it when you don't get rewarded. However, Just Cause 2 is much much better and worth every cent. Or just wait for Just Cause 3 and play that one if it ends up being good. No point playing all of them in this case.			"

												You get what you pay for to be honest. The graphics are not to impressive. This game is far from the best but also not the worst. It has its moments the missions are fun for the most part. The side missions are repetitive and not fun to play after a couple of them. The game will glitch out on the occasion and for those reasons above my feelings are mixed about it. The game has its moments but also has some flaws. If I were to rate this game out of 10 it would be a 6/10. Purely due to the repetitive side missions, annoying glitches and, fairly disappointing graphics for being an early Xbox 360 game. I will not recommend the game though because if you are not a lenient person and cannot bare the flaws above you will have a bad time playing this game.			"

												Whilst I love the mechanics and story, the bugs in this game are so bad that I can't recommend it to anyone. As an example, during one of the missions, you are told to steal a truck full of drugs and deliver it to a certain location. Upon stealing the truck, a car chase begins. This wouldn't be a problem, except when the vehicles chasing you ram into your truck, they stick to it as though they've been dipped in glue. No amount of swerving, sudden stopping, reversing, or any other aversive maneuver will get them off your truck. These attached vehicles also slow you down to snail's crawl and in less than a minute, your truck full of drugs blows up.  "

Ever since I picked up Just Cause months ago, I've stopped resting my laptop on my testicles, instead I've been resting my testicles on my laptop.

												Loved this game.  I bought it super cheap a while back, it is worth every penny. Youll have many stories to laugh at with other people who have played it. I was being chased by an attack chopper, and another car spawned in front of me, I smashed into it, the car shot up into the air spinning end over end and hit the attack chopper in the air..It was GLORIOUS.Other people mentioned how difficult the last part of the game is, I have to agree, it was mostly jarring more than actually difficult.Exploring, goofing off etc is alot of fun. The cartel/guerilla missions are OK, although VERY repetative.I found saving to be kinda annoying, as you couldnt save anywhere you wanted, you have to go to specific spots that you unlock, which in general isnt that bad, since you can get dropped off there, just an extra unneeded step.It also has a tendancy to want to go into slow mode camera view, and when you have a timer, it doesnt actually slow down time..so if youre in slow motion for 15 seconds, thats 15 seconds off the timer. So drive carefully when you have a time limit.In the end, it was alot of fun, and I cant recomend it enough, especially if its on sale.			"

												If you've ever wondered what a game version of the webcomic ""Manly Guys Doing Manly Things"" would look like, here's a latino take on it. Drive cars, base jump, grapple onto vehicles and steal them. As ridiculous as it may feel while doing it and however cheezy the backstory may feel, I couldn't help but find myself smiling while playing and trying all kinds of vehicles. Just Cause really *is* over the top machismo that just can't be taken seriously, but it's makes for a few hours of fun nonetheless.			"

												The game was fun back in it's day, and it looked amazing, but the PC version is not as good as the 360 version.

												In the standard tradition of Steam Summer Sales reinvigorating Bargain Bin Breakdowns I bring you, Just Cause.  I picked up the first two in the series, and their included DLC content for an amount low enough not care what the games were. Having been part of a franchise that I recognized I knew they couldn’t be total crap, right?Purchased and installed they sat there, icons on the desktop, being ignored while double clicks would happen elsewhere.  Two icons over LEGO Worlds gets a double click, on the other side of the screen Quake 4 is the proud recipient of a click followed by and press of ‘Enter’ on the keyboard.  Team Fortress 2, Fallout 3, Resident Evil 4, Race to the White House, Minecraft, Chips Challenge, even the Recycling Bin were all getting more click-action.  Until I finally decided to hover the cursor atop its icon and give it the grace of the double-click.  Why, after all this time did I finally take this step?  Just cause.As of writing I’ve logged five hours playing Just Cause and while that’s not enough time to provide a fair and honest review, I’m gonna do one anyway.  Just cause.Things start off with a free fall from the back of a plane where I need to meet up with a contact on a beach.  The first time I did this I opened my parachute earlier than I meant to, then closed it and reopened it again, and again and again, and again. I guess Rico(the main character) has a hundred reserve chutes or maybe he can fold them up and repack them quickly?  After a while I just decided to belly flop into the ocean, die, and start this crazy mess over.  Only I didn’t die.  Falling from really high up, gaining speed by holding my body tight and pointing down and I just splash like it was a five foot high dive.I stared at the screen for a moment or two, awe struck, slightly annoyed. Seconds went by and I noticed the lack of a breathing reminder. So I waited, and waited, and waited some more.  Never did I see anything informing me of a need to exit the water to breath nor did I suffer to the fate of suffocation.  I’m going to hope the developers went with this route because of some aspect of the game I haven’t experienced yet, and not just cause.Once I restarted and made it to the beach proper I helped my contact guy fight off some other people and then we left in his truck. During the truck ride I got to see the auto-aiming performed by the mounted gun in the back of the truck. I’m starting to notice a trend of ‘easy mode’, is this because I’m playing on an easy difficulty?  Maybe, I don’t know, but I’m not complaining about it.  I’ve reached the point where I’d rather have a enjoyable casual gaming experience than getting worked up because its too much of a challenge.We make it to the base or hideout, or whatever it is, where I get a cut scene leading me into the first real mission.  What that actually is I haven’t a clue since I’m focused on how this guy talking to me is completely trying to be Sam Axe from Burn Notice. But whatever, lets get this pony show on the road.  I leave that place check around my surrounding and find a motorcycle, so I hop on and start driving towards the point marked on my map, just cause.At some point I passed a police car and they yelled “Stop!” and hit the lights/sirens combo.  I thought ‘Wow, that’s awesome it detected me speeding, this is going to a fun challenge to play!‘ So I stopped, and the police car pulled up and they got out.  I got off my motorcycle, not knowing what to expect, then they shot me. I guess I should have expected this.  Although I don’t know what it was that triggered them to attack me, but the police yelling at you constantly is an annoying part of the game, just cause.I think it was somewhere around here that I realized I was playing a mob-less tropical-island-based Grand Theft Auto. Don’t immediately take that as a bad thing, the GTA franchise is one of the best ones out there.  And sure, there are other games out there that put you in an open world like that, Mafia is another that comes to mind.  But I mark GTA with that distinction since it was at least the first one I played.The main story didn’t grab me as I had hoped, I went and broke some guy out of prison and instead of him wondering why I would do that having never met me, he had me join him.  Which was good, since the reason why I was to break him out was so I trick him into letting me join his group. I feel like the leader of a rebel group would question the guy  he’s never met before that breaks him out of prison. I guess he decided to just cause.I did a couple main story line missions before I discovered the side missions.  Missions where you help liberate small villages from different armies or something.  Those were fun, repetitive, but fun. You would basically work your way up a road taking out roadblocks along the way until you reached either a flag that needed capturing or a leader that needed killing.  I would fly my helicopter to a mission marked on the map, liberate the town, and then steal the helicopter parked on the roof of the building.  Then fly off to the next one. I did this for a couple hours, and I had more fun than I had playing the main storyline. I’m not trashing the story or anything, it just didn’t grab me like liberation missions did.From what I’ve seen Just Cause is the child of Far Cry and Grand Theft Auto’s wild night in Vegas. They’ve taken pieces from both and created this whole new thing. Its not terrible, its not amazing, it just is, just cause.			"

												Woo, finally finished the game, that's one less game on backlog to worry about!Not bad. Game is similar to Mercenaries 2 World in Flames (M2 WIF) if you've ever heard/played that before this - I did. Too bad there's no multiplayer/campaign/story co-op, like there was for M2 WIF but I didn't have the game when the servers were up.There are some bugs and glitches that still need to be patched(such as random crashes to desktop, missing liberator mission giver, and audio glitches - probably because I just upgraded my lappy to win10; I don't think it happened back when I was running win7 on it - which probably means there needs to be a patch to make it stable for win10 users) but I don't think that's gonna happen from the devs as this game is a few years old from release date.Yeah, like I said - Nooot bead...now to start Just Cause 2 sometime....

												Sorry to say it, Just Cause, but we're through. Sure, you were an amusingly politically incorrect GTA Vice City rip-off set in pseudo-Latin America, and you might have been fun in your day. But there are so many unanswered questions. What's the point of doing stunts? Can I ever get a better gun or vehicle? Why do I have to go to YouTube walkthroughs just to find my way to (and through) the main story points? And your reply was always, ""Just 'cause."" Sorry, J.C., I may try your sequel some day, but as of today you are (sniff) uninstalled.			"

												To start, this game is not Just Cause 2, it is very different, but needs to be evaluated on its own merit.The game feels as if you are in some cheap action movie, where the plots are see-through, characters shallow, and explosions massive.The game is rather buggy, and AI is not very smart.  The open world makes up for the other shortcomings.  You can truly do anything in this area.8/10			"

												Short Review:The game is dated and its age clearly shows. When I first got the game, the user reviews were mostly positive. Now it's mixed, so you can probably tell from that too. Full Review:- Gameplay & GraphicsWhile the scenes in the video look nice, playing it in 2014 with a 1680 x 1050 resolution and later in 2015 with a 1920 x 1080 resolution makes me feel like crying. If you force the game to full screen, it's pixelated, else it's small. I could adjust my default screen resolution to suit the game, but this simply reinforces that the game is outdated. It may be good in 2006, but certainly not now. The controls are your typical WASD and mouse interaction, while for the gameplay itself, I did not fully explore the game so I cannot offer a full storyline review. However, from my early stages in the game, it takes way too long to travel from one point to another with little to offer. While Far Cry also requires you to walk a long distance, at least you get to hunt some game. Not in Just Cause 1. It's just holding W and hoping someday, you get there.- AudioThe music and sound effects are pretty average in my opinion. I'm not a fan of it, but taste is subjective.- VerdictDon't buy it, even it's for a really cheap 90% discount. Unless you're using an older and smaller computer, you've played it before and you want to play it again. In that case, follow your desire.			"

												Haven't played the sequel so I can't compare JC1 to JC2.It's a pretty fun game, one I would definitely recommend to kill some time, but there could be some improvements. For starters, the missions get pretty repetitive which doesn't keep me playing for very long. The American character voices seem....off. Not like lips moving before audio plays, but you can tell when you hear them. Overall, pretty decent. Buy it when it goes on sale though.			"

												The first open world game I ever played. I had heard alot of negative things about this game before I played it, so I was expecting it to be ♥♥♥♥. But it wasn't. I loved it, and still do. Hopefully there will be a remake/remaster of this game soon, but for now stick to this. If you've played other just cause games before this one you'll only like it if you expect it to be ♥♥♥♥. Pros:-Beautiful graphics for it's time-Amazing soundtrack-Grappling hook can only grapple onto vehicles. This makes the game much harder and more challenging.-Good skydiving-Very fun missions-Funny glitches-Good flying-Cool slow-motion and low gravity driving that makes you either laugh your ♥♥♥ off or ragequit-Can run smoothly on almost any computerCons:-Some missions aren't really made very well and can be very frustrating (like one mission where you need to steal a truck with boxes inside of it)-Free roaming is not very fun-Side missions are very repetitive-There are only 3 or 4 resolutions in the game menu, but it can by doing this:

												The only reason to play this game in 2017, ten years after its release is for a sense of nostalgia. Here are my notes from playing the game.  The base game looks extremely dull. This is a port of the original Xbox version and it looks bad even for a 2005 game. The game has no controller support and it is better to play with a keyboard and mouse. I had to look at the forums to fix  the widescreen and shadow problems and had to use SweetFX to brighten things a bit. Animation and AI feel so old, its nostalgic. It appears to be on par with Mass Effect: Andromeda. :P The game features very silly plot and dialog with funny looking character models. Bare minimum of instructions, I didn't know I had to free the first area before I could save the game. There is constant police & helicopter noise in the background and it is very annoying. Capturing the various areas is fun at first but gets repetitive fast. I don't remember seeing a difficulty setting. It was extremely easy. Guns have autoaim and it is enough to shoot somewhere near the enemies. There is no regenerating health except for a tiny portion but enemies drop health packs regularly. Grappling hook is not as good as in JC2 but it can be used to skyjack helicopters. The world is vast but feels lifeless compared to GTA and the first Saints Row from around the same time. Four wheelers handle very poorly, there is no way to set a waypoint and the map is barely functional. Fortunately, there is something like taxi in GTA to avoid driving yourself. Every session after playing for an hour or two, the game begins to feel like its going to crash soon, this is remedied by restarting the game. The game crashed unexpectedly 2 times in total, not bad for a 10 year old game.Just the main story takes around 8 hours to finish. Liberating the areas is not really necessary for progress. I had extremely low expectations and the game is okay for what it is.			"

In no other game you can grapple onto helicopter and jets during flight and take control over them by beating the **** out of their pilot.11/10 would do an aerial takedown of a jet from a motorcycle again.

												5 words: Grand Theft Auto: San EsperitoI love this game. If your computer is old and can't run JC2, this game is quite fun and enjoyable. Open world, lots of shooting, over throwing the government, free Vehicles on the black market rather than having to pay for them with your hard earned in game money. It's great, and it's cheap.

												Short Review:The game is dated and its age clearly shows. When I first got the game, the user reviews were mostly positive. Now it's mixed, so you can probably tell from that too. Full Review:- Gameplay & GraphicsWhile the scenes in the video look nice, playing it in 2014 with a 1680 x 1050 resolution and later in 2015 with a 1920 x 1080 resolution makes me feel like crying. If you force the game to full screen, it's pixelated, else it's small. I could adjust my default screen resolution to suit the game, but this simply reinforces that the game is outdated. It may be good in 2006, but certainly not now. The controls are your typical WASD and mouse interaction, while for the gameplay itself, I did not fully explore the game so I cannot offer a full storyline review. However, from my early stages in the game, it takes way too long to travel from one point to another with little to offer. While Far Cry also requires you to walk a long distance, at least you get to hunt some game. Not in Just Cause 1. It's just holding W and hoping someday, you get there.- AudioThe music and sound effects are pretty average in my opinion. I'm not a fan of it, but taste is subjective.- VerdictDon't buy it, even it's for a really cheap 90% discount. Unless you're using an older and smaller computer, you've played it before and you want to play it again. In that case, follow your desire.			"

												To start, this game is not Just Cause 2, it is very different, but needs to be evaluated on its own merit.The game feels as if you are in some cheap action movie, where the plots are see-through, characters shallow, and explosions massive.The game is rather buggy, and AI is not very smart.  The open world makes up for the other shortcomings.  You can truly do anything in this area.8/10			"

												It might have been okay for it's time...but it's nowhere near the GTA series...even of the time. I found myself disinterested in the world and the game is too ""random"". AKA if you look away from a car on the road and turn your back again the car will be gone or replaced. This applies to vehicles that are being driven on the road too. The game play is pretty repetitive as well but fortunately you dont have to do the repetitive missions to progress the story (unlike in Just Cause 2). So you can beat it and get it over with reaaaaally fast.			"

												Sorry to say it, Just Cause, but we're through. Sure, you were an amusingly politically incorrect GTA Vice City rip-off set in pseudo-Latin America, and you might have been fun in your day. But there are so many unanswered questions. What's the point of doing stunts? Can I ever get a better gun or vehicle? Why do I have to go to YouTube walkthroughs just to find my way to (and through) the main story points? And your reply was always, ""Just 'cause."" Sorry, J.C., I may try your sequel some day, but as of today you are (sniff) uninstalled.			"

												I'll be frank. The original Just Cause was extremely advanced for the time, allowing for vertical gameplay, an absolutely MASSIVE world map, capture-the-territory regime change mechanics, car stunts and a politicized CIA story archetype which is pretty distinctive in its conceptualization by Avalanche Studios. I originally played this game for the Xbox 360 at a friend's house and was completely blown away by the freedom the game afforded, its solid controls and its then-gorgeous graphical detail.The PC port does it a disservice by being so janky. I personally believe it's almost impossible to advance in the game because the vehicular and combat controls were originally designed for the 360 version and were then effectively rebound to a mouse and keyboard as the only change... this makes the entire game feel stiff and hard-to-adapt-to when you're actually playing it.Combine this with numerous graphical, AI, UI and other kinds of issues (Regular crashes to desktop? Really?) and you have, without hyperbole, what is one of the worst PC ports I have ever seen. I would gladly recommend you play this game, just not this version of it. It's overpriced at $6.99 unless you really don't care about it being playable and only want to collect it.If you loved Just Cause 2 and want to harken back to the genesis of the franchise, go do yourself a favor and pick up the Xbox 360 version. Maybe that's mostly nostalgia talking (I have yet to have bought the 360 copy for myself after all this time), but you have a far greater chance of beating what is an ultimately good game hampered by an awful port. Oh yeah, and you can't do 16:9 in this game either. Yep. At least the PS2 version (also flawed, but much easier to play) had an excuse, being a last-gen port.			"

												Haven't played the sequel so I can't compare JC1 to JC2.It's a pretty fun game, one I would definitely recommend to kill some time, but there could be some improvements. For starters, the missions get pretty repetitive which doesn't keep me playing for very long. The American character voices seem....off. Not like lips moving before audio plays, but you can tell when you hear them. Overall, pretty decent. Buy it when it goes on sale though.			"

												'Just Cause' is the story of Che Guevara, an Argentine Marxist revolutionary, physician, author, guerrilla leader, diplomat, and military theorist. A major figure of the Cuban Revolution, his stylized visage has become a ubiquitous countercultural symbol of rebellion and global insignia in popular culture.Playing Che as a young medical student, you travel throughout South America and become radicalized by the poverty, hunger, and disease that you witness. Most of this part of the game consists of quicktime events punctuated by scenes of you jogging down corridors and along dusty streets, but the tight controls more than make up for any boredom you might feel. Your burgeoning desire to help overturn what you see as the capitalist exploitation of Latin America by the United States prompts your involvement in Guatemala's social reforms under President Jacobo Árbenz, and at this point in the game you join one of three factions which you will stay as for the rest of the game. In my playthrough I joined the 'Reapers' which was more of a fetch-quest based plot but I really like these because I'm a masochist.The president's eventual CIA-assisted overthrow at the behest of the United Fruit Company solidifies your political ideology and you can start earning perks that upgrade Che based on three trees - Ideology, Philosophy and Taxation Schemes. Ideology allows you to increase Che's intelligence making things like lockpicking and sneaking easier. Philosophy makes people dislike Che more but you're able to find things like hidden doors and alternative roads thanks to 'thinking outside of the box'. Taxation Schemes are probably the most useful tree and are fairly self-explanatory.Later, in Mexico City, you meet Raúl and Fidel Castro, join their 26th of July Movement, and sail to Cuba aboard the yacht, Granma, with the intention of overthrowing U.S.-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. The yacht becomes a hub for you and your men and from here you can use an extensive crafting system to make new weapons. Whilst the other NPCs are in your party you can outfit them with weapons and skills just as you can for Che. The AI is a little patchy in places but for the most part works fine. You soon rise to prominence among the insurgents, get promoted to second-in-command, and play a pivotal role in the victorious two-year guerrilla campaign that is set on deposing the Batista regime. At this point the game moves to a top-down perspective ala Sim City, and most of the gameplay from now on is based around maps of military strategies and other boring stuff. I guess it's alright.

The plot is just exceptionally ridiculous, even adjusting for the fact that it's an action game trying to emulate GTA in many ways.  The gameplay is just horendous, awful, hideous; but to be fair, this is probably due to the fact that it's not a great port.  It could be interesting on console, but this game simply does not age well at all.  I gave it a chance, but it's not worth my time. 2/10 (JUST CAUSE it made me laugh until I quite nearly pooped my pants.... now if that's your thing, buy it now (don't buy it now!!! under any circumstances!!!)

												This is the second game in a row I have failed to finish. This game started off very well, it has a bright colourful cartoony style and nice music. There's a huge environment to explore with loads of side missions. It has some zany grappling gun mechanics where you can leap between vehicles. So where do the problems lie? Firstly the side missions seem rather repetitive and the rewards aren't that appealing. Certain weapons look very similar making finding good guns difficult. Getting around can be annoying, roads are few and far between with massive cliffs and dense woodlands covering most the islands. They have included airlifts and vehicle drops but these take an annoyingly long time. The vehicles' handling is very light at speed to make getting anywhere even more frustrating. The main reason I never finished this game is the last missions are just really hard with swarms of constantly spawning bad guys and after failing repeatedly I thought I have better things to do with my time.

												Holy shnikeys. I don't remember this game being so bad on Playstation. Maybe I'm just getting old and my memory is bad, but wow is this game ever broken. The driving is horrible, some of the worst I've ever seen. Such random nonsense happens, like the heli that eternally follows me wherever I go blowing up random civilians and then slamming into mountains and exploding...only to resurrect a minute later and continue its onslaught. Shooting a gun is pure luck mixed with hope if you hit anything. The missions...oh my. The chase type missions are just pure cancer. I did the same one 10x in a row and still came up empty. It reminds me of that Driver 2 mission called Chase the Gunman. About 25 seconds into the mission you go around a corner and there's a tree there....that you hit 98% of the time on this basically railed mission. I dubbed it the ""Magnet Tree"", and that's the same as this game. You get to a certain point and the same bs happens every time. And I'm not sure, but I think the mission I was just on was very glitched. It's the one where you take a heli to meet whatzername for the arms deal and you get double-crossed. It just fails randomly before I can even catch up to the guy. Weird.But, the game is fun despite all the garbage points it has. It's a big map, albeit fairly empty, lots of vehicles to choose from, and fairly simple gameplay.If you can stand all the bugs, this game is a winner.I would rate this game...32 canoes out of 4 Blues Clues.

												Sorry to say it, Just Cause, but we're through. Sure, you were an amusingly politically incorrect GTA Vice City rip-off set in pseudo-Latin America, and you might have been fun in your day. But there are so many unanswered questions. What's the point of doing stunts? Can I ever get a better gun or vehicle? Why do I have to go to YouTube walkthroughs just to find my way to (and through) the main story points? And your reply was always, ""Just 'cause."" Sorry, J.C., I may try your sequel some day, but as of today you are (sniff) uninstalled.			"

												A fun, classic title, mostly easily described summed up as ""an early version of"" franchises such as Saints Row and  GTA.  Follows the now-standard formula of 1) Shoot enemies 2) steal vehicles 3) aquire new bases and weapons, repeat as needed.  As with most games of this kind, what little plot exists is more of an excuse (ie a ""Just Cause"") to blow things up and shoot badguys, but a heafty dose of humor and intentional cliches keep things from getting tideous.  All in all a decent game that's weathered time well...  and it's cheap, too. ;) The final boss fight can be a bit of a let down, though.			"

												I purchased this game some years ago with the Square Enix Bundle. I plays very similar to grand theft auto, but more so from a military viewpoint. The firing mechanism is very typical for third person shooters. The story line so far has been pretty decent, however some things such as vehicle or property ownership in the game is nonexistant the game plays very well.			"

												The original Just Cause for me isn't a bad game, but isn't a good one either. The story missions are cool, but everything else is very repetitive. The map is very big, but almost all of it is forest/jungle. The collectibles, liberation quests and side missions are also very repetitive, with the exception of a few races. The music and graphics are OK, but the gameplay is basic, both in shooting and driving. And the PC version doesn't offer native widescreen and controller support, and is glitchy. However, one could see the potential that a sequel would deliver, and Just Cause 2 did that. Still, i can recommend the original for cheap if you play the story missions, because the rest was a chore for me to play.			"

												I will be quite frank: if you have played Just Cause 2, there is no reason to play this.This game is Mediocrity Simulator 2006. I had a few moments of fun combat but I was frequently frustrated by the counter-intuitive controls.This game was trying to be GTA, and didn't do that badly.And who knows? I might get back into it.But I'll be completely honest: It's not super high on my list of Video Game priorities.My best advice: if you're curious, try it out for yourself.

												Buyer's Remorse, to the extreme. I had a great time with this game, on XBOX. I first played it (with the better graphics) on an X360. Now that I've decided to get Steam, I wanted this game to be the one to remove my ""Limited Account Status"" or whatever, so I could add my friends as Friends. Seven bucks (not to mention the hours of installing) later, and the game doesn't even support my controller?? Had I known this was a keyboard-only game, I wouldn't have wasted my money! Where's the Refund button?! And on top of it all, I couldn't even type this review until I've used it for 5 minutes.

												The first time I heard the name was with Just Cause 2. ""The game seems to be good"" I told myself. In a discount, I bought both games (Just Cause and Just Cause 2). To be fair, I must say that I expected to play only Just Cause 2, not the 1. Since I like to play games in order, I tried to play the first.At first, the graphics didn't looked like something really impressive. They aren't. In none moment I was impressed by the graphics. The first mission appeared to be ""simple"" and not very interesting. The game, literally, throws you into action and you should shoot to the bad guys. Nothing really impressive. I wasn't expecting a big game during my first 10 minutes.I was wrong.The game implements some interesting game mechanics. The gameplay is good, and the story... well... the story is interesting (cliche after cliche, but that isn't bad). The main ""storyline"" is fun to play.I first played throughout the main missions. There aren't many missions, so, you can pass the main missions in some hours, but, I think, not in a single try. Some missions are really easy. ""Go and destroy this"". If you get an helicopter with missiles, some missions are completed in a couple of minutes, or less. Other missions (in special, the final 4 or 5 missions) will require you to try various times, since is almos a deal that you will die. A lot. So, the main missions are ok, they are fun and, by the nature in the game, you keep wondering ""In which other ways can I complete this mission?"". The main missions, I think, have good replay value.The game has various extra components, like liberation missions. These missions are intended to remove the power of the government over some small places. At first, these missions are ok, but, as long as you keep liberating more and more zones, they start to feel a little bit repetitive. I stopped liberating zones since I get bored (since they are repetitive) and I get stressed because of a spawning problem in the game. When liberating a zone, reinforcements keep coming, and some are spawned riding a car. The problem is that sometimes they are spawned right behind you (if you are in the middle of the streets) and advancing, so, they can kill you without warning if you are in the middle of the streets, and dying means failing the liberation. If you don't mind that problem, and doesn't get bored so easily, then these missions are ok.Other side missions are about recovering ""hidden"" elements (they are perfectly marked in your map). This is interesting, but, also, after a while, I got bored of flying from here to there in an helicopter to fetch these things. If you enjoy a lot flying over the islands, these things are for you.The side missions in the liberated zones are ok, but within some minutes, they will start to repeat themselves, so, you can't expect a lot from these (""Go kill these people"", ""Go destroy this"", ""Go and retrieve this"", etc, you got the idea).So, these are my results of playing with the game:Good:- Really cheese story.- Funny ending (so exagerated that made me laugh).- A big open world.- Lots of things to do.Bad:- Liberation missions are a little bit of repetitive.- Side missions in liberated zones are repetitive.- You can die very easily due to apparent bugs (like cars spawing behind you).So, I can recommend this game? Yes. The game is better than what I really expected. I can't compare it to Just Cause 2 since I have not played it yet, but is a game that can be re-played various times and you can finish the game doing various things.			"

												The game if fun for a while but then it gets hard. Eventually it gets to where you die and it respawns you next to three active enemy choppers(Exadgeration)and you die at that one part because its a bad checkpoint. Then you'll get used to it.  Then, at the last level, as far as i know, there are no checkpoints. You'll find it so hard to beat the game. I recommend that you play until you hate a level( If your almost done with that level, then beat it)and then play free-roam or the side missions. I do recommend this game but its not fun towards the end. Its fun but im not sure its worth full value.			"

												if there was a statment to used to describe things lower then ""meh its alright"" but not meen that it is bad it would be just cause (the game that is). i cant say this is a good game or a bad game and i have my reasons1.this game really and i mean really suffers from simplisty. for example there are missons where you have to fight big groups of enemy then proced kill more and proceed etc. but the ai is as good as the ai of a rock and will never hit u as long as you are moving and if you do get hit it does the least amount of damage a bullet can do to you and you heal by not getting hit and you can still move and heal so u always have full health2. the combat in this game is bad you get a gun with unlimeted ammo as soon as you start the game and thats the only gun you are going to need because it does alot of damage and any other gun u do pick up might as well shoot lazers. ik this sort of goes under simplisty but still3. the story is um ahhh is there a story idek i have only played a hour of the game ik butso far the missons have been go here and kill these guys then go here and kill these guys. from the tinyest eveidnce i think our main misson and goal in this game is to kill the goverment.4. this game isnt as glitchy as some game *cough*   *cough* assassin cred unity. but it does have it far share of glitches mostly with driving for an example i ran ove a guy with a car and instead of falling onto the ground he went 1000 feet into the air, and also i went to exit a carand then flew to the other side of the map and this map is very very big.5.as i have siad this game has a super big map but it feels so empty and dead there are little amounts of people.6. i could go on more about this game but this has already turned into an esssay of why this game is bad but thankfully just case 2 is an amazing game so go and check that game its got the same size of map but with lots to do and it fells live there an acutally story and challenge and better combat and guns and barly any glitches so overall i give this game a 2/10 why 2 and not 0...Just case			"

												uhhhh, where do I start?  Well, I'll start with the fact that this game made me laugh till I cried.  The plot is just exceptionally ridiculous, even adjusting for the fact that it's an action game trying to emulate GTA in many ways.  The gameplay is just horendous, awful, hideous; but to be fair, this is probably due to the fact that it's not a great port.  It could be interesting on console, but this game simply does not age well at all.  I gave it a chance, but it's not worth my time. 2/10 (JUST CAUSE it made me laugh until I quite nearly pooped my pants.... now if that's your thing, buy it now (don't buy it now!!! under any circumstances!!!)

												I personally cherished this game in almost every way. I played it after JC2 and found it oddly charming and fun. It's got a nice setting and scenery, as well as decent graphics for a 2006 game. Audio was buggy like there was no tomorrow, but I found it humourous. The gameplay was... unique in its own little way, but I enjoyed it for the most part. The particular mechanics definitely make it seem like the prequel to the awesome Just Cause 2.The characters were cheesy as all hell, but I think that adds to the game's overall style. The story could've been better, but after all, that's not what the Just Cause series is about, now is it? I think that the story served its purpose in letting you know why you're on an island blowin' ♥♥♥♥ up.There's plenty of things to do, making it a completionist's dream. However, if you don't like repetitive missions/objectives, then you might get less time out of it like I did.Overall, it's a classic title for anyone that liked Just Cause 2 and wants to discover its roots, or to anyone who wants to get into the series.I fully recommend it for the price. Definitely worth it!8/10			"

												10 out of 10 game. Lots of explosions. Some fun antics include: flying a gunship to the strip club in a volcano and gunning down a naked fat man, causing 9/11 with the Alexandre jumbo jet, blowing up cocaine, killing someone with a shipment crate, fisticuffing fishermen, and swimming on land with super fast rocket launching hover boats.

												Some good 'ol nostalgia. I've never been as happier playing as a Spanish mercenary ragdoll with a mullet and unlimited parachute.			"

												Ох и старенькая же игрушка... Но когда-то она произвела фурор! Сюжет довольно простой, но от этого не менее интересный! В общем советую всем любителям помучать Рико Родригеса!			"
