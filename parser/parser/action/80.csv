												To start out, I've really got more like five hundred hours in this game. I started playing it obsessively long before Valve thought to add playtime records.It's fun.The bots are fairly competent as long as you disallow them from buying grenades and the list of maps that come prepackaged far outstrips that of the original Counter-Strike. (They're also far prettier, at least as much as they can be on the GoldSrc engine). Hostages are, as always, somewhat brain-dead, but they're nowhere near as bad as the ones in Counter-Strike: Source--although the fact they all wear identical orange jumpsuits makes me wonder who really are the good and bad guys. Isn't variety the spice of life?Sound design and quality are improved slightly from the original game and many of the less generic maps lack that kitchen_rats look that's become so indicative of Half-Life's engine, so that's a plus. At the same time, a lot of maps have odd collision detection issues and I'm somewhat bothered by the fact that Counter-Terrorists are as chatty over the radio as their criminal counterparts.			"

												If you want to be destroyed by people who've been playing the game since CS 1.1 release and are tryhard mlg pros, you get 1.6.If you want to play dress up dolls with your guns and play with a bunch of people who complain about their ranks and blame you for losing, you get Global Offensive.If you want to play a ton of mini games and never find any servers with the actual core game, you get Source.If you want to actually have fun, have better balanced weapons, play with a decent community, have a game that can run on nearly any computer, and actually play the core Counter-Strike game, you get Condition Zero.

												Back when Counter-Strike tried a campaign mode. The game is a series of mini-objectives against bots on various maps, while the Deleted Scenes extra is a full blown CS campaign with many elements of the online game being brought in with solo FPS gameplay mechanics (such as equipment) to make a fun and hilarious game (the stereotypical russian accents make me laugh every time). The multiplayer part is quite similar to the original CS but with slightly better textures.Overall, this isn't a game for people who like CS:GO, it's more for the fans of old school FPS games and OG Counter-Strikers. I do recommend it nonetheless, but keep in mind that the game is over 10 years old.			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a follow up to the original Counter-Strike game. This game was released in 2004, so almost eleven years ago. Condition Zero uses the Half-Life engine. What we have here is a CS game which includes a single player mission pack. When it comes to playing Counter-Strike, I am more or less a newb at it. This game gave me the perfect opportunity to learn the guns, maps and mission types without the pressure of feeling like you are letting your team down by sucking. The campaign took me about four hours to complete, but this was only on Normal mode, you can go back and replay the missions on a higher difficulty to eventually work your way up to playing online. I also found the squad management system to be a nice little feature which isn't seen in other CS games, at the start of each mission, you can choose which squad members to take with you on the mission, each of the team members have their positive and negative stats so you can really get stuck in with min-maxing them. You start out with three members and you work you way up to having a full blown squad of about eight men. On each of the missions you also have to complete specific challenges, these can be goals set around killing a certain amount of people, winning the match in less than ninety seconds, rescuing a specific amount of hostages etc etc. This added a little variety of play, especially the challenges where you have to use a certain weapon in order to complete them. This allowed you to learn how to use other guns effectively rather than sticking with your tried and tested Rifle and Deagle. While the graphics do not come close to looking like games we have in the current day, the game still does look nice. I wasn't put off by the dated graphics one bit; I guess that just shows how good the Half Life engine actually is!  The difficulty levels completely rely on how hard you want to make it. I started out on Normal mode just to get to grips with the game as I am newb like that; but you can work all the way up to playing as if you are in a match online and have the brutally hard experience if you want to. Easy mode is complete walk in the park though, enemies can be standing in front of you for about three seconds before they realize they should shoot you, and even then they spray bullets randomly all around you without actually hitting, so I wouldn't recommend you start out on Easy mode. Like I said, the campaign took me about four hours to complete, but there are two or three more difficulty levels to try out, and I can see this adding a lot of variety into the game play, so I can easily see the single player alone taking about twelve hours to complete it fully on all difficulties. I found no technical issues what so ever while playing, I would assume all the bugs and niggles would of been ironed out years ago.. In conclusion I can easily recommend Counter-Strike: Condition Zero for anyone looking to get into the FPS or CS scene, it will easily give you a worthwhile experience, giving you the opportunity to learn all of the CS maps, guns and game modes in a pressure free environment.

												Counter Strike: Condition Zero comes with two games:1. Condition Zero2. Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes1. Condition ZeroBasically Counter Strike 1.6 but with improved graphics and the addition of bots. The bots are amazing considering when this game was released (they're still inferior to human players). In addition, the bots are a great way for beginners to learn about the game in a more relaxed environment. There is also a singleplayer Tour of Duty, which is basically regular counter strike missions against bots, but with additional challenges (example: kill 3 enemies with a sniper rifle). Sadly, the Tour of Duty missions are Counter-Terrorist only. There are no Terrorist missions.2. Condition Zero: Deleted ScenesThis is a singleplayer game. It uses the same weapons and game mechanics as Condition Zero, but with some additions, including the awsome fiber optic camera. Level design is one of Deleted Scenes' greatest strengths. The AI is passable. The story is where it fails, in that each mission is its own self-contained story with practically no connecting elements. I suspect you don't even play as the same person in each mission. Immersion takes a serious hit because of this. It helps to pretend you are playing as the same person. I recommend Adrian Shephard before Black Mesa.I had a lot of fun playing Condition Zero and Deleted Scenes. I highly recommend these games as well as any other Counter Strike game (or any game by Valve for that matter). By the way, check out the first screenshot on the store page. Really take a close look at the plane...			"

												I bought this game on sale, because i wanted to have the full CS collection, but what a great surprise i got when i actually played it. Its CS with a campaign mode or Tour of Duty, whatever you wanna call it.If you want a challenging single-player mode with different difficulties and maps, then this game has what you want but expect some bugs and the AI isnt great but gets the job done and its challenging enough for a good time.The Deleted Scenes game only adds more content to CZ with new missions all over the world where you play as different units with a story behind each mission and a lot of objectives to follow. The game isnt recent but you can still have fun with it in 2014, at least, in my opinion.I totally recommend if you wanna have some single-player fun.7.5/10			"

												I've been playing Condition Zero for hours, playing online, singleplayer missions, etc. And my final Word for this Game is: It's (atleast in my opinion) the probably BEST Counter Strike game ever made. The Gameplay, the new Maps, and everything else made this game perfect. ""Deleted Scenes"" is also a nice idea that was added to the Game with the singleplayer campaign. (once again, my opinion). This game is truly worth all of your money, and i recommend it to anyone who's new to Counter Strike.I give this Game a 9.5/10, really good ""update"" of the original Counter Strike.			"

												A great ""tutorial"" for beginner CS players, the missions are just your usual bomb defusal scenarios with some bad AI, even though the AI is bad some of the time you still need to be tatical, the community is decently sized and the bots (that plague some servers) are just insanely good in some servers, the controls are smooth, gameplay is fluid, and there is wide variety of guns, it can run on a potato so you'll be able to play this on almost any potato you own, and the default maps that you play on during the missions are really well done, only complaints are that it can feel boring dying very early in a round and having to wait the entire round, and you still have to wait even in the missions with bots, overall I'd say buy the copy with this and the original Counter-Strike and try this one out first.And a side note; the deleted scenes in my opinion are MUCH better than the Condition Zero base game itself, it offers a good variety of maps and scenarios while giving the player more guns and action, if I were to give a score for that one it would be a 9/10.But for the regular Condtion Zero it would be around a 7.5/10			"

												Counter Strike Condition Zero is the sequel to the original Counter Strike and now it includes a Single Player Campaign, so let's take a look shall we ?When I mentioned that this game has a single player campaign, I didn't mean a story mode. The single player campaign is a very short bundle of missions where you have few objectives during each missions. Like rescue hostages, defuse bombs and take out terrorists with a specific weapon.The missions are incredibly short and you can finish all 12 within 2 hours. The AI will make the hostage missions a living hell. Once the round starts the AI are on the hunt to find any enemy player on the field and will not help you so don't expect any help from the AI. Getting a hostage to a drop off, before your team kills the entire enemy team.The gameplay is not much different from the original Counter Strike so don't expect a major change.Now for the feature everyone cares. THE MULTIPLAYER. It's almost completely dead. I had trouble finding a match and when I did get into a full lobby match, I felt bored and it's not as good as the original Counter Strike.This game is not good, but it's not horrible either. The campaign is short and not worth the money and the multiplayer is slowly dying out. In the end only get this if you're a hardcore fan, otherwise get any other game in the franchise.Final Rating:6/10 - Okay If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you dislike post in the comments on what you dislike about the review.For more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												The classic counter strike with slightly improved graphics, new content new maps and improved bots. The single player 'campaign' in it is basically playing all the usual maps and get certain number of kills in certain weapons and rescue certain number of hostages nothing fancy but It's just a very good classic.I only recommend it if you're getting it through the valve bundle.UPDATE:The counter strike condition zero deleted scenes redirected me to the same store page as this so apparently it comes with it, the deleted scenes have a decent campaign consisting of different missions on the world map including all the counter strike characters, weapons and even new equipment and some stealthy action, it was a fun campaign, it is totally worth it.

												This game is more fun with the bots. Granted, the AI is sometimes terrible and glitchy for many maps (even cz ones), but the most fun is to edit the botprofile.db and make your own unique bots (it's very easy to do) and essentially form your own match league. I have created around 700 bots each with their own clan tag, track standings/stats etc. Granted, it's a lot of bot-simulated matches which would be boring to most people, but has kept me occupied as I am a stat junkie. Captures some level of competion for me, as I am way too old to participate in any ladders or really be any good anymore, whereas most people could dominate any of the bots very easily. But for me, a fun little throwback to my younger days. Now I'll go put my false teeth back in and take a lap around the retirement center on my motorized cart.			"

												I was originally just going to punch in 5 minutes so I could make this review just about the Deleted Scenes, but I decided to be fair and try out the base game too.Condition Zero's Tour of Duty mode is a series of levels that one could describe as a campaign without a plot. In each level, you have to complete a set of tasks, or ""challenges"", while stopping the terrorists from doing their thing enough times to satisfy the level's non-challenge requirements. You can create your own squad by buying teammates from a roster of 36 counter-terrorists, each with different levels of skill and weapon preferences, with points earned by completing levels.The Tour of Duty is very simplistic, but it managed to make me like it a bit and I normally hate playing multiplayer-oriented game matches with only bots, which it essentially is. And in my opinion, it on the Easy difficulty feels like a tutorial; One lacking explanations of the game's controls, but also one that trains the player by putting them up against targets that move and shoot back, which is not present in the tutorials featured in the Deleted Scenes and CS:GO. Update: Currently at frustrating point where the Terrorist AI is almost cheating and the Counter-Terrorist AI is braindead.Then I tried out the multiplayer for a bit. Not long enough for me to actually say anything about it, but from my limited experience it felt like CS:S but different. I hate CS:S for several reasons so I'm going to see later if it's different in a way that I'll enjoy it. It's basically CS:S but deader, has worse level design, and you have to remember to buy ammo. Not my thing.Finally, the ultimate purpose of this review: The Deleted Scenes. It's a set of 18 different missions, each having a different scenario (and are not connected in a grand scheme or anything like a campaign in say, Call of Duty). I don't have much more to say about it in terms of description, so here's where I begin the ""opinion"" part (I think there's a much better word for it but I'm tired): Holy f**k it's good. It of course suffers from dated graphics and some weaker level design here and there, but it is fun. I've done all of the missions 3 times over 25~ hours and dear god I think I might do it several more times even after finding all of the secrets within. It makes me furious that CS:GO's campaigns were limited time because I'd replay a Counter-Strike campaign with CS:GO's gameplay and graphics more times than I think I will replay Deleted Scenes. Update: Forgot to say this when I first published this review but the music's great too. Especially the music in Secret War, that level's awesome in almost every aspect.Overall: If for nothing else, buy this game just for the Deleted Scenes. Unless you like CS:S but want a more retro feel and can put up with poorly-balanced AI in the Tour of Duty, that's like the main selling point.			"

												      Counter Strike Condition Zero is an odd one. Caught in between CS 1.6 and Source, it came very close to CS: Source's release, and was brushed aside. At the time, it graphics were outdated, and its single player content was lacking. Today, the single player content is just as lackluster. The regular campaign is literally offline bots with some slight customization. It's bland, boring, and the AI is pretty terrible. There's also the ""Deleted Scenes"", which is actually an entirely other game. It's a single player CS Campaign that plays nothing like Counter Strike. It feels more like a fast-paced Arcade shooter. It's plagued with poor map design, cheesey plot that desperately wanted to blend with games like Halo at the time, and gimmicky spy gadgets that while intriguing at first, are poorly executed.     Where Condition Zero does shine is its multiplayer. It's graphics are dated but timeless. It feels like an updated CS 1.6 in visuals, and plays in a way thats really unique to Condition Zero. Ammunition is expensive and money is tight, so you really have to watch your shots in this game. It still has a very large playerbase, and holds up much better than the classic 1.6    While Condition Zero failed to capture a single player Counter Strike expirience, it did create a pretty fun Multiplayer that's still fun to hop on today. It's by no means a masterpiece, but it isn't a bad game. If the CS Anthology pack ever goes on sale, I'd say pick it up and try it out. But on its own, I'd say it's a pass.			"

												Counter-Strike:Condition Zero is the best game online because it is easy to use for all the computers since it don't need so many requirements as other games, this way many mas users are going to have an easy access to play this fabulous game in line. It is also one a revolution in this of the games online since the change of graph is very well-known between(among) the Condition Zero and the first Counter-Strike and its alone realism overcome by the Counter-Strike: Source. This game also can be played of a player by if you want to play the way history.			"

												The reason I bought this was for Deleted Scenes. CZ Deleted Scenes are in deep need of polishing for todays standards, but give it a break it was probably made before you were born. Deleted Scenes has very good cutscenes that catch you up and are a great part of the game. Once again, the AI needs polishing for todays standards, but the enviroment still does its job even to today by giving you a slight unsettling feeling as you battle enemies. Deleted Scenes campaign is SINGLEPLAYER so you can play Counter-Strike offline, which is cool as hell in my opinion. Counter-Strike campaign offline. However, just like every other CS game you probably need experience with the FPS genre. Don't let easy mode fool you because it is really tough. Any CS fan will love CZ.			"

												Condition Zero is basically Counter-Strike 1.6 with minor improvements to the graphics I guess. Gameplay remains the same. Much of the official and even community-created maps from 1.6 are available here as well. There are a good amount of servers up, though this is the least played CS. Deathrun, Gun game, Surf and more custom mods can still be played.The Multiplayer version comes with Tour of Duty. These are small missions in which you assign yourself a team of bots and play rounds against other bots as a Counter-Terrorist until you complete them. As you progress, you will gain points to spend on better bots and have an easier time.Buying Condition Zero also grants you Deleted Scenes. This is where Valve tried to make a single-player version of Counter-Strike. In this campaign, you once again take the role of a Counter-Terrorist, but this time, you are basically solo, ♥♥♥♥ing up Terrorists like Rambo. Your higher-ups pretty much chill outside while you are doing the dirty work. In Deleted Scenes, there are some new items introduced, such as  radio-controlled bombs, cameras and blowtorches. You have to rely on your aim to complete the game, though medkits and ammo packs are not scarce and you will rarely run out of health or ammo.It is bundled with 1.6, so the price is pretty good for 2 great games and I recommend it.

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is the next installment of the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Amazing game through and through.I very much like how it's spiced up with access passes and weapon skins.It also features a fully developed singleplayer campaign, much alike to that of Half-Life itself, albeit split into missions.And if you're feeling extra frisky, you can purchase a key and try your luck with weapon cases!EDIT: Now Stat-Trak weapons have a separate counter for singleplayer kills.

												Counter-Strike 1.6: The Phantom Pain is a Single Player First-Person Shooter that takes you through the lives of numerous Counter-Terrorism units. The story is linear and all counter-terrorism units depicted are not connected. Most gameplay is a tutorial for a mundane version of VR missions, a prime example being your very first sneeki beeki-like S.A.S mission, where you, the main unoriginal protagonist of Dissappointment Ops 3, is instructed to infiltrate and exfiltrate from Prague or something to stop a train from going boom and to locate Metal Gear Supercomputer.

												Synopsis:With its extensive Tour of Duty campaign, a near-limitless number of skirmish modes, updates and new content for Counter-Strike's award-winning multiplayer game play, plus over 12 bonus single player missions, Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a tremendous offering of single and multiplayer content. My thoughts regarding Condition Zero are pretty much Identical to the original CS 1.6. This is basically due to both games sharing the same engine, with Condition Zero being different only in the texturing and meshing department. With CS 1.6 showing its age, Condition Zero might be a worth a squirt if your feeling nostalgic. Basically once the game Is bought you have to two installation options, Counter Strike Condition Zero and Counter Strike Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes.Counter Strike Condition Zero:This is essentially the CS 1.6 variant of the game which allows for traditional CS 1.6 style online gameplay and a somewhat enjoyable mini campaign which spans across most of the original maps, where objectives are the same as multiplayer however you can build a team for each map with bots of varying skills with more powerful bots costing more resource which you will unlock as you complete the maps. This single player should be avoided since it offers no real value and you are much better off playing on servers with real players.Counter Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes:This installation covers the actual single player campaign for Condition Zero. Each theater consists of you playing as a different counter terrorist unit: GIGN, GSG-9, SEAL Team 6, SAS and SpetsnazYou in turn fight againest a variety of different terrorist factions:Arctic Avengers, Elite Crew, Guerilla Warfare, Phoenix Connexion and Midwest Militia.I rather enjoyed the single player campaign since it deployed a large variety of maps and global locations ranging from fetid jungles to war ravaged cities. Most missions have a pre deployment briefing but these just offer simple intel and not much else. Most missions range from hostage rescue, bomb disarmament to assassinations. In most respects the campaign is somewhat reminiscent to Call of Duty MW which often puts you in the boots of a different soldier serving under a different army.In conclusion CS CZ is worth your time if you are a hardcore C.S 1.6 fan like myself. It is pretty much HD 1.6 with a enjoyable single player campaign.Final Score: 85/100			"

												I like the game a lot. There is a Singleplayer campaign which I have passed in 2.5h. I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game comes with another game called Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes-CS:CZDS has only Singleplayer which is very intriguing to pass and play it, it has total of 19 missions and are very well made-And I have liked it of course!-The game has better graphics than Counter-Strike-The game is fun to play even with bots-Developers haven't forgot about this game, the games does not need any updates or patches-Community is strong, so much players on 2500+ dedicated servers-The game is cheap-The Singleplayer Introduces you to all of the maps that are in Counter-Strike: Condition Zero, and introduces it very well-The Multiplayer servers are defended with VAC so there are little to no hackers in this gameCONS-I didn't like some of the Challenges because I have killed terrorists too fast and couldn't save the Hostages so I had to repeat it four to five times-The graphics for player models have changed a little bit but they are still... I don't know how to describe itI recommend this game! I rate it 9/10. Would kill five terrorists in row with M249 again			"

  This game is underestimated  The problem with 1.6 is everyone who plays that already a pro. A really small comunity plays this game and they are not  THAT  good (they are still quite good). This game (for me) is better than CS:GO (because CS:GO is ☢toxic☢  and i can't run it very well) and better than 1.6 beacuse they are too good. (i dont have CS:S) Here is a little story of mine:First i only wanted to buy CS 1.6 but it could be only bought with this game. Then This Happened:-Opened CS 1.6-Got in to a hungarian server (im hungarian)-Realized that they are too good-quitNow i thought: Lets try this other one out.

												Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.

												The more polished, better looking cousin of Counter Strike, Condition Zero is the version of Counter Strike to not only play, but for developers to beat.  The addition of the much-required shield has an important balance factor; it counters the usage of the AWP.The hit detection is once again, superior to CSGO, much like the previous Counter Strike, and the aim for the weapons isn't cartoonishly exaggerated where you have weapons like the M249 and the shotgun being actually viable.Online play is head-and-heels above CSGO's.  In CSGO you feel like everythings a waste of time unless you're playing in competitive matches, while in CSCZ, and CS, pubs rule the game (like all classic multiplayer games).  I can't say how sweet it was when someone who was clearly a CSGO player who looks like he just started playing CSCZ, killed a team mate to defuse the bomb himself, and then got perma-banned by the moderator.  It was also the moment where I realized that the behaviors of players in CSCZ compared to CSGO are not just different, but the CSGO behavior is just ♥♥♥♥ing awful and counter-intuitive to team work.  You have people competing fo points to get a higher rank quicker so that they can unlock more skins, which they can trade/sell for a hugely over-priced margin (some skins being worth more than CSGO itself).I guess it just goes to show that if you're someone who actually wants to enjoy playing the game, CSCZ is the game for you.  CSGO is just another ""competitive"" game with nothing more to it than popularity, driven mostly by the market economy the game has created for itself, suffering the same fate as TF2 and Dota 2.I would recommend CSCZ over CSGO any day and not because it's what I used to play (since I have none, as I barely ever touched it for more than a few minutes back in the day), but because the balance, design, and overall aesthetic is just so much more satisfying and fun to experience compared to more modern online FPS games.

												Wonderful! As writing this review I have only played about 47 minutes but OH MY GOD! Okay, this Counter-Strike installment ups the graphics from the first game and gets a lot better. More weapons, more maps, more ♥♥♥♥ to do! The single-player of modern Counter-Strike games are just games that you setup to get your skills up and just ♥♥♥♥ with bots. Now, this game, really improves upon simgle-player. IT HAS ITS OWN CAMPAIN! It has four diffulties to choose from, awards to receive, not acheivements but single-player rewards, and it involves all maps so far. If you ever played Counter-Strike and wanted a campain for single-player, this game is for you.			"

												Sadly dead.Out of all the Counter-Strike games, this one is probably the most underrated. However, that doesn't make it a bad game in anyway.For one thing, CZ doesn't deliver anything really new into Counter-Strike compared to 1.6.There are a few things they did add.+A Campaign Mode+Re-decorated maps+New Maps+A Mission Mode+New sound effects+Slightly beter graphicsAnd when you compare 1.6 to CZ, they're nearly IDENTICAL.I would only get this for the Campaign and the Mission Mode. For Core Multiplayer CS gameplay, get 1.6. However, if you want to try out the Deleted Scenes campaign, this is worth your time.			"

												This product  consist of two games - Counter-Strike: Condition Zero and Condition Zero - Deleted ScenesCounter-Strike: Condition ZeroUpdated Counter-Strike 1.6!Added HQ-models, updated some maps, with HQ-textures too, and Campaign, which in CS:GO too (operations). But this is usual CS. Unlike official classic version, original Condition Zero have BOTs. 1.6 need to download them from unreliable sources... Horror! But there is a BOTS!!!So, go to the pros & cons.Pros:HQ-textures, doing game world more like CS:GO. if you are bum and CS:GO doesn't run)Detailed new maps.BOTs!!!1!11ONEONE!Campaign.Cons:Shooting mechanics unwonted (spreading of M4A1 restoring after 5 sec.)Just a litle bit changed classic CS. Developer's laziness.But anyway, I don't understand why it takes so poor rating...My mark - 7 bots out of 10.Condition Zero - Deleted ScenesCounter-Strike with a story missions!! Total - 18. The same HQ-models.So, pros & cons.Pros:Detailed models and HQ-textures.18 so interesting story missions.It's a doble pros!New weapons and spy tools. RPG 4life!Cons:The same shooting mechanics.My mark - 9 the best Russian accents out of 10.So, general mark is... 8/10!! "

												Buried beneath the successes of Valve's blockbuster titles, Condition Zero is a hidden gem that boasts both singleplayer and multiplayer entertainment. The main reason you should consider this is for the Deleted Scenes section, which contains a variety of content not used by the base game. From a legitimate story mode (with rather cinematic and interesting moments) to fun new weapons (M60's and blowtorches, to name a few), it pretty much is worth the price of admission. The base game is decent as well, but it can be easily replicated by playing CS:S or Global Offensive with bots. Deleted Scenes features a story mode with, well, a story. 18 unconnected stories, sure, but the variety of locations ingame makes up for the lack of consistency.Overall, it's a fun diversion when you're yearning for another story-based game from Valve. At a price of 5-10 dollars, you're basically getting two high-quality games for the price of one. I would recommend it to Counter-Strike and Half-Life fans alike.			"

												It's exactly as I imagined, singleplayer CS. If you dont have any interwebs and have it in your library you can play CS with bots but the change is that bots aren't mentally challenged anymore.

												This game is awesome!Why you should get it:Counter-Strike: Condition Zero: It is my most favorite Counter-Strike game in the series. Although I never got to experience this game until 2016 because I never heard about it. Added bots, Tour of Duty campaigns, but not the campaigns you think of. You just do the tasks and you beat the level. You play as Counter-Terrorists trying to stop Terrorists. I found out about this game in late 2016. I've been playing CS 1.6 for 10 years now and seeing this as a 1.6 but with  better graphics. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes: Actual campaigns/missions, you get to fight terrorists, again. All I got to say.Get these games, they're worth buying.			"

												Counter Strike Condition Zero is an interesting game to discuss not because of it's merits as a game but largely for it's history. It had a surprisingly troubled development and changed hands between 4 distinctive developers before finally becoming finished. The game was originally designed by Rogue, the developers behind Strife and American McGee's Alice. However the developer went out of buisiness so Valve instead gave it to Gearbox, who Valve had previously worked with on Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Much of the game is based around Gearbox's version, which focused on creating more impressive graphics and remaking many of the classic Counter Strike maps in better detail.However, the project changed hands again and the game was handed off to Ritual entertainment. The guys behind SiN. They remade the game as a pseudo singleplayer title before Valve decided to hand the game off to Turtlerock studios. Who would years later create Left 4 Dead. Who finished the game and completed it based on Gearbox's version. The content Ritual made would be released as the ""Deleted scenes"".The final game is very much inspired by Counter Strike 1.6. It plays very similarly albiet with nicer graphics and a very different art style. It was also the very first Counter Strike game to ship with bots by default. The game also contains a singleplayer separate from the Deleted Scenes, however this is just an Unreal Tournament style ladder featuring botmatches. When Condition Zero came out, it was seen as outdated. It released two years too late, and the very same year as Valve's own Counter Strike Source. As a result it isn't often talked about when compared to the other games. Since you do get it by default when buying 1.6 it's interesting to play for curiosity's sake, but you'll likely find more players for 1.6 or Source.			"

When Deleted Scenes was solo #YOLO, Condition Zero is multiplayer one, which is not as good as original 1.6 as few of you think. But I think it's opposite.

 ,just like in CSGO Casual. But their camping skills ain't the best feature of this game. You can tell that Condition Zero made a step foward with most knew voice line of bots ""I'M DANGEEEEEEEROUS"" when they kill nothing.10/10 would enjoy seeing those lines in Global Offensive			"

												Rank: 7.5/10Recommendation(s): Be a hardcore Counter-Strike fan, understand the old 1.6 mechanics, and play a little bit of Half-Life.Major Theme: Hidden treasure for CS players.Bought at Price: $100 (for Valve Complete Pack)Single player Counter-Strike was always an interesting concept to throw around. So much in fact, a small studio completed it.A quick reminder, this game was designed around Half Life. Linear gameplay in a compact space should be expected. This doesn't mean its bad - plenty of single player games are linear - it just takes time to understand if you haven't played Half Life. Level layouts and item interaction are not going to be what you are used to. Is the game perfect? No, and no game is. Due to the for mentioned old game design theories, certain pathways and mechanics will seem odd. Getting players to do a 180, and come back the way they came can be confusing.I've always been a Counter-Strike fan. There's no denying that. If you are well, you will have a blast with this title (and the Deleted Scenes). This title brings you back to the roots of CS, which allows for a neat experience. Would you play it again and again because of that? Probably not, because I completed the game in 4 hours and that felt like it was enough. I can only really see someone playing this if they are using an old machine with poor internet connection.Being an old engine, AI isn't very good either. The way around that is to place environmental hazards everywhere such as trip mines. Because of this, it feels more like Half Life then Counter-Strike.To wrap this up, if you are a CS player, you are missing something by not playing this. If you aren't, go on in life, there's nothing demanding here for you to play.			"

												Counter Strike CZ should be considered as an upgrade to the the original counter strike, or even the prelude to source. Many maps have been changed and look  better . However, I would say that CZ is geared towards players who don't have a fast internet connection, or lan a lot, since there is a wide emphasis on bots.			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically 'just' a slightly improved version of Counter-Strike 1.6.If you happen to be unfamiliar with the CS games series, the concept of the idea is simple.Players play against eachother in online matches, choosing to play either a terrorist or a counter terrorist. The team that completes their objective or eliminates the opposing team wins.Counter-Strike is a fairly old game, built on the Half-Life engine, that became extremely popular years ago and is one of the best known shooter games (series) ever made, alongside eg. Unreal Tournament, Doom, Call of Duty and other such classics. And thanks to a large community, there is a huge amount of custom content available for these games. As long as you have some people to play with, it's hard to get bored in the world of Counter-Strike. And Condition Zero is no exception to this.What most people familiar with the series can tell you is that while CZ is a decent game, it is highly underrated compared to both older and newer installments. Why is this? Well there may be several reasons, but the easiest way to put it is this: it's the middle child of CS games.CS purists will prefer to play the original Counter-Strike, versions 1.5 and 1.6. And the newer games draw a big crowd because they're flashier and fancier. Since Condition Zero is situated in between the older 1.6 and Counter-Strike: Source (which started using the new Source engine), it doesn't get much of the attention it deserves, in my opinion. However, I can tell you that it is definitely a game worth playing if you're into slightly older shooting games.--------------------More information...-=Gameplay=-Q: How is it played?A: After joining a server, you have four options. You can join one of two teams, you can let the game decide for you which team you'll join or you can spectate the game, basically existing as a ghost, watching others play. You can play as a counter-terrorist operative or as a terrorist. The moment you spawn (when a new round starts, or within seconds of a round starting) you're able to open a menu that allows you to buy weapons, protection and various equipment. If the round has not yet started, you are unable to move. If you picked a team seconds after the round started, you will instantly be able to move. Everyone spawns with a basic pistol and a little bit of money. Once you're able to move, your goal is to move out of the spawn area and attempt to complete any of your objectives to earn more money and to win the round. When the round is over, everyone respawns in the same area as last round and the game is repeated. If you died, you'll start over with your gear, otherwise you keep what you had before. You will keep playing rounds until the server changes to a different map (level), usually after 20 minutes. There are a couple of standard game types, determined not by server options but by the type of map that is being played. The three main types are bomb defusal, hostage rescue and assassination. There are other types, but those are only featured in custom maps. Completing just ONE of the listed objectives will win a team the round and earn additional money for all of it's members.*Bomb defusal-Terrorists must plant a bomb in one of two possible bomb sites and make sure it explodes. (the team still wins if the bomb explodes while all it's members are dead)-Terrorists must kill all counter-terrorists.-Counter-terrorists have to kill all terrorists.-Counter-terrorists must defuse the bomb if it is planted. (the team still wins if all CT players are killed after the bomb has been defused)*Hostage rescue-Terrorists must stay alive and keep the counter-terrorists from rescuing all living hostages.-Terrorists have to kill all the counter-terrorists.-Counter-terrorists have to rescue all the living hostages.-Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists.*Assassination-Terrorists must keep the VIP from the rescue zone while staying alive themselves.-Terrorists have to kill the VIP.-Counter-terrorists have to kill all the terrorists.-Counter-terrorists have to get the VIP player (picked at random) to the rescue zone within a specific time limit.-=Experience=-CZ is an old game. It runs on an old engine. It looks, feels and sounds old. Quite simply, if you can't stand anything but HD graphics, realistic water effects, decent ragdoll physics and other such things, this is not the game for you. That said, there's enough to keep it interesting. Weapons all sound and behave differently and it takes practice to get good with each (type). The maps are diverse enough in types of environment. It's worth mentioning that in a game like this, the maps are relatively small, forcing players into confrontation to keep the game going at a decent pace. Because the action is usually fast and intense, you will usually be too distracted to really notice what your surroundings sound or look like. For some interesting experiences, try a few custom maps! Made by members of the community, you'll find the craziest levels. Themed ones, maps based on popular films or tv series and just insane maps that seem to be all over the place. Shake things up by customising your game and trying out new things.-=Technical, controls, etc.=-Again, CZ is a fairly old game. As long as you can get the game started, you're not going to have issues with this. It's pretty stable and even if you do suffer a bug or error, you will easily find a solution for it through Google, thanks to the large amount of players who have played this and other CS/HL games over the years.It's extremely small compared to modern games and will take up very little space, even if you start adding custom content to it and customising it further. For anyone with a normal internet connection you can download this game very quickly.Controls are what you're used to in PC shooters. Pretty intuitive and unsurprising. Thankfully, if there's anything that is not working how you want it to, you can change it. Controls can be changed in the options menu and if there's anything not listed in there, you can always find a way to fix it by using the developers console. This may sound complicated if you're a casual PC user/gamer, but again, the community has made sure that there's enough information for you to figure things out without spending a lot of time doing research and basically missing out on actually playing and enjoying the game.Besides regular user controls, there are also enough options and commands by default for server owners (you, if you're hosting a game) to keep control of the match. These can be expanded upon greatly by installing an administrative modification on your game (server) and again, there's enough information for anyone with limited computer knowledge to succeed in this endeavour.Pro's:-Basically an improved Counter-Strike 1.6-Extremely and easily customisable with a lot of custom content available-Easy to learn, hard to master-Features working bots (not brilliant ones in gameplay, though) and the game can ""learn"" custom maps and make waypoint files for the CZ bots automatically. They work in multiplayer too-Comes with Deleted Scenes, separate game on the same engine that has you playing a proper SP campaign, going across the world to stop terrorist activity in scripted missions.Cons:-Highly underrated and not well known, will not have as much players as other CS games (best played with friends)-Somewhat pricey, unless you're planning on playing it a lot, despite the content available and given with just the game itself------------------------Visit our steam review group page:http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreviewReviews of games with titles starting with C, and reviews/translations of thisgame (review) by other group members in this thread: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thedairyreview/discussions/0/537405286660678835/ "

												A good way of experiencing Counter-Strike without all the stress of playing with other players. You can assemble a team of bots and fight in different maps, each with different missions to complete (kill people with a certain weapon, rescue hostages etc.) You can create custom mission-packs or download from others.Also, deleted scenes is the badass single-player CS we all wanted. Go for it. You will not regret it.			"

												Cory in the House is a television show, which aired on the Disney Channel from January 12, 2007 to September 12, 2008 and was a spin-off from the Disney show That's So Raven. The show focuses on Cory Baxter, who moves from San Francisco, California to Washington, D.C. with his father, after Victor Baxter gets a new job in the White House as the official head chef. The series marks a Disney Channel first, as it is the channel's first spin-off. This is also the only Disney Channel spin-off series to be broadcast in standard definition for the entire length of the show. Reruns of the series have not been produced on Disney Channel, or on Disney XD; however they continue to air on the Family channel in Canada. Raven-Symoné guest-starred, reprising her role as Raven Baxter in one episode. In 2014 Disney Channel started airing a weekly block called Disney Replay on Wednesdays nights, during which episodes of Cory in the House air alongside That's So Raven and Kim Possible, among others.

												It's essentially a slightly improved version of the original game. Featuring slightly improved graphics, and a single player mode. It also includes Counter-Strike: Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes, which is essentially a Counter-Strike campaign. I'm not a big fan of it, however.			"

												If you are looking for a hard freaking core trainer to getting better at other counter strikes, here is where you should start. You will start out with bots that are super easy, but as you progress and get to the levels on hard difficulty they will be so freaking hard. I have only pumped about a dozen hours into this and it has DEFINANTLY helped me with my accuracy and problem solving skills on global offensive. This counter strike is considered to be the worse, but I can tell you it is FAR from that. I would reccomend getting this game for training to be better on other CS games, or to just have and extremelly fun and VERY challenging single player experience. This game is a must buy for PC gamers. Make sure to tweek the setting so even people with the crappiest PC's can play it at a rock solid 60 frames per second. Trust me, worth the buy.			"

												Single player is quite fun, but can be boring. I like counter strike, and it was interesting to implement single player. As 1.6 will refuse to work on my computer, this is the most retro CS I have. The only thing I don't like so much is there is no dot in the centre of the crosshairs, making it hard to aim with non scoping weapons ( including bullpup)			"

												I really like this game.Back when Counter-Strike wanted to try to make a campaign mode. The game was based of mini.objective against bot on different maps, and the ''Deleted Scenes'' was extra off the full Counter-Strike Campain, with many elements of the online game being brought in with solo FPS gameplay mechanics to have a fun game. The multiplayer is very similar to the orginal but still have some better textures than the orginal, in my opinion.Really bring up some memory when i was young. Still love all old CS games.1.6 will always be in our history!			"

Deleted Scenes is meh, but I mean it was scrapped and then added in just because.  It's kinda frustrating, but with more polish it might actually be somewhat decent.I recommend this over CS 1.6 if you're trying to choose between this and 1.6.  This is basically CS 1.7.			"

												This game may be old, but its really fun to play! Unlike any other Counter Strike game, this one is more or less ment to be played on single player. With every location you secure you get something called Reputation points, and it allows you to hire NPCs to work with you, and no NPC is the same. They all have diferent skill sets, Different names, and Different weapons! Also , if you buy this, you get another, erm, Version of the game, bassed off of deleted scenes, which are more of you completeing missions like defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, and this version doesnt allow you to get team mates, its just you against NPCs. id say that game is worth it as well.

												Holy cow.I'm not really sure how to start this review because I started off with the game being a crappy and basically I had boughten a basically different modeled CS-1.6, lets get down to it?Multiplayer:I didn't get to play too much of this, mainly because there are not too many servers with players, I didn't get to play a few skrim matches though, fun stuff, basically 1.6 (I believe 1.5 was out when this game was available) I don't have too much to talk about here, maps are somewhat different from the original texture wise, there are a few added items like a shield w/ sidearm.Single player:Mainly the reasons why I was interested in this was because of talk of a campaign, when you buy the game, you will find two games in your library, Counter strike condition zero and counter strike condition zero 'Deleted scenes'. Huh, deleted scenes, does not sound that interesting in a game without a story, sounds like something a goldsrc modder would use, open up the regular game to come to a familiar titlepage, when you open up the single player, you are only basically taken to what operations we get in csgo, killing boats for challenges... No story, no different maps, same deal with increasing difficulty, there are plenty of these missions because each difficulty you can select has missions of their own. This was very disappointing and was not worth the $2 price tag, I groaned to myself and probably played five missions before giving up. It was the silliest idea ever. Looking at the games screenshots, there looked like there would at least be  some characters and an okay plot! But sadly what we were given was this ""Bot killer simulation 1997"". I was greatly disappointed and would have been bothered even more if I had bought this on CD format. Untill. The deleted scenes, who would want to go through that? Well I mean I would, I like to see beta content or removed items and such and that's all I was expecting. Most people are not into that, but I installed that puppy anyways, on the title you are given the option to go to a map screen and start a new game. What I saw five hours that night was one of the best games I have experienced in awhile. WE were actually given a story! Well not really, you were basically pulled into a quick briefing and pulled into chaos, my eyes were glued to the screen. Honestly it felt like I was playing a half life game with realistic environment for its time, wait a minute. What's that say on the wikia for CS condition zero? The game had three development teams? The deleted scenes were made by gearbox?!?!? No freaking wonder the missions were awesome, I have poured five hours into the game and I'm not even half way done, there had to be at least 20 missions all taking place in different environments, one moment you are American in an middle eastern city underseige, the next you are shooting your own comrades in an russian mission plant. Literally, this game (deleted scenes) was amazing and I feel that valve really should had reconsidered gearboxes version of the game.			"

												CZDS is the franchise's first and only take on single-player campaigns, and it turns out pretty well! It's definitely a fresh new take on the game when it came out over ten years ago, and it still is today.Although most campaigns feels like your usual run and shoot, the pacing is quite balanced with a few puzzle and hostage/defusal/boss shootout battle scenarios insterspread to break the monotony. The maps are also well-made.A few downsides: the NPC's aiming sometimes feels inhuman, and the game incorporates a few stereotypes which are not to my liking.			"

												Widely ignored, but better than the previous installment. And it adds bot support. For LAN or party gaming this one is way much better than Counter-Strike. It has revisited maps, bots, better textures and models, more maps, better UI, even single player missions!Since it comes with Counter-Strike in the same bundle, it's a nice addition for everybody who loves this franchise.

												This game may be old, but its really fun to play! Unlike any other Counter Strike game, this one is more or less ment to be played on single player. With every location you secure you get something called Reputation points, and it allows you to hire NPCs to work with you, and no NPC is the same. They all have diferent skill sets, Different names, and Different weapons! Also , if you buy this, you get another, erm, Version of the game, bassed off of deleted scenes, which are more of you completeing missions like defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, and this version doesnt allow you to get team mates, its just you against NPCs. id say that game is worth it as well.

												Gamers who don't already own the frenetic Counter-Strike should be attracted to this new game as a good introduction that helps them transition into serious online competitors. Gamers who already accomplished Counter-Strike players will find the offline component somewhat novel but not indispensable. It certainly doesn't do enough to compete with today's shooters and the fact that much of the game is already available in another format makes this version seem a bit redundant.			"

												Condition Zero in itself is a unique package, allowing for progression of teammates in an AI environment. Nowhere near as popular as it's predecssor or successor, Condition Zero still provided a unique experience with an interesting change in visual design that is quite often forgotten.Deleted Scenes provided the first step towards trying to turn a very popular and successful competitive shooter into a single-player goal-oriented experience. While not inherently mind-blowing, the low cost of Condition Zero in combination with some neat ideas put together to provide a small, but interesting run through the ideas of what Ritual Entertainment was putting together for their contribution.Simple, basic, still interesting.

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the singleplayer addition to the timeless classic: Counter-Strike. The game adds a singleplayer campaign, bots, and graphical polish. While the game itself is very similar to the original Counter-Strike it adds many needed features that the first game lacked. For starters the new graphical polish that the developers added (I think there were something like 4 total devs) makes the game much more believeable and more fun to play. I felt the the developers really took the time to make sure the weapons were as close to real as possible. Because of this the game feels much more tactical than the first. In my personal opinion, this is the most tactical CS game you will find (when I say that I am excluding CS:GO). As for the bots they could've used a bit more work. From todays standards the bots are everything but smart. They often have trouble deciding whether they want to climb a ladder or not and frequentely stare at the wall hoping something exciting will happen. While these bugs are excusable for the age of the title, they do detract from the game. The singleplayer campaign is good and fun to play at times. If you are confused as to what to expect on the singleplayer campaign picture Half-Life but in the Counter-Strike world. Basically if Valve wanted to make CS a singleplayer game they probably would have done it similarly to how it was done in this campaign. It can be fun and actually quite exciting but anything far from challenging. The most challenge you will get out of the campaign is a big enemy with lots of armor and a machine gun.If you are a beginner looking for a introduction to the world of Counter-Strike, this is the way to go. The bots are a perfect difficulty for any new player and the game maintains the feel of the original Counter Strike. Overall Rating: 8/10For my full Counter-Strike review please click on this link: http://steamcommunity.com/id/RYNOMAN/recommended/10/ "

												Counter-Strike Condition Zero is like Counter-Strike except enhanced graphics, new maps, new hostages, new models, and more. Not really that popular, but the fun should still be the same if played in the populated server. This game comes with Counter-Strike so dont be surprised if you have it and never purchased it because it comes with it.I'd recommend it to try it out anyways, you will have it anyways when purchase so why not try it out.Also if anyone is curious of the story mode of Counter-Strike, go play Counter-Strike Condition Zero Deleted Scenes, it comes with it. Basically you will have 3 games for 10$, so go try that if you want to see the story mode of it.			"

												Not a whole lot offered here that you can't get from 1.6. Condition Zero creates a whole bunch of scenarios on the already-established maps and game assets, such as getting a certain number of kills during a match or rescuing all hostages. Condition Zero adds a strategic element to the classic Counter-Strike formula by having you pick your computer-controlled squadmates, each with their own levels of skill. You start with some rather mediocre backup, but as you progress in the game, you gain access to more skilled teammates. Balancing your team out and finding players that have their own strengths and can fill in your gaps makes the bots feel more useful. If single-player is your gig when it comes to Counter-Strike, this is a good expansion. However, if you're already deep into 1.6 or you only play online, then this isn't for you.			"

												(Purchasing this game comes with Counter-Strike 1.6. It's a good deal now, but back in 2004, I doubt many would pay 40 dollars for *just* Condition Zero.)Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the one Counter-Strike game everyone seems to never talk about. Passing four development teams (Rogue Entertainment - Gearbox Software - Ritual Entertainment - Turtle Rock Studios) and taking four years to complete because of this, this game barely made it out of development hell, and was not well received.This game was going to be more than it currently is, although some things did get in it, such as the Galil, the FAMAS and the Tactical Shield. Don't forget that the idea for a second LMG (M60 - the Negev in CS:GO is close to Gearbox's planned iteration for the M60 stat-wise too), the Grenade section in the Buy Menu, and Molotov Cocktails from CS:GO all originated in Condition Zero.While we will never get to experience the ""true"" Condition Zero, let's have a look at what eventually got released.Bots: The first Counter-Strike game to feature bots (on PC - Counter-Strike: Xbox was actually the first). They aren't the best, but they play well. Gearbox's version was basically going to have an advanced PODBot, as Markus Klinge was given access to the engine. While this was tested in a beta back in 2003, these bots did not make it to the final version of the game, Turtle Rock Studios' did. Personally, I wish that beta was uploaded somewhere, I'd love to test out the ""enhanced"" PODBots. (P.S: PODBot works on Condition Zero, so if you'd like those instead; http://podbotmm.bots-united.com/main_pb_page/index.htm)_cz maps: While Condition Zero was going to have new, original maps, those got scrapped in favour of ""_cz"" maps, which are graphical improvements of the Counter-Strike 1.6 versions. Some new maps do appear in Condition Zero, but the number of them does not reach the one that was going to be in other iterations of the game.Detail Textures: These were developed for Counter-Strike: Xbox, but they were later included in Condition Zero. While these did ""update"" the look of the game, when compared to other Valve titles which were to release a couple of months later (Half-Life 2/Counter-Strike: Source), these were nothing. Tour of Duty: A very simplified edition of Gearbox's campaign. Involves simple tasks, such as ""Kill 4 enemies with [weapon]"". There are six Tours of Duty in this game mode and each one consists of three different maps. You aren't alone in these missions however, as you can select up to five (bot) teammates to help you. The bots are divided in to five groups by cost; cost 1, cost 2, cost 3, cost 4, and cost 5 - with the cost being that of ""Reputation Points"".Deleted Scenes: Ritual Entertainment's campaign, with a few edits. The AI is a bit wonky, but the campaign is fully playable. Features factions that were only seen on Counter-Strike: Xbox, such as the Akunin. (this comes with any purchase of Condition Zero, despite it being ""another"" game in your library)Mod Support: While this appears in all Counter-Strike games (albeit limited in CS:GO), it's still worth mentioning, as many games don't have it.Dedicated Servers: Same as mod support, but still worth mentioning, especially if you aren't a fan of matchmaking.______________________________________________________________Conclusion: Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good game, but it could have been much more. I'd recommend it if you'd enjoyed the old (GoldSource) Counter-Strike games, especially since it comes with Counter-Strike 1.6, which is loved by many.			"

												Some people calls it the ""the underdog"" in the counter strike series, that is only because when CS: Source came out it split up the player base by a lot. the game is simular to cs: 1.6 but with slightly updated graphics, full campaign and using the engine (GoldSrc) which comes from half life (cs 1.6 before it became standalone was a mod, just like insurgency, ect.) people still plays it but only by the hundreds, its still an awesome game and it could be considered as a go to game if people gets bored from the other cs games. The game is so lightweight it could run on a carrot :)			"

It's a completely unnecessary remake of the original CS 1.6.The graphics are marginally better, the gameplay is exactly the same, maybe some changes to weapons' stats or so but not really noticeable.The ""campaign"" consists of playing ordinary Counterstrike matches with some specific goals like ""Kill 4 enemies with the Bullpup"" or ""Save all hostages"". You are accompanied by the most annoying and frustrating Bots in Video game history. The other team consists of Bots as well. Their skilllevel either stupid as a rock or stupid as a rock with lightning fast reflexes and godlike accuracy.It's not suited for training for online multiplayer since no human being behaves like that.Multiplayer is almost dead. Play 1.6 instead.			"

												It may be old, but it sure is still as fun as I remember it when I was younger. Its like Half-Life, but not as good. But still really fun. It comes with 2 games: Counter Strike: Condition Zero and Counter Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Deleted scenes has npcs and storyline, the main game... Is basically Counter-Strike with bots and challenges. If it weren't for Deleted Scenes, it would be pretty bad. I give this the stamp of approval, as well as a 7 out of 10!			"

												Wait... i did not reviewed this yet? omg...:CS just like 1.6 but... with small map changes and... same ♥♥♥♥ all over again...EXCEPT: great awesome singleplayer campaignThese 80 hours i played this game was 95% spent on single player campaign, which gives unique experience of small missions besides the match. There are 18 maps to play on those campaign (classics like dusts or aztec but also forgotten maps like chateau). Games are pretty much about getting better score, just like in any other CS with some changes:- Teammates Selection - Before the match starts, you get an option to choose up to 5 teammates. Each teammate costs points, which you get for winning the maps. Each bot is prefering different weapon, has different skill level, differently play as team, different bravery. So if you are playing map like aztec, you should get some snipers and on office get some guys with higher teamplay skills.- Mini-Objectives - While you play the match, you have usually 3 main mini-missions to finish during the match. Easier ones are like to get few kills with specific weapon, harder are to kill flash-blinded enemy. Sometimes you will have to kill two guys with pistol and survive the round, one of the hardest is even to kill an enemy with knife. To win the match, you have to finish all those objectives and be 2 wins ahead of terrorists. However, if you let them be 2 wins ahead, you loose and you can start all objectives over.Campaign is only playable as Counter-Terrorists, but there are a lot of downloadable campaigns, you can even easily make your own with your own bots and custom maps.+++ Single Player Campaign - you wont find anything like this in any other CS+- Its pretty old game, so graphics is just fine.- Forget multiplayer, i guess its not alive in this game80/100			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was and still is the best FPS for me. To me, it is better than COD and far more entertaining (as you can see in my hours spent in it). It has many servers which have many active players still (to this day) and their servers contain the default gamemode + many different modded versions such as zombies and whatnot. It is pretty similar to CS 1.6 but features improved graphics, a campaign and bots in Singleplayer. You will not regret buying this game. Do not judge it by its graphics but instead by its gameplay. Remember, if you don't like the default gameplay there are still MANY modded servers for you to play on! Also, it doesn't have a case opening simulator so you don't have to worry about wasting your money on gun designs and people judging you by which gun designs you have.Score: 10/10			"

												this is a great and classic game for players who have a crappy pc when it comes to gaming (like me). when you buy this, you get CS 1.6 (a pc classic) and CS:CZ along with ""the deleted scenes"" (i don't know what those are). believe me, there's a lot of servers to play on and a lot of friendly english-speaking people to interact with, and same with cs 1.6. i definitley reccomend you buy this, as you get 2 games for the price of $10.99 (also the deleted scenes).

												So, as it seems, CS:CZ is suppose to be a singleplayer game, along with traditional multiplayer mode almost identical to one found in the previous CS instalment, the infamous 1.6. As a player who actually likes playing against bots in online games, such as Counter-Strike (any), Team Fortress 2, FoF, Quake Live, Quake 3 and Quake 3: Team Arena, the whole ""singleplayer element"" found in CS:CZ is really, really bad in my humble opinion.The gameplay is just like your traditional Counter-Strike but with predifined number of bots and ""tasks"" instead. The player is given several tasks which MUST be accomplished in order to pass the mission. Unfortunately, majority of these tasks are absolutely what the player SHOULDN'T be doing in a regular CS match. Here are some examples:1. Kill x players2. Kill x players with a specific gun3. Kill x players with a specific gun and survive the round4. Win below x seconds5. Rescue x/all hostagesSo, here's my explanation to the following points respectively:1. Barely any progresss will be made if player's playstyle won't be shifted from cooperative towards tryhardish, with the former being much more welcome in online games. That means, in CS:CZ campaign the player must play aggressively, lone-wolfing, making him prone to dying. Of course, the player may remain cooperative but it will very likely result in a rather unwelcome prolonging of the mission.2. In order to perform well, players should always use weapons they feel comfortable with/high tier weapons, however in this case the player MUST use a specific weapon (usually a fitting one for the map though). Sure, game forces us to try out different guns but in reality the players usually stick to Deagles, AWPs and M4/AK47 for the most of the time anyways. Perhaps that's the task, but still a crappy one, considering players have their most favorite and hated guns, which will never be chosen in an online game anyway.3. Same as above but this time with an opportunity to actually fail the task, forcing the player to be stuck with whatever gun he/she has to stick with for even longer until he/she finally manages to score required amount of frags and also survive the round.4. Another tryhard gameplay promotion. Frag opponents in shortest time possible, meaning, the player must rush B like a ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥ in order to pass the mission. At least it is somewhat challenging at times but again highly discouraged in traditional CS matches.5. The absolute worst of all tasks, since AI controlled hostages can easily get stuck, yet the task will be only ticked off when all of the hostages are rescued. Here's a number of things that can easily prevent player from accomplishing this task:a. Hostage gets stuck and it is no longer reachable (like jumping from a balcony/roof but the hostage doesn't follow). Even if reachable, it's extremely tedious to go back and it also increases chances of encountering an opponent, which can make player's ordeal completely null and void.b. Player manages to get to the hostages, takes them with him/her but bots suddenly frag the very last terro, triggering the win-by-elimination victory.c. hostages get in the way during gunfight, potentially making player stuck, giving terro an opportunity to score a frag and obviously preventing player from finishing this task in this very round. The loss might have an impact on the next round, reducing the chance of accomplishing the task even further.Summary:CS:CZ is a lazy attempt at CS singleplayer mode, full of solutions that are plain wrong and boring. Better stick to a regular game with bots and play as you wish. It could have been much better if it would have taken Half-Life's approach. Instead we have a game. barely different from any of the other CS games but instead with bots and boring, forced tasks. Tedious. That's all that can be said about the campaign. As a singleplayer game I do not recommend it. As a multiplayer game, you better off stick to CS 1.6 instead.			"

												This is the same game as Counter-Strike except it includes single-player mode, slight graphical tweaks, and new maps. I mostly play it for the single-player mode as the effectiveness of the AI makes it for a really fun and engaging experience for a while. Hardly anyone plays the multiplayer, you have 1.6 and Source for that. But within its lengthy development time, all the developers did significantly was add bots to an already made game. You can't help but feel disappointed but nevertheless, the game is included with your purchase of 1.6 (which is worth buying at some point) and for that, I recommend it.6/10 - ABOVE AVERAGE			"

I May Have Played Or Not Played This Game, Still I Will UpVote It As I Know How Much Efforts, Blood And Sweat Is Used To Make Any Sort Of Game, Irrespective To Big Or Small, Branded Or Small Devs. I Personally Do Not Have Time To Play All Games, So I Just Idle Them, No Offence, Just For The Cards But I Know That The Game Is Worth Shot Even If Not Worth Our Time As It Requires Tremendous Efforts To Make Even The Simplest Of All Games. God Bless All The Game Developers, You Guys Are Great Because You Guys Make Games And Games Are Life For Gamers And Stressbuster For The Working People.

												The CS:CZ is not bad but isn't more significantly improved to the original. The new bumpmap textures, training camp, new models and maps are fine, though.As for the Deleted Scene part, I would consider it as a bonus DLC for CS:CZ. The Deleted Scene is generally a Single Player game based on CS but it contains a cool Fibre Optic Camera attached PDA and a blow torch to sneak and peak inside enemy lines.If you are a huge CS fan, buy it and I find this game OK but maybe a waste as CS 1.6 and CS:CZ are almost identical.

Oh and adventures on classic and our favourite maps.Features more than the new games.Pick it up, what else can you do with 9.99 dollars or something, maybe grab a couple sodas but they don't last or feature guns.

												This is a GREAT fun multiplayer game, but you need time to figure the map and the guns and the load outs ... I will have a little rant though, about a VIP player called ""Peabody"" ... this guy BANNED me for THREE days on the UGC server for having a little sing for no more than 10-15 seconds ... he didnt warn me ... he didnt say stop it .... ok on his defense it was britney spears BUT common MAN dont JUST ban people ... anyway when I went back on five days later I saw him and I called him out saying WHY did you ban me? you could have told me to shut up or MUTED me for an hour or BANNED me for 30 minutes ... I would have gotten the message i'm not a newby (well a little lol) i have been playing in this server for over 500hours .... anyway WITHOUT A NOTICE HE PERMANANTLY BANNED ME!! ... ok i did call him a D**K BUT he deserved it for what he did previously without a warning.Anyway its over now and I can spend the time not enjoying this server and friends I play with on there including Alfantander, Retro, pointless, rocked, x.e.y.w.a.n.i. (yeah its spelt like that) and loads ot other guys i cannot remember their names on the server but all cool guys ... ANYWAY ... WATCH OUT for PEABODY!! and its in the UGC server de-dust2 .... apart from HIM! the game and ppl are cool.			"

												I remember being given this game on disk by my uncle. It was a great feeling. The game itself was renowned and reading the reviews that were illustrated on the front of the packaging reassured me that this wasn't going to fail me. At first, I didn't play very much of it due to PC complications; after that I then started to play again. I began with the mission, I thought they were great and wished they were brought out to the later games like Source which I love dearly, sadly I was brought down. The missions, in my opinion, were a great addition to Condition Zero especially when you would rage quit multiplayer being hunted down by pros. The missions offered great customization on what teammates you were going to be battling with. Once chosen your teammates you were given a map and then it was left up to you and your teammates to either defuse the bomb or to rescue the hostages. Condition Zero was my first Counter-Strike, people regard CS 1.6 as the original and better game and I have to disagree. Condition Zero in my opinion offered good hitboxes along with fairly accurate registration, apart from defusing bombs haha.			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is the next installment of the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike.

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes is unexpectably great game.I was thinking that it will be like ordinal Counter-Strike, but it isn't.I cannot believe that it looks so great even it is running on Gold Source.And also the campaings are full of new features, such a RC Bomb, Radio...TOO MUCH THINGS!

												This game is pretty much just as good as Counter Strike Source just with older and outdated graphics and sound. This game does have improvements over Counter Strike 1.6. The offline multiplayer objectives playing with the bots is good. And the free single player campaign expansion that you get called ""Deleted Scenes"" is good too. A great game!			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a first-person shooter game from Valve. It is the next installment of the Counter-Strike series. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is basically a slightly improved version of the original Counter-Strike, but with many addition to the game, it can also be considered as standalone expansion pack.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero gameplay is 100% the same with original Counter-Strike. But Counter-Strike: Condition Zero has new Tour of Duty mode, more maps and the new singleplayer campaign named Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Deleted Scenes. Tour of Duty is a singleplayer mode game that is basically has the same game mode, but has some challenges objective that needs to be completed to win the map. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero also introduce offline multiplayer bots, where you can play against AI controlled player in offline game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero graphics is also basically the same as Counter-Strike, only has some improved models, textures and maps, but older maps are still included in the game.Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is a good improvements to Counter-Strike. I recommend this.Rating 10/10			"

												I remember back in 2010 when I got my first true gaming platform (computer-wise) my friend gifted me this game and I played it on and off for it was the only first few games I had on Steam since I was new to the community. This game is fun and although I won't play it anymore since I have Counter-Strike Source this game was a part of me involving myself into the Steam community and becoming a Steam user.Great game to shoot and kill people and great with many mini-games that the community has made up. If I was you though, I'd buy Global Offensive (I haven't bought it, I still have Source) because within this review the playerbase has that has logged into this game in the past 24 hours has been 1316 people and for Global Offensive it has been 292,836 people in the past 24 hours.Counter Strike Condition Zero playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/80 (lowest)Counter Strike: Source playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/240 (mid)Counter Strike Global Offensive playerbase: http://steamcharts.com/app/730 (highest)			"

												This is what happens when you have 3 cooks in the kitchen and take too long to get a game out. Compared to Half-Life 2 and Counter-Strike: Source, which both came out in the same year as this game (2004), Condition Zero offers practically nothing. The game was so bad during development that Valve even reverted its ""gold"" status and changed developers on the project 3 times. The result is that very few ideas feel consistent and connected. Single-Player experience? You just get a bunch of bot matches with arbitrary and unimaginative restrictions and goals to complete missions that are not connected in any way (there isn't even any pretend story). The nicest word I can use for the sense of progression is ""limited"". Also, when you finish the game, there's just... nothing. Multi-player experience? This game plays exactly like Counter-Strike 1.6, but partitions the players instead of just offering the campaign as an expansion (similar to Diablo II and Diablo II: LoD, which also came out around the same time). There are some exclusive maps, but I failed to see how any of them were an improvement to their CS 1.6 counterparts. Even if the maps were enough of an incentive, it was a pretty low effort endeavor for someone to copy-paste them into the CS 1.6 workshop. This means that you essentially had 2 versions of CS going on at one time, except one of them costed extra so people just stuck with 1.6 instead lol.Graphics? They look like hot garbage compared to the other games from Valve that came out at the same time (Half-Life 2 and CS: Source). The game looks like it was made in 1998.I got this as part of the Counter-Strike complete package during a Steam Sale, and it felt like an incredible chore to finish. There is a video from a recent CS:GO major talking about the history of Counter-Strike, and they mention how ""Source is almost forgotten in CS history"". Funny how they comment on that while actually omitting CS:CZ from CS history. Honestly, this game is an embarassment.			"

												Counter Strike Condition Zero,the game that many people call this game the worst Counter Strike game ever,but everyone has their opinion,actually i like this game,also you can play Counter Strike 1.6 maps versions or Condition Zero versions,and its missions that you can play only as Counter Terrorist,4 difficulties:Easy,Normal,Hard,Expert.Note:If you play expert difficulty in missions is friendly fire enabled so watch your fire.The game made by Turtle Rock Studios which also made Left 4 Dead.Final note:7.5/10			"

												You'd think this is a fun singleplayer offline version, but it's really not.  Bots on your team can't aim at all, and bots on the other team have superhuman accuracy.  On top of that, the game gives you stupid missions to accomplish such as using garbage weapons to score kills with like using a low tier smg on a long-distance map, or using a low-tier sniper rifle on a close quarters map.  Maybe if they paid you to play this, it would be worth your time, but the idea of paying for it is laughable.			"

												The online is pretty barren at this point. The servers that are up are mostly outside the US or running mods that probably suck. But there are some reasons this maybe the last real ""Counter Strike"" game as the later ones went to Source and the problems relative to that. Aswell as far reaching but in reality small changes made in CSGO and CSS that really make it very very diffrent than the older games when in play.Graphically CS and CS:CZ are pleasant looking, simplistic, whats good for a competative shooter game. Its easy to see enemies. Models look pleasant, and its still has some really great 3D sound effects.Suffice to say if this game had slightly better controls, matchmacking or was updated to have these features it would probably be alot more lively than it is today. Or even add those features for standard CS. I would rebuy or pay extra for that.CS:CZ and CS come together if you buy them and they would make a terrific LAN game.If you want something to play single player all you will get from here is Bot Matches (Bots are really good for a multiplayer game in CZ and better than CSGO bots). CZ Deleted scenes is included but this is basically an unfinished old game thats just not good at all but really had some capability to be pretty good but unfortunately they didn't further its development so its crap.If you want a multiplayer game for online play with random people around the globe, CS or CSGO would be a better choice since both of those seperately have way more players than this game.

												I bought 1.6 and I noticed ""Condition Zero"" and ""Condition Zero Deleted Scenes"" popped up in my library.  That's a plus, it comes for free with the original counter-strike.Condition Zero is amazing.  It's the Counter-Strike gameplay we all expect, but with a teambuilding menu and a campaign that bears similarities to Unreal Tournament 2004.  Across all the different maps, you'll be fighting the terrorists with your co-op bots, all of which have custom statistics, weapons and stats for Skill, Bravery, and Co-op.  The AI is competent and even unforgiving, minus the annoying standoffs between T's and a riot shielding bot, and the game remains a lot of fun as you have a 'tour' of each map with multiple side-objectives and a round counter.  If you can win three rounds and be ahead by two, and complete your objectives, you move onto the next round.  Trying to balance out easy victories versus, say, completing a round in 75 seconds or getting three tactical shield kills, is surprisingly difficult at times and gives the game a lot of replay value as each difficulty has a new set of objectives (don't even bother with Expert).Now, let's talk about CZ Deleted Scenes.  I've always wondered if Valve ever considered making a Half-Life style campaign for Counter-Strike.  It seems like such an excellent idea... and this seems to be a direct message to me saying ""Been there, Done that.""  That's right, this is a campaign, complete with events and mission-specific objectives.  In Counter-Strike.  That's where the praise ends, becuase Deleted Scenes is atrocious.  Don't get your hopes up like I did, it's one big steaming turd of broken hitboxes, amazingly horrible voice acting, and OCCASIONALLY showing a small amount of promise as a good game before more turds go into the fan.--These two games along with 1.6 knock GO out of the park.  If you want a Counter-Strike game for both online and offline, look no further than the CS 1.6 + CZ bundle.  Probably some of the greatest $10 you'll ever spend.  Also, there's no chance of an MP shutdown, since Valve holds the servers up with Steamworks to this day-- not that it would shut down, 1.6 is 20,000 concurrent players strong at all times.EDIT: Okay, maybe 30,000 50,000 people... not bad for a game from the 90's.

The expansion of Counter Strike 1.6, but with a Single Player storyline!
It was pretty fun, challenging and interesting.
Not much to say, I enjoyed it.

												So, I got this along with buying counter strike. When I started it up, right away the screen was off, so I tried to change it, and it crashed the game.(This is on an Alienware Area 51 r2 desktop btw). So, I had to play it while it was windowed. When I started an offline game with bots, there was major lag issues. (Yet again, on an alienware area 51 r2 desktop). And whenever I tried to disconnect the server, the game would crash, resulting in me having to either restarting steam or my computer. So, I dont know if it either was a virus, or the game is just too old to be played. This wouldn't have been a negative comment if it weren't for that...			"

												Counter-Strike: Condition Zero is the first official sequel to mod Counter-Strike, released in retail in 2004. It was pretty much same Counter-Strike on same engine and minimal changes when it comes to multiplayer experience, but it had more to often to solo players, with addition of bots and ""Deleted Scenes"" pack of single-player missions.Now, for multiplayer community... Is as good as ever. While it's not on the level of Counter-Strike 1.6, you will still be able to find few almost-full servers, whetever it's yet another De_Dust2 map or some server that actually rotates maps. Just more smaller tighter community. BUT it's kinda way too high-skilled by now for newbies to be able to enter in easily.So, when it comes to the main, expected, multiplayer part of the game, it didn't recieve many changes. Explosive grenades are stronger. Hostages are a bit more realistical. The end.Oh, and you will ntoice that graphics got a small boost, as far as HL1 engine goes (""GldSrc""). Models got more detail to them. Few tweaks here and there. Maps are much interesting as far as graphical design goes. If you are going to play de_dust2 non-stop then better do it at the less bland one.And yes, I don't really like Counter-Strike realistical gameplay much here either.Now, for single-player, you finally get some bots to play with. Which are less frustating for new people than online play and helps to hone aiming skills as well better. Though, while they navigate through default maps quite nicely, they don't always make best decision. As a protip, always send them a voice command to stick together, team. They also try not to steal your fun of defusing bomb, waiting for commander to do it, even if said commander is in opposite end of map. Yes, it's a flaw.And like Quake 3 Arena and UT, CZ single player consist of repeated matches with bots, as you will progress through trio of maps, being able to pick less and less stupid teammates over time, always being on side of Counter-Terrorists. And on each map, you have to have more than 2 wins over score of Terrorist team and have to complete each of three objectives, which go like ""rescue <x> hostages"", ""kill <x> amount of Terrorists yourself"", ""finish some round in <x> time"" and ""kill <x> terrorists with <y> weapon"".  So, fun for a while, but more of ""just so something was there"".And now for Deleted Scenes. This is what Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was supposed to be at some point, a full-blown single-player campaign. It was ""cancelled"" once Valve saw magazines giving it low ratings to preview, just to have it put along as bonus into final game. All just to get low ratings once again due to being ""more of same"". Deleted Scenes had 12 missions in retail release, with Steam version adding 6 more that you can select anytime from World Map.Now, Deleted Scene is a mix of good and bad. The excellent level design and repetive core gameplay.First, good things. Level design is quite good one. You will have to take control of unnamed heroes of counter-terrorist operations all over the world, with missions having great variety, with enough lenght to keep you playing, having to stop terrorists from taking over nuke in snowy part of Russia, defending yourself in Arabain town or fighting your way through the jungles. Seriously, some of the missions just have a bit of that scripted hollywood love that would make them worthy of being in Call of Duty and alikes, quite epic! Levels themselves are also build with knowledge of pacing and a bit of exploration, albeit linear.And it really tries to push GldSrc engine! In order to make it look like it's capable of more than expected, developers made a lot of animations of death for terrorists as well as destruction animations. Hell, I was amazed to see a stack of boxes getting squeezed by a door in the third mission, it's all quite joy to look at even if it's scripted. And well, it does hurt occasionally when it comes to enemies deaths. Like, when you shot with pistol at melee enemy into knee and he suddenly teleported half-meter away to the door, swirled and fell toward the door, just to get it open.But core gameplay of Counter-Strike doesn't translate well at all into linear levels of single-player. What you bassicly will do, is to shoot few bullets into heads, while taking some hitscan bullets back. Repeat it on every enemy. Until the end of the game. It really is repetive and boring. Weapons don't matter much, all of them are good enough for bursting enemy again and again. Grenades aren't given often and flashbang don't seem to be as useful as in multiplayer. Smoke grenade is more offensive there though, making enemies cough instead sometimes. There is little enemy variety as well, you just got whatever hitscan stupid enemy, stationary snipers with laser, whatever melee enemy that rushes you and terrorist with freaking bazooka that is pain to avoid too! So, burst headshot, and burst headshot, repeat repeat repeat.It also finally get to have some music there. For once. So, something definitely good.Counter-Strike Condition Zero is better offer than Counter-Strike 1.6 and has more value for solo players, but it's still not good enough to get me much interested in such twitchy realistical shooter. I still wouldn't recommend new people, especially with newer CS titles out there, only those who already play Counter-Strike should check out this one.			"

												COUNTER STRIKE: CONDITION ZERO Cs 1.6 with graphical improvements and bot mode.GraphicsSame as CS but a few improvements. New player model 1 for each team. Slight improvements to weapons and such. But This is 2004 And Halflife 2 came out about the same time with the source engine. BUT this is on Goldsrc engine for a game that was realeased in 2004. AI: 8/10 Has a ""Campaign"" which is basically matches against bots where you try to complete goals like""Kill 4 enemys""""Rescue 2 Hostages""""use a Flashbang""Makes a nice Practice mode for singleplayer because the original CS didnt come with bots. The enemy AI is quite good if you arent a CS Pro and I had to reapet level quite a few times. Sound: 6/10Slight Improvements but overall the sameGameplay: 8/10Same As the original counter strike but i feel the hitboxes are a bit bigger. Recoil is still there so Spray-and-Pray isnt the way to go.Overall 7/10Decent Game Dont buy it on its own get it with CS:Complete Pack or the original Counter StrikeGame Design 6/10Pretty Good. Improvements across the board. Overall 7/10Only buy this with CS:Complete Set. Or with CS 1.6 Multiplayer is Mostly Dead. COUNTER STRIKE CONDITON ZERO : DELETED SCENESExpansion Pack For CS:CZ With a new campaign thats exactly like your average COD campaign WITH ZERO PLOT. I dont know why they made this because CS:S was almost finished and HL2 was hot stuff.Graphics: 6/10Same As CS:CZ and new enemy player models for the campaign. Not much to say here Sound 5/10Same as CS:CZ but some nice (and awful) music.AI: 4/10TERRIBLE the enemy ai in the campaign basically cycles from Run at you, Shoot you, Run away, RepeatEnemys have no strategy at all and Require no tactics to defeat unlike CS 1.6/CS:CZ. The only thing diffucult is when enemys respawn 2 seconds after you kill them. You dont make a game where enemys respawn after killing them to make up for there diffuculty. Game play 5/10Nothing New.Game Design: 6/10Levels are varied like a stealth mission and such but nothing special. No new weapons. Nothing specialOverall 5/10I dont know why the released this instead of CS:S. "

												Too too bad. I rate this game to 0/10, why? Enemys and Team mates AI=0. Grenades are  useless. Soldiers coming behind your back. The most frustrating thing is your teammates are die all the time because they can't kill just 1 terrorist. Bazooka terrorists going to troll you and you are going to ragequit. That's why i hate this game. This is VALVe's baddest game i have ever played!			"

												This game is all about the mission and the offline campaign that was created with it, called the ""Condition Zero: Deleted Scenes"". It was way easier than 1.6, headshots and spray kills happens way easier than in 1.6, and whereas some spam points has been removed in the old maps (and in the added CZ maps), it doesn't really change the layout all that much. It's still the same game - just easier, imo. I don't recommend it, since the campaign is dull and boring, gameplay answers to 1.6, just easier, as previously mentioned, and lastly, the ""Call of Duty"" offline bot campaign is so boring and repetitive, you might want to just beat expert, never to come back. It's that terrible. Buy 1.6 instead if you want the game in it's entirety, because CZ, while Source added some new elements and better graphics, is just a blatant copy with extra features thrown in there, for people who doesn't care.

												dieses Spiel ist eigentlich zimlich gut und man ist schnell überrascht was man damit alles anstellen kann so viele Mods wie ( Star-Wars , Left 4 Dead , Furiens ) und noch viele mehr ich muss auch zugeben manchmal war ich sehr überrascht was das spiel alles zu bieten hat ^^Edit: So schade es auch ist aber dieses Spiel wurde von ""Counter-Strike Global Offensive"" total vernichtet! Damals gab es jegliche Art von Mods und ca. 1.500 Server jetzt nach der Erscheinung von CSGO gibt es ca. 1.000 weniger Server und darunter sind leider die ganzen tollen Mods. Es gibt nur noch die Mods ""Furiens, GunGame, Deathrun, Jailbreak, Surf, Zombie Plage und Base Build"", natürlich wahren diese Mods schon immer dabei, mit dem Unterschied, dass ""Star Wars, Left 4 Dead"" und ein Haufen an Furiens Servern ""down"" sind und damit nicht mehr erreichbar. eine echte Schande, dabei ist CSGO nicht mal ansatzweise besser als Counter-Strike Source, was ich auch gerne kaufen würde, allerdings weiß ich nicht wie stark dieses Spiel getroffen wurde und ob es da überhaupt noch Server gibt... traurig aber war, CounterStrike Conditions Zero wurde von CounterStrike Global Offensive zerstört.

												ok so i just played the game and i say this game is not that bad after all i haven't played multiplyer because there is not even around 100-200 players online which is a fair amount but this is cs the campaign is weird i played one mission the bot teams is just not that good of a defender of you they mostly ignore you and let you die and it sucks but because of the selection of bots that you can chose that gets better if you played more it feels like candy crush and mmo-ish games where you play more you get better loot progres easier(not really) but instead of loot you get better bots...which makes the game harder due to the fact that you have to make choices and only one mistake makes you lose and that makes it way harder to even choose a ♥♥♥♥ing bot when you can invite friends or random pepole but volvo ♥♥♥♥ed up again sorry valve but i'd rather play cs:go then cs:cz but hey i give some credits to you its again not to bad no more news showed up since 2014 and i'm making this review on april 2016 so yeah you can do what ever you like i don't care much i whould give this a solid 5.2/10 just need some fixes events news and etc...
