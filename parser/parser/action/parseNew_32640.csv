												While the AI and graphics are bad, the gameplay is good, there are 30 different missions, and you can play in 4-5 styles on each mission. The arsenal is pretty big too.			"

												An absolute classic and the one I like most in the series. Has a couple of bugs, but it is always a joy to get back to it. Nostalgia is one hell of a drug.			"

												Still one of the best FPS ever made. COD and BF doesn't add up to the gigantic maps and switching of guns midgame. It is just one of those gaming classics that you wish still had an enormous online community. Still the Single Player campaign is enjoying enough for me to get my freak on! Rating: 9/10.			"

												Other then UT2004 this was one of my most favorite games of all time back in the days. Shame I cant show my game time from back then because I pretty much lived on this game when I was not at work or some place else. Bought the CD like 8 times because people kept jacking it. The last time after I begged Novalogic to add it here on Steam I destroyed all my game CDs or Gave them away & bought my games that were available here on Steam. No more jacked disks, scratches, or lost disks. Wooo whooo! Don't show much play time on Steam because the game runs smoother on XP then other later versions of Windows. Runs pretty good on Linux too but I prefer Windows for gaming. If you have Windows XP & a decent video card for the games time then you might enjoy this game. I don't think they have any rated servers anymore but you should still be able to find quite a few player based servers some of which have their own stats servers. One of the best Squads I played on was KOP which I got into by a friend I played Co-Ops with all the time ""Drippen KOP"". Any way if you want a good FPS try it out!			"

												The Delta Force Series games are wonderfully done and well laid out. With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.			"

												This game is much more arcady and action-focused than Delta Force 1 and 2. Be advised.Pros:-Nice old FPS with Single Player campaign;-Has a new 3D engine in comparison with its predecessor, Delta Force 2;-Has a new weapons selection menu that makes things much easier;-Works on Windows 10;-Comes on cheap bundle on Steam.Cons:-The Single Player campaign is a little short.-Get Fullscreen with the software dgVoodoo, putting it on the folder ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Delta Force Land Warrior"".

												It's just as I remember back in the day! So nostalgic! My mom used to scold our dad for letting us Play this game, but he'd still let us play it. Playing it brings me back to the good ol' days.  If you're used to newer games and their good graphics like Borderlands or Fallout new Vegas, you may not like this game. But for all of us 90's babys this game is a must have!!!			"

												Bizarre shift for the series. Realistic feeling missions were replaced by one-man army killathons. The stoic spec ops soldiers you played as previously were replaced by action hero characters with cliche personalities and cheesy dialogue. Realistic weapons were cluttered with many oddball designs that just look cool, with the titular Land Warrior concept billed as the obvious weapon of the future (it wasn't.) Combat was tweaked to be more like an action game than a tactical shooter. The new engine was supposed to be a giant leap forward in 3D gaming, but didn't run properly on most computers, and the game is still super buggy.			"

Multiplayer i cant guarantee as it doesnt seem to be that popular and servers seems to possibly be dead. So i cant promise anything about multiplayer, but story mode i guarantee you will like.			"

												Delta Force Land Warrior (just DFLW from now on) is basically Delta Force 3, a slight refinement of their ""voxel engine"" ground based games (which includes a tank game as well as previous DF games, and the Commanche helo game), with a pretty long campaign, some single mmissions (which includes many of the campaign missions), plus the real reason to play DF... multiplayer mode. I will be mainly discussing SP because I generally don't play MP. Being a 14+ year old game, the poly count on the characters and structures are bad, and buildings are almost always at right angles to each other.  However, the ground is gorgeous, with smooth contours that you can jump, slide, crouch, even crawl and sometimes, swim through. (Yes, there's some water levels, like island map or swamp map). You are limited to what you can carry: 2 heavy weapons, 2 long guns, one pistol, some grenades, and optional equipment. Heavy weapons are AT-4 rockets, satchel charges, or claymore antipersonnel mines. Optional equipment would be extra ammo or kevlar vest for a little more protection. Two long guns are plenty, but basically its one for long range work (sniper rifles or LMGs) and one for medium/short range work, such as assault rifles, SMGs and shotguns.  There are occasionally supply cabinets where you can requisition extra stuff (i.e. change your loadout) within the mission. There's no scavenging off the enemy or such. If you used up all your ammo, you're done for except for your knife. Anyway, as said before, the beauty is the terrain, as each map is HUGE. MUCH bigger than most MP maps. While the ground is not really textured the contours are such that you don't really feel what's missing. The hills, islands, or little bayou feel ""real"" (or real enough) and the fun part here is water, as there's more water-related missions such as island (and you can take a dip by swimming underwater) and swamp (lots of little ponds to hide in).  The buildings didn't get any upgrades, as remain as they are in previous DF games... Mostly sharp angles much like Castle Wolfenstein, but with true multiple levels, and enemies possible at all levels. AND there are possible underground elvels where you get even more stuff. There is no underground passages map... All you get is this little ""radar"" which doesn't tell you any levels. And sometimes, you don't get even that (i.e. no satellite coverage for you!)Any way, the game basically boils down to two phases... From long distance, snipe everybody you can see before they shoot you (enemy snipers are rare) preferably with a silenced weapon so they can't find you. Circle the entire enemy camp and repeat (and take out the surrounding patrols). Then go inside the camp and clean it out in CQB with your silenced SMG or silenced pistol. There really is no point playing it any other way, no matter which type of operator you pick, at least in SP. Wind and bullet drop at distance are simulated, so you have to account for wind and measure the distance (read it from the scope), or you can view the bullet impact and adjust manually, if you shoot that far. Hypothetically shots of 1000 meters is possible if you get the sniper rifle with the most powerful scope (14x), the Barrett M82A1 .50 cal sniper rifle, but in practice most shots will be at about 100-300 meter range. The missions will have you travel to various exotic locations, from sands of Egypt (Sphinx and Pyramids) to jungles of Colombia to deserts of Mexico (complete with a ghost town and church) to snowy hills of Europe to little islands of Micronesia. Of course, visually they are roughly the same, albeit with different lighting levels and ground colors. :D  (and structures and vegetation)You will encounter dozens, perhaps hundreds of enemies, many of whom are equipped as good as you or better. And they are capable of one shot kills. And sometimes, you'll even run into enemy gunships. Which brings us to some oddities of Novalogic games: the key bindings. Basically Novalogic seems to be allergic to use conventional key bindings. There's no ""grenade"" key. While they use WASD, everything else is weird. Save key is F11 and Load key is F12 (which of course, conflicts with Steam's screenshot key). And there is no AutoSave or Checkpoint save. If you didn't manual save and you die, you start ALL THE SAY BACK AT THE BEGINNING. And you are only allowed 3 save slots per mission. (and some of these missions can run VERY long, esp. if you do it the slow and careful way)There is that feeling of accomplishment though, when you managed to clear the map and depopulated it of enemies all by yourself, by sneaking left, and right, and sometimes, right under the enemies, and shoot them in the back or the sides, often when your teammate (AI bot in the script) sometimes don't even survive that far. The game sometimes do throw you a curveball or two, such as scripted events when you get to a certain point on the map, like spawn new enemies. There's a mission where I need to lase 6 enemy attack helos. Got that. As I went for extraction, my extraction chopper got shot down (scripted). I ran for the chopper, found the pilots escaped unharmed, tried to lead them to secondary extraction zone, killed a patrol, when 4 paratroopers dropped in front of me (from what? There's no more helos and there's no planes overhead...)  As this game is almost before the wheeled mouse, mousewheel adjusts the shot compensation, not zoom level. This is part of the other interface quirks present in almost all Novalogic games. All in all, DFLW is an old classic. It's redone as Delta Force Xtreme a few years back, so you should get THAT instead of this game. This game is NOT recommended except for nostalgia or complete a collection.  "

												In the day this game was tops, great multiplayer mode so much fun sniping your mate laying down on top of a sand dune. But this steam ver i can't judge, just does not work lol mouse stops as soon as game starts and can't get out of first menu. So i guess i wasted my money but people are getting it working so incontrast. From old experiance this game is awsome but it may not work on your modurn computer becauses its old i suppose. Hopfully theres some solutions to the problems in the future and i can give a more relevent review :P.			"

												I feel as if NovaLogic shipped this game unfinished. Even with the latest patches this game seems to have a ton of glitches in it. Path finding is messy and sometimes going to a waypoint for extraction does nothing. But still, even with its flaws this game still outshines some of the first person shooters of its time.			"

												Delta Force: Land Warrior is a sequel to Delta Force 2, and it comes with many improvements. Pretty much all of these improvements lie in the graphics, but they should’ve fixed the 3d acceleration support in Delta Force 2 as well. That’s not saying much. The AI is pretty dumb still, but that’s acceptable because you don’t have much health either. You still get killed in a few hits or one direct hit in the head, so the game is not too difficult that way. This game makes me miss the terrain from Delta Force 2 because when looking at this game it looks like they tried to make it run on more computers but ended up sacrificing the attention to detail and long grass. That’s not a good thing because it makes terrains in other games such as Project IGI look better and it seems to shimmer while moving around.The only other improvement I can think of is that they mapped “W,” ”S,” ”A” and “D” as part of your default controls as well but those can be changed anyway. They also made the weapons sprites for some reason. It’s a step back because they remind me of the weapons from the original Doom. In the first two games, they were actual 3d models! Quite frankly they were probably just too lazy to animate them.I don’t know what else to say; it’s another Delta Force game that has better graphics. Certainly, a recommend if you are playing through the series.			"
