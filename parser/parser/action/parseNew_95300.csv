												Well, what a wonderful game.Honestly, got is a part of indie humble bundle. Thought I'd try it out because was quite bored. And it turned out to be my favourite game of the year as of now.AS a 2D platformer it is quite demanding on your system - however nothing an average system can't manage (integrated graphics cards tend to have little support and in that regard run the game quite sluggishly. if you've got a separate gpu then it's gonna run smoothly). Nonetheless personally I think it's a beautiful game, even stunning. Mechanics are great - very enjoyable fighting, nice variety of weapons available and they all feel different too (a bit too ""soft"" and ""smooth"" for heavy guns like a rocket louncher or so, but it's futuristic plasma rounds that you're firing so I think it reflects on that well). Many different kinds of opponents that you will have to figure out how to kill, so it's not too much of a straight 'shoot em up' platformer.Where this game really excels is its soundtrack.The atmosphere it creates is simply... breathtaking. As a part of bundle I received it separately as mp3, and am listening to in on a regular basis - it's that good.You will quickly notice that this game is not lengthy. Still it leaves plenty of room for prolongued gameplay, especially if you like picking up achievements and accomplishing everything to perfection.To round up, as mentioned I was so blown away by this game - gameplay, soundtrack and (forgot to mention) story wise. Definetely pick it up if you're a platformer fan (imho it doesn't redefine the genre in any way - however it does show that it's still got that kick), and, well, even if you're not. I guarantee you will not be let down.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: AlientrapPublishers: AlientrapInitial release: April 2011Genre: Action, Adventure, Physics Puzzler#Worth/NotWorth: #DefinitelyWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationBoy did this one surprise me, the freedom of movement is incredible. From your gravity hook, jetpack, anti grav pick ups, moving around truly feels great. It feels a little like Metroid. Due to the aspect of the isloation of an unitentional and forced exploration of a new planet. Some creatures being hostile and some not. Of course if you want to be crass you can draw comparisons to Terraria and Starbound without the crafting. But the movement and art style, I really like the art style, are enough to distinguish it apart. The weapons are diverse, effective and fun to use. The campaign is level based. Each with different objectives. Some are simple get to a certain location and others task with destroying certain targets or rescue missions for yor fallen comrades. I found that the physics here are slightly at odds with themself as tethering yourself to a human allows you to pull them up and simultaneously jump off of them pulling you both upward. Perhaps this was a happy conceit for pulling your buds out of harms way. Absolutely phenomenal soundtrack, It really makes you want to just explore a ♥♥♥♥in cave. Its exciting in a wonderous way. Definitely one of my favorite and more memorable indie games ever.Follow my curation for more "

												Everything the negative reviews say is true, as are components of the positive.To begin with everything is good, I can even live with the weird controls as you get used to them.But after a certain point the level design seems to exist simply to punish you for getting that far.Enemies constantly being offscreen and having to trigger them by advancing and yet not seeing them until you do is unacceptable.You get stars for completing levels, being an indicator of how close to perfect the developers consider doing the level is.The stats for the achievements give an indication of how far most players get, being - 20* - 28.7%, 40* - 9.3%, 60* - 2.9%.I have got the 60 and this was from playing 11 levels, and it doesn't take that much effort redoing the earlier levels to pad your stars.Good game, obviously well made, but bad level design punishes you in a way that would seem that it is your fault for buying and playing the game.In a bundle - give it a try if you can get other things you want.  On it's own - do not buy.			"

												Capsized is an action platformer, where player controls a survivor in cruel and unknown world after a crash of his spaceship. As for indie platformer the gameplay is really solid and fun. Every mission just leave player in a vast level with only a compass to navigate, a sheer number of physics based puzzles to solve and eagerly waiting aliens to kill. Yeah, physics have a major part in gameplay, as space around is a vaccum and every action runs differently from how we used to. At this part, I must mark some problems with Capsized. Most of them are small problems: controllers are ignored by the game and make coop mode useless, some achievements are bugged, physics at times just annoy, game only lasts 4 hours, a few crazy difficulty spikes... However, developer debuted with a cool concept and the game is mainly fun and entertaining. ReDiR's rating; 7.5			"

												Wow. I mean WOW!!! Did this game caught me by surprise!Handcrafted graphics, a nice storyline told in comiquesce pictures between the missions, and the music, man how i love this music perfectly blended with the sound effects. All in all this game sucks you right in with it's awesome athmospheric style. And  I'm quite sure not many people mention this, but the music never stops. There is no single moment of silence after you started this game. And so comes you will most definitely find yourself staring at the clock and wondering why it's getting bright outside yet you have the feel you just started that damn thing just to take a look a few minutes ago.This game is totally awesome. And from what I've seen so far it's got plenty of replayability for it gives you different arcade game modes as you earn stars in the main campaign. And even in the campaign is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of statistics to fullfill to get the perfect game.So for everyone who did enjoy games like ""Exile"" in the good old days ... give this game a shot. It's totally worth your time and your money.I totally recommend this game.			"

												Capsized feels like what happens when you make a great engine and art style, good sound, decent gameplay, and run out of budget 1/4 of the way through level design. It starts off decently, and the first few levels are okay, but then it becomes repetitive as hell and overstays its welcome.The end level could be cool, but repeating a boring boss three times isn't my idea of fun and ultimately I walked away disappointed, because it had a lot of potential.

												Floaty controls - which is thematic but also a little awkward.  The later levels are really hard, and not in a fun way that's rewarding to beat.  It would make a world of difference if, when you ran out of one type of ammo, they would switch you over to the basic ammo.  Instead, you switch to whatever's next in the queue, which can lead to you blowing yourself up or wasting something amazing.Level eleven just made me angry.  I guess I could have tried on easy, but no thanks.  It's hard to love a game when you feel like you're fighting the mechanics as much as the enemies.Music is good, though!			"

												The sole good feature of this game is it's soundtrack, which is amazing.  The rest of the game is terrible.The controls are floaty and loose, the guns are weak and awkward, the traps are sudden and unforgiving.The difficulty is binary.  On easy or medium, don't expect to die.  Ever.  On hard, expect to get instantly killed by enemies from offscreen.  Traps appear in one level out of nowhere and instantly kill you, resetting your progress.  It's a simple timed lock, but due to the horrific character movement you can't reliably get through.The graphics are consistent and pleasant, but at times make the game hard to read; you don't know if you're facing an enemy, a terrain outcrop or a usable tool.  An argument can be made that this is part of the theme of discovery that runs through the game, but the gameplay is completely mismatched with such a theme.In the end, a game must be judged on its gameplay.  I find this game lacking.			"

												Absolutely hated the game. Which is a shame, because I loved the atmosphere/graphics and sound.Enemies are not 'hard' in the traditional sense, just super frustrating. Some puzzles turn unsolvable if you made some mistake during the sometimes lengthy levels (level 11 I'm looking at you). Floaty controls that for some weird reason work better with mouse/keyboard than controller...for a platformer!Shame really :/			"

												Nobody said getting marooned on an alien world would be easy. In fact, it's pretty fair to expect that it'd be a rather difficult experience, but Capsized makes it fun nonetheless. Putting players in the shoes of a space marine lost on an alien world, Capsized hearkens back to the old days of 2d platforming on PC, setting the player to explore the alien landscape, fight off aliens, and solve objectives ranging from finding the exit of alien warrens to destroying idols or rescuing crewmates.Taking the visual style of Elemental Gimmick Gear and gameplay mechanics from Bionic Commando Rearmed and Alien Hominid, Capsized pits players against enemies of all varieties. Some seem to exist simply to annoy: small, mosquito-like enemies dart at you, avoiding your reticule with every dash. Heavily armored giants spray bullets at you as their armor makes your guns practically worthless. Pudgy foes with jet packs fill the screen with the Immolator, a sort of flamethrower that devastates even formidable opponents.And of course, there are more. More lurking in dark caves. Some that swarm in dozens. Some double, and even triple, the size of the spaceman. The odds are against him since danger almost always lurks at the edge of the screen. Capsized doesn’t work players through waves foes leading up to intense boss battles. Capsized keeps the players engaged in constant, stressful combat. Murderous foes occupy nearly every inch of the sprawling levels. Moving at anything but a careful, measured pace often means death.Combat makes up a significant part of the experience, but Capsized is equally about exploration. The planet’s gravity isn’t quite the same as Earth, so the spaceman’s got ups. With a grappling hook, he can reach high ledges, and if the next ledge proves just too far away, occasionally the spaceman will find fuel for his jet pack, letting him soar around through pea green and uranium yellow skies. All of these tools must be utilized as the player scours through each area in search of secret passageways and much needed supplies.As fun as it may be dangling hundreds of feet above the ground blasting aliens from a tether, Capsized is by no means a flawless adventure. Considering how much time it takes to travel from one part of the map to another, the checkpoint system could have been a little more generous. There are also a number of deadly traps in the game, many of which can’t be seen until the player unwittingly wanders into a hailstorm of undetectable arrows. This just screams of unfairness, especially since you have a limited number of lives at your disposal. One thing that two-dimensional games do best is allowing the developers to create distinct and detailed visuals, and Capsized is no exception. The thirteen levels are all excellently drawn and are packed full of detail resulting in really crisp and vibrant environments. Along with some subtle special effects such as night time, sun rays, smoke, and debris, they really suck you into the alien world, which is a great feat considering that there is no third dimension, and the game goes for an artistic, rather than realistic, approach. While the sound effects are solid by all accounts, it was the music and ambient audio that stood out for me, something which a lot of developers forget can have an even larger impact than flashy visuals.Capsized also has a variety of competitive arcade modes, as well as cooperative gameplay. However, one of the game's biggest disappointments comes from this, since the cooperative play is only local, which seems like a pretty major oversight for PC gaming. I was geared up to play with a friend on the other side of the country, when I realized that the game didn't support it.All in all, Capsized is a solid game. If you're nostalgic for the era of DOS-based 2D shooters like Duke Nukem or Commander Keen, there's a good chance you'll enjoy Capsized. With its classic gameplay and a wide variety of ways to get around, Capsized is a good first effort from Alientrap and a good sign of things to come.			"

												Beautiful game. The hand-drawn environments show a sense of care to 2D games that only a few devs have matched. It is very rare to feel like you have been drawn than just watching you character do things on the screen, but the Alientrap devs have gone above and beyond with this.The short little tutorial at the beginning is straight forward and controls are easy to grasp. The game introduces new elements very straight forwardly, allowing you to figure out what they do on their own rather than telling you, which keeps the element of discovery fresh in every level. The use this same concept for the enemies.The level design is great, providing secrets like in retro 2Ders to discover which will give you a buff or extra life. There is no map or compass adding to the genuine ""Lost and stranded"" theme to the game.If this wasn't enough to grab it, go check out the demo on Steam!			"

												Really loved this game. You get thrusted into a unique world full of life while having to struggle to stay alive.The game plays like a explorative metroidvania with an environment rich story to tell.You gain upgrades for your astronaught as you progress,survive and explore the world you are on trying to find you way through it all. Just because the game might have that ""another one of those"" type of looks to it, trust me thats not the case here. It has some slight puzzle problem solving elements brought to you via the platforming and encounters in the game world. The game does a good job with through lots of action,puzzle,platforming,problem solving, and boss battling at you.The controls with your jet pack take a lil getting used to but takes hardly any time. The game is a good simple explorative enivornment rich platformer. Get the game in at w/e price you wiling to pay; full price,on sale,in a bundle,or  a giveaway but just get it and enjoy a simple yet fun game.			"

												I fun little platformer with some great art and levels. The game took me ~5hrs, but longer if you want to farm all achievements. I never tried the local coop\mp so I can't comment on that, but it looks like it would be fun.I did run into a few bugs, only one of them was ""gamebreaking"": A piece of the ship I was salvaging fell thru the ""ground"" and was stuck so I had to re-do the level; I guess not gamebreaking but a little frustrating (didn't happen the second time). If you die with your grapple hook deployed, the ""static"" background noise it makes will continuously loop until you load a new game\level. Very annoying but easily fixable.The art\gfx is very cool and unique, but I think the music is what made this game for me!Worth it for <$10, just for the soundtrack alone!7.5\10			"

												The game has nice graphics. The game has nice music. The game has an interesting physics-engine. Still i don't entirely like it. It doesn't feel as a whole piece. Just like everything has been added together in a rather short time around a physics-engine without polishing controls, level-design, enemy-behaviour, story-inclusion (which i don't expect to be complex at all). Don't get me wrong. None of it is completely awful, but if the question is just between ""Do you like it?"" or ""Don't you?"" then alas i must say it's closer to: I can't recommend the game.			"

												Gets frustrating sometimes, especially with physics objects not always bending to your will and more often than not getting in your way. But overall, it was a decent adventure.There's 13 levels in which you complete certain objectives, whilst fighting off aliens and whatnot. You can jump off walls, rapple/grapple to objects and the environment, and use your jetpack when you have fuel for it. There's also a selection of weaponry to be found in the levels with limited ammo, while you have your default weak weapon that has infinite ammo, all weapons also have a secondary attack.Not a bad game, 7/10.

												Capsized is a game with good ideas, but numerous design issues.The game features a cosmonaut on a green planet fighting green aliens against a green backdrop and behind green vines. Yes, it is as cluttered as it sounds. The main menu, which consists of white text on a white background (which thankfully scrolls to other colours so you can actually read the text) gives you a good idea of what the rest of the game is going to be like. Eventually, you get used to it, but the developers do not seem to understand that 'good graphics' doesn't just mean nice looking textures. You have to use contrast as well. Draw the players attention to important things, don't hide it in a field of clutter.The vsync option in the game also does nothing (at least on the Linux version, anyways), and has no frame limiting. In other words, no matter how slow or how fast your computer is, you will have loads of screen tearing. I switched to windowed mode since I have my window manager (Compiz) set to vsync windowed programs whether they like it or not. I then discovered that the game doesn't try to keep your mouse in the window, so be prepared to accidentally click outside of the game a lot.Moving on to actual gameplay, the idea of using a grappling ""hook"" to swing around a low gravity environment and toss enemies around sounds great, but it behaves very strangely mechanically. Shooting a grappling hook horizontally into a wall somehow manages to let you move upwards? I also found the ability to stick to walls was preventing me from moving where I wanted to go instead of helping me.The are some other minor issues that could have easily been fixed had more rigorous testing been done. For example, many of your weapons cause splash damage that does very high damage to you if you're too close to where it hits. There are also rapid fire weapons that fire while you hold down the mouse button. When you expend all the ammuniton in one weapon, it automatically switches you to another weapon, firing it if the mouse is currently down. See the problem?Oh, and the game freezes when you try to exit it, so there's that too.			"

YouTube™ Video: Capsized Review 

			Views: 146		

			We take a look at the fast paced action platformer indie game set on a hostile alien planet; Capsized http://noobsthatplaygames.com/		

You and your crew have crash landed on a mysterious hostile alien planet and you must fight your way through an onslaught of vicious alien creatures to rescue your crewmates so you can escape. This has been a staple plot line for Science Fiction for almost as long as science fiction itself has existed, there is nothing new with the idea of this setting, or premise; however Capsized manages to take this setting and apply it to an absolutely gorgeous, intense, atmospheric environment paired with equally spine-tingling soundtrack. The game is a 2D platformer that combines both fast paced action combat and exploration elements. You control your marooned space cadet across various extraterrestrial environments battling your way through herds of fairly challenging Alien creatures with your main objectives varying from “Rescue X amount of Crew mates” or “Destroy X amount this alien artifact”. The controls of the game feel very refreshing and intuitive and you are packed to the brim with weapons and gadgets to choose from. Two gadgets in particular are what really make the gameplay feel fresh and interesting, the grappling hook and gravity ram; grappling hooks can be used to pull yourself to far away areas or can double as gravity guns similar to that from Half-Life, and Gravity Rams can expel massive bursts of energy to send objects or enemies flying.The entire art style for the game is very beautiful, consisting of complex hand-drawn artwork. The game only offers 12 levels, however the art style for each one feels fitting and sets the mood, whether that be a bright colorful level full of alien life, camps, and monuments or whether they be glum and damp and underground with darkness and danger lurking around any corner. The electronic musical soundtrack perfectly accompanies this atmospheric environment, further helping set the mood for each gorgeously illustrated level. Not only is the level design brilliant, but the enemies are also very well done. You won’t get sick and tired of being forced to fight any one enemy over and over, the game does an excellent job of spacing out various enemies of different species, sizes, and difficulty levels.  Capsized manages to provide a very enjoyable action platforming experience with a stunningly beautiful atmospheric environment. The combat feels good and there a large enough variety of both weapons and enemies to keep the game feeling fun and energetic. The only negatives of the game are that there are times when levels tend to feel a bit tedious and become a burden when slight mistakes cause you to have to retry missions multiple times; however this is merely a minor complaint. I would definitely recommend this game especially for such a low budget price of $9.99. The game plays at its best when played with a friend in local co-op. http://noobsthatplaygames.com/ "

What really made me rage quit is how often my tether wouldn't latch onto a perfectly good spot and I'd fall eight billion feet to the ground, or I'm trying to kill one of the floating priest dudes and hey, look at that, my plasma mortar somehow went right through him without hurting him! Hey, same with that guy! And that guy! Like the art style is cool, music is pretty decent, some of the story slides are funny, but I'm not recommending this broken♥♥♥♥♥game.

												This game was more frustrating that fun.  The controls were not good, especially on a gamepad (for me at least), which made fighting enemies difficult.  Nothing makes me dislike a game more than being unable to play it well due to the game, rather than being hard due to the challenge.The atmosphere of the game was alright.  Music was good, artwork and environments interesting, and it was fun trying to find some of the secrets, though, again, frustrating trying to control the gravity hook and swing into their hidden entrances.  It wouldn't have been so bad if there was more jetpack fuel, but then that could have made it too easy.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mine Capsized is a Sci-Fi action game developed by Alien Trap Games, the people behind Apotheon. Capsized is a 2D shooter where you, an astronaut working on a spaceship gets hit, you manage to escape along with some of your friends and crash land on an alien planet. Seperated from your friends you have to rescue them, then escape the alien planet, a pretty straight forward storyThe graphics are very pretty, although a simplistic game where all you have to do is shoot, the graphics and environments made me feel like I am on an alien planet. The music is top notch, very Sci-Fi type musicThe level of difficulty, it is easy at first, but for the last few levels of the game. Capsized takes a high difficulty spike and the game gets really difficult, very frustrating... Capsized is a very short game, clocking in at only 2-3 hours, this game is extremely short. But for the difficulty spike in the end, it was long enoughOverall, the game is not bad. If it had a better story and not the huge difficulty spike, then it would of made Capsized a better game then what it is, but for how it is, its a good game RECOMMENDED :)  "

												If I were to describe this game with one word, it'd be ""forgettable"". It runs well, looks nice, has some challenge to it, but the lack of story, memorable level design or unique gameplay sums up to a dull experience. With the amount of choice we have when it comes to this particular genre and games in general, there is no reason to spend your limited time on this.			"

												OK after reading the good and bad reviews I decided I needed to write oneI like the game... a lot, despite its ""shortcomings"", and I'm picky. The gravity manipulation weapon along with the jetpack are so fun. And I liked all the weapons dual fire modes. I think it gets a worse rap than it deserves, especially for a careful player that doesn't just ""run"" straight into the open thinking he's not going to get effed up. Along with great puzzles for the gravity gun and the ability to wreck pretty much everything in the game without shooting a gun if your insanely up to the challenge, great music and very cool unique art and enemies, I am completely recommending this game.Now for the things people complain about. First, enemies can see you before you can see them, and for those little flying ♥♥♥♥s it can get really annoying... unless you THINK first and accept it. Bait them and move slower than a rambo shooter. Or grab a ♥♥♥♥ing rock and hold it in front of you, bait them, and then smash them all with it after you move back into a crevice or tunnel. Not rocket science. Repetition on enemies... I'd have to agree... but not to the extent it comes even close to ruining it. I loved having to find the weaknesses of the hardest monsters. And all monsters are pretty much dangerous. Multiplayer has a few flaws but its still a blast.In the end, if you rated this game down for any reason, your either a♥♥♥♥♥♥ or you suck at videogames. I have 11.2 hours on record and 100% completion!!! It's NOT THAT HARD. This game is fantastic for the price. And if you don't like the gamepad, newsflash... its a computer game. KbM is a thousand times more accurate than a pad. Step your game up. 8.5 our of 10 for 2.50 on sale... any real gamer would be insane not to buy it.			"

Short, but sweet.Capsized is a fun action platformer that largely involves the usage of its physics engine to set it apart from more contemporary games of the genre. The game starts and ends with very few worlds. You are a nameless astronaut-soldier-person, who gets the ship that he's on attack by an unknown energy source. It's up to you to save your surviving comrades and battle through hordes of savage aliens.Yeah, it does feel a little cowboys vs natives, but you won't really be thinking about the story since the game usually involes the following:Shooting thingsPhysics antics.Shooting things with, I'll admit, a varied weapon set complete with alt-fire. Assault Rifles become shotguns, Flamethrowers become shields, and even a black hole launcher. 9 weapons plus power ups. The enemies are brutal on hard so you need it.As for physics antics... the best way to describe the physics was if Newton thought the world played like Asteroids. You have a variety of movement options like this energy hook to pull yourself or objects around, an awesome push mode where you can rocket jump with them and send little critters and objects hurling at your enemies. This also means you'll get some awkward levers and buttons, with the way you can send objects while hooked, it becomes a tad frustrating. Especially when you deal with things that repel bullets so you'd have to launch an object at it, sometimes you accidentally push your ammo over a cliff. But, I digress. Some levels do it well, especially when it's more open, but when they cram you into trap pits and the like you might want to break your keyboard.  The main negative is definitely the games best selling feature, oddly. Sometimes you propel yourself too fast into enemy fire, or you gain speed walljumping straight into an almost insta-kill poison trap (which has no indication of being there, besides smoke). Or worse, you have to carry objects to a certain area and the object gets stuck. Frustrating. So, really, great in an afternoon but it's not perfect. If this sounds good for you, I'd suggest getting it on sale since the most you'll get after the 13 levels is a pretty barebones arcade mode and some modifiers/achievement hunting for the story. These guys really like their physics, and I can't wait to try their other stuff out.			"

												Mixes the exploration of a Metroid with the physics of Half-Life 2's gravity gun, while maintaining an immersive atmosphere and problem solving that both series are known for.  Pretty short at 4 hours, and definitely on the harder side of most games, but definitely worth it once you get the hang of controls and get more creative with the tools and environments you're given.

												Controlls are floaty and VERY fickely. Story is basically non-existant. Levels are badly designed.This game is hard, but not at all due to its contant. The game is unpolished, and the combination of floaty controlls and bad collision detection (you usually end up stuck on a small invisible nook in the ground thanks to uneven ground hitboxs) just makes it harder to enjoy.

												You'll notice the negative reviews have a common theme. The controls don't feel right. ""Floaty"" is the usual term and that's fairly spot on. I used the term ""clunky""as well. The game has nice graphics. The game has nice music. But it's like they stopped there and didn't polish the most important thing in a game like this - the control scheme. That's a fatal error for a game where the later levels are pretty punishing.			"

												Capsized is an atmospheric 2D puzzle platformer that even as I describe it just sounds like another fish in the sea. The art is very nice, whoever designed the worlds and the characters is very talented. The puzzles (at least in the early stages) are exactly what you would expect, and I think any fans of the genre could play this game in their sleep.Where I just couldn't take it anymore was the control. I’m relatively certain it’s by design, since the atmosphere is alien and aquatic in nature, but I never felt in control of the character. Every time I wanted to make even a moderately precise movement, it felt like instead I just floated off into the sunset as if someone simultaneously enabled noclip and turned off friction.It’s pretty and all, but so are most of the more reputable indie platformers. The lack of control I felt while playing, however, instantly put me off from the game and really left me with nothing but negative feelings towards it.			"

												Don't make the mistake I did and think that Capsized is some kind of exploration-heavy metroidvania thing. The mentions of exploring and using tools to navigate might suggest that, but it's a very different beast. What you're getting is a floaty sci-fi platformer with a lot of shooting, a lot of physics puzzles, and a lot of frustration. And it might just be short enough to finish before you get fed up with it.Capsized sees you stranded on an alien world that wastes no time trying to waste you. The natives are restless and the fauna is deadly, and most levels are going to be spent depopulating the area so you can accomplish your goal. Instead of big, sprawling areas, Capsized takes place in fairly compact levels, each one starting you from scratch and tasking you to search high and low for weapons, jetpack fuel, extra lives, and other power-ups. I must emphasize, nothing is carried over between campaign missions, leaving each of the 12 levels feeling a bit thin.There's not a lot to do besides kill things, collect power-ups if you're having trouble killing things, and finish the level. Sometimes you need to reach a certain point, sometimes you need to collect doodads, and sometimes you really do just have to kill a bunch of stuff. Navigating the levels to do that might prove difficult, as your spaceman is very floaty and easy to send flying. He can wall jump almost effortlessly, grapple things with a grappling beam, and jetpack around, all with mounting momentum that can easily get unmanageable.You'll be shoving and grappling plenty of blocks, too, because Capsized loves physics puzzles. It feels odd calling them physics puzzles, though, because it's usually just a tunnel blocked with junk or a pressure plate that needs to be held down. Finishing said ""puzzles"" is another source of frustration, since the stones and boxes use the same physics as you and can easily drift away or rocket off the screen. The worst is when you're expected to use a block as a shield against the game's incredibly lethal traps, watching your spaceman get perforated as the block he's holding wobbles around lazily.Dying is very much the low part of the game, and it comes more and more frequently the further in you get. Enemies and especially traps can do tons of damage, and as they become more dense in the later levels it gets that much harder to avoid big chunks of hurt. When you die you either respawn at the last 1-up you collected OR the start of the level, which is infuriating in the more maze-like levels. Several of your best guns also do splash damage to you, and there are plenty of little critters that love to run up and attach to your face to catch mortars for you.The art is fantastically detailed, but becomes a bit too busy for a game like this. Sound design is nice and somber but the effects in battle, both audio and visual, are sorely lacking. There's so little impact to weapons you'll never really know how much damage is being done until your enemy (or you) is dead. A few co-op and arcade modes round out the game but the fact is that you're getting a 12-mission campaign that can be beaten in two hours, provided it doesn't make you rage. And whether it be the giant boulder that just will not get out of your way, or the jetpack sniper that runs you out of lives, something will most likely make you jump ship early.			"

												You've been shipwrecked on some planet and you need to save your mates and get home.You have a bunch of weapons and a tractor beam of sorts to push and pull stuff. Oh, and it can be used for climbing...but so can your jetpack. Redundant, I know.There's no story aside from some pictures to start levels. Levels all look basically the same.All the enemies seem to be animal-like in their nature, so why there are weapons laying everywhere I don't understand. They're kind of dumb too. Every one has specific patterns and once you figure them out you'll shoot from a distance to avoid attacks. Some enemies at the end get a bit stupid to counter this tactic. For example, one enemy creates its own gravity well to pull everything in, including your photon blasts, and somehow the live ammo and shots don't damage it, but get shot back to you after a time.This game gets great reviews on Steam, but it didn't blow my skirt up. It's also short. I beat it in a couple of hours. Fun enough for a night, but at about level 8 of 12 I was ready for the game to be done.			"

												A 2D action platformer with beautiful hand drawn artwork and a perfect soundtrack for exploring the alien world you've crash landed on.  Level design is quite open with large drops and climbs, forcing you to make use of your jetpack and gravity hook to get around.  In addition to clinging to walls the grappling ability allows you to manipulate environmental objects such as boulders. You also have a gravity ram ability, which is essentially a powerful headbutt that knocks back enemies and objects.  Still, guns are your primary defense against the alien life forms and most are fun to play with, each offering two unique attacks.  Capsized clocks in at only a few hours and offers Steam achievements, high resolution and several additional modes of play to mess around with once you finish the story.  There is gamepad support but it's not as accurate or easy to adjust to as the keyboard/mouse controls.			"

												Verdict: Meh.Capsized is a shooter/platformer. You use the mouse to aim and the keyboard to move around. I got through 3 levels before the time ran out. I got shotguns, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, super punches, and grappling hooks. There's environmental physics fun as well.I was really unimpressed with this one, but I can't nail down why.Good: Great art. Good music, good graphics.Bad:- Levels proceed in stages, like an old console game. This would be fine, except that it was telling a minimalist story in the beginning and in cut scenes. The gameplay and the story had nothing to do with one another.- Controls felt floaty. I know that's partly due to the gravity of the planet, but I felt like I had too little control over the character.- Nothing felt chunky or impactful.			"

												I want to like this game more than I do. It seemed like the game I was looking for to satisfy my need for a retro, side-scroller/platformer with more modern design choices--and in a lot of ways, it is. I like the array of weaponry, and I mostly enjoy the way movement works; when you get a feel for it, it's like bungee jumping across the terrain like a sci-fi Spiderman. Completing objectives in the campaign feels satisfying. But there are elements of this game that fall short in some important ways.Some of them are incredibly basic; the worst offenders were the incredibly slidey and imprecise movement, which detracted from what made the rest of that system interesting, and the lack of responsive gun-swapping control (via the MMB). Firing your weapon upon clicking to unpause is also incredibly sloppy and occasionally wasteful of uncommon ammo. I would also say that it was an oversight to neglect to put all the information relevant to achievements for each level on the campaign map.Larger but rarer issues also impacted the experience negatively. Although I appreciate the desire to throw new things at players and let them figure it out, there are some curve balls that would have benefitted from some kind of preparation or clearer cues. There was an enemy type (priests) that really came out of nowhere and seemed to just eat everything I shot at it, to the point where I considered that it was invulnerable except to some specific ammo. Any sort of consistent audio or visual clue that it was taking damage would have been helpful, but it rarely did either.Basically, this game is frustrating at many times in plenty of little ways, yet fun. I'd recommend it, with some caveats.			"

												Capsized is probably one of my favorite indie games of all time.It takes beautiful artwork, a serene soundtrack and solid game mechanics and controls and mushes them into one.Actually, the controls are a bit 'buttery', but it's forgivable. It's a game all about management of resources and using whatever's at your disposal to complete the level. Solving puzzles is also another key element (which is one that I thoroughly enjoy, might I add) that makes this game darn fun to play. They're not your run-of-the-mill ""Find the button on the wall and push it"" kind ofpuzzle, either. Again, you take resources at your disposal to clear obstacles, make way through trecherous landscapes and to dispatch enemies efficiently. iz good game.			"

Great platforming, very interactive physics and fun combat come together in a crazy fun package that is well worth the price. The campaign may be short but the game is highly replayable and really promotes score chasing with some fun unlockable modes. Grab the demo and play through a level or two multiple times to see how this game can provide hours and hours of entertainment. Add on the Bonus Modes and you have some great staying power. And enough can't be said about the artwork. Hand drawn graphics create a great atmosphere, with fun designs for enemies and a main character that will have you living out your astronaut dreams.

												Deceptively good, considering you see ""Capsized"" and expect some underwater♥♥♥♥♥♥ In actuality, space. Well, just an alien planet at least. With a very flowy control setup, and a pretty intuitive control scheme, its a quick game to pick up with. And in all honestly, it feels like a metroid game in its core, though it keeps its own feel. When you pick up the whole jetpack thing, it feels less ""We gave it to you, so now you HAVE to use it."" Maneuvering is fun, and fast paced. The hookshot allows for some good tactical placements and your Gravity Burst thingy, lets you put the jetpack into less of a key position of use. Ive found myself just bouncing around from ceilings as things shoot at me from below, while i rain bullets on them. Its worth the nice small price Humble Bunde 8 asks for, just to get a rather fun Indie game. This is probably further proof that Triple A title companies are focusing on the wrong parts of a game, and Indie companies are doing the right thing. Making♥♥♥♥♥♥fun.			"

												I got this game because I really liked older platformers with the ""keyboard movement / mouse shooting"" combo like Abuse. I thought if this is something similar then I'm in for a great ride... but not quite I'm afraid.Capsized is an absolutely gorgeous looking shooter/platformer with deeply flawed gameplay. The character movement is very floaty and not precise at all, I could have accepted that mechanic as in many other games if you didn't constantly get stuck on the environment (Even when walking on THE ****in FLOORS!?!) and had to jump to get around most of the time. The hand-drawn environments are painstakingly detailed which makes the game look great in stills but once you actually start controlling the game and shooting, you're very likely to loose your enemies as they blend into the backgrounds more often than not. The music is great sounding but does not fit the atmosphere at all. The weapons are standard stuff you'd find in a shooter in this ilk (they also have secondary fire which are also pretty standard) but what mostly killed the game for me was the gravity tether: an energy rope you can use to pick stuff up and throw them which can, and probably should, also be used for environment traversal. This device heavily relies on physics in order to get the result you wish for it but 90% of the time it just doesn't work how you want it to and will probably even result in your untimely death. Sometimes you are required to use the tether to get to lower/higher places and this sometimes had me trying for dozens of minutes just struggling to get a rock out of my way so I could go on with the rest of the mission.Enemies are fast, ferocious, bullet sponges and highly accurate with their shots. Some can even fly and follow you wherever you go. They'll nail you from across the screen with their shots before you even get to realize where they are. This is of course on the easy and normal difficulty where a LOT of trial and error as well as memorization of enemy placement can help you get through the levels because the hard difficulty will kill you with single hits and smaller enemies can grind you to dust in no time at all.This game is NOT about fair challenge. I was constantly fighting the mechanics to get the most trivial things done (even getting from point A to B can become a frustrating challenge). The graphics are amazing to look at and the music is fine but even they lead to frustration and gameplay problems. You can use a gamepad but that will complicate the moving/aiming even more. It's just better to play with keyboard/mouse. I honestly wanted SO MUCH to like this game but it's just a mess to play through.There is coop and there are some secret areas in every level which don't mean anything as they are more of the normal power-ups you get. There are some arcade modes like survival and bot matches and 2-player vs. and I can see the appeal in some of the modes but this is pretty normal, run-of-the-mill stuff we've seen before. Another thing, the achievements are some of the most uninspired I've seen in a while. They could have at least made stuff interesting here with the different weapons and mechanics but nope. Unbalanced and simply a chore to get through. Can't recommend this unless you know what you're getting into and even then, I still wouldn't. Play the demo first.			"

												Fans of SNES Metroid will enjoy Capsized. My WASD fingers were given the workout of their lives while playing this one.Beautifully designed levels keep things fresh, while new weapons and challanging enemies keep you coming back for more. Some of the levels were a tad frustrating, it is very easy to find youself overwhelemed by enemies in a moments notice. With some skill, and a lot of luck, you won't die...too many times. You will pull through the single player in 4-5 hours, depending on your skill level. But the arcade mode adds to the lasting appeal of the game.			"

												i'm suposed to like it, but I really didn't. Yet, it's my type of game. But it's hard to get around that game with the weird physics and key config like UP and JUMP to be the same button when there's also a jetpack item to bind.Overall: 5/10. I know the ratings could be better, but it's still from my experience.			"

												Pretty decent sidescroller shooter with a metroidvania vibe to it. The gameplay is OK and the weapon variety isn't really something out of the ordinary, you also have a jetpack and a grappling hook. The story isn't really that great, where the voice acting is non existing, basicly you're on a ship and you end up on an alien planet and you need to find your way out of there. Now, the good stuff. The game has a STELLAR soundtrack in my opinion and some really great hand drawn graphics and that for me is what made me play the game. It might be just me but I felt that the game was somewhat hard on later levels, other than that, if you enjoy 2D shooters and you enjoy how Capsized looks, I'd say go for it and play it, otherwise it might be a waste of your time.

												Fantastic Game!I originally got this in the Humble Bundle 8, but haven't given it a shot until now. The story is simple and straight forward, assigning a different task to each mission with all having the ultimate goal of escaping the strange alien planet you find yourself on. The gameplay itself is fun and offers a variey of ways of movement between wall jumping, hook shotting and jetpacking when you have the fuel. There are a varity of weapons to choose from each having their own unique way of attacking. The enemies also vary from simple hostile primitive creatures to the more advanced aliens which range from grunts with guns to tough guardians with magical abilities. The environment is eerie and intrigues a sense of curiosity and exploration. Probably my favorite part about the game though, is the soundtrack. It fits incredibly well with the lost spacey feel of the game and will have you googling for the artist before the game is through. All in all, this game really impressed me and has been one of the most delightful games I have played in the past year. If any of this sounds good to you, don't hesitate to treat yourself to a copy!			"

												Another mediocre indie side scroller plagued with all the same problems as the others and then some: objects and a player character that lack the necessary weight to create a good sense of low gravity severely hampering movement and the use of the grappling hook, ironically broken gamepad controls, a jetpack with an inconsistent set of rules, enemies like the priests that take way more bullets than should be necessary, level terrain that is absurdly easy to get stuck on and God knows what else.I mean, sure,  the art is gorgeous and the music provided by Solar Fields is fitting, but it takes a lot more than that to make a game worth playing.

The soundtrack is great, the gameplay is great, almost everything is great. If it had Multiplayer or Co-op (not Local) it will be much more interesting. I just got the game and it's worth! It has achievements, it needs trading cards and it will be a great title. There is not much to write in this review. I hope it will get more updates, because I just love it. It's a simple, 2D, Sci-Fi, indie, great game. Get it now and you will not regret it!			"

												Very nice platformer. Gameplay is a lot of fun, and music is great, too. A good way to describe it if you are a Nintendo fan: it's a realistic-flavor Metroid. The only things that I find not great enough are probably: 1) field of view is too small when going straight up or down 2) mouse is recommended, not optimized for gamepad 3) lack of plot.8/10.			"

												This game has a beautiful art style, and the motions of characters and AI are quite unique, and fitting the setting of the game. The physics is quite neat, though I found myself often getting stuck in the map and having to spam the gravity gun to get me out. The combat is really awkward, both with a mouse and a controller, and some levels were a massive pain to finish, so it was a bit off-putting. It's a shame that steam can only give 'yes' or 'no' ratings, because I'm a bit neutral towards Capsized. I would probably give it a 6/10.(By the way, I'm not sure why, but steam tells me that I have 29 hours logged into the game, but I don't. I did, however, finish the game)			"

It's leashing mechanic and jetpack adds another dimension to the game  but the controls feel 'loose', making it a bit hard to control where you are going at times. Game itself is quite challenging, and the varying weapons allows for use to choose the best weapon to handle each enemy.Overall, a decent game but there are better options worthy of your time.			"

												The controls are a bit clunky - the use of the mouse (especially with a trackpad) for aiming is difficult, to say the least, and trying to use a controller, such as the Steam controller, is nigh impossible - mapping WASD to the controller, for example, yields no actual movement, and trying to use the ""gamepad"" settings in the game itself results in your character perpetually heading to the right and firing your gun until you run out of ammo.

												We could easily classify this game as ""The evolution of platform/shooters games in flash from the web"". A beautiful artistic audio-visual section and solid gameplay make this title a sure recommendation.PROS:- Spotless artistic direction (the style of the characters, enemies, weapons and unique backgrounds give the game its own personality).- Excellent soundtrack (As a lover of electronic music, i could be listening for hours to the various tracks that create a correct atmosphere for an action/exploration game like this).- Balanced and varied Gameplay (There is no other term for this, each weapon has its unique feature which makes it useful in a given situation or effective against a particular enemy type, as for the missions, each one has one unique objetive to comply).- The exploration element is present (many smartly-hidden secrets to discover containing bonus points, weapons, ammunition, equipment, boosters, etc).- Use of physics for combat and get rid of obstacles (You can create cover from objects that are in the area, pull or push objects that hinder your path or even for use as long-range weapons against enemies).- Has local co-op campaign mode.- The extra modes outside the campaign give the game extra replay value (includes a duel mode against bots or against a friend locally, an infinite survival mode and others).CONS:- Hard (Even on the normal difficulty, the game is very challenging. For those achivements hunters like me, this will compensate the short lenght of the game).- No configurable keys or buttons on the joystick.- The only joystick recognized by the game is the one from the Xbox 360.- Some glitches that prevent to close the game normally (in the linux version, i played the demo on Windows XP at the time without problems).- Some achivements are broken (a logical problem in those achivements that ask a requirement for complete in all the levels of the game).- Short (can be compensated if you dedicate yourself time to explore the levels for secrets)- The use of physics in certain situations can be a headache if not used wisely.- Sometimes a mini-map to avoid getting lost would be useful.- The developer abandoned this project long ago (no hope for some fixes).If you like fast action 2D games, mixed with elements of exploration that are accompanied by beautiful graphics and a good soundtrack, this game is a safe buy.My score: 7.5 / 10Note: Played it on GNU / Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - 32 bits)			"

												I have over 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game. One Hour Reviews #31: CapsizedCapsized is an action platformer.  I didn't realize until right before I started that this is from the same developers who made Apotheon, which I was a big fan on.  Certainly though, this is a much different game.The campaign begins as your ship has crashed on an alien planet, and is broken up into a series of levels, during which you are trying to save your crewmates and escape.First thing I have to say is the art is gorgeous.  The backgrounds are very detailed, and definitely gives you the feeling of being on an alien planet.  You definitely are not left with the sense that the developers cut any corners here.  Unfortunately it seems the presentation has a price as I found it stuttered at times on my mid-range system.  I'm not used to that with 2D platformers.  It wasn't enough to detract from the experience overall, but it was a mild annoyance at times.The soundtrack also does a good job standing out.  The music is moody and does a good job evoking the feeling of exploring an alien world. On the down side, I found the controls a bit difficult at times.  You use the right stick to aim and the left stick to move and jump.  It takes some getting used to, but it's manageable.  You can also play with the keyboard and mouse, but I didn't try it myself.The game is filled with combat and weapons, but also provides a secondary firing mode with a gravity gun.  This is used to good effect by the game by adding in some physics based puzzles to go along with the exploration and combat.  The early levels are not that difficult, but I could definitely sense an increase in the difficulty with each level.As you progress though the campaign, you will earn a number of stars for each level, depending on factors such as how quickly you progress, how many times you die, and how many secrets you find.  As you earn stars, it will unlock other arcade game modes.  I only unlocked one of these modes in the hour I played, which was a basic deathmatch mode against a bot that wasn't terribly smart.Overall I thought this was a pretty decent game, but I like Apotheon better.  If you are a big fan of platformers though, this is worth checking out.			"

I like the variety of weapons and the jet pack and grapple hook. The game has beautiful scenery . The story that i got was your a astronaut that crash landed on an alien planet and your trying to locate your fellow crew members . Your embarking on a strange and lonely journey to find the one thing you know on this uncertain journey ...your fellow friends. It does have secret spots and power ups to find .

												Очередной ""платформер"" от независимого разработчика. Среди подобных отличается слегка необычной механикой и высоким качеством проработки всей визуальной части. Звуковое и музыкальное сопровождение тоже на уровне, и органично вплетены в процесс, помогая создавать ""атмосферу"". Однако действие оружия немного не соответствует названиям.Атмосфера одиночества и безысходности начальных уровней передана не слишком хорошо, как и во всех произведениях в сеттинге джунглей довольно странно пугаться такой яркости и пёстрости, даже если и смертельно опасной.Достижения абсолютно стандартные: на исследование мира, на сложность прохождения и на дополнительные режимы.

												Although at times convoluted, the graphics and art style are fantastic. Very colorful and atmospheric, but at times difficult to spot enemies. Add to the fact that the controls take some getting used to, and physics get weird, it can provide a bit frustration. However, it fits the sci fi theme, and the music is breathtaking. Plethora of weapons too. All in all, I recommend the game to platformer fans, mostly because of its great atmosphere and somewhat interesting game mechanics that just might be strangely rewarding to those that persist.			"

Because of that, I wouldn't recomend this game, even if it's on sale.			"

												I have beaten the game on hard-If you bind Ram ability (a very strong physics push) to mouse wheel, you can fly through the level so quick that sometimes you die by entering a solid wall, it also has a little bit of air knockback so you can ignore the existence of jetpack and just spam it for infinite flight.+Disclaimer: Ram ability is still the most fun mechanic to use.-Difficulty is mostly dumb AI swarming you, there is even a little enemy that goes through walls and comes in swarms.-Also every enemy has constant 100% accuracy, and rush towards you after first line of sight.-Secrets and fake walls entrances have no visual clue indicating that it exists until you occasionally fall in or shoot it.-The missions that require you to destroy statues does not show how to break them and where is the blue sphere needed to destroy it.-Missions that require carrying physics objects to endpoint are annoying.Currently i have found 3 bosses so far: -A big alien with a colossal amount of health -A warrior dude that charges an insanely high damage instant beam that has no way to predict where it will go. -A flying shaman that shoots homing explosive that does not get destroyed by touching enviroment, so it follows to you regardless of enviroment cover (you must shoot them and he shoots it so often when not using his special attack that you must use mostly the fast firing default), and a very short cooldown special attack that sucks everything around including the enviroment, the player and all bullet types, that shoots back at you after it finishes it.-Final boss of the game was obnoxious, and actually easier than those flying shaman bosses.-Characters are bland and forgettable.-Storytelling was interesting but the story itself is bland and forgettable too.+Enviroment visuals was really good and i had fun playing the levels where the objective was simply ""reach the exit"". -All other levels sucked.Edit1: -I forgot to mention but after a 4 hour session the game physics was starting to fail, sometimes the gravity hook and projectiles started to go through stuff instead of colliding. -And i lost a level once by touching a spazzing prop partially inside a wall and get launched to infinity out of bounds.I should recommend because compared to other platform adventure games this is actually better, but depending on price it is probably not worth the money, considering it is kind of short.

												Really fast paced platformer with special abilities thrown in. I enjoy it so far and what's interesting is how the story is told through a set of images. The thing is, these images have no words so it's up to the player to imagine what's going on. This is a fairly casual game and I give it a 3/5. Nothing too special, but still fun and a good time killer for when you're bored.			"

												Capsized is a short but very satisfying game. The beautiful aesthetics and fun gameplay more than make up for there barely being a story, and aside from the broken Steam achievements (would be nice if those were fixed or removed) I did not encounter any glitches or bugs.Some people complain about the strange learning curve, but I personally didn't really have a problem with that as figuring out how to defeat new enemies was fun and did not take me *that* much effort.Overall I'd say it's worth a buy.

												I personally dislike this game, I know others who do enjoy it though. The main problems are the fact the game is difficult to control, and the enemies are unforgivingly hard. There are puzzles (usually instant kill ones) that I still don't understand how to do and only managed to pass through pure luck. The story is very dull and is told through still frame pictures with no dialogue or text. Overall its not the worst game Ive played and if you think you will have fun playing it, its probably not a horrible cheap game to get, but don't pay too much.			"

												A game that started fairly good but was slaughtered by its troublesome controls and high difficulty combined. It has a really nice atmosphere and the graphics are gorgeous and detailed - one of the best aspects of this title. The arsenal is full of cool weapons and it certainly has some interesting gameplay elements, like the grappling hook or the jetpack. A lot of content and different modes add to this game's replay value, as well. Expect, though, many game-crashing bugs to show up.			"

												OK. First of first this is a good action platform game, but not an excellent one.It has an awesome soundtrack and a great art design which create the feeling that you are truly on an alien planet.On the other hand the game suffer on gameplay part. The control of the character is difficult most of the time and it can become frustrating sometimes. Also the aiming has the same issue. I always have the feeling that the character is very.....""slippery"". But you have a nice weapon collection you can use to pulverize any form of life on the damn alien planet :)The story is almost absent and the game is extremely short.So, I think this game should be played for the most part by side-scrolling-platform-action fans.

												I purchased this game during a Steam sale. It has hand drawn graphics and a local co-op mode for me and my son to play together. I thought I'd give it a try. Initially I enjoyed the game. The artwork is outstanding. Really awesome job as far as 2D side scrollers go. The game had physics that made gameplay interesting. Fun at times and a pain at time also. But regardless it started strong.I had a bout 4 levels left when I called it quits. The controls never felt right for me. I hate using a mouse and keyboard for a platformer and the gamepad controls felt awkward no matter how I set them up. The gameplay was just a little off and I'm big on controls.. auto-deal-breaker. The levels never really varied either. They all looked pretty much the same as the last. I never got excited to see the next level. When me and my som tried local co-op it was just a mess. With our grappling beams constantly pulling the same rocks, debri, etc. it felt more like a chore than a fun co-op experience. So although this game started out strong, if I had it to do again.. I'd pass.			"

												It has been almost three years now and the devs still have zero intention on fixing their broken achievements. Yes, achievements with an 'S'. You are going to need to hack your own save file just for the game to be correctly show your achievements. And do you want to know, curious reader, why there are problems? For one, the game refuses to count; and the other two, the game thinks there are 13 levels when in fact there are 12. I am sick and tired of games like these broken and never fixed. They do not belong on the steam shelves to be sold because not only are they sickening, but they encourage other plagues like it. Come on devs, you only need to change a couple lines of code.http://steamcommunity.com/groups/100pAG/discussions/1/828935672459065954/ "

												I do recommend this game, but it is with a major caveat... the controls are terrible. It’s just bad wrong. It is playable, but I gave up after a while because the mouse/kb wasn't cutting it for me. You'd thing, ""Oh, but look, it supports controllers."" but so did I. It's actually worse. You might think I am just being a negative reviewer for the sake of irritation on my part, but I really wanted to love this game. In a way I do... I love the graphics, music, animations, weapons, aliens, and just about EVERYTHING (aside from the slightly lightweight campaign). Unfortunately, unless the developer updates to better enable controllers to work with this game, it’s going to remain a ""don't buy"" recommendation from me. It's a sad thing too, because I really watched this one come to life from its early stages of kick starter. It’s that one really important missing piece keeping this game from truly being a gem of the indie trend. "

												This looked like an awesome game, and I bet it is an awesome game full of fun and wonder, but sadly, two things absolutely ruined the entire experience for me to the point where I had to turn off the game.1. Enemies relative to your surroundings - Look how long I played this game. At the time of me typing this, it was 26m. In 26m, I felt so incredibly disoriented whenever I had an enemy near me in side of a wall or a cave in a fairly dark place, and yes, WITH THE FLASHLIGHT ON, and I could never see where they are due to foreground objects of them looking just like the scenery. It's not fair to have tiny enemies with giant foreground aesthetic bullcrap covering them! There are also plenty of ranged enemies that get an unfair shot at you before you even know they're there and give you no time to react to a shot coming from seemingly nowhere. It's ridiculous!2. The controls - The enemies were one thing, but the controls is the sole reason I cannot recommend this game to anyone, and the main reason being that you have 3 ""Up"" or ""Ascend"" commands. You have ""Jump"", ""Up"", and ""Jetpack"". One thing to keep in mind for game design is that ""Jump"" and ""Up"" are NOT the same command, yet unfortunately for me, Alientrap Games disagrees. So, when I'm trying to, say, go up in a manner that doesn't involve jumping, I obviously hold up (the original jump control, which I mapped to spacebar, along with the Jetpack), only to realize, oh right, jump and up are the same button. The jetpack is another thing that's an absolute mess because typically in games, jetpack is a form of ""secondary jump"" or activates from a ""double jump"". Having it be its own button is very awkward, so I set it to jump. Alright, no biggie. Every time I want to jump or use the jetpack, it's just the same button now. But no! The fact that Up and Jump are the same button not only makes me use jetpack fuel every time I want to go up or jump, but also does the reverse when I just want to jetpack lightly, I'll go rocketing upward because it makes me jump when I'm too close to the ground, and if jump isn't mapped to the jetpack, the entire control scheme feels incredibly awkward.A dishonorable mention I'd like to finish my negative review on is the jetpack itself. Level 1, you're given a jetpack that has unlimited fuel, but can only be used in short bursts then needs to recharge. Completely understandable and a good mechanic, but, oh wait, now I start level 2 and I have no jetpack? Oh, I find jetpack fuel and... ... it doesn't replenish...? WHY would you introduce a ""recharging"" jetpack mechanic in level 1 if in the VERY next level (that didn't pull a Metroid Prime of ""you lost your jetpack"") would you make me need to continuously collect fuel?! That's so stupid! I don't know if you get an unlimited jetpack later, and frankly, I don't care. If you do, it cancels out this last paragraph, but it's downright insane to introduce ""recharging"" to immediately say ""lol jk now collect fuel"".Now onto the positives: The atmosphere and visuals are absolutely beautiful and stylized. Similar to Metroid, you really get the feel that you're alone on this alien planet looking for your crew (at least that's what I got from playing 4 levels). Honestly, when I wasn't getting screwed by the aesthetics with enemies blending into it, I was stunned by how gorgeous it looked. On top of that, the soundtrack is a joy to listen to and further emphasizes that you're on some uncharted alien planet, full of vegetation and whatnot.Overall score, I'd have to give it a 4, which is for the gameplay, music, and visuals, while the controls and blending-into-the-scenary-enemies cuts down a lot of points. If the controls weren't half-broken, I'd probably give it around an 8, give or take the 7-9 range depending on what's to come. Sadly, because the controls feel so crippled, I'll never know what's coming up.			"

												OK. First of first this is a good action platform game, but not an excellent one.It has an awesome soundtrack and a great art design which create the feeling that you are truly on an alien planet.On the other hand the game suffer on gameplay part. The control of the character is difficult most of the time and it can become frustrating sometimes. Also the aiming has the same issue. I always have the feeling that the character is very.....""slippery"". But you have a nice weapon collection you can use to pulverize any form of life on the damn alien planet :)The story is almost absent and the game is extremely short.So, I think this game should be played for the most part by side-scrolling-platform-action fans.

												Capsized turned out to be far more fantastic than I initially gave it credit for.There are plenty of physics-based games with transparent mechanics and floaty controls where the player is given the opportunity to mess around with objects and you can be as silly as possible, but in Capsized the physics take a back seat. Nevermind the fact that you can jetpack around lasso-ing objects and enemies alike to navigate- the world itself is the star. The environment is beautiful, full of detailed organic life and creatures and I don't even know what, and an equally awesome soundtrack echoes throughout giving this game an A+ for atmosphere in my book.I played the game on Hard and it was a fun difficult challenge, when I encountered a few specific types of enemies. If you're looking for a surreal space adventure with some narrative and a bunch of weapons, this is a small-package game done right.			"

												A twin stick platformer with horribly loose controls is not exactly how I want to spend my time.  To make things worse, the hit boxes are awful.  So not only can you not aim at the space bug that wants to kill you, even if you do shoot it through the face, it won't register as a hit.  Every derivative game has to have a mechanic that makes it SPECIAL.  In the case of Capsized, it's the gravity gun.  This of course means physics puzzles.  Joy.  Physics puzzles haven't been completely overdone over the past ten years or anything.  Remember that with the horrible controls, the giant concrete slab that you have to place precisely or else die will simply not go where you want it to.  Puzzles are annoying when you don't have to repeat them a dozen times due to lousy controls.  If you make me repeat a puzzle through no fault of my own, I will hate you.At the very least the graphics seem pretty.			"

												Pretty decent free-aiming platformer with some interesting weapons. Movement is very free. You have a grapple and can stick to walls, in addition to being able to pick up jetpack fuel. You can also use the grapple to grab and throw items. The graphics are marionette-ish, which I really don't care for, but the gameplay is fun. Works with a gamepad, but for some idiot reason you have to go into the options menu and enable gamepad support first. The gamepad play is actually the best I've seen in a free-aiming game. You use the sticks and the trigger/bumper buttons instead of what most games do, where you're trying to figure out how the hell to use the abxy buttons while using the right-stick at the same time. There's several different things you can do, and the gravity is very low, so you're quite 'floaty'. Because of this it takes a few minutes to get used to the controls, but after that it's entirely workable.			"

												A nice little action/shooter platformer. The graphics are pretty and the music & SFX are not bad either. Capsized has a very robust physics engine and an interesting assortment of weapons to choose from. However, there's not so much enemy variety and the main campaing is relatively easy to complete, e.g. 3-4 hours or 15-20 minutes per level (of which there are 12). Some of the levels require minimal ""puzzle"" solving, like pushing a lever to open a gate or throwing a rock at something etc; most levels need you to get to other side of the map, kill some meanies or collect some items from around the map. I believe the game could be much bettter if it had a little ""extra"", like RPG or rogue-like or exploration elements.I got this one for free when I pre-ordered Apotheon via Humble-Bundle. I guess I wouldn't pay full-price for Capsized, but I can surely recommend it for those who like fast-paced shooter-platformers, without too much of a challenge.			"

												Here's the deal. I love 2-D Metroid, even though I've never actually finished any of the games. I have started them, though. Oh boy, have I started them. I started Super Metroid on the SNES, and got about 40% done. Then the battery in the cart died. R.I.Panasonic CR2032 battery.    Later, I started the game up again with a little assistance from the ZSNES PC emulator. Got around 80%, then reformatted my computer. R.I.Partitions.    My third soiree with Super Metroid took place on the Wii in the form of a Virtual Console download, which went great until the Wii lived at a house that I did not. R.I.Parent's basement.    I also played though most of Metroid Fusion, but that doesn't have a story behind it. I just lost the cartridge. I managed through the original Metroid on the Gamecube, courtesy of a unlockable Metroid Prime/GBA connection bonus, and lived to tell the tale of using that dammed postage stamp-sized d-pad. I plan on recounting this story to my grandchildren, and hopefully it will serve as explanation why I cannot play catch, write, or handle cutlery properly thanks to my deformed, claw-like left hand, forever frozen in the twisted position that using that minuscule d-pad necessitated.    I pray they'll understand.     I suppose I'm telling you this because I have a bit of a predisposition towards pretty 2-D games that feature people in spacesuits alone on alien worlds, which is what Metroid and Capsized share in common. It can be easy to assume that they'd share more, like a focus on exploration, creepy atmosphere, and progressive unlockables, but that's not the case despite what you might have assumed from the screenshots. And the Steam Store description. Instead, Capsized is, according to the (partially accurate) store page description, 'fast paced' and 'intense,' neither of which really gelled with me since the controls (and the physics) feel pretty loose.    The graphics are nice, and the physics are fun to wrestle with once you get a feel for them, but at the end of the day, I simply didn't find the game very interesting. Also, this game is somehow rather taxing on my quad-core, 8gb RAM equipped laptop. I had resigned myself to 720p for games like Bioshock Infinite and Borderlands 2, but this game as well? Meh.    In the end, my review is an opinion. That's what reviews are. And my opinion is that I didn't really like this game. Brought forth a sense of apathy from me. Sorry, I guess. The developers were gracious enough to put up a demo on their store page, so in the end that's going to be the best determinant for you, really.    There is, however, one thing that really did honestly bother me about Capsized. In the game, you are on an alien planet. There's alien creatures, sure, but also a lot of alien humanoids that look an awful lot like a western stereotype of 'jungle natives.' I mean, they shoot darts. Throw spears. Wear tall wooden masks. Sacrifice your little astronaut friends on stone tables. Tiki torches. Magical shamen. Idols. Speak a gutteral language that could be transcribed as “Ooga-booga.”     Your missions generally revolve around killing all of them. And destroying their idols. Yes, there's an achievement for finishing 5 levels without firing a shot, but it's an achievement. It's supposed to be hard. Normal play looks a lot like you, a pale man in a spacesuit, committing xenocide (another achievement, natch) with your laser pistol, laser RPG, laser shotgun, laser flamethrower and wiping out all traces of these “primitive's” religion. Hell, I honestly wouldn't care if these alien natives looked alien, but with how much of the art draws from imagination, and then you're faced with a pretty familiar depiction of earthly native jungle people just rubs me the wrong way, especially since the game really doesn't seem to be concerned about it at all.     Maybe I'm just on edge a bit after playing through Uncharted 2 again and (SPOILERS DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT OR GO AHEAD I'M NOT YOUR MOM) being reminded that the hero single-handedly wipes out an ancient city populated by magical natives (that you are expected to mow down with a variety of advanced military-grade weaponry) and the story narrative shrugs this off. Literally, the hero shrugs after bringing the whole city down. Happy ending. No one cares.     It may seem like a little, arbitrary thing and...maybe it is, but the first thing that comes to my mind after Capsized isn't the gameplay, nor the story, nor even the art, it's the dissonance between the foreignness of an alien world that the developers want me to be absorbed in, and the very familiar feeling of the aliens depicted in the game. That's what sticks with me, and helps me decide to not recommend this game, Steam. I appreciate you listening.			"

												So, Capsized.  Here we are.  I finally made myself finish the game.  Here's the thing with Capsized - The aesthetic is AMAZING.  Few 2D games look this freaking amazing.  The music is spot on, and Solar Fields not only capture the atmosphere, but add to it tremendously with one of the most chillaxed and haunting videogame OST's ever.  The movement is appropriately floating, given the alien landscape, and this is both a good and a bad thing.  It's bad, because it feels so unnatural and unintuitive, in a way, and this usually is a blemish on any other game, but because of the setting of Capsized, I find it acceptable, and actually necessary to sell the fact that I'm on this strange and scary world.Combat is okay ... feels very much like a twin-stick-shooter, despite being 2D, side-scrolling, open-level platformer.  I think there were too many weapon options.  Honestly, I think about 4 of the weapons were nessesary, and the rest were filler that the devs probably thought were cool.  Maybe they were, but I stuck with what worked, and didn't spend a lot of time with many of the weapons.The story is okay ... a little bland, but I'm not here for the narrative, so I don't really care ... I like bland stories in games.Overall I recommend Capsized to anyone who likes playing twin-stick shooters with their keyboard and mouse, who are willing to spend some times on an alien planet, fighting lurking wildlife and natives.Oh, and I guess there are ""secrets"" in this game, but I certainly didn't care one whit about finding any of them.  You might like that more than me.  Give it a try!			"

												Bought this for a few bucks. Not good. Using a 360 controller. The aiming is off,the jumping too floaty,and the level design is a mess. Seriously..enemies that get a jump on you when your fighting with floaty controls for jumping and having serious aiming issues. maybe its better with a mouse and neyboard but thats not my style. Only buy this game if you have the Tylenol near you,its a freakin annoyance playing this thing. 3/10 The 3 going to Good graphics,nice music,and the tylenol making me feel sleepy. In short..AVOID!

												Capsized is not without its problems. It's floaty controls and uninvited physics-puzzle mechanics can sometimes make the platformer unnecessarily frustrating. When it shines though, it shines. Shootouts  often become intense and frenetic as you fling yourself around the lush alien landscape trying to avoid flying enemies and projectiles. The artwork and sound alone are enough to make you want to come back.			"

												Some others have commented about this game having control issues & it being too 'floaty'; I have to say I didnt experience any issues of that nature what so ever using mouse & keyboard. Sure the jetpack & hook take some practise to fully master for tricks & fast moves, but isnt that the same with any game? I found I could use the jetpack & hook to really spring around quickly & easily after 2 or 3 levels, It became a really good tactic for combat.The games a bit of a thrust/jetman/exile hybrid, the visuals are very good, the sound & music of top quality also.The game is moderately challenging on hard & im glad to say not to the point where I found it frustrating. Theres a nice variation of weapons & they feel powerfull. Theres also a small number of power ups & its worth exploring the maps to find the secrets & said power ups especially on later levels. It plays well & looks top drawer on high settings with no frame rate issues for me at all.If you fancy a game to kill 4 or 5 hours this comes recommended.  "

												This game is amazing.  Its is reminiscent of the 90's era where platforming games like Jazz Jackrabbit and Commander Keen were a solid example of great gameplay.  However, Capsized comes with a new array of features which makes every level a blast to play.  I beat the single player Campaign in 3 hours.  Its fairly short with about 12 levels, but extremely fun and somewhat challenging.  There are hidden secrets in each level as well as 3 difficulties.  If you're going for achievements and whatnot, I'd say the game's length would be about 5 hours.  The levels start small but get huge, with plenty of exploration and a plethora of weapons to use against the planet natives.  Though I won't call them 'puzzles', there is a multitude of challenging scenarios which you will have to use your brain in order to solve.The developers really put some artistic talent into this game.  Each level is a work of art and the music is awesome.Definitely worth its price in gold. 5/5			"

												You crash land on an alien planet and you need to find a way to get off of it, this is a basic concept but the execution here is fabulous. Fantastic game play mixed with a sound track that really immersed me into the world. It's a game you can pick up easily but can't put back down. I ran though it one night and lost track of time, with a good set of headphones you really get pulled into the alien world. The gameplay got me started but the soundtrack kept me playing, you really lose yourself in it. The controls are simple whether you’re using a gamepad or keyboard and mouse, I actually preferred to use a gamepad for this one.  You get a wide variety of weapons that also have a secondary fire, you get a gravity hook that allows you to swing around, grab hold of different material, and even throw enemies.  The game starts out pretty easy but it soon picks up and has you pulling your hair out. The artwork is also beautiful, the level design and the character models work perfectly together. This is high on my recommended list for anyone that loves a good platformer!			"

												Intriguing game mechanics and hardcore enemy barrages make this a fun and interesting little game. Akin to Metroidvania style games, Capsized has you scouring levels for pickups, upgrades, and stuff to fling at enemies. The gravity hook works well most of the time, and gives you more than one way to kill enemies. The AI for the enemies is somewhat mediocre, with enemies getting themselves stuch behind walls, etc. This is probably made up for by how damaging some of the enemies can be, you will find yourself cursing your death more than a few times. All in all, Capsized is probably best to pick up in one of the many bundles going around these days, or at the very least, during a sale.			"

												Okay, if you're interested in this game, wait to buy it when it goes on sale. It's a beautiful game, visually and aurally, and the minimalist story is a nice atmospheric detail.The controls are whack. I thought it was just because I was using a controller, but the keyboard controls are also wonky and takes loads of time getting used to the physics and mechanics of movement, firing, etc etc. For a game that spurs action on you (at times) when you least suspect it, and an unforgiving difficulty curve, this is frustrating.That said, once you get a grip on the controls, the game is managable. It helps to go back and replay the earlier levels some. I'm glad I finished the game, but I felt no desire to pursue the challenge of playing at a higher difficulty level or trying out the other gameplay modes. Others may feel differently.			"

												Capsized, as a game, is a competent platformer. Its gameplay is outdone, however, by some exceptionally beautiful artwork and scenery. My wife even commented on how pretty the environments are before I'd even suggested it.  And if a GIRL thinks a game looks good, it MUST, right?But that's all irrelevant.The MUSIC in Capsized is worth the purchase price alone. It's hypnotic and immersive soundtrack reminded me of MOD, S3M, XM, and IT tracks from PC music's Golden Age. The game's melodic backdrop makes the narrative feel complete, masterfully setting an atmosphere for the experience. Fortunately, all eleven tracks are .WMA files found in the ..\capsized\Content\Music folder. YOU, the proud owner of Capsized, may listen to the soundtrack whenever and wherever you choose. I don't remember ever being this awed by a game's music. Not bad for a $2.50 INDIE GAME (if you catch it on sale).It has a free demo.  You have no excuse to not try it.			"

												One of the best indie games I've played. I enjoyed the art design. The gameplay has an unique, ambient quality that makes the game feel simultaneously casual and story-driven. The soundtrack fits perfectly, which is a copy/pasted album called Movements by Solar Fields -- who are also responsible for the Mirror's Edge OST. All around a neatly packaged game. 10/10			"

												A pretty good side scrolling shooting game (think old school Metroid or Castlevania) with a great ambient soundtrack and hand drawn sprites/background. The story, although simple, is enough to keep one playing through the game and more enemies are added to in keep things interesting. My only gripe about the game like many other reviews is the difficulty curve gets incredibly difficult half way through the game. Going from losing no lives in the first couple of maps to losing over half of my lives on a single map can be quite frustrating. What more, I feel that some of the puzzle traps do not translate well to the controls of the game, forcing the player to merely minimize damage as they run through certain areas of the game. Despite all the issues I would definitely recommend picking the game up in a bundle or while on sale. I beat the game in a couple of hours, so keep that in mind when purchasing.7.5/10.0 "

												I didn't take to the game at first, but coming back to it now was a lot of fun. I guess i came at it before looking for something different, most run 'n gun games i've played are very tight, and require some careful precision and pattern memorization.This game is not that. This game is very frantic and open ended, you pretty quickly give up on solving things the ""right way"" in favor of just making things happen however you can. The levels dont have planned routes half the time, but instead it'll just be a big map and you need to destroy/rescue/recover a few things spread across the map.The music is also pretty sweet, especially the title theme.Try the demo and make sure the game runs for you, it's fine on my desktop but on my laptop it ran hella slow (and my laptop is fairly powerful).

												Arriving at this alien planet in an escape pod... this is a storylined survival platformer. The levels are designed well enough to provide many ways to finish them. Although missions do get repetitive, the maps in themselves change quite a bit, every time becoming harder to get through.This sci-fi setting is well placed with all the different laser weapons you can get along with your combine suit. An intricate feature I particularily enjoy is how your screen starts to shatter in game as if it were the visor of your suit being destroyed as you lose health.It also has multiplayer! For fighting your friends or going through the map in co-op! So be sure to get it with a friend to play~ "

												This is pretty fun actually. Awesome 2D-platformer/shooter, with jetpacks and gravity-gun-style physics (You might want to solve a little puzzle to get bonus powerups). It's a little bit on the short side, with only 12 missions, but the ones during the later half of the game are incredibly long.Lots of creativity, fresh ideas, intense mid-air gunfights, all witha  high polish. Controls are tight and responsive and it's easy to get lost in the moment. This has to be one of the best indie games I've played yet.			"

This was near the start of the alphabet so I started there.The art style is really pleasing and fits the theme well.  Platforming/combat is great.  I’m not sure what the other reviewers were talking about regarding it being too easy.  It's challenging and didn't feel particulary cheap.  I’m a terrible gamer too, so there’s that. It’s sort of the more violent, less polished  brother of Waking Mars.   And the soundtrack is unstoppable. Capsized is well worth checking out.			"

												Intriguing game mechanics and hardcore enemy barrages make this a fun and interesting little game. Akin to Metroidvania style games, Capsized has you scouring levels for pickups, upgrades, and stuff to fling at enemies. The gravity hook works well most of the time, and gives you more than one way to kill enemies. The AI for the enemies is somewhat mediocre, with enemies getting themselves stuch behind walls, etc. This is probably made up for by how damaging some of the enemies can be, you will find yourself cursing your death more than a few times. All in all, Capsized is probably best to pick up in one of the many bundles going around these days, or at the very least, during a sale.			"

												Capsized is a action-platformer shooter game with beutiful art and a wordless yet compelling storyline. (in a way; more actoin than story, but you get the picture; it has its moments...) It starts out simple, with a tutorial that's not that easy to understand (personally), because the game has such a wide variety of concepts, but after a few levels, you'll understand all the controls, and by the time you understand these concepts, you're thrown into a difficult but rewarding gameplay experince that really tests your limits. (in my opinion the hardest level was 11) The alien lifeforms and their potrayal in this game are something to easily admire, and shows a very unique alien planet in which life thrives greatly. This truely is a great game, as hard as it may be.			"

I would recommend waiting for a Sale to snag it for like 3-5 bucks or in a Humblebundle.It's worth the 2-5 hours (dependend on difficulty level).			"

If you aren't artificially handicapping yourself, you'll murder your thousand Bete-rejects in about an hour.This is more of a recommendation for Jesse McGibney and Solar FIelds than the game itself.

												Capsized comes from a very small indie corner of gaming but can revive some of the best moments when SNES and DOS were your two best gaming platforms. For me this game brought back the thrill of two platformers, Super Metroid and Abuse (1996 DOS). Story is driven through quick comic book cut-scenes and in-game visuals, there is never a point where your controls are taken away just to have someone tell you unimportant information. It keeps you playing because it never takes it away in the first place, and the very lush visuals.Gameplay is paced with a sense of exploration and tactic choices in combat, you can simply run in and try to shoot everything but that is simply the choice of the player. Capsized gives you options in how to approach combat with assortment of weapons or even better yet, clever use of physics to drop or even projectile heavy objects.With only a crew of two who made this game the attention to details are massive in both visuals and the super responsive controls.

												This is a pretty fun Metroidesqe/Level Adventure/Physics Based 2d shooter. Very good Design elements paired with spot on controls and level design make this is a MUST BUY for any Eclectic/Indie gamer. For gamers not of that type, such as you casual gamers out there patience and practice will make for a very rewarding experience. The unlockable ""mini games"" are a great addition as well, giving this well written game some long term playability. Multiplayer is quite adequate as well, with  gametypes that go well with the games engine and design (in other words, it doesnt feel like an after-thought.)9.75/10 stars ;]			"

												Initial gameplay is very immersive: the environment is beautiful and enjoyable to look at; enemies and weapons are diversified; the game boasts brave new platformer mechanics and a smoothe physics engine. The atmosphere and hidden items are reminiscent of Metrtroid, and succeed in adding to each level's replay value.Although the first few levels are fun, the difficulty curve skyrockets unexpectedly at approximately the fourth level. I'm not sure if this was intentional, but it does so regardless of the difficulty setting chosen. The last thing I was expecting was for an indie game to turn hardcore midway through, hence I would only recommend this game to someone looking for an extremely challenging platformer. 6.5/10 Play the demo first.

												You crash land on an alien planet and you need to find a way to get off of it, this is a basic concept but the execution here is fabulous. Fantastic game play mixed with a sound track that really immersed me into the world. It's a game you can pick up easily but can't put back down. I ran though it one night and lost track of time, with a good set of headphones you really get pulled into the alien world. The gameplay got me started but the soundtrack kept me playing, you really lose yourself in it. The controls are simple whether you’re using a gamepad or keyboard and mouse, I actually preferred to use a gamepad for this one.  You get a wide variety of weapons that also have a secondary fire, you get a gravity hook that allows you to swing around, grab hold of different material, and even throw enemies.  The game starts out pretty easy but it soon picks up and has you pulling your hair out. The artwork is also beautiful, the level design and the character models work perfectly together. This is high on my recommended list for anyone that loves a good platformer!			"

												Intriguing game mechanics and hardcore enemy barrages make this a fun and interesting little game. Akin to Metroidvania style games, Capsized has you scouring levels for pickups, upgrades, and stuff to fling at enemies. The gravity hook works well most of the time, and gives you more than one way to kill enemies. The AI for the enemies is somewhat mediocre, with enemies getting themselves stuch behind walls, etc. This is probably made up for by how damaging some of the enemies can be, you will find yourself cursing your death more than a few times. All in all, Capsized is probably best to pick up in one of the many bundles going around these days, or at the very least, during a sale.			"

You are in extraterrestrial space, on newly “discovered” (well, your spacecraft crashed there) planet and almost everything has strong need to kill you. So, you begin your journey to save the crew and get the hell out of there. I really like the environment. Together with the music it feels very alien and strange. And therefore it looks realistic. I recommend this game, it is fantastic, when you don’t want complicated plot or puzzle challenges. Just be aware, I rate this game as hard (I have to repeat some levels several times).			"

												Capsized is amazingly fun for people with refined reflexes. Between the gravity ram propelling yourself 2 screens over, the grappling hook with great physics (not just for going over pits), the jetpack, and super-simple wall jumping, you get a ton of movement options all the time. Mix in the 8 guns, with different ranges and all of them have an alt-fire, and I found my self committing genocide on every level for fun.The music is fantastic for the world, and is seamlessly sown together. Made me think back to Mass Effect 1, while I explored for hidden passages and stared whimsically at docile space-bugs.The main campaign is rather short (2.5~ hours if you rush everything and don't explore at all), but there are several of different modes and coop (which I've yet to try, boo.) Overall, a very fulfilling experience.			"

												A solid 2d experience.Float, swing, throw and shoot all sorts of alien things in a couple of hostile maps.The game merges exploration, 2d shooting with seperate mousaiming and physic puzzles.Youll get a nice assortment of freaky guns and extensive possibilities of gravity-space brachiation. Pros hardly walk in this game.Also, cool graphics. There's even a minimalistic but pretty story told between levels. Like so many indie games, it does things too quick. It is like the creators fell in love with all the elements at once.That is nonoptimal for two reasons:1) the game overpowers you with all the options right from the start - no necessarily too bad a thing. Although many player will never come to realize what they've been missing.2) Not one element is polished to its full potential - not good.Still, the game features lots of styles to master.And you definitely get a lot of beautiful (!) pixelbang for your bucks.I found 3,5 marooned policenauts out of 5			"

												This game is just steampunk Terraria with Terraria guns. I swear I tried to play this game but then some alien thing killed me and I lost. The story for this game sucks. All u told is that ship die and u land on planet. Hella stupd. The art is terrible I asked Jenny and she said she drew better drewings then this all the time. And don't even get me started on the title. You are NOT ONCE fitted for a cap in this game. Seriously, if you're going to make a game about being stranded in a planet inhabited by ferocious and bloodthirsty aliens, give it a name that doesn't give an impression of learning how to tell your cap size. Maybe something like ""alien attak"" or something like that. I give this game a ( ∫ (x²)dx with the domain of [0, 2] ) / 4			"

												Capsized is the first commercial title from Canadian indie developer Alientrap. At first glance it looks like a familiar side-scrolling, run-n-gun platformer, but is set apart by its detailed visual-style and variety of gameplay mechanics.The campaign's story is very bare-bones and basic, as is the comic book style by which it is conveyed. A series of beautifully drawn images, sans any dialogue, are shown panel-by-panel telling how a spaceship of Human astronauts is hit by an unidentified object, so they are forced to suit-up and evacuate via the ships escape pods.Brief, 1 to 3-panel story strips also serve as introductions to each of the stages and your objective in them. The introductory strip for the first stage shows one of the pods crash-landing (upside down, I suppose where the name “Capsized” came from) onto the jungle-like surface of an unknown alien planet. You play as the spaceman that steps out of it and you proceed to follow your first vague objective: explore the alien planet.Capsized's gameplay is mix of exploration, puzzle-solving and shooting action, using WASD to move and the mouse to aim your targeting reticle. Objectives are usually simple; reach the end of the area, destroy certain targets, collect items etc., though completing them often requires more thought as puzzles are introduced and the enemies get progressively heftier,  more wily and numerous.The stranded astronaut can use a nice variety of futuristic weapons to blast away alien scum who are selfishly trying to protect their home world. Though you start each stage with just the puny blast carbine, there are plenty more to choose from should you discover them within the stages. From basic pulsar rifles and flamethrowers to advanced homing nano-bot launchers and the devastating “Quasar Array”, there's a suitable weapon for every situation.Aside from the weapons, you can also jump and stomp “plumber style” on weaker enemies with your hefty space-boots, or use the handy grappling beam to grab rocks (or, indeed, small creatures) to launch at your foes. The grappling beam also serves as alternative means of traversing the environments; you can use it to pull yourself towards surfaces or swing throughout the planet like Tarzan in an spacesuit.You also have a handy jetpack, activated with the spacebar, useful for boosting around the more open areas, provided you discover fuel for it. Jetpack fuel, as well as ammunition, extra lives and various powerups, are hidden throughout the stages. To reach them you need to find secret passages through the walls, basically by bumping against the edges of the map until you fall through it. It is usually worth scouring the terrain for these goodies to gain the edge, particularly in the latter half of the game where I found the difficulty seemed to spike considerably.Physics play a big part in the game's mechanics; using the grapple beam is essential to pull levers, or lift rocks to drop them onto pressure pads and to open doors and access new sections of the maps, or to simply knock away debris that is blocking your path. There are situations where you will need to haul items across the stage to dump it onto a pressure pad on the other side (made somewhat easier by the low gravity), either dodging enemies or clearing them from the path in advance, the latter being my preferred method as some will actively hunt you when the see you.Moving objects around can be problematic and was a major cause of frustration, particularly in enclosed spaces as they will get stuck in the terrain occasionally. Also in areas where you must carry rocks to pressure pads, I often found myself reaching them only to accidentally launch the rock off a cliff edge and groaning as it tumbled back down to the surface.The music of Capsized consists of some nice atmospheric synth-tunes, though overall it lacks variety. The tracks are also usually rather slow-paced and, well, relaxing which I thought doesn't really fit an action game. Each stage has a different theme, but you will often hear the same tracks repeated in the background. This doesn't really detract from the experience too much, but I felt a lot more could have been done with the music, even if it is nice to listen to.As for sound effects, there are plenty of background noises such as sounds of unseen wildlife tweeting or making insect-like clicking sounds, giving a nice feel of a living world. You've also got the basic laser weapon “zaps”, alien creatures' screeches and grunts and explosions and whatnot, all of which mesh together nicely.One stand-out aspect of Capsized is the gorgeous, hand-drawn art style through which the vibrant alien world is visualised. While the environments are limited to the similar-looking overworld regions or caves beneath the surface, the amount of detail is impressive. Vines sway, docile indigenous creatures can be seen wandering about in the background, also weather effects such as sunshafts cascade over open areas in daytime stages, while mist and rain add to the visual ambience of night stages.I managed the main campaign in around 6 hours, a decent length for an Indie such as this considering there's a good amount of content included to keep up the longevity. There is a local co-op mode; you can team up with someone via two Xbox 360 pads to take on the campaign together, although I lacked the equipment to try it out. In arcade mode, there are other game types to play such as survival which pits you against waves of enemies, time trial where you must traverse stages in search for oxygen capsules to stay alive. You can also duel against another player, though only locally using two game pads as there's no online option sadly.Overall, Capsized is a good game and although it is frustrating in parts and not particularly deep, it has enough variety and challenge to keep it fun and interesting during the 5-6 hour campaign.

												The oversensitive movement controls in Capsized provide a nice experience of having no control over what your character does. This can be enhanced by using a gamepad which futher reduces any control you have over the movement of your space man and the aiming of his weapons. The ridiculous difficulty curve keeps the later levels fresh and exciting as you are repeatedly murdered by swarms of flying fart balloons and their gravity controlling teleporting priests. You don't have to worry about spending too much time on this game either as crash issues render the game incompletable after a certain point.			"

												Don't expect the gameplay to match the art style or music- this is a game about a dude armed with generic human weaponry killing a thousand aliens armed with generic human weaponry, except his are made out of laser sparkles and theirs are made out of wood.It's challenging if you try doing a hard mode no-death/one-gun run (save for the final area, which is a spectacle of appalling programming) and the music is great, but the gameplay itself is mediocre.  If you aren't artificially handicapping yourself, you'll murder your thousand Bete-rejects in about an hour.This is more of a recommendation for Jesse McGibney and Solar FIelds than the game itself.  Worth a couple bucks on sale, though.			"

												Pretty cool indi game that takes 3-4 hours to finish the campain solo.  Its a bit of a throwback in turns of gameplay since it fits in the 2D metroidvania style.  I found the controls to work pretty well, although they do not allow for precise control, but more of a sliding control.  I did not find this game difficult - 7 of the 12 levels I beat without dying.  Basically this game you wonder around the level doing whatever task you are assigned.  Make it to the exit, collect something, kill something, ect.  The early levels are short and the last few levels take 20+ mins.  I enjoy using the guns since each level has a ton of them and no reason to save them.  Some of the bosses are interesting.  I found myself only able to play this for about an hour at a time, not sure why... I assume its because I was uninterested in the slow controls on what could be fast combat.			"

I’m not sure what the other reviewers were talking about regarding it being too easy.  It's challenging and didn't feel particulary cheap.  I’m a terrible gamer too, so there’s that. It’s sort of the more violent, less polished  brother of Waking Mars.   And the soundtrack is unstoppable. Capsized is well worth checking out.			"

												Picked this up on a Humble Bundle because it looked interesting.   It's amazing, simply put.  Art style is detailed and thorough - the weapons and platforming offer a nice little challenge without being too maddening. It also offers some nice tools for your character to use to solve some puzzles like the hookshot, jetpack, ram, etc - kinda feels like a 2D version of the gravity gun from halflife.  The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous.  It's very peaceful but engaging and complements the sense of wonder as you explore this dangerous new world.  If you're not into platformers, you may wish to avoid it.  Otherwise it's easily worth 5 bucks and I'd argue it being worth 10-15 depending on how important it is to you that well-made, artistic indie games like this get made.  I give it an 'A'			"

												CAPSIZED-You and your crew crash onto an unknown planet with hostile aliens. You are forced to shoot through them all to accomplish a variety of objectives, such as saving crew members, getting ship parts, and slaying certain types of alien tribal people.-Most of the missions boil down to either search and destroy or dragging something to a desired location. It doesn't get much more complicated than that.-Capsized doesn't really do anything differently than any other game. There are a few cool guns, some interesting environments, and various upgrades, but it doesn't really get any deeper.-The foreground is distracting. Later on the amount of enemies on screen gets fairly insane, and the backgrounds become an eyesore. Though it seems like a lot of work was put into these environments, they are almost TOO complex. I only played for about an hour and had to quit due to a headache.-Even on easy mode this game is fairly hard. You will die a lot, and sometimes you will have to restart due to an error. A couple of times I had a physics based error that made it impossible to progress. I didn't particularly enjoy any level enough to replay it again, so this quickly became a pain.-I like the music, but it starts to drone on repetitively after a time.-It's a cheap game, might be worth the ten bucks, but I can't see this appealing to everyone.-It certainly didn't appeal to me.-I may give it a try another day, but Capsized seemed far more frustrating than it was worth. Wonky physics, annoying amounts of enemies, and the lack of anything really that captivating prevented me from enjoying my run.FINAL VERDICT-Not really worth the time. This may appeal to people who enjoy sidescrolling shooters, but the controls weren't tight enough for me to enjoy the experience. I like the idea of a minimalistic story told through pictures rather than words, but in the end I never felt like what they were portraying really translated into the gameplay. I can see this being a good distraction for a few hours, but nothing more than that. Despite the almost soothing music and charming art style, Capsized it's a very frantic game that offers a very familiar story that might not be worth the time to relive.			"

												A wonderfully immersive, beautiful game, helped along by the brilliant soundtrack from Solar Fields. I bought this game because of the soundtrack, and thoroughly enjoyed the side-scrolling shooter that is Capsized.			"

												This is not a review of the game, which is great, I would like you to consider actually buying or playing this title on a big screen with Steam controller, works great on linux, Steam controller correctly configured is way better than keyboard mouse or joypad!!! This game is even better now!Thanks Steam			"

												Un vero gioiellino! Con meno di 10 euro vi portate a casa uno dei migliori indie disponibili. Artisticamente è alla pari delle grandi produzioni, la grafica 2D rende benissimo sia i paesaggi che i nemici, gameplay frenetico ed innovativo per il genere, comparto audio poco vario ma d'impatto! Straconsigliato!			"

												I wanted to like this game more than I did.  The trailer made it look great.  The artwork is wild and weird, and the gameplay looked fun.   The problem is, it's not.  The keymapping is really awkward, and the game is pretty damn unforgiving of this.  The entire time I played, all I could think was ""Am I doing something wrong here?""    The artwork IS nice, but it's nigh impossible to tell the difference between destructible objects and non-destructible.  So I'd repeatedly get stuck only to go ""Wait, you mean I could blow up that one chunk of wall, but not the rest?""    It's not awful, but I don't see myself playing it after this.			"

												Unexpectedly, I had a lot of fun with #Capzised! It has a slow and a bit boring beginning... hence the surprise... but after the first levels it really gets on with a nice paced #action and #puzzle #platforming!			"

												This game is a 2d physics-based platformer/shooter which did not capture my interest on my first play session.  The core mechanics did not feel completely polished.  I did not invest much time in the game, and very well might update this review if I give it a second try.			"

												Kinda like space-age Trine just nowhere near as interesting, clever or fun. There were problems for me trying to set up a controller with it on my mac. Too much money for a game that already has hundreds of free flash games doing the same thing.			"

												This game would be a lot better if the controller support were improved.  I felt like the control of my character wasn't very tight and aiming was extremely...EXTREMELY difficult with a gamepad.  I really couldn't get past how hard it was to kill things, I wanted to play this game but I gave up on the second level.			"

												This is a fun 2d action game.  While the action is skill based, it also encourages exploration of the areas.  It's reminiscent of Super Metroid (though not a true ""MetroidVania"" style game as the levels are organized in sequential stages).  It also has a dash of Solar Jetman thrown in for anyone who remembers that semi-rare NES game.  It's fun and receives a definite recommendation.			"

												Capsized is a fun little 2D shooter. You're an astronaut whose ship has Capsized on a foregin planet, hence the name.The game is a fresh breath of air from all the FPS's and feel unique in its setting. Though the gameplay is slightly stale in the beggining it offers challenges and more enjoyment later on. The gameplay itself is really good, jetpacks, sling-hooks and a arsenal of different weapons makes the game feel like a platformer aswell as a shooter. Even though different weapons are good, the game might frustrate you with the auto-pickup of weapons, which can harm you in a shootout.Capsized brings freshness to the regular gaming. The visuals are good and the music is better. Even though it's good i must decrease my rating because you can complete it in a day, or even one sitting if you play on easy.The game last for about 4-5 hours, it has some replay value but is mainly a one-time distracton. 6/10 Bacon strips			"

												A few years back I played this game, and found it horribly choppy and unplayable; later on I figured out this was from my Integrated Graphics card automatically switching on for this game instead of the dedicated card, but it was soured for me and I didn't go back.Well I'm damn sorry I stayed away... It's the same game, but it's pretty amazing.  The absolute star is the Solar Fields soundtrack and the atmosphere it helps to create in the game.  The game is fun, challenging, interesting to look at, and can be played in a variety of ways.So basically it comes down to whether you like a game like this or not.  It's a sci-fi level-based exploratory game using wasd and mouse-aiming with clean gameplay and awesome chillout music.  Sound good?  Then get it!			"

												Capsized was an interesting game to play. The monsters were brutal and your character the badass who is the only one competent enough to save himself and his friends. The art and soundtrack were amazing and the mechanics easy to pick up, but hard to master. Only con I can really think of was when enemies hit me off screen before I can see them. This in 2D platformers should not happen. However the game was rather enjoyable, even on the harder difficulty and the final boss was challenging. I would have also liked the game be a bit longer or even have mini bosses. The wild life on the planet could warrant for such, but instead you just had to get past hordes of enemies with skill and precision and then carry on to the next level to save your fellow man.All in all I give this game a solid 7/10 for the visuals, sounds, and mechanics hard to master. A lot more could have been done in this short game to even increase the playability, but other than should be able to enjoy the story and adventure.			"
