												No game will ever affect me as much as BioShock Infinite did.After playing through the game three times (twice on Xbox 360 & once on PC) it still upsets me that Irrational signed over the series permanently.I'm going to keep this clean of any spoilers and say that this was a brilliant end to the revolution of the trilogy, and that Burial at Sea episodes One & Two are to be considered absolutely mandatory if you are to play this game properly.This game has been one of only a few games, that has brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Call me a cry baby or whatever, but I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with.BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite.I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also.If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention.

												Like the first game, Bioshock Infinite is a very thematically ambitious game. One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming. There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one. There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles. And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back. Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals. It's got a lot to say. The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does. While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same. You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout. These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand. They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere. To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game. For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.The world of Columbia is wider and more open than the claustrophobic and enclosed Rapture, gun fights involve more enemies than the original Bioshock. The problem with this is that it devalues the fights itself. In the original Bioshock, enemies were something to fear. Even the most basic ones could do damage to you if you're not prepared. In Infinite, most enemies are just faceless guards who you just simply have to shoot in order to progress to other parts of the story. Most fights just end up repetitive, and though the game allows you to use various methods such as vigors and skyhooks to defeat enemies, rarely do you ever need to. Most of the game you're grossly overpowered, even if you're not upgrading your vigors or weapons.Another thing, though admittedly it's a nitpick, the dissonance between the beautiful story and the violent shooting is something worth mentioning. Sometimes the dialogue and the ""breather"" scenes seem to be slightly disrupted by the high amounts of adrenaline shooting that follows. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's certainly something that could be done better. Less emphasis on gunplay and maybe some more exploration elements could benefit this game.Bioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one. A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007. It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well. If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.			"

Note: Play the games in this orderBioshock 1 > Bioshock 2 > Bioshock InfiniteThe year is 1912 and you play as Booker DeWitt and you've been tasked with saving  a girl, Elizabeth , in the city of Columbia. The game is an Action FPS that is true to its genre. The game offers a fairly fast paced action that might sometimes feel a bit tedious. Bioshock Infinite contains a multitude of weapons that are era specific and are lovely to use.You also have access to powers, known as vigors, which you can use to dispose of enemies or to just help you make your way through the game. The vigors can also be combined with each other making it an intriguing system to play around with.In addition to Weapons and Vigors you have other tools, like the skyhook, which lets you jump around from hooks attached to the side off certain buildings.The stealth system within the game is good. The detection is based around both sound and vision so walking on a carpet can suppress your footsteps while walking on puddles of water or broken glass will make them louder.The games scenery and enviroments are absolutely outstanding. When I got the first glimpse of Columbia I was speechless. The voice acting in the game is great as well with excellent dialogue. I'm quite serious now, I can't describe how PERFECT some parts were with how the characters acted and what they said. This game has brought forward some amazing quotes. In addition to that, all of the characters are well made and very sympathetic. I like games that have a good story, and Bioshock Infinite has just that. The story  is incredibly rich when it comes to content and will leave you with memorable parts that will make you smile when you think back.Bioshock Infinite is a game that you will not regret playing. It's fantastic.edit - removed Chrono order to please people.			"

												I don't think I've ever fancied a video game character before Elizabeth... Whilst my hours on steam don't reflect my actual playing time, as I've completed this game way too many times on my PS3, I just can't express how much I love this. It's my favourite ever game, and here's why:1) The plot is incredible, and has real substance. I've never completed a game more than once before, because I find playing the same story line tiring. However, this is an exception. The story line is phenomenal. I find myself being totally, and utterly, immersed in the world of Columbia. I have a real sense of ""belonging"" within the game which sounds a bit weird, but I don't really know how I can explain it. Brooker DeWitt and Elizabeth are both very strong characters, with great backstories, and the way these stories collide with each other is thought provoking, fantastically executed and cleverly directed.2) The graphics are visually stunning. The joy of playing this game with ultra settings, is one to be behold. If you're looking for a game with a wealth of detail, this is the one. Characters and scenery look great in the cut scenes and during game play. The lighting is just right throughout, and to me, fire has never before looked so good.3) The characters are strong, witty, and badass. And whoever voiced the characters need a medal, because I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping up to deliver what these guys have delivered. 4)  Combat. Is. Awesome. I never really liked gore in a game before, but I really enjoyed this, with just the right amount of gore included. Not just that, it's really easy to pick up which I love, and seem to have trouble with in other games.The only real criticism I can think of is the lack of DLC's available, and wishing that the story went on just that little bit longer. I didn't want it to end. Other than that, I really can't fault it. You're not just buying a game here, you're literally buying an entire world. Three hundred thumbs up from me!			"

												What drives a man of God to wash away the sins of his past, only to blacken his heart with a multitude more? How far can a freedom fighter be pushed before virtue and righteousness are replaced by a lust for vengeance? What does a privileged society do when the foundation of its prosperity is shaken? BioShock Infinite dares to explore these heady themes and many more, giving you glimpses at just how the seemingly smallest of decisions can forever alter our realities, and our hearts. As an agent provocateur in the fantastical floating city of Columbia, your actions bring turmoil and strife to an ostensibly idyllic landscape. It's immensely fun to stir up trouble, and even more engaging to see how boldly BioShock Infinite portrays a society torn asunder. You'll be haunted by this thematically devastating adventure, and indeed, its phenomenal final minutes, which are bound to be discussed and dissected for some time to come. Superb!			"

												Rise above the clouds and say hello to the city of Columbia, a place that changes the whole concept of how a video game should look.It's hard to say when Infinite evolved from a regular sequel into a terrific piece of art, but here it is. Even though it seems to ignore pretty much everything the original BioShock had to offer in terms of narration, the game not only bears the same idea but also expands it widely, moving the series far beyond any borders.The story now is much, much more complex. A standard rescue quest soon turns into a great adventure full of amazing twists, also featuring tons of different references, including physics, philosophy, religion, politics and many other things. By the way, it doesn't apply to the base game only — the Burial at Sea DLCs are necessary for understanding the wonderful cycle of the series. No examples here, for the whole story is worth seeing.Not to mention the gameplay mechanics which appear to be a simplified variation of the first game's scheme: easy enough to keep the fast pace and yet deep enough to let the player choose their way of dealing with problems. No more hacking mini-games or complicated stealth tactics, though, but if one is looking for some challenge, there is always 1999 mode that can make it feel like home. These facts, together with detailed design and, of course, outstanding visuals, make it hard to deny that the BioShock franchise is nearing perfection. Irrational Games use every single instrument the gaming industry has discovered to make their own beautiful symphony — and to finally make a perfect distinction between mediocre video games and a masterpiece.

												Whoever says games can't be considered ""Art"" probably never played any BioShock game.BioShock Infinite brings entertainment to another level, I haven't had fun with a game for a long time. That doesn't mean all the others releases are bad but it's been a while since i had so much fun playing a game.The plot it's one of the best i've seen in my entire gaming life, matching some Visual Novels and books i love (i kinda like a good plot and not the usual mindless action or generic shooting gallery we get most of the time). I don't think you'll find another game with a better quality plot anytime soon.Graphics aren't realistic but that doesn't mean they are bad, they got kinda a unique style that makes everything beautiful. You could say they are the same as the older games but they certainly improved a lot. However i kinda get annoyed with the excessive ""bloom"" in some scenes, sometimes they are overused to the point of blinding you. Aside from that everything else is beautiful. There's the music, honestly it isn't great but it's not bad either, the combat music is the same for the whole game save some specific scenes and it gets repetitive after a while. It's average at best.The gameplay is what you've already seen in BioShock 1 & 2 with some improvements. You can equip gears that gives you a few improvements like auto-casting lightning when you are struck or put your enemies on fire when you strike them with melee attacks.There's the new ""Sky-Line"" mechanic that allows you to travel around the place and can even be used in your advantage during combat, your partner Elizabeth even rides with you.And talking about Elizabeth, that's one hell of a companion. She is like Alyx in Half-Life 2: Episode One but instead of fighting she gives you support during and outside combat like finding and giving you ammo, salt, money and even warning about points of interest and some missable items like lockpicks. I love when i'm almost out of ammo and she throws me some ammo, she also plays a huge role in the plot.Honestly i haven't cared about my companion in a single-player game since Alyx, she isn't useless like most companions who doesn't do jack aside from yelling at you all the time like 'AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS"", "" TAKE POINT"", ""THEY ARE KILLING US DO SOMETHING!!!"". PC port is above average, there isn't much graphics options but at least the game runs great, without vsync the game always run above 60fps (sometimes going up to 90fps) with everything maxed out and the game has some pretty graphics.It took me around 13 hours to beat the game.My rate: 9,5			"

												Having played the main story on the hardest setting and completed all the DLCs I have to say: I absolutely love BioShock Infinite. Positive:- Extremely beautiful and atmospheric settings - as to be expected of a BioShock game- Fantastic, intense and unexpected storyline- DLCs actually deliver new and exciting storylines and game play- Great voice-acting and music overall- Responsive controls- I enjoyed only being able to hold two weapons at a time (unlike the other two BioShock games). It allows you to adjust to the situation by providing different weapons for you to pick up, or stick to your preferred play-style without scrolling through a huge inventory of weapons- No escorting: Elizabeth takes care of herself and helps you from time to time- You are rewarded for exploring- Challenging battles that remain exciting throughout the gameNegative:- I always found it strange that you take fall damage, but not when jumping off the sky line- Personally I found the crows + shock jockey combo to be extremely over-powered - The main story is only approximately 10 hours long- Less exploration than BioShock 1 and 2- Quite linear Conclusion:If you like BioShock then Infinite is a must - it delivers what you would expect plus more. Fantastic game-play, intensely atmospheric environments, unforgetable story, and DLCs that connect Infinite to the original BioShock games (it will blow your mind). This is the only game I have ever pre-ordered and I do not regret it at all.			"

												Where do I even begin? I had a great time playing Bioshock Infinite. I managed to complete it twice, and am considering a third playthrough. Similar to previous games, the story is original and very well written. It kept me interested throughout the game and despite my initial apprehension towards Elizabeth’s naïve character; I ended up really liking her as a “sidekick”, because that’s essentially what she is throughout the entire game. I enjoyed the numerous twists and turns of the story, and the ending absolutely blew me away.The gameplay is one of my favourite elements of Infinite. The new Skyrail system has transformed the dark and linear corridors of Rapture into a vast and open battlefield. The weapons are great fun to use, including the audio, with piano key drops that blare out when you land a headshot (soooo satisfying). The plasmid equivalent vigor abilities are nothing too special. Some are similar to previous Bioshock games while others introduce new things like forming a protective shield to absorb bullets and blast them back at your foes. There are some interesting combinations you can do with the vigor’s, which leads to many choices during combat.When compared to its predecessors, I felt Infinite lacked the horror elements that made me such a big fan of the first two games. In Rapture, everything was dark and gloomy so horror came naturally. In the floating city of Columbia, it was much harder to feel like it was part of the Bioshock universe. The secondary antagonist, Songbird is creepy and he does his best to keep the Big Daddy theme going, but the lack of creepy enemies just upset me. The boys of sound and sirens were my most anticipated enemies that I saw in the trailers for the game, but they had such a small role in the final game. Despite the lack of horror, Infinite managed to make me question my own understanding of what Bioshock is about and gave me lasting memories of a truly epic game.  "

Must haveI don't always finish my games, but when I played Bioshock Infinite, I finished it twice. DLCs included. Masterpiece.All the ingredient of success : fun gameplay, beautiful graphics and world design, incredible story.Pros :- Incredible story, with stunning details and love put into the creation of this universe.- Characters are fabulous, with background story for all of them, if you wish to learn more about the universe.- Wonderful art and world design. Columbia lives up to Rapture's hype. - Elizabeth.- DLCs in pre-civil war Rapture. Wonderful to see the city alive.- Gameplay is smooth, and unlike what some comments might have said, combat is nervous. I liked it anyways, and it's an improvement on the previous titles.- Perfectly suited soundtrack.Cons :- You'll never be happy again.- You'll need to google the ending because you'll be mindf*cked, especially if you are not native english speaker and play the game in english.- You'll have to explain your soulmate why you want to name your daughter Elizabeth.

This award category literally screams BioShock and between the first one and Infinite, I'll go with the most mind blown dealt between the two. I remember finishing the game and just sat there thinking, ""...What the hell just happened?"". I proceed to go online for more clarification about the ending (yes, I didn't really get it at first). This game is simply a masterpiece and I hope someday, in the near future, they will announce a new BioShock even cooler and crazier than this one!			"

												BioShock: After playing the whole series of the game, I can defenitly say its a great game. Everything you know or, at least think you knew about the world we're living at, is all lies. In each of the games you start as a ""normal"" character, with a casual personality, that during the game change and become a new character with a different personality. The game is about mental games with your brain. You gain new  powers and new abilities the more you're progressing in the game. In each game, the story change alot on each move you make. The whole idea of BioShock game series is really cool in my opinon and so are the action scenes in it and the story of each game. I highly recommend on playing the game, but from the first to the last, one at a time to understand better the story of the games. Great game.			"

												Although it's a simplistic, heavily scripted, linear experience, it's one of the most optimized, visually appealing, interesting ones available. It's been a while since a game compelled me to write a review and if the price is right, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite.Unique aspects of Bioshock worth notingElizabeth's Pathfinding, Awareness & Helpfulness. In years prior many companions in games would get you caught, waste all of your ammo, die, or block you from progressing all while being totally silent. Elizabeth will toss you ammunition or money should she find any, will move out of your way if you walk close to her and will constantly make remarks about her surroundings.The use of the Sky Hook and Skylines. Sure, conventional methods of transportation are just fine and dandy but it certainly never hurts to think outside the box! It's quite an enjoyable experience zipping throughout Columbia on the Skylines while fighting enemies.Aspects of Bioshock Infinite worth praising● No Third Party Digital Rights Management. No limited amount of machine activations, no ""always online"" requirements, and no services other than Steam you need to sign into to play.● The Achievement Progress Saving System. You can reload checkpoints to accumulate kills and loot containers. And if you were to ever miss any Voxophones, Telescopes or Kinetoscopes,  you can simply go to ""Load Chapter"" and select the chapter you believe you missed it on and collect it. However, you have to be weary about Infusions as they have to be obtained in a consecutive playthrough.Aspects of Bioshock Infinite worth criticizing● No In-Game Option To Toggle HUD or Holster Weapon! This is an unfortunate trend in many 2K Games and 2K Games affiliate products going back years. Honestly, what's the point in developing such beautiful scenery if you're not going to have the ability to take screenshots of it without a Health bar, Shield bar, Vigor bar, your arm and your gun getting in the way?● 2 Weapon Limitation. In previous Bioshock titles you had access to a wide range of different weapons via a weapon wheel. This time around it's limited to just two weapons.● Lackluster amount of choices or alternative endings. For a game that's circled around infinite parallel universes with infinite possibilities, why does Bioshock Infinite have such a lackluster amount of meaningful choices or any sort of alternate ending? It's debatable if Bioshock Infinite really needed any but I certainly wouldn't want to be the individual aruguing for less.Development disagreements & degradation of the product!Bioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you. The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer.Not every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game. Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right.			"

												OH MY GOD.The game sure did not get 94/100 from Metacritic for no proper reason.It's full of things to do, Main quest, Lots of side missions, Things to collect like weapon upgrades, Skill upgrades and Passive abilities, and of course, Easter Eggs to look for.The scenery you see in game is just amazing. Totally mind-blowing if you ask from me. It ranges from Rainy Seashore to up the skies in the Floating City, and all the way down to deep bottom of the Ocean. And the best part, you don't need very powerful computer for this game to funtion properly. I played with the 2nd lowest graphics, had my fps constant, and still was stunned by the beautiful views. Apart from landscape, the gameplay part is absolutely well-made.The gameplay contains mainly shooting and puzzles.The weapon models look really nice, and there are no bugs at all with animations.Some of the guns barrels even turn shining red from heat caused by constant shooting.You can blow your enemies up with RPG, shoot them as full of holes as Swiss Cheese,Abilities that you can use to turn your enemies into piles of ash, or to skyrocket them million miles away.Of course you don't need to always kill everyone. The game let's you choose most of the time whether to shoot or to stay in stealthy mode, looking out for threats and staying in shadows.The characters are easy to identify with.You just want to sit and keep playing, because the story is so entertaining and addictive.You want to see what's next, what is behind the next corner, what kind of enemies will you face.And, to be honest, there are merely no games without any bugs nowadays.I am talking about visual bugs, possible glitches and getting out of bounds.The bugs i got never killed me or prevented me to continue my adventure.For example, sometimes NPCs walked on places where they shouldn't have walked, Like on walls.But if you're into that kind of stuff, like i am, you're gonna find yourself going to places you were not supposed to go, and trying to find your way inside buildings, or outside areas, where you never was meant to be at.When i realized the credits were about to roll, i was a bit disappointed about the length of the game.It took me 14 hours to complete all the side missions, and main quest.It's not a long game, but it's very enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value too. Personally, that was one of the best Singleplayer shooters i've ever played. Totally recommended.Thanks for reading, hopefully this helped.-Nate			"

												I've always found the Bioshock universe interesting and really well done, unfortunately i dont really enjoy horror atmospheric games like Bioshock 1 & 2. This is exactly the reason i choose Bioshock Infinite. Bioshock infinite manages to put down a really good atmosphere just like part 1 and 2, it's kinda like this 1800's overly happy/goodlife style. And except for 1 or 2 horror atmospheric parts i really enjoyed walking through the flying and colorful world of Columbia. The scenery in this game is so amazing and i found myself often just standing still and enjoying the view.On to something different: The story and it's characters. Both are really interesting and well done. The story keeps itself interesting by introducing new things all game long. And by looting the world you'll find basic things like salt's, ammo, health etc. but also voxophones, these are audiofragments which expand on the story and give you more background information.  Someting i liked alot about Bioshock Infinite was the fact you travel with Elizabeth almost the whole game. It's something different, and although she doesnt really do much other than provide you with supplies and a bit of talking, it's better than traveling alone. However something you might need to do is search online for a explanation of the ending, because it's a really complex ending. There's alot of video's and sites explaining it, so it shouldn't be a problem finding something about it.Overall Bioshock Infinite is a amazing game, great story, great characters, great mechanics and a wonderfull world to explore. It's definitely a game that will keep you to thinking for a long time after you finished it.			"

Such as they replaced plasmids with vigors, to which its a consumable now. You have to think around 5 hours of what was going on in the time-line, due to time traveling, dimension walking worlds. And dont be confused when you reach the end cinematic. Everyone else was :P  10/10Enjoy ^-^			"

+ High-quality voice acting
+ High-quality content DLCs (Burial at Sea)
+ Well-crafted weapon feedback (the weapons feel ""heavy"" and ""strong"")
 - Annoying autosave system, especially in the content DLCs
- Performance issues
- Burial at Sea: Episode 1 is a bit too short

												Taken as pure First-Person Shooters, Bioshock Infinite is not too different from past incarnations of the brand, resulting therefore in level (if not below) of many other productions of the same kind. The point is that define Bioshock Infinite a shooter would be an understatement, almost wrong. That created by Irrational Games is an experience almost essential for a video game that you define. A video game where sensory, emotional involvement and narrative, really make the difference going to erase the ""flaws"" from a revamped gameplay. Columbia is completely different from Rapture-is a cross-section of the contradictions of the American Society of the early ' 900: a world in which dive as in reading a good book, rich in facets and details, warm and welcoming; complete. It is an experience of great impact, capable of developing in us a strong empathy towards the protagonists, and let us rejoice and suffer with them at all times. It is one of the highest forms of art in gaming, where knowledge and freedom of expression are combined to form a mosaic that cannot leave indifferent. Bioshock Infinite is a far from perfect game, with many flaws, but you can't not love; It is impossible not to want. Why Bioshock Infinite is one of those productions that leave a mark in the game industry and the player, coming long remember and increasing the personal baggage.			"

												Finishing the BioShock trilogy is a thing with a happy and a sad eye. What 3 wonderful games. Stories are great, this is a amazing final in the air and in the dlc under water. Graphics there could be more details, more things to find but its very good. Sound is mostly wonderful. The game length could be longer ( i play game on hard and 1999 mode, DLC1, DLC2 2 times (easy & 1998 mode) and clash in clouds. So the weak point is there could be more areas to find, where they get the pigs? Is there a air service from earth or even a farm? I miss a few more spots like a hospital or something and there could be more places under the sea but this game is epic and only very low critic points. I only miss Bioshock 4 (near the earth core, on the moon or something and a connection between all games like Jack, Delta, Brokker could have the same DNA or Elenor is daugther or reincarnation of Elisabeth). Sadly there isnt. I give this game 97 %. What i dont like was Clash in the Clouds, to replay 14 rounds for 1 try to get a Blue Ribbon was a bit to much, but what a wonderful world is this Bioshock <3. Thx for reading and hopefully enjoy all 3 games like me or more.			"

												This game was actually a very pleasant surprise, particularly since i got it on sale just to try it out, and im glad to say it was well worth it.The game is a decent FPS with great graphics and smooth gameplay, characters are very well written, there is a reason to care what happens to them, the game provides a satisfying challenge on ultimate difficulty, there are no severe or gamebreaking bugs, havent experienced a single crash after 70+ hours of gameplay, the challenges and achievements all unlock properly and accordingly. However there are 2 aspects of the game which imo make it an above average shooter- the story and the game companion.The story is a deep, memorable, open for interpretation type, borderline philosophical, which sticks with you for some time even after you close the game. It did however take me 2 playthroughs to completely understand it, but i value the effort put into the story and how throughout the game they slowly reveal details to you, just to give you a totally unexpected finale.As for the follower/game companion, this game offers the most likable and usefull companion ive ever seen in a singleplayer game. I personally dont like followers because in most games they just block me in corridors, alert enemies to my presence, set off traps or make stupid remarks. Luckily Liz doesnt do any of these things and she also throws you ammo/health during combat when youre low, which makes you want to keep her around. The game comes with 2 DLCs- Clash in the Clouds (combat challenge based) and Burial at Sea. While ive enjoyed the main game and CitC DLC very much for above stated reasons, the events that take place in Burial at Sea DLC were at least from my point of view very confusing and anticlimatic. Probably because i havent played BioShock 1 or 2 prior to this game, and their stories are bound.CONCLUSIONNot to bother with numeric evaluation, lets just say i find this game to be exceptional. If you can, try this game out, absolutely recommended!			"

												BioShock Infinite is the final entry in the BioShock franchise, and while it's quite different from the previous two games, I think it's a good way to end; especially once you play through Burial at Sea - Episode Two; but I'll talk about that in its own review. This one will talk exclusively about the main game, while I'll write reviews for each of the DLCs. So, on to the review!What should I talk about first? I guess gameplay would be an important factor. In BioShock Infinite, the combat feels more frenetic; so to speak. Rather than focusing on exploration like the previous games, you'll usually move from one combat arena to the other; not literally, of course, there will be moments where you're free to explore a bit, but the game still feels pretty combat oriented. Not that it's something bad, considering that, in my opinion, the combat in this game is pretty good, with lots of options to dispatch enemies; from the different weapons, to the Vigors (Infinite's version of Plasmids), and Elizabeth's Tears. If there's something I'd complain about, though, is the fact that you're limited to carrying two weapons at the same time. Somewhat disappointing, but the variety of Vigors (and Vigor Combos) more than makes up for this. Also, the Sky-Hook is a great addition, allowing you to quickly move through certain areas, while also working as a melee weapon. Finally, there's the Tears. Elizabeth, who will be your companion for most of the game, can open them to bring things to help you out during combat, which is quite useful.As for the story, well, it's pretty good in my opinion. It starts out somewhat ""normal""; you're a guy sent to the city of Columbia to rescue a certain girl, but as it progresses, it gets more and more complex, in a good way. The characters are all pretty well written in my opinion, and a particular mention goes to the Lutece twins. Their dialogue always cracks me up a bit. Some people might feel that the main character, Booker, feels like a ""regular"" hero; you know, guy with a dark past, atoning for his sins, etc. Well, I'd say that's because, while being the playable character, Booker isn't the main character. The main character would be Elizabeth, and when you play through the game, it kinda makes sense. The story isn't about Booker's trip to Columbia, but rather about Elizabeth escaping from Columbia.And now, I'll dedicate a paragraph to Elizabeth. Like I mentioned above, I feel that the game is more about Elizabeth than about Booker. After all, she is kind of the driving force behind the plot; what moves it forward. And like I also mentioned, she'll be your companion for most of the game. Even then, the game doesn't feel like a long escort mission. During combat, Elizabeth helps you out; not fighting enemies directly, but by providing you supplies, opening tears to bring in help, and even warning you of powerful enemies. Outside combat, she'll wander on her own; not going too far away from you, but she'll still look at things that interest her, and might even find things you missed; she can also open doors for you through lockpicking. I think they did a great job at giving her a personality; she doesn't feel like another NPC at all, but rather as an actual person. Still, there are a few details here and there; just as an example, when lockpicking, she'll usually talk in a cheerful tone, which can feel out of place when, only a few minutes before, she was angry at Booker for something he did.The environments are superb. The city of Columbia is a pretty beautiful place, and I can see why they went with the ""city in the sky"" theme rather than going back to the bottom of the ocean. Not to say that Rapture wouldn't have looked good; in fact, you'll get to visit it in its prime in Burial at Sea! However, having a different setting was interesting, with 1912's Columbia providing a nice contrast to 1950's Rapture. The level design, by itself, is pretty good; still, most of the places you'll visit feel like combat arenas, consisting of big, open spaces, unlike Rapture's labyrinth-like structure. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.Well, I think that's all I can say about BioShock Infinite. Personally, my favourite BioShock game is BioShock 2, but even then, I think Infinite is an excellent game, which is why I recommend it.			"

												BioShock Infinite towers over the rest of the competition in terms of history, involvement in the narrative coherence of what is shown on screen, and above all for the incredible artistic choices that have allowed Columbia to be built and Elizabeth were born and breathe. However there are a number of deficiencies that affect the gameplay, so strongly to the past lies in the series, and the technical aspect of the game, sometimes rather backward. Which it is a shame because if more care and finishing aspects so crucial for a video game they had joined the incredible design work, we would have found ourselves in a masterpiece of indisputable value. But we are ""only"" in front of a shooter excellent.			"

												Considering no one has made a fully objective review that analyzes actually positive aspects of this game, I took it upon myself to make one.Let's start with the bad aspects. Mainly, the gameplay. Bioshock had revolutionary gameplay; plasmids were extremely versatile and can be used for many things. Solving puzzles, starting attack combos, destroying machinery, and more. Along with the customization of upgrades and gear and great stealth mechanics, Bioshock had stellar gameplay and was different than almost all FPS's of it's time. That is, until Infinite showed up.The game is mechanically fun. The soundtrack and noises are amazing, and help set up the atmosphere and establish that Booker is ruthless and indifferent. The gameplay is also pretty rad in that setting up traps and using a combination of vigors is always fun. Objectively, however, it does not compare with the first game. Almost no puzzles can be solved with the vigors, and everything is pretty linear. It's strange that Infinite tries to go for an almost open world gameplay style where you can go back to places you've already visited for extra bonuses, considering it's pretty damn linear. It doesn't blend well, and going back a mile is not really good design. I don't think the average person would go back at all.The gameplay is also somewhat repetitive. At times it seems like the average AAA title where you're just filling random people coming at you with lead. The system where you can see where you're supposed to go to finish a quest/mission is pretty awful too. Sure, Infinite might have needed it considering theres so much to visit and you may be confused with the addition of skylines, but it's still not very good design. It's blatantly telling you, ""hey, go here to finish the quest!""Some design choices were also awful. Probably the only formidable foe is the handyman (which is btw, practically a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ big daddy rip off), and it only shows up like 3 times. Another design choice that annoyed me was the failed potential of Elizabeth's prowess. You would think opening up rifts to different universes would be awesome, but no. Instead, it's literally just summoning ammo and guns from nowhere.I'll cut the wall of text- the gameplay is more mediocre than the first Bioshock. It's not revolutionary and it has its fair share of flaws. It's still pretty damn cool though, and I'd personally say the gameplay is better than most Triple A gameplay.To say I didnt enjoy it is completely wrong. As a narrative, the game is amazing.Sure, most people don't play games as a medium of critical storytelling- literature and film exist, after all. However, games can easily show critical value and Infinite represents this.The characters grow increasingly complex as you see more of their dialogue. Booker is extremely interesting. He's completely desensitized to everything- yet so fragile. It is commonly shown that Booker hardly hesitates when it comes to death and dismay. When asked about this, he even states, ""One thing I've learned, if you don't draw first, you don't get to draw at all."" It is suggested that the events he's been through at the battle of wounded knee made him the person he is. The event adds significant internal strife to his character; he knows he's done wrong and sinned, and he can't do anything to fix it. As stated by him, ""You think a dip in the river is gonna wash away the things I've done?"" Perhaps the highlight of his corrupt mind is shown when (major spoilers) he even gives away his daughter in attempts to repay his gambling debts. His fragility is shown throughout the game as well, especially torwards the end. Unlike his character, he starts to deeply care for Elizabeth and puts himself in extremely wreckless situations in attempts to protect her. When she tries to kill Comstock, he tells her that instead they should just relax in paris. He wants to run away rather than confronting Comstock. He refuses to be  baptized at the last second, showing his common trait of wanting to run away. He is emotionally scarred and he continues to prefer running away than confrontation at many times. He becomes extremely protective of Elizabeth to the point where it's obsessive and wants to prevent her from harm. It isn't much of an exaggeration to say he's fragile.Elizabeth is also a deeply interesting character. Being caged throughout her whole life and forced to have only the companion of a mechanical bird, Elizabeth desires freedom and relishes it. She's stuck between a rock and a hard place- she can go back to her tower and be restrained and watched her whole life, or go with Booker to whatever the ♥♥♥♥ and be utilized to get rid of his gambling debts. She does care for Booker, though she doesn't show it often. Also with the strange ability of opening rifts to different timelines, it is suggested she feels somewhat alienated from humanity. Given that she practically has a massive hatred torwards everyone and every group throughout the game including booker and yet she's forced to stay strong and go with Booker, her character is pretty tragic.Finally, the Vox Populi is really damn cool. It's much more than just a terrorist group with guns; they were so obsessed with gaining liberty and freedom that it turned into something much different. They changed from fighting for justice to fighting simply just for actual blind hatred torwards Comstock and his people. This is easily exemplified with Fitzroy about to kill the child just because of plain hatred for his family and their increasingly brutal standards for killing enemies. The concept of Columbia was bound to have internal strife, and the Vox Populi illustrates this well.Not only are the characters are well made, but also the intricate plot.It's a highly intelligent story, yet it doesn't try to flaunt it and end up being pretentious. The ending, like the first game, is a complete plot twist. It changes everything you know about the characters. Who the Lutece Twins really are, who Comstock really is, what elizabeth represents, and more. The game is truely a masterpiece in delivery, and at too many times during the ending I had my mouth open when I realized in my head what happened. You can also find out more about the plot the more you listen to the voxophones you find during the game. It is safe to say that Infinite's plot by far interested me more than any film or book I've ever read. Not to mention, the backgrounds/graphics and the soundtrack are all godly. They all are good at establishing the atmosphere of the game, and even standalone they're amazing. The game is a masterpiece. Sure, maybe the gameplay may not be truely exceptional, but when every other category excels, the setting is extremely creative, and the gameplay isn't as flawed as the average AAA title, it is safe to say the game is a masterpiece. Also, on a subjective note, I still found the game fun as hell despite the design flaws and I'm sure you will too.  "

												This game.Man, this game was an absolute blast to play through.Ever wanted a swashbuckling adventure, set in an alternate timeline of history, where you get to visit a magical city in the clouds?Ever wanted to have an awesome companion throw you tons of ammo while you mow down the hordes of goons that the villain has standing in your way?Ever wanted to connect personally with characters you were unsure about whether or not you'd connect with?Then this is the game for you.But in all seriousness, this game is very visually impressive, the sound design is excellent, and the gameplay and gunplay are much better than the previous BioShock games. Throw in a mind-bending ending that will keep you thinking about the possibilities of what it means for a while, coupled with DLC that gives definitive answers about the events before BioShock 1, and you have this helluva game.Also, I'd like to add that I feel like this is the best ""game"" of the BioShock series. 1 was more of a philosophical experience, and 2 was a somewhat weak game compared to the first. This is the most fun that I've had playing the entire trilogy, and I think that this game is perfect for those just looking for a great time.10/10			"

I know I'm 4 years late with a review of this game but I feel an urge to express my opinion about my favourite game, so here it is... The plot : Bioshock Infinite takes place on a floating utopia named Columbia (year 1912) where you play the role of Booker DeWit, a private investigator that recieved the job of finding a girl named Elizabeth and that way to erease his ""debt"".The beautiful city of  Columbia  is at the surface a perfect place with perfect people but exploring and advancing in it you will find its dark moldy face. The city is the representation of extreme nationalism and religious fanaticism at its finnest form: propaganda posters and papers,patriotic music,rigorous clothing and behavior and the glorification showed to Zachary Comstock aka ""The Prophet"".I'm not going to enter in the  story  trying to avoid any possible spoilers, but I must say it's the most outstanding storyline I have ever encountered in my life.  <You are going to cry after a scrappy rusted fu***ng bird.>  Advancing in the city and learning its hidden controversated history it's a delight. Finding out about Booker life and Elizabeth secrets and true self it's going to keep you bonded with them the whole game.It is the most mindf**k story I have seen in a game/movie/tv show/book untill now. You are gonna start questionig every little detail of the world and the story in the hope of understanding the game and find yourself in need to take some notes to not be overwhelmed by it. The story it's hard to comprehend, raising many questions and theories, but that is its beauty.Regarding the  graphics ,  level design ,  game/gunplay  its perfect: graphically it is beautiful having an amazing verge between the ""bright side"" of the supposedly perfect place and the dark side of the story/true city. The gameplay it's easy to learn, the gunplay its smooth and basic (being there a gun for every category: pistol, handcannon, sniper, automatic, semi-automatic weapon having the option to upgrade them at the vending machines). The new part comes with  the vigors  which make the gameplay more fun (having the options to possess,freeze,stun <etc> your enemies). And also you can find gear that enhance certain abilities.  The melee weapon  can be used to travel across the zipline network of the city, that way being able to observe the beautiful level design and kill some patriots, of course. Ultimately , this is not just a game for me, it's a masterpiece. Ken Levine and his team from Irrational Games did the best job with Infinite: the combination between breathtaking story, well established characters, outstanding graphic work and fluid gameplay is all I can demand from a game developing studio.10/10 I would play again and start questioning about the size and the possibilities of the universe, realising that my mortal life is nothing in the long run for this obscure,dark place we exist in. Ps. If you want more story,the answers for some questions and the link between Infinite and the first two games Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 is there for you.			"

												(Completed on consoles)Even with my very high expectations there are things in the game that really shocked me. This game combines identity, guilt, belief, narrative, revolution, race, national identity into one of the most brilliant and remarkable creative feats I have experienced. Taking place in an alternate 1912, you play as a handsome Booker DeWitt wrecked with debt that can only be revived by rescuing a girl from Columbia. The world revolves around a floating city fashioned by Comstock who turn an ulternate America into a religion. Columbia ferrocious thrive for racial purity stems a discontent for violent change. With this brilliant metaphysical story takes the player in a journey best discovered at a slow pace. What is so extraordinary about Bioshock Infinite is how it highlights the human needs and the choices that we make as a person. Everything from its art direction to its narrative is numbing in its inventiveness. Bioshock Infinite is filled with extraordinary details in every moment manifesting from audio logs to level designs. To rush through Bioshock Infinite is to miss one of the greatest pleasures in video games. One of the most impressive accomplishments is its casts of character and especially Elizabeth's appearance throughout the game. The relationship that slowly involves and metamorphosize between you that is the central thrust in the story. The success is its sublime design and animations that turns Elizabth into the most striking character I've seen in any creative media. Elizabeth earned my affection and throughout the journey as I actually cared for her. Gameplay incorporates smooth and precise action sequences. Boss fights in mid sections change up the players vitality and it's all driven by an amazing sound score that raise these moments to extreme heights. The arial combat of the grabbling hook is fresh and a wonderous achievement as it keeps you in constant rush of adrenaline. It was impossible for me to say goodbye in the end. Bioshock Infinite will be the game of the century and will remembered for as long as I live. Just buy it and get lost in its masterfulness.☆☆☆☆☆ /5 stars			"

												Bioshock Infinite is essentially an overhyped hallway shooter. At first the atmosphere and city seem full of potential, but as you proceed through the game, all of it disappears and is replaced by mixed feelings of boredom and dread. This isn't because the enemies or environment are frightening or intimidating, but because playing the game quickly goes from 'a promising Bioshock sequel' to 'tedious mob-killing chore oh god let me finish this game already'. Progress in Infinite is akin to cutting through thick vegetation in the jungle while waist deep in giant python-infested waters, only without the danger, suspense, and adventure that would come with such an expedition.One would imagine that such a setting as a floating city would be an incredible feature on it's own, but alas, even the very world you play in falls flat on it's face and doesn't bother getting up, opting to roll awkwardly to it's destination instead. It is entirely forgettable that you're in a floating city once you begin to proceed through the game. Perhaps it's because rather than being able to explore the city and be reminded that you're miles in the sky, you end up just walking through one straightforward area filled with bullet sponges to the next. Where the Bioshock games allowed the player freedom of movement around whatever section of Rapture they were in, Bioshock Infinite instead holds the player's hand and leads them down one corridor to the next; the game's map design is basically a big, fat, straight line. Previously it would take some degree of exploration and attention to move onwards. Infinite, meanwhile, decides that it's done with all that non-linearity business, and makes sure there's an abundance of giant doors with comically oversized flashing locks on them so you know exactly which end of the hall goes to the next area. After you kill all the enemies there, get ready to fight more of them. Waves after waves of them, until the end of the game. Perhaps the worst part of all is that all of the main features that people were pumped for were instead revealed to be nothing like expected:Those cool sky-rails that seemed to have so much potential? Almost exclusively used to circle around whatever area you happen to be mowing down baddies in.Elizabeth having fun and dynamic interdimensional powers capable of smashing bad guys with items or having offensive and/or interesting combat use? They instead spawn in robots, skyhooks, cover, and guns/health/salts in a few predetermined places.Those giant handymen that seemed like they'd be fun replacements for Big Daddies? Get ready to fight two of them in the entire game.The giant bird that was anticipated so much and seemed like you'd have an amazing showdown with? You never fight it.Expecting a pit-in-your-stomach feeling as you plummet towards the earth after walking off an edge? You simply teleport back to where you stepped off.Having any choices in the game that could impact the ending or your overall power (like Big Daddies and harvesting/saving Little Sisters)? Don't expect anything even remotely similar, this game has no meaningful choices at all and has a hilariously stupid excuse for it (as well as the previously mentioned teleporting) that comes with the ending.What else do you expect from a game that Levine admitted they had to rewrite 6 months before release to accomodate the ending he came up with? It's hard to go into detail about some things (like the lame explanation for tonics existing) without spoiling the hastily assembled story, but all you need to know is that despite the mildly charming and well crafted environment (one of the few good things in this game), Infinite is a very poor successor to the Bioshock series, and an incredibly mediocre game overall.

												This is probably one (if not the best) game i have yet played, the story sucks you in. I played through it in 2 session on my first run. Well to be fair it does have some minor downsides, sometimes the graphics will look pretty bad, eg flat bushed or trees. And often youre just running from one combat to the next one. But there are so much more things that make the game so great. As already mentioned the insanely addictive story with a lot of twists and turns Even though the graphics are in some small cases pretty bad it is overall really nice to look at and the atmosphere makes you feel like youre really in a 20th century steampunk world (even though its lowkey steampunk ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) Another positive thing is Elizabeth. You all know those NPCs that walk slow as hell and are more disturbing than they help you. Elizabeth is completely different, she is never in the way and has a matching walking/running speed like you. So no more waiting for her. Shes also kinda helpful in Battles since shes giving you free ammo/salts from time to time when your resources are low. Since most people might not buy the season pass I must say that you really should. Not only is it connecting Bioshock Infinite with Bioshock 1&2, but it is also giving you some more background info towards the story. And the Clash in the Clouds DLC is tbh kinda useless and mostly just for achievement farming ;)So all in all it is (with the Metro games) one of the best ones I have played to this date and I can only recommend you buying it PS: and since Im writing this (not only) for the Badge I can tell you that if I could Id put it in almost every single category, but as you can only choose 1, I choose ""woooaahh Duuuudeeee""			"

												[NO SPOILER] - 9.2*/10The game is just awesome in its own way. Its Unique, its beautiful, its fluent, and very narrative if you are focused on story and events happens throughout the game, just be patient when you play, and be focused- thats the most important thing, so that you wont be with a lost head at the ending. I love the mechanisms and gameplay. Apart from this, this game really uses your brain and your memory what you did in the game from the beginning. Elizabeth is a very beutifully crafted female characters i have ever seen in games (one of the best possibly). And Booker is a very good character as well, story flows very nicely and it does not make you bored at any place. The Hook Weapon and then death from above move is awesome, and using vigors simolatenously when you are shooting is a great combination. Elizabeth helps you mostly throught the game as a great companion by passing you health, ammo, currency and salts. And the best thing is you dont need to look after her, she always finds a safe place when you are in combat, my jaw was dropped after seing the ending, but yeah that was this game meant to be ""Bioshock Infnite"" ♥, i recommend this game.

												Having not played any of the prior versions of Bioshock I had no idea what the franchise was about or what to expect. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting the game to be more of an action / fps rather than an action adventure, and there is about two hours of ""story"" before any action happens. However I stuck with it and ended up really enjoying it. The visuals in this game are amazing alone, and masterfully done. There are some minor thing I would recommend users tweak that I found helped considerably.**The Good*** Amazing Visuals.* Deep and interesting story line* Good replay value, there is a lot to explore and search through out the BioShock infinite world.**Needs Improvment*** Visibility of enemies is very poor, I recommend either using SweetFX or turning up digital vibrance.* Player movments are very ""blocky"" with the stock configuration, I found out this was caused by ""autoaim"" being forced on. There is a config tweak to modify this:Browse to C:\Users\YOURUSERACCOUNTNAME\Documents\My Games\BioShock Infinite\XGame\ConfigOpen XUserOptions.ini with notepad or wordpadFind the line called ""bAimAssist=True"" and change it to ""bAimAssist=False	 **Overall Rating **9.5 / 10			"

												It's hard to talk about this game about giving too much away but don't matter what kind of player you are I feel you should play this game at least once and form your own opinion. It's probably overhyped but I wouldn't say it's overrated. I loved Infinite, it's one of the best crafted stories I've ever seen, that moved and confused me for days. It's not without flaws, I feel most of the gameplay systems don't quite fit the game but they're not awful, just inadequate. Other than that the game is just fantastic. The soundtrack is one of the most effective I've heard in quite a long time, the whole game is just beautiful, the duo of main characters is amazing and it has become one of my favorite games of all time. Play Bioshock Infinite, do yourself a favor.			"

												I can drop compliments to bioshock infinite all day long, but what really matters and is worth mentioning is that this game is addictive and will not let you go for a couple of days at best (couldn't stop thinking about it for about 3 days the first time I've beaten it) thanks to its' magnificent design, breathtaking environments, attention to details, charming characters and greatly though-out story that will blow out your mind. Bioshock Infinite is a prime example of how a first person shooter can excel in every aspect of a game structure(graphics, gameplay, story, sound, etc.). Definitely a game of the generation contender for its' unique ability to deliver in every possible way as I mentioned above. I rate it a stunning 10/10			"

												Bioshock Infinite delivers a compelling story and addresses issues, both sociological and philosophical, on a level entirely above most other games.  It somehow manages to tie the complex multiverse theory and quantum mechanics into an enthralling plot full of twists and turns, with engaging characters and a beautiful and immersive setting. Put simply, Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games I have played to date, and definitely one that I will play again – I just wish it was longer :/			"

												Bioshock Infinite is an amazing game. In this instalment, you play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton who travels to the floating city Columbia in search of a girl.Similar to the other Bioshock games, this is a single player story driven FPS. Along with the typical run and gun controls, you're given various powers along with a sky-hook which allows for fast paced rail platforming.The art direction and narrative are well done, however I don't think it quite lives up to first Bioshock as I personally preferred Rapture's atmosphere. The combat is a bit too easy as well.This game is still a must-play though, buy it if you haven't already.For a more indepth review, check out my video:

												This game. This f*cking game.Well I finished BioShock Infinite a few minutes ago, and I'm still terrified about the game. It's just...okay, let's put it in topics. (Also pardon my english) Story: 10/10  A complete mindf*ck, that leaves you frightened from top to bottom and makes you want to hug your newborn child and cry in the corner. I honestly can't compliment the script enough. Loved the concept of American exceptionalism, perfectly executed. I won't talk much about the lore itself, since I recommend you to actually buy the game and have your own experience from a blank sight. Characters: 9.5/10  I actually managed to laugh with Booker DeWitt, who's extremely charismatic, and a bit of an assh*le. But the spark of the lightbulb here is Elizabeth. Oh boy, Elizabeth. You will fall in love with her, I assure you. She's one of the most charismatic characters I've ever encountered in a videogame. Elizabeth also helps you in-combat, providing Ammunition, Healthpacks and Salts. She can also unlock a few doors and throw you a random coin. It might sound silly, but you'll never get tired from seeing those animations. Speaking of combat... Combat: 8.5/10  I hope you don't hate me for this, but I've never truly been a fan of the usual ""BioShock combat style"". Yet, if you love it go ahead! The combat itself doesn't change much, but the addition of different guns and different Vigors can and will make you enjoy it. The Vigors are great, and the amount of combos you can do is huge. The enemies are also diversified, and some will even make you wet your pants and die a little on the inside. Adding ziplines, the help of Elizabeth (I'll avoid mentioning that much because of spoilers)  and a ♥♥♥♥ing bird  contributes to make the combat extremely fun. But then again, I'm not a huge fan of such combat. Map Design as a whole: 10/10  Simply astonishing. As an amateur Concept Designer, you wouldn't believe the amount of Screenshots I took. The artstyle is, as always, nice and smooth. I'm not gonna lie, I managed to get lost a few times, exploring stuff and finding random collectibles. I recommend you to...""enter"" the game, and feel the whole atmosphere. But oh boy the scenarios.... I mean, it's a f*cking city in the middle of the clouds, if you don't like that, you're weird, yo. Final note: 9.5/10  BioShock Infinite is one of the most well-written and well-executed games I've ever played so far, yet the Combat felt a bit boring for me. The game can be very challenging, specially on 1999 Mode (Don't ask). It's a must-have for players who aren't into BioShock that much, such as myself, and a treasure for BioShock fans. I know a few BioShock millenials didn't like Inifinite because ""it doesn't look like BioShock"", but come on, dudes.  "

												Nothing more than a tarted up corridor shooter with pretensions to literary merit.  As a shooter it is weaker than other games in its genre.  As a sequel to Bioshock it is lacking in the features that distracted the player from the weak shooting.  As a successor to System Shock 2 it is a sad case of sophomore slump.  As a build atop the general concept of the immersive simulation it (and its predecessor by the same studio) are a total sell-out.  As a story it is an incoherent mess with no conceptual ground and unrelatable characters.  Its one redeeming trait is sumptuous, nay, brilliant visual design.  It is an utter feast from start to finish.  It's a shame that's all it is; vacantly pretty.			"

												Bioshock Infinite isn't a horrible game, it isn't anywhere close to being the worst I've ever played, but it highlights the unhealthy mindset game developers have today. This game has received so much praise that it physically pains me, because I know in the back of my mind people with no concept of consumerism are buying into this hype train wreck.Bioshock Infinite has repetitive gunplay with unsatisfying weapons that are better than their successors that appear later in the game when upgraded. It has horrible hostile A.I. that uses no form of logic other than aggressively running into the open and mindlessly attacking the player. There is also a lack of unique enemy types to freshen up the combat, and any uncommon enemy that is in the game can still be killed by simply shooting at them. No enemy types require any form of special strategy or apporach to defeat them, so the unique enemy types serve no purpose, and may as well be normal generic enemies. The vigors lack variety, and often just replace functions that mixed up the gameplay in previous installments of the series. Many of the combat vigors are simply grenades with fancy skins and a tripmine feature. Also the enemy A.I. hardly makes use of vigors, only the flame and crow enemies use any type of Vigor. Splicers in previous Bioshock titles used plasmids very often, and made enemy encounters more varied, plus with vigors taking the same role as plasmids, should they not be a commonly used tool among the citizens of Columbia? The tear feature is extremely under-utilized, and doesn't alter the game environment during combat nearly enough to really keep the experience fresh. So every fight narrows down to shooting at bullet sponge enemies and throwing vigor grenades. Escort missions have always been things players dread, but many games have achieved amazing escort mechanics such as Yoshi's Island, Resident Evil 4 and Ico. Instead of actually trying to be inventive, and making escort mechanics seem less of a chore, Irrational Games decided to remove the gameplay element of escorting Elizabeth from the equation entirely (either to pander to the feminists, or avoid the risk of adding something idiots may think is too hard). Elizabeth is unarmed the entire game in the middle of gunfights, there's no way she can, ""Take care of herself,"" without having a weapon or some line of defense. Despite the enemy's main objective to be capturing Elizabeth, they make no efforts to do so during combat. In Ico and Yoshi's Island, the goal of the enemy faction is to capture your partner, that's why preventing them from being captured is an element to the gameplay. Why is Elizabeth in the game? Answer: To pander to Tumblr psuedo feminists who want capable female characters instead of good gameplay, and neckbeards who want to be together with Elizabeth forever. Elizabeth is a useless friendly A.I. that doesn't aid but rather wastes the players time spawning ammo, health, money or other items (due to the previously mentioned bullet-sponge enemies draining you of your ammo, and the enemies dropping ammo for guns randomly, instead of based on the weapons you are currently using) and stripping control away from the player or clouding the screen with a button prompt to receive the item you could have simply picked up yourself, and in no way takes part in combat. While she can pick locks, there is no reason Booker himself couldn't have been given this abilty during development. Either way, you still have to command her to pick the locks, so you might as well be doing it yourself, her doing it for you also removes the possibility of having lockpicking being an aspect to Infinite's gameplay. The tear ability still requires you to command Elizabeth to utilize it, therefore the ability might as well be Booker's. If Elizabeth had an A.I. that utilized tears based on which would be more advantageous to you at any given time, this would have actually given Elizabeth a purpose in the game; too bad that would require work on Irrational Games's part.Infinite is also highly praised for its atmosphere, but I disagree with this claim.  Attention to detail on the player's part will immediately remove them from the environment they are meant to be immersed in. This game's visuals are praised to be groundbreaking, but only because they used the trite orange-blue contrast everywhere they could instead of the color brown. Level design clashes with the gameplay. Now, the first Bioshock was closterphobic, cramped, tightly packed, consisting of small arenas or hallways. This compliments the more simplistic, arcade-y FPS elements of the game, where you can avoid exposing yourself to many enemies, and reveal yourself to make a quick offensive. In Infinite you have a two weapon limit, so you can't pull out a sniper (you might not have one) and make an offense in the open, you have to approach your enemy, expose yourself, and be forced to take damage. Even the enemy design clashes here, where they'll run at you with melee weapons and be slaughtered by you in the wide open spaces. The melee weapons were useful in Rapture, where enemies could ambush you and get solid hits on you, here it's assanine.Most of this game's ""atmosphere"" should be credited to fancy skyboxes, and bloom. Whenever I started to take in the environment, something stupid would completely spoil everything. The biggest of all being the first person cutscenes, where the game makes you watch your character do things you didn't command him to do in first person view, the main display mode of the gameplay. When playing a platformer, cutscenes don't play from the stock camera angle, or else you'd be still be in the mindset of trying to control your character, and being surprised to find out that conrol of them has been stripped from you, immediately taking you out of the game.The same rule applies here, the first person view is reserved for the gameplay, so transitions from gameplay to cutscenes are less jarring. Another huge video game sin is where the game presents choices to you through button prompts. These decision making moments aren't presented in the gameplay's format, the gameplay is stopped so you can press a button and watch your decision unfold. One should be prompted to make a decision without being removed from the actual gameplay; the whole Half Life 2 ""pick up the can."" scenario is a perfect example where you are presented with choice without removing you from the gameplay. The setting of Infinite is nowhere near as compelling as Rapture, where you'd wander the deserted hallways and wonder what life was like before it all fell apart. Instead, Infinite seems to prefer shoving controversial issues like racism or patriotism in, and never actually do anything intellectual with the themes presented.The game's focus on narrative is problematic as well, simply because it takes importance over the game's gameplay; the most important part of any game. People seem to think writing has to be ""cerebral"" or ""deep"" to be good, but a simpler story that's charming, horrifying, campy, epic, joyful, or heart-breaking is just as, if not more compelling. Story is something that can be enjoyed on the side. Games shouldn't have to confrom to movies or literature, they are unique in that the player experiences them instead of watching or reading them; the events of the game are happening to you, so you are already invested in the adventure. Video games are about the actions you perform while playing them, the lessons you learn and the the emotions you have while perfoming them, and the sense of accomplishment you experience from overcoming the challenges the game made you face along the way. This game isn't worth your time or money, because it forgets the fact that video games are about the experience of playing them. Anyone willing to look at this game critically will know that buying it is a huge mistake, and a vote for games going further in the wrong direction.			"

												Love this game! Always been a bioshock fan, bought infinite a few years back and dove head first into it. This is one of the few games where a linear storyline doesn't bother me. The way the story is told, and the immersion are on point. This game was far ahead of its time and I'm fortunate to have played it when it was in its prime.The story is also incredibly deep, even more so if you have played the previous games in the series and then play the DLC. Do yourself a favor and don't spoil the ending if you haven't played it yet. Yes, you could watch a let's play, but you get so much more out of playing it yourself! I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a quality single player experience!			"

												Very pretty game with an interesting story, and my praise ends there. This game oversimplifies the mechanics of the first two BioShock games, removing a lot of features entirely.  Vigors are a dumbed-down version of Plasmids that are not tangential to the plot of the game like Plasmids were to BioShock (though this is cheaply tied together in the last DLC).  Hacking is gone entirely.  Tonics have been replaced with a much smaller variety of equipable clothing.  Vending machines are horrendously expensive.  Skylines are pretty silly for methodically dispatching most enemies at ease.  The game also treats the player with an innovative and never-before-seen regenerating shield on top of their standard health bar.Does not have the same sense of wonder and discovery of the previous games, mostly because Infinite is, dare I say, a completely different genre from the other BioShock games - it's an action FPS, and as far as I am concerned, the only thing that makes it remotely similar to BioShock is a brief tie-in with Rapture, and ""BIOSHOCK:"" being in the title of the game.I'd recommend it for a $10 Steam sale, not much more than that.  The Burial at Sea DLC brings you back to Rapture in the most awful way possible - playing with the same terrible, console-treated mechanics that you had to deal with in the main campaign of Infinite.  UPDATE 3/25/14:  BoS Episode 2 does a little better in this regard, forcing the player to adopt a stealthier style of play unlike the running and gunning of Infinite and DLC 1.I honestly don't get the critical circlejerk about this game.  It is easily the least fun entry in the series.  For reference, I had played the first and second BioShock games within a period of 72 hours prior to playing Infinite.Update 3/25/14:  Burial at Sea Episode 2 fills a lot of holes and ties a lot of plotlines together, almost to the point where it feels like filling plotholes was the only reason this DLC was created.  Nevertheless, playing as Elizabeth is a lot more interesting than Booker's chapter of the Rapture DLC, and the storyline of the second episode is a lot more important than the first.  Considering that the second DLC offers a ""recap"" of Booker's DLC, only purchasing Episode 2 is entirely feasible.			"

												Just an excellent game. Takes about 10-20 hours to play and is a great offline game (why I don't have more hours into this). The story mixes with the actual game and makes a great combo the fighting is never boring due to the combination of guns and vigors (magic). The combat itself is hard and forgiving because of the fall back to a checkpoint style of death while at the same time keeping with the story which every part of this game does perfectly, there's no meta game moments which brings the world in a beautiful way to you, uninterrupted by gameplay. The game is fresh and unique while at the same time familiar and easy to grasp again.The story is that of the best I've played for a long time and without giving away spoilers its one you most likely won't get until the game tells you. It gives you the nice twist you (should) expect and it ties it off, yet in a way that allows for another game after this.=== Complaints: Choices don't matter in this game but they still make the world different and... well its related to the story. There are no puzzles like I expected... aside from The one in the very beginning regarding bells and that... that's a joke. Easy mode is... nothing normal is easy hard is normal and 1999 (konami code) is hard. by that I honestly mean that hard (normal) makes you use your skills and your guns or else, you can also make it through without any back tracking or grinding for money. Easy you could probably use your melee through the entire game. 1999, is the hard mode you expect, requires precision and sometimes may involve an actual use of vigor combinations along with just about anything else. Last is the vigors... they are great and each person has their own favorites, once you find yours you wont stray too far except in some situational use.=== Warnings/Spoiler free tips: If you fancy yourself a seasoned gamer I would recommend entering the konami code at the main menu (where you get an options menu) this will give you a tougher game mode and you don't have to repeat the game in hard / normal / easy. (although I will still play the game on the harder mode so that I can revisit and re analyze the game.) Pay attention. Collect the voice recorders to uncover the full story.Story: 10/10 (WoAh, watch out for that twist)Gameplay: 9/10 (FPS, not very exciting. +Vigors or else it would be 7)Presentation: 10/10 (Good style)Soundtrack: 7/10 (Non memorable, a few snipets of pop culture type of music)Replayability: 5/10 (If you do it will feel like a chore, or that you have been betrayed by the game.)

												Once again, I'm making a review of fairly old game that most players have played already or at least know about. Bioshock Infinite, as its predecessors, emphasize on story and great deal of magic of it artwork (calling it 'just a game' is real downgrading). Masterpiece with its own right in art and science fiction. I immediately fell love to it's colorful and everchanging world, great voice acting job and complex characters.I played this game to the end twice now, once when it came out and for second time when I got it here on steam. It brought me to the world of Bioshock where I even decent through the books now.+++ Story, plot twists and parallel universes++ Artwork+ Voice acting, audio logs+ Graphic+ Gameplay+ Two story DLC's worthy as proper expansions- Intensive and lovely experience but short10/10 “One man goes into the waters of baptism. A different man comes out, born again. But who is that man who lies submerged? Perhaps that swimmer is both sinner and saint until he is revealed onto the eyes of man.” – Zachary Hale Comstock "

Are you afraid of God, Booker?Short Answer: An absolute, no question, must have.Bioshock Infinite is the next installment of the already extremely successful Bioshock franchise and boy does it deliver.Without spoiling much of its amazing story here are the good points: Incredibly elaborate storytelling Beautiful graphics Clean and exciting combat flow Great voice acting, always on pointThe only bad feature? You can only hold 2 weapons, but let's be real here.I feel as though I can't go into more detail without ruining the experience, but you will play this game at least twice.Infinite brings to you one of the best gaming experiences you've ever had and you'll talk about it for years.

Product received for free
												I was gifted this game by a friend and it sat in my library for a few years. I didn't know much about Bioshock, but I just decided in my head I wouldn't like it. A couple of days ago, I just decided to load it up, and I can confidently say it's my favorite single player game of all time. Though some have criticized the gunplay, I found it very enjoyable, and the vigors were a blast. But, the world building and story is where this gem shines. With only having a vague understanding of the first Bioshock, I was able to follow the story without any confusion, well, except for the confusion the game wanted me to have.  Fully recommended.

												This game will literally blow you awayThe graphics are nice but it still runs with a really healthy fps (150-200 on i5-4690K and GTX 970 on ultra settings)The story is just... well just play it yourself and you'll never get the pieces of your brain together. The story makes no sense in the beginning and you'll be busy fighting waves of enemies but the further you go the messier the story gets. I promise you the ending will not only answer many questions but rise a lot of new ones. Totally worth the money! Maybe I'll play the DLC some day...			"

A lighthouse. A man. A city.Irrational's conclusion to the BioShock mythos was widely considered an instant classic upon release and rightly so. The game pays homage to the classics of the late 1990s such as System Shock 2; bringing the excellent design and relevant mechanics of such games to a mostly new audience and era. But unless you've been living under a rock for the past few years, you probably already know this and also have probably played it, so I'll skip the formalities and get right into it. Heads or tails?You are Booker DeWitt, a tortured, former Pinkerton agent, sent by his mysterious employers to the floating city of Columbia, a steampunk, pseudo-Christian dystopia to find the young woman Elizabeth, the city's mysterious idol and supposed heir of Father Comstock, the so-called Prophet and main antagonist. Your goal? To bring them the girl and wipe away the debt. In leading the beloved Lamb of Columbia astray however, your journey as The False Shepherd will take you beyond the blood-soaked city, the ruthless factions vying for control and morality itself as the two descend to where you may not want to go. ""We all make choices but in the end, our choices make us.""Drawing heavy influence from science fiction and philosophy, BioShock Infinite features a narrative unlike any other, proudly boasting complex themes and a well-written cast characters as the game ultimately plays out as a thought experiment, hinted at from the opening title and the plethora of voxophones, (the audio logs of Columbia), that can be collected. Though it is in the format of a first-person shooter, (with deeply satisfying and fluid gameplay to boot), the world of Infinite is rich and full of life and stands head-and-shoulders above the barrage of military shooters in recent years. The opening sequence is especially memorable and opening the doors to Columbia will certainly be remembered for the breathtaking moment that it is. What you will immediately notice upon playing is just how gorgeous Unreal Engine 3 is, even today. Though the occasional muddy texture would catch my eye or a slight pop-in, as a shameless cinephile, the colour palette really is the gaming equivalent of the Technicolor of classic cinema, i.e. that it is absolutely beautiful to look at.  Now, of course, it would be criminal if I didn't dedicate an entire section to the Sky-Hook. Already featuring the lore-appropriate return of the Plasmid-like Vigors, combat will quickly introduce you to the Sky-Line feature that links the quantum levitation of Columbia's buildings together through a suspended rail system, which you are free to use whenever you like, with a quick magnetised jump on or off. The manual executions with the Sky-Hook are bloody as hell and pretty damn satisfying in the heat of battle.Also complementing general gameplay is your excellent companion, Elizabeth, who might even surpass the likes of Alyx Vance as the greatest companion/sidekick in gaming. Along with her Tear abilities, Elizabeth will frequently collect and toss health kits, salts for your Vigors and money at Booker, repeatedly saving your life, especially on higher difficulties. Furthermore, she'll often have contextual comments or interact with the environment which are always really interesting to hear and I often found myself turning round and walking back to see what she was up to. That is, of course, after Booker was finished stuffing his face with hot dogs and coffee.Over all, you will certainly develop a bond with Elizabeth as Booker begins to find his redemption in her. She is a fascinating and likeable yet tragic character that ultimately feels like a friend to both you and Booker, which makes the ending that much more painful and the plot twists all the more meaningful. Make no mistake, Infinite will pull you into one of the most immersive shooters and mindblowing experiences gaming has even seen and will stay with you long after you've finished playing. In addition to the fairly long campaign, (which you'll undoubtedly go back to for multiple playthroughs even just to pick up on small hints that you missed), and collectibles galore, the DLC released features two sets of content. Clash in the Clouds is a rather enjoyable arcade-like challenge map mode in which you fight off various waves of enemies and complete challenges to progress. I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable it is and the mode also includes behind-the-scenes content that you can spend your earnings on to unlock. Far from gimmicky, it is actually quite good. The best addition, however, is the Burial at Sea episodic expansion which brings Booker and Elizabeth into Rapture and the events surrounding the fall of Ryan's underwater utopia in 1959.  The first episode is good, establishing the events of the DLC but it is the second episode where this truly shines, connecting both the original and Infinite in a remarkable and quite emotional experience, well worth the price of the Season Pass. As someone who has followed this franchise since the early days, all the way back to my beloved PS3, words cannot truly express just how great it is to be back in Rapture, realised in all it's true glory in Unreal Engine 3. The respect that Irrational has shown throughout to both the community and the world it has created is remarkable and, though now disbanded, they set a standard for games that all other studios should aspire to. That's not to say that Infinite and it's DLCs are not without flaws however. A divisive criticism since the first game is that the series is often too heavy with exposition and there are some notable plot points left unexplained. The checkpoint feature can be irritating at times, even with the well-executed respawn mechanic. The ability to only wield two weapons at a time can be a pain, especially in large battles and ammo is running low. Booker is no longer the silent, walking death machine that Jack was by the end of the first and 1999 Mode will be sure to remind you of that very quickly. But all of these pale in comparison to the game as a whole. After playing it through again and again, you'll find yourself simply not caring about the few negatives that are noticed. You'll be too busy invested in the top-notch sound design and immensely satisfying gameplay. It is important to note that if you have not played this before then you must avoid all spoilers, even with the third anniversary since release approaching. If you haven't played the first BioShock then I also highly recommend that you check it out. A walkthrough or wiki page does little justice.But I've been rambling on and off for the past few hours now so let's conclude.You'll often hear the words 'essential' or 'masterpiece' be thrown around in the midst of hype and enthusiasm, but BioShock Infinite is one of those rare feats that lives up to itself and achieves what can only be described as true greatness. At the time of writing this review, the entire series is on sale for an absolute steal, but even now it would be worth full price.  It isn't perfect but, in all honesty, when was the last time you played anything that was this good? A work of art and a triumph of gaming as a medium, this is one for gamers and non-gamers alike. Pick it up with the Season Pass as soon as possible.			"

												This is a game that desperately makes you want to think it's smart when it has no idea what it's talking about and knows jack about it's own subject matter. The combat is limiting and repetitive with a two weapon limit with an expensive as hell upgrade system. The ""Vigors"" (plasmids with a new coat of paint) all do the same thing with three exceptions: Possess machines for a short period of time (Not the same as hacking from Bioshock 1), charge at enemies with a strong melee attack (comes with a certain upgrade that makes it stupidly overpowered so you'll probably not use anything else), and an ability to catch and reflect bullets (would have been pretty cool if it wasn't given to you at practically the last part of the game), all other Vigors are just the same crowd control effect with a different look. The story doesn't save the game either. In the beginning it tries to send a message about racial equality and revolution but that's thrown away in favor of theories about alternate-dimensions/realities (which don't make any sense at all the second you start thinking about them). Also; why did they feel like they needed to have a twist ending in Infinite? Just because the first game had one? They also did it in Infinite's DLC. Are twist endings now a staple for this series? Do they understand how a twist ending is supposed to work? A twist only works if the audience isn't expecting it, just by making your series the ""Series with twist endings in them"" you're ruining the surprise because people will be expecting it. That's what made the twist in Bioshock work, the game gave everyone enough hints towards the twist without giving it away; no one was expecting it. In Infinite the twist is not hinted at at all, I played the game twice just to make sure I missed something but any actual hints towards the big reveal were extremely vague. It's only 12 hours long but many areas felt like unnecessary padding. The ending is 20 minutes long and it's whole purpose is to provide an explanation to many of the mysteries in the game, but it fails. Not only are many questions left unanswered, many more questions are raised. They try to explain most mysteries with alternate dimensions and quantum physics which ends up not making any sense.On a sunnier note, Columbia as a setting was pretty cool, but I honestly think this is the only thing the game truly has going for it.Wait a minute that card/10			"

												It’s no secret that BioShock was regarded as a pretty good game. On the whole it was solid but had some problems – mainly regarding a surplus of pipe puzzles, a few too many fetch quests and a really ♥♥♥♥ final boss. BioShock 2 traded those problems for better gameplay on the whole, but spent too much time protecting Little Sisters, and carried the narrative baggage of a million retcons. How convenient that everything that happened before BioShock 2 occured outside of the original.So if BioShock got the story right, and BioShock 2 fixed a lot of the gameplay problems, what happens if you mash them together?You get BioShock: InfiniteThe year is 1912, and you are surprisingly non-silent protaganist, Booker DeWitt. Ex-Pinkerton agent, with a gambling habit, drinking problem, and a lot of debts. When approached with an offer of 'Bring us the Girl, and wipe away the debt', you can't help but take it. At arriving at a Lighthouse, Booker decides to go up to the racist nutters rather than down to the rich nutters.Let’s not kid ourselves, Infinite looks incredible. Rapture’s main aesthetic came from the art-deco style and the murky underwater theme, and BioShock 2 took that and aged it by another decade or so. Ignoring the fact they’re older games, they relied on style and atmosphere more than fidelity of textures. Unfortunately it meant they occurred in identical corridors and big rooms with a few leaks. Infinite has amazing views of a city floating above the sky, and the feel is much different. 1 and 2 were horror games, and you’re being hunted and hounded at every corner. You crawled along dark corridors, scrounging for cakes and bullets, while jumping at shadows of Splicers or a Big Daddy. But in Infinite you can grind a Sky Rail, leap off and smack someone in the face, throw a murder of crows at his buddies, and gun down the survivors in one swift movement.You can only carry 2 weapons at a time, and I think there’s a bit less variety – where there was a multitude of Chemical Throwers, Crossbows, Spear Guns, Rivet Guns, there’s only a couple of weirder weapons, but I found I was using other weapons more often.I was most pleasantly surprised by Elizabeth. I was aware of her story significance, but I didn’t expect her to follow me around, and actually be useful. She scrounges for supplies, throws you ammo and Salts in combat, and you don’t need to protect her! I don’t think I could ask for a much better NPC follower! What were Plasmids are now Vigors, and EVE is now Salts. And there's some great quality of life changes - Vigors have a quick access wheel, and you can have 2 on demand to switch between, and the Salts bar is divided to show how many shots you have left. You can't carry First Aid kits or EVE Hypos like before, but you now have a rechargeable shield, and ther's a lot more items to restore your salts, and the Vigors cost less. Unlike 1 or 2, Vigors felt less useful. I don't think it would be better without them, but they weren't as pivitol in fights to the point I forgot to use them most of the time. Vigors are just kinda...there. Where they were instrumental to Rapture's downfall, Little Sisters and Big Daddies, and in combat, Vigors feel like they're here because they were in the last 2.Much like BioShock 1, I never felt in immediate danger, even when it began getting hectic. Your shield recharges when not being damaged. Salts and most ammo types were fairly common, except for a few of the more powerful or unique weapons. I had Elizabeth to throw salts, ammo and health if it got grim, and while I died a few times, it was never the end of the world, more a minor inconvenience.The final Boss is alright, but Comstock, the main villain, is much less compelling than Andrew Ryan, Frank Fontaine, or even Sofia Lamb. Ryan had some interesting ideas about who’s sweat belonged to who, but he was a pretty smart guy, and wouldn’t allow Comstock to be in charge, considering Comstock is basically racist Santa.BioShock: Infinite is the best story bits of BioShock, the better Gameplay elements of BioShock 2, and some quality-of-life changes. I think it’s the best of the bunch, but if you don’t agree, that’s fine. Not everyone can be right all the time.If I had a Silver Eagle for every time Booker said 'huh', I would buy Columbia.			"

												Don't consider this game as a Shock series game. Consider this game as a normal FPS instead of a RPG. And sadly the FPS part of this game is medicore and functional at best. Ultimately the game is filled with repetitive shooting for 10 hours before players get to the last 20 minutes of non-interactive ending, which does not reward the players in any ways what-so-ever. It is sad that a game with a wonderful soundtrack and fantastic visuals falls short when the gameplay is not entertaining in any particular ways.			"

The story is very interesting and I found myself unable to stop playing until sleep nearly overtook me midgame.

												This is a very delayed review, and probably not going to interest anyone, so more for my own ego's sake than anything else. That being said, I'll remain spoiler free if you've wandered across this review somehow and haven't played it (you should, its excellent!). Bioshock Infinite takes us from the submerged, suffocating horror of Rapture to the strident, soaring world of Colombia, high above the clouds. The atmosphere and tone is very different, but atmosphere and tone is still very much present in this world. Bioshock is dragged out of the shadows and put into the light. It works, it's a captivating fantasy world which I really enjoyed with its own hooks, but on some level its not ""Bioshock"" as I immediately associate it with the claustrophobic, maniacal terrors of Rapture. That's not a bad thing courtesy of its magnificent storytelling. There's a good selection of powers and weapons to choose from with a variety of playstyles to select as you please. Having the DLC made the early game feel a little too forgiving however, as you receive a substantial volume of additional resources. The highest difficulty levels present a decent challenge, you have to be moderately conservative with your ammunition and vigors. At no point did I hit a brick wall in my achievement runs of the story, a test but beatable. There is also a challenge mode over several maps, and this is a challenge! Some of the wave missions are pretty demanding and precise, and if you mess them up, you have to start the entire map again and get back to that wave. Be prepared to invest some time if you get the completionist itch. The games strongest component is its storytelling. It's exceptional. Unlike the blank canvas of our Rapture denizens, Booker and Elizabeth are defined characters with distinct personalties, behaviours and voices. They interact heavily with the world around them, and most importantly with each other. There was a really poignant moment where I wandered into a room after a firefight, and found a guitar. Elizabeth began singing as Booker strummed. Spontaneous and incredibly touching. I normally skip such pseudo cutscenes if possible, but I found myself just sitting back and listening. That's good storytelling.They tangibly develop as characters over the course of the game, and you feels its earned and justified. Nothing is more rewarding as a player than when you yell YES! or WHAT! while playing, because you've developed a connection to the characters. There are also the classic Bioshock plot twists. Prepare to dive into the rabbit hole in this one, it gets pretty wild with some clever nods. I loved it. The game also possesses the most wonderfully bittersweet ending, which is worthy of a mention in itself. It makes your second playthrough almost as interesting as your first, as you look for the telltale signs of the set up. And oh boy is it a set up.So the question that rises: is it better than the original Bioshock? Well, in my opinion yes, but for a specific reason. As visceral as the atmosphere and plot twist of Rapture is, the strength of the narration and characterisation in Infinite carries it above it's previous entries, with twists to match those of the first game. It goes on my all time favourites list, and my 100% completion list. 'There's always a lighthouse, a man, a city'			"

												pros: interesting story and memerable charcaters- the most beatiful city and enviroment ive seen to date-skyhooks bring a sense of open world and fast pace combat-high emotions-elizabeth is the most helpful and fleshed out character and companion in a game so far. Garrus from mass effect and the other games a cool but their traits are only really shown through narrative. with elizabeth she has interesing things to say and does minor things that make her organic such as cough in smoke or around smokers and not go into the mens room with you or run ahead so it seems shes not following you and getting in the way( ""skyrim""cough). She also finds salts, health and ammo exactly when you need it.-Amazing voice acting-unqiue graphics-tons of underestimated vigors-MORE BIOSHOCK-gears add more varitey to combat with buffs like 75% chance to set enemies on fire with meleeCons-salts.Unlike in bioshock 1 and 2 you had stacks of eve hypo's which you could use in seconds and have up to 9 at once while not breaking the flow of combat. In infinte you cannot have stacks and your vigors( espically in the beginning) consume SO much salt. example. the second you run out you are restricted to your guns and have to often run from fights just to look around or wait for elizabeth to find some.This restricts you and ruines alot of potenial combat had.-guns are generic and uninteresing-no more visable upgrades on your guns like in bioshock 1 and 2-SO much lore is missing-enemys are bullet sponges near the end of the game-Irrational wanted to make columbia feel alive. but you cant talk to anyone unless they talk to you at scripted parts of the game.bad move-the ""steal"" mechanic is bad  as in when you first see the red letters in say a box in a bar in a back room with no one looking you think you can take it safely. the second you open it people start screaming and others attack you. pointless-WHERE ARE THE DAMN GEAR BOOTS-restricions. example: a nun in a airship will use a moltov to kill herself and destroy the airship your in. you know this. you open fire at her and guess what? divine intervention or some ♥♥♥♥ because the bullets go through her. The devoplers hold your hand at alot of parts in the game and the worst is you can tell.-you can only have 2 guns which really restricts combat variety unlie in 1 and 2 where you had 8 at once-combat more fps and not as fexiable as bioshock 1-guns lack kickVerdict 8/10Its a great game and i do recommend it and playing on hard as its a tough but staisfying modehowever you do need to pay a close attention to the dialouge as the story off the skyhooks.people need to look closer at the game and it doesnt deserve the 10/10 its been getting but does deserve every damn award it got at E3 as its a amazing game. you dont need to play the first 2 bioshock games to understand this one. however so much unseen potenial.

""Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt""  - A sentence heard in-game which you will be remember for a lifetime. Several years after Bioshock, Irrational Games and 2KGames coming up with a new game Bioshock Infinite. Want to read more about check inside...Before I start, I just want to say a few words. First off, the game lasted around 16 hours, that's with completing the story from the start to the ending credits. Besides that, in my review, I'll post the cons after I've put up my review of that section.Story:""Indebted to the wrong people, with his life on the line, veteran of the U.S. Cavalry and now hired gun, Booker DeWitt has only one opportunity to wipe his slate clean. He must rescue Elizabeth, a mysterious girl imprisoned since childhood and locked up in the flying city of Columbia. Forced to trust one another, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond during their daring escape. Together, they learn to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, as they fight on zeppelins in the clouds, along high-speed Sky-Lines, and down in the streets of Columbia, all while surviving the threats of the air-city and uncovering its dark secret.""The story itself is amazing, you get so immersed into the game it's unbelievable, making it impossible to stay off the game. As you step through the story, you get a real feel for the game, you start to see how American history is referenced (I won't say too much more as I don't want to spoil it for anybody).So yes you are Booker DeWitt, and you have to rescue a girl called Elizabeth. You enter a floating city called Columbia, which is living a lot, everywhere people are walking around and interacting with each other. Most of the times they say something which add some twists to the story you follow. As soon you find out what's wrong you will fight alot of enemies and hope you can find an answer for all your questions.Throughout the game, there are two factions, The Vox Populi and The Founders:The Vox Populi (Latin for ""Voice of the People""), are a militant underground insurgency group led primarily by revolutionary Daisy Fitzroy. They are in open conflict with Zachary Hale Comstock and The Founders, rejecting their puritanical and xenophobic ideology.The Founders are a major citizen faction and political party in the city of Columbia. Their name relates to the fact that they see themselves as the true founders of the city, and they attempt to model their ideals after the founding fathers of the United States. The party promotes ultra-nationalism, religious faith in the divinity of Father Comstock, jingoism, Militarism and extreme xenophobia, and is currently engaged at war with the anarcho-communist resistance group known as the Vox Populi.Both have there own story, decisions and things they believe in. Throughout the game you will learn more about both of them. I can tell you it will makes an interesting experience to know each story.Pros:- This game story left a me with a mend-bend.. :).Cons:- None.Gameplay:The gameplay in this game is very similar to the first Bioshock. However, there are some differences, which should be noticed by the average player along with the veteran players of this franchise. I love it myself, so I definitely noticed!1. Gear: Ingame you can find and collect Gear parts. Each gear part has some stats which change some gameplay things like more damage or faster sprint and more like that.2. Vigors: Remember the plasmids from Bioshock 1? Well now they are called Vigors, they do exact the same but only difference is that you need Salt for it instead of Eve. But these Vigors are awesome, you can let people fly in the air so you can do more damage to them before they hit you, or you can make an enemy your ally to fight with you for a specific amount of time.2. Sky-Hook: This is a melee weapon and means of transportation throughout Columbia on its Sky-Lines. This thing can also be used as a melee weapon so you can hit you enemy with it or you can press a button so it insta-kill your enemy which result in flying enemies or burning ones (depends on the gear you wear).3. Elizabeth: After you rescued here, she will help  you during the fights. So she can give you ammo and health. Beside the fights she will randomly walk in the area where you are and might ask you sometimes if you need some money or she tells you that there are some lockpicks there. Yes lockpicks, Elizabeth has a great lockpicking level, but like always its hard choice to lockpick or not.4. Weapons: Booker DeWitt has alot of weapons but the only downside of this is that you can only hold 2 of them instead of all like in the first Bioshock. (For more information about all weapons can be found here: http://bioshock.wikia.com/wiki/BioShock_Infinite_Weapons ). Every weapon has it's own up and downside effects, like limited ammo, more damage or lot of recoil. You will experience this on your own while playing.Bonus: Once you completed the game you are able to play the game again in the 1999 mode, so how you played your games when you were younger. This mode makes the enemies harder to defeat, you have no map or direction help and you get less money. Beside that there is another way to achieve the 1999 mode but from start, all you have to do is enter the konami code and you are done :D.Cons:- I could say that 2 weapons is one of the ""cons"", only it doesn't make a difference to the game, but I'll still leave a note here.Graphics:Where should I start, the first time you enter Columbia you will be amazed of what you see. It's absolutely gorgeous, the visuals are beautiful. The light shines through the windows, it gleams around the buildings. Honestly, this game is a dream with it's graphics, they're fantastic.The graphics, atmosphere and the visuals are just outstanding, they are so perfect. I'm not sure what to say more about this part of the game. It's like you walk into a dream story, you feel so immersed into the gameplay it's crazy. Great visuals make for some great sounds, too..For the people which are wondering, i ran all settings on High. This is not the highest setting, but listen: I tried very high and ultra, and I must say I couldn't see any difference else then how the water visuals were different anything else was just the same.Cons:- Can use a better variation of NPC faces (they look mostly all the same :().Sound:Well, what can I say about the sound? The voices, the music, they're all amazing, and they add that extra pop to an already great game. The youtube video below is an example of the in-game music, but I suggest you play the game to get a feel for it.Personal:Rating: 9/10Recommendation:This is really one-of-a-kind game you should have played. The graphics, atmosphere, story, visuals and the sound makes this game a adventure you won't easily forget. It doesn't really matter if you didn't played the first 2 bioshock games but still it would make some clue more understandable.Personally this is the GOTY 2013 for me, let me know what you think... or at least get this game and try it for yourself.Note: Season Pass will hit soon, this should give us 3 new expansions for Bioshock Infinite which should be alternate stories. Ken Levine has stated that you don't need to finish the game in order to play the upcoming expansions. NOTE: Old review i wrote for a website. I know the season pass is already available so don't worry ;). "

												Bioshock, the spiritual successor of system shock is built upon a series based around thrills, horrifying moments and atmosphere. While the games suffered from balancing issues and some poor design choices, they are quality horror games. Bioshock infinite however has stepped away from its predecessors leaning towards a very tense and story driven experience. Anyone attempting to play this game for horror, will find it sparsely sprinkled throughout the game, and very mild mannered at best. Overall I find this to be a great path to tread. The presentation is impeccable. The visuals are amazing. From flying vehicles to the skyrails and islands you will explore, there's never a dull area. There has been so much thought put into what you see, that areas didn't feel the same as each other. Even the enemies look wonderfull, the vigor animations are a treat to watch. A word of warning however, prepare yourself for the execution animations. I feel they are out of place, and downright gory compared to the rest of the game. After executing my second soldier, I had to stop myself as it is just too visceral for my tastes. The characters are amazing as well. It's as if they've figured out how to make a sidekick in a video game feel alive. Elizabeth is no damsel in distress. She will always be interacting, speaking with you and exploring the world. It will never be about following you, getting in your way or being generally useless. I came to really enjoy her presence, and as the game progressed I really wanted a good ending for her. All of this with the story being the highlight of the game. It has been a long time since a story has not held my hand. That while giving you clues as to what's going on, it never directly shouts it at you through a megaphone as if you are a fool. It is intelligent, enjoyable and throughouly worthwhile. How it tells itself through character interaction, sights and sound just floored me. If at all possible avoid spoiling this game for yourself. With all the good things I have said about this game, I hope you are still reading, as I'm about to explain what brings this game down. That is the gameplay. Bioshock infinite has a problem and that is, it's a game. A game that does not blend itself well with its story counterpart. There is an intensity presented in the game for your characters. You feel that they want to escape. You understand the pressure and intensity that they are going through right up until you enter any of the games many shooting segments. To get to the point, the soldier A.I is downright braindead. They lack any reasoning skills and are generally bullet magnets, and sponges to boot. The worst part is that they are the main force you will fight for the entire game. Unique enemies will present challenges and intensity from time to time, but they are too sparse to make up for it. There will be segments of up to an hour of slogging through fodder just to get a brief respite. A moment where you feel and can empathize with your characters plight, as you will be forced to move, run and fight for your life. Then it will return to being a mundane slugfest. The reason this problem exists is that there are several flaws inherent to the games mechanics. The vigors are poorly balanced with some outshining the others. There is little reason for variance as many of the vigors are just functionally irrelevant. Why throw a grenade when you can stun, increase damage dealt, reveal from cover and never miss. The guns as well just don't match up to each other in power. I found myself clearing the entire game without reason to drop my guns in favour of others for any situation. Ammunition is plentiful, there are vendors sprinkled throughout the majority of the game causing me to never want to remove a weapon. Possibly if you could equip more than two there would be incentive to swap. Between the enemies, the poor gun/vigor design and the enemy variety the game gets a very dragged feeling. I very rarely felt the intensity that my characters felt. Immersion was weakened for me due to the weakness of gameplay. I feel that poor design choices and lack of A.I for regular enemies really holds the game back. It could have been much better than it is. But that does not stop me from recommending this game. Yes, the combat is pretty dull, yes enemies are bullet sponges. The story makes up for this, and it is really something you should experience for yourself. I hope more stories in games are this interesting, with characters that feel so... real.			"

Through a gorgeous display of vivid graphics and masterful storytelling, Booker DeWitt, the main protagonist, takes us down an emotional journey. A journey of corruption, racial discrimination, profiling, and rebellion, all issues that remain heavily prevalent to this day.---------------------------------------------------------GameplayWhile serving as a reminder of one's own morals and character, BioShock Infinite also brings to light issues that go far beyond oneself. Set in a fictional steampunk state, Colombia began its humble beginnings as a trophy to the world: a display of pride and a world fair floating high in the skies upon blimps. What started off as an innocent display of such pride, though, quickly turned into an image of hatred and brutality. Going against the wishes of the American government, Colombia became a vicious state operating against the very people it swore to serve.As DeWitt, you will join forces with Elizabeth, a young woman full of extraordinary powers - of  which and whom the story revolves around. Explore each character and their history, while also utilising their unique abilities. Work your way into the very heart of the problem and unhinge it at its very core. Take down an organisation that supports and condones racism, elitism, segregation, and other significant issues that silently tear down the strongest of people.---------------------------------------------------------GraphicsThrough a quick Google search, you will find a huge list of awards that BioShock Infinite has received. Many of these can be attributed to its stellar storytelling and fascinating approach of real world issues, but also for its graphics. This game simply delivers the whole package. Not only are the graphics vibrant and sharp, they are eye popping, hogging (in that you won't know where to look), and just... stunning. There is no other way to describe the wonder of the world that is BioShock Infinite.---------------------------------------------------------AudioAnother aspect of BioShock Infinite that helps bolster its already brimming trophy case is the soundtrack and effects. Not only has some of the original tracks received recognition, but the audio just works so seamlessly with their scenes. Nothing is out of place and detail in the sound has been very well taken care of.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ TL;DR version: overall, a great FPS game+ Challenging to get all the achievements, yet only really requires a lot of time in order to do so+ Vast array of weapons that you can upgrade with skill points in order to ""evolve"" them to each situation+ Free game mode called ""1999"" which allows gamers to experience the difficulties of the game back in the day+ Audio and sound effects don't detract from the game; it is not annoying and definitely helps bring the game to life+ Various skill trees and characterisations make for interesting and unique gameplay (powers and dark magic, etc., that is)+ Great storytelling that is both engaging and exciting; it definitely makes you want to complete the game (and then some)+ The graphics are some of the best that I've seen for its day and age. Excellent job, Irrational Games and 2K Games+ The replayability value is, in my opinion, high. When you first complete the game, you will be left with an unsatisfied itch. Like most owners of this amazing title, I'm sure that you will pick up this game again just to relive it+ Characters are beautifully crafted in both design and complexity. Each of them have their own unique personalities and facial expressions that clash within the story, yet compliment it so well at the same time. In no other game will you find such developed and engaging characters as these. Every scene with them makes you crave to know about their history and background: why they are where they are. Ultimately, you want to get to know themNeutral± Pricey in that if you're a gamer who just likes to play through once, this game will be over too soon. If you play through multiple times just to immerse yourself more, then this is the game is definitely for you± Only one mode exists, and that is ""normal"". Those who are seeking more of a challenge, therefore, won't find it here. Likewise, the death system is not punishing enough and seems ""easy"" and unchallenging as compared to, say, BorderlandsCons- There is really only one issue that truly gets to me, and that is when Elizabeth glitches and gets in the way. It happens very rarely, but when it does, Elizabeth just decides to stop moving and it'll take every ounce of your being to not just waste all your bullets putting them in her face out of annoyance. As stated earlier, this is rare, so don't let it way to heavily on your decision of getting this game---------------------------------------------------------With the amount of issues that BioShock Infinite touches on (and isn't afraid to speak about), I'm surprised this game even exists. Despite all of its controversies, I believe that all gamer's should experience this game and try to understand the various lessons and meanings that it is trying to scream out. BioShock Infinite truly is the definition of a gaming masterpiece and I'm not surprised at all that it has been rated so postive by the community.With almost 53K recommendations, all I can say now is this... what are you waiting for?Overall9.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.			"

												Bioshock Infinite really sets a new high for first person shooters - fitting really, considering its set in Columbia, a floating metropolis above the clouds. With Infinite, original Bioshock developer Irrational has changed the game, they have not attempted to transport the gunplay and atmosphere of a city at the bottom of the sea to one that literally floats to the heavens, and while there are some call-backs to the first game and both are indeed first person shooters, Bioshock Infinite is a fresh experience once again delivered in a stunning original world whose first moments may just illicit the same awe we all got on our first view of the failed utopia of Rapture.Irrational Games is known as a genuine outlier to predictability. It creates worlds that gamers will want to explore, from the destroyed capitalist freedom that was crushed under its own economic weight (Bioshock) to the claustrophobic fear of an over-run starship (System Shock 2), and with Infinite, Irrational has developed Columbia, a promised land, where, once again, not everything is as it seems.Columbia feels very much like a place that at one point may have existed. It is the vision of a zealous ultra-nationalistic leader who sees himself as the prophet for a new era in American exceptionalism. With its own history, hierarchy, and propaganda filling the city's streets, children playing on sidewalks and the constant views to the clouds, Bioshock Infinite paints a very different picture and atmosphere to that of its predecessors, but this fantastical world feels alive and genuine - and one you'll happily delve into.The world painted by Infinite is all the more believable due to its amazing cast of characters, chief among these being Elizabeth, the character for whom the game's story is set in motion. As war veteran turned private inspector Booker DeWitt your objective is to infiltrate the city and kidnap the ""girl"" in order to ""wipe away the debt"". The first hour spent in his shoes gives only the barest hints of his mysterious character, and he is clearly not a virtuous man, though this isn't a weakness in the game's desire to coax you into his backstory.Booker's backstory and his character are filled out by Elizabeth, who early in the title you are able to break free from her captors before the city turns against you. She rarely leaves your side, even in a firefight, and while she's not one to grab a rifle and start blasting away, she will throw you ammo and health as needed, coin when it's safe, and even use her powers of manipulating time and space to allow for some truly fiendish and clever gameplay.Elizabeth is an amazing character, up there with Alex of Half Life 2 and Tali Zorah Nar'Rayya of Mass Effect. She is a companion you will truly grow to love over the course of the game. During idle moments, she may speak her thoughts about your recent actions or what she sees in the world. Elizabeth is a fully fleshed out character that few games ever truly aspire too, and Infinite is all the better for it. Her presence is a departure from the previous titles in which you travelled alone, and she greatly contributes to the game's emotional depth and your character's motivation.Her captor, the zealous antagonist Zachary Comstock, is a great villain in that he is seen as a prophet by his followers and is reprehensible in the eyes of the player. He has a level of evil that permeates the entire game, with his followers drawn to his stirring ideals and manipulation of the game’s events. Those you will be fighting throughout the game are somewhat more comical; George Washington Patriot robots, three metre tall human cyborg handymen, cops, security men and various citizens. There are many variations on these few enemies, though none feel as developed or as interesting as the various splicers from the previous Bioshock titles.Accepting that, Infinite’s Songbird feels only slightly more developed than the Big Sister character of Bioshock 2. Awe-inspiring and a little chilling at first sight, but whenever he shows up the game kicks into high-gear with some thrilling chase sequences. It’s a shame he doesn’t live up to his premise as Elizabeth’s keeper, though he does play a crucial role in how the story is set up.As with the original Bioshock, your shooting prowess is augmented by a power system, in this case, vigors, which can bolster your offence with electricity zaps or fireballs, among others. They each can be powered up with tonics found throughout the game, and they also have secondary fire capabilities, usually as traps for unsuspecting enemies. With one hand dedicated to firing at enemies and another for using various powers, there’s a wide variety to how any various encounter may play out. And in addition, Elizabeth can use her powers to bring extra guns, health packs, cover and turrets into the world, providing another layer of strategy to firefights.Bioshock Infinite’s story doesn’t end when you “get the girl” to “clear away the debt”, and much like the original Bioshock, doors are closed off to you to exit areas until you complete an objective in the current zone. This could feel infuriating, yet I was never angered to explore Columbia some more, and the story does take a few turns you might not expect. If you are expecting a mid-game twist like that in the original title you will be happy to hear that Infinite has one as well, and it’s a doozy. I know I didn’t expect it and it comes out of left field, though on careful replays there has been some build-up I overlooked. And at the satisfying conclusion of the title, some fifteen hours or so after start (it’s a little shorter than that, but I definitely lingered in some areas), you will definitely want to talk about what just transpired, like all good movies wish to accomplish.Before release, I had to question whether Irrational Games could hit the extremely high expectations of gamers again. Overall, I believe they have delivered. Infinite is a remarkable game that offers a distinct experience in a new signature world as every bit as satisfying as our first ventures into Rapture. Infinite is a brilliant shooter and stands out in a ‘me-too’ market, providing satisfying gunplay, some great characters and some amazing innovations in its world, atmosphere and storytelling. Highly recommended, and I suggest purchasing it, would you kindly?9.2/10			"

												This game is a masterpiece of art and also a masterpiece of science fiction. I played it back in 2013 when it just came out and i had a lot of complaints about the gameplay and combat but it was still my favorite game of the year for its amazing idea and story. Game is inspired from Early 20th century America and Quantum Mechanics. Its about how in a situation of different possibilities none of the possibility goes unrealized. Every possibility takes place in Multiverse. It will surely leave you a little dissatisfied in the end because of the same idea it follows as it does it in a dramatic way. But its a must play game for anybody who admire art and also love science fiction. "

												Bioshock Infinite is a delight of a game and a perfect addition to the trilogy, but it's nothing new or anything that hasn't be done before. That said, Infinite is a finitely good game and excels in every department of its classifications. It quite simply does that bit more other AAA titles don’t do by being innovative, clever and ultimately cool. The combination of art style and accelerated gun battles are both elevated on the shoulders of a fascinating story that keeps you playing onto the next chapter scene after scene is a testament to title. Keeping the player not only interested but keen to know more and seek a thrilling conclusion to the epic franchise. Get Bioshock on sale and experience arguably the best title of the 3 for a fraction of the price, a worthy game both on & off sale, however I recommend playing both 1 & 2 first if you did not already.

												BioShock Infinite has you play as Booker, on a quest to Columbia, a flying city in the sky.I don't want to go into the plot too much as it's very interesting to discover yourself. So, on to the review.Infinite was a great game. Very Bioshocky, very fun. It is not a 10/10 game. This is hype. I'm sorry, but it just is not. It's an incredibly well made game with interesting plot and game mechanics and twists, but I expected more out of the reviews provided. 8/10 on a realistic chart, even 9/10 at a stretch. But not 10. It has no ""flaws"", just some missed opportunities, a little bit of a lack of fleshing out the narrative fully. A recommendation from me most definitely. I completed the game in 14 hours, playing on Hard, completing 34/37 Sightseeing and 75/80 Voxophones (which is maybe 95% completion?).Hope you enjoy it as much as I did!Nilesy			"

												This game is pretty good. With an interesting storyline, an elaborated characters concept, awesome graphsims and a nice gameplay, this game can really distract you during hours. I got to say that the weapons choice is good-enough to make you specialize into your favorite game style. However, sometimes the ""fighting phases"" are not-so-pleasant like the Handymen or the ""Special-boss-that-I-will-not-say-the-name-because-I-don't-want-to-spoil-the-storyline-to-others-players"". Those bosses are the definition of rushing toward them and flee them at the same time. The difficulty is perfectly balanced on this game.

												I am impressed. Impressed by The City in the Sky. After finishing Bioshock and Bioshock 2 I thought nothing can ever compete with the world of Rapture. But then I walked in the streets of Columbia for the first time and it was so peaceful, so beautiful, so incredibly atmospheric.""There's always a lighthouse. There's always a man. There's always a city.."" But still.. these two worlds are so different. In Rapture you were stuck in small rooms with very limited ways to escape. It had its own charm. Columbia is just the opposite. It has many big open areas with the possibility to move fast around by attaching sky-hooks to the city's main transport system Sky-Line.Bioshock Infinite story is, without doubt, one of the best ever made for a game. It tells you the story by showing you things. Do not expect any direct explanation. This part is on you to find out what just really happened.. To put all the pieces together and try to understand.. Fortunately some people already made their explanation and interpretation of this very complicated story and that helps players like me to understand a bit better. And of course it opens more question for discussions.I have to admit I liked the combat system in previous Bioshocks a bit more. The biggest issue I had was that Bioshock Infinite allowed me to carry only two weapons. Sometimes I felt like I was stuck with what I found around. Upgrading certain weapons didn't feel very satisfying in the end. I never used them as much as I would like to. I was very frequently unsure if I should pick up different weapons around or not, because you never know what will you be facing behind the next corner.Here comes another But. You can't save your progress in the game. You have to wait for autosave. I understand their intention but it can become a bit annoying when you have to stop playing and next time you can't simply continue from where you were before.I chose hard difficulty level and it was both, enjoyable and challenging. Despite some of my complaints the fights were still very decent.To be honest all the negative things I experienced were washed away by the impressive graphics and story. I took some time away from the game before writing this review. My mind was struck and paralyzed by the very emotional and confusing ending.The good feelings still persist. I must recommend this game and then I must continue with the DLCs :)			"

												What a game...GameplayThe gameplay in Bioshock Infinite is both creative, immersive and perfectly fluent. I was a bit skeptic about the skyline feature of the game at first, but it turned out to be greatly implemented with the game's world. Some say that the game is a bit repetitive; and I won't deny that at one point, I was wondering whether the enemy killing would ever end. But personally, it felt way less forced than most games I've played. When you encounter enemies, there's always a reason or an explanation. You won't get attacked by random enemies at random times for random reasons. For once, it actually follows the plot line.The game features a decently nice selection of weapons and upgrades, which is obviously, always a plus in any shooting game.WARNING: Slight spoiler ahead.The ""vigors"" add a really nice touch to keep the game from being boring, along with the ability to get Elizabeth to open ""tears"" to help you along the way, which really gives you the opportunity to try different tactics to fight enemies.Elizabeth will also sometimes throw you some supplies as you run out, so being out of ammo or ""salts"" during a gunfight is not very likely to happen, as long as you don't abuse Elizabeth's powers.The characters development is truly one of the strongest point of this game. Elizabeth and the Lutece twins are the most unforgettable characters in Bioshock Infinite in my opinion.StorylineAw yes, the best part of playing this game.The storyline in Bioshock Infinite truly sent me on a feels trip. I felt wonder, curiosity, happiness, denial, unbelief, and even a bit of sadness right through the whole game. Never at one moment, did I not stop thinking: ""Why?"" ""Who?"" ""How?""The game's world kept me entertained with all its great wonders, while still keeping me clinging to the plot line until the end.WARNING: Slight spoiler ahead.The ending is probably the most memorable one I have seen in any games. The only thing that was a bit of a downer about it, is the fact that they fling at you the whole explanation in a few minutes, triggering much confusion, and leaving you with a feeling of ""...what?""The ending is rather complicated, and I even went and read an article explaining the ending after finishing the game, to truly understand a few minor points I had missed through the story. I ended up thinking about the game for two days straight to finally put all the puzzle pieces together. Overall, it makes much more sense than I initially thought.WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD!!! If you haven't played the game yet, DO NOT read beyond this point.I felt the story ended a bit abruptly. When I realized what was happening, that in order to break the cycle, the Booker from this universe HAD to die, I also realized that Booker DeWitt, along with Elizabeth, Comstock, and all of Columbia would no longer ever exist as they are. Without Comstock, Elizabeth would never have been who she is, and Columbia wouldn't have existed in this universe either. It felt as if after going all of what you did, all of this had been pointless, yet very necessary to break the cycle. The other versions of themselves would never know that without them, the cycle would have gone on and on. Booker and Elizabeth would now live, but in an entirely different world.The post-credits scene was interesting as well. We see Booker sitting in his office, hearing a baby and suddenly getting up and calling ""Anna"" and asking if it's her. Somehow, it seems that this version of Booker slightly remembers what his other version went through, thus he doesn't believe Anna to be there. We'll never know if this theory is true or false though, since the game ends there.Overall, the game was truly memorable in every way. I really enjoyed it. I wish most games would have such an immersive story as well.			"

												Bring us the girl, wipe away the debt.....BioShock Infinite is arguably one of the best games of the year. It is the third game in the BioShock franchise and you don't need to have played the first two to enjoy this one ^_^You play as Booker DeWitt, an ex-Pinkerton agent, who was instructed to bring a girl and wipe away his debt... join him as he unfolds the mystery that lies inside Columbia.       The story is the strongest point of the game. No doubt, it has one of the best stories ever.... rivaling novels and such. The game starts off very confusing, but explains everything as you go. Honestly, I had to pause the game multiple times just to take in what happened. I also had multiple ""Holy Sh*t"" moments because of the wonderfully executed story-telling and all it's unexpected twists and turns :) It's just beautiful..... gave me goosebumps :3       The visuals of the game is very colorful and bright but somehow very eerie and unsettling...... I love it :D Somehow it feels repetetive, but pretty nonetheless :3The AI of Elizabeth feels so alive, she isn't dull and she will keep herself occupied if she gets bored. The music just blends with the atmosphere so flawlessly that it feels natural e.g. a bad rendition of Nocturne will be playing in the slums of the city while a beautiful orchestral piece will play in the higher class. The stunning music and artwork of this game will transport you to the world of BioShock Infinite.      The gameplay is an FPS with RPG elements put into it. You wield a weapon in one hand and a Vigor in another, experiment with them all to find out what best suits your playing style ^^ At first, I thought fighting while using the Sky Lines would be confusing, but it surprisingly isn't :D You do have to familiarize yourself with the battleground as the combat in this game can get intense.Overall Experience: I love this game so much, it's the story and atmosphere that really got to me. It's a masterpiece and it deserves the praise it got. Although the game stutters at times, it's not enough to ruin the experience. I highly recommend this game ^_^ It's an experience that you shouldn't miss.....			"

-Quick Review-Bioshock Infinite is a first person shooter with an excellent story, fast paced game play, varying challenges, and dynamic character upgrades that help keep the game fresh and going. This game will easily make it on my favorite games list, and the leader in its genre. -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  Have you ever completed a game and can’t remember any of the characters names? I think this is a common problem we all have, and game designers try their hardest to make sure you remember their protagonist.In Bioshock Infinite you will never forget the names “Booker DeWitt”, “Elizabeth”, or “Father Comstock”. Why? You may ask; it’s because these characters are fascinating, you’re drawn into the spiraling story and floating city that is “Columbia”.I won’t give away any important plot details, just know that each time I thought I understood where the story was going, it was changed and reversed leaving me astonished and eager to learn what would happen next.Game Play: Unlike the past two Bioshock games, this game limits you to using two weapons and two Vigors (aka, your: Force Powers / Mana / Plasmids) . I preferred this mechanic because it simplified the controls and made you plan which devices suited your strategy.There are two other elements to talk about regarding game play: transportation, and clothes. In this game you get to use a special tool that lets you zip along rail lines, which I must admit still hasn’t gotten old for me. Instead of having gene tonics (DNA adjustments that gave you special abilities and strengths) you have clothes which do the same. Achievements: Bioshock Infinite has a total of 80 achievements, about half of these are earned in the main game, the rest are from DLC. Regarding the achievement types; they’re what you would expect, story achievements, killing enemies with certain guns, killing enemies certain styles, collecting all the voice recordings, find all the things, and beating the game on the hardest difficulty.Price: Bioshock Infinite is  $29.99. At the time I’m writing this review, I’ve put in 18.5 hours; on my first play through I played very thoroughly (I was only missing 1 voxiphone/Voice-recordings at the end *cries*) I think this is a fair price for the amount of time I spent playing, as always I suggest you purchase the game on sale or from a humble bundle. Conclusion: Many people have asked me to compare Bioshock 1, 2, and infinite. What I said is that they’re all extremely good games, but for infinite you don’t need to play the first and second game because it’s a completely different setting.Naturally the game feels more new, but that shouldn’t undermine the fact that the whole Bioshock series has raised the bar, and up to this point Bioshock infinite is the most worthy successor yet. One can only wonder what might be to come next?I’m Atratzu, and I highly recommend this game.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update April 10, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for BioshockHere's the URL to see my review for Bioshock 2 "

 A refreshing take on the Bioshock franchise Title: Bioshock InfiniteGenre: Steampunk, FPS, StorydrivenDeveloper: Irrational gamesPublisher: 2K games The Story: You play as Booker Dewitt a man who got the job to bring a girl to certain people to get released from his debt. ''Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt' Its all a bit vague at the beginning but as the story progresses you will see what it was all about in the beginning. Next to all this, when you travel to the cloud city of colombia people recognize you as some sort of antichrist and they are all gunning for your head. On colombia there is racism and hatred going around plenty. You have to choose a side. You come across Elizabeth the girl you need to save early on in the game. But she is being held hostage in a tower guarded by a giant birdlike creature with the name Songbird. Well you can find the rest out for yourself. to keep it short. the story is good. A bit predictable but with enough twists to keep you guessing whats really happening till the end. Storywise this game has its plottwists but it is well voiceacted and carried out great so im not complaining.  Gameplay: This is a first person shooter. You can play trough the game in 10 hours or so if you ignore everything around you and go straight for the story. People like me take a bit longer because im trying to collect every damn thing there is to collect. (which I failed to do too lol). The gun handling is okay I guess but what stands out the most are the vigors. you can create traps and lure your enemy into them, you can lauch enemies into the air, push them away and set them on fire. It was fun finding good combinations with the vigors to devastate your enemies. The variety in weapons was not that great. You have  like 10-12 weapons in 2 different variations. But they basically do the same, the only thing that differs are the names. But I didn't mind that. I just chose the 2 weapons I enjoyed the most playing with. And kept those for the rest of my playtrough.Also there are a couple of enemy types you will encounter on your trip to Colombia. They offer enough variety in gameplay. You will have to adapt to the enemies that are thrown at you. The hardest gamemode was a more of a challange than the rest. It keeps you on the edge of your seat so to speak.*SPOILERWARNING* As it turns out her father Comstock locked Elizabeth up in that tower to contain her. Elzabeth is a gifted girl who can open 'tears' to other places and worlds. Prophet Comstock thinks you are the Antichrist. As it turns out you are actually Comstock but from another world or something.  Yeah its all kind of messed up in Colombia but it was a fun rollercoaster in the end. Conclusion & Final verdict Should you buy this game? IMO yes. if you love a entertaining story with enough twists and turns, some good gameplay and great voiceacting you will surely enjoy this game. Its not at all like the 2 other bioshock games. If you want that rapture thing back, well its not really here. You should get the 2 DLC packs for this game. Its a refreshing take on this franchise and after all I had a blast playing trough this game.  Its all I wanted and expected out of a game like this and therefore my final verdict for Bioshock Infinite is a great 9/10  Do I recommend this? If it wasnt clear for you yet, do yourself a favour and buy this already. Want more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

												Bioshock Infinite is a game by Irrational Studios and 2K Games which plays as a First Person Shooter with intwined game mechanics. Bioshock Infinite is easily my second favorite game of all time. From the breath taking artwork to the tear-jerking storyline there are few games that can compare to the masterpiece known as Infinite. The game itself plays unlike it's predecessors Bioshock and Bioshock 2: Sea of Dreams. Bioshock: Infinite takes place in an alternate dimension (as well as time) from the universe of Rapture, where the other two games were set. Infinite takes place in the city of Columbia primarily during the year 1912 (and other places/times as the story progresses). The game lasts 5-8 hours on average.Main Storyline:The main story follows the point of view of Booker DeWitt as he searches for the elusive Elizabeth Comstock. His goal is to bring her back to New York in order to pay off a debt he owes, accumulated through excessive gambling, Booker is an ex-soldier of the military which was heavily involved with war crimes during both the Boxer Rebellion and the Battle of Wounded Knee, His actions led him to feel remorse and soul-crushing guilt for the rest of his life. His one joy, his daughter Anna DeWitt, was lost when he was forced to sell her to help repay his debts. In the game he meets Elizabeth and together they discover the secrets of Columbia and take on the prophet, Zachary Hale Comstock.The game is told from Booker's POV. Most of the game he is accompanied by Elizabeth however it does not play like an escort mission. Elizabeth can fend for herself and supplies Booker with tears, ammo, money, salts and health. Booker can carry two weapons at a time (excluding the SkyHook he uses for melee) and is able to use all 8 vigors once they are found or purchased. Booker's shield is regenerated when not attacked for a set period of time however health can only be regenerated through items or vending machines. Salts fuel vigors as Eve fueled plasmids and salts can be found throughout the game.Clash in the Clouds:Clash in the Clouds is a wave by wave survival and elimination type of DLC that was added to the game. The DLC is non-canon to the main storyline however once one completes the Museum Curator achievement they will find an interesting reference to the Bioshock series. The Clash in the Clouds DLC contains four maps, each with 15 waves. The maps become increasingly difficult as the waves progress. The money system in Clash in the Clouds is untied to the main story and one may purchase museum items as well as upgrades for the DLC exclusively.Burial at Sea Ep. 1 (Spoilers):Burial at Sea Episode 1 is canon to the main storyline and yet at the same time is almost entirely detached. In Burial at Sea Episode 1 the player takes control of Booker once more however in this universe, the setting is in Pre-fall Rapture. Christmas Eve. The plot follows this version of Booker searching for a young girl named Sally who Booker seems to believe is like his daughter. An older and more mysterious Elizabeth (whom this Booker does not recognize) leads him out of Ryan's Rapture and into the ruins of Fontaine's Futuristics (hundreds of leagues below Rapture). In this ruin, Booker and Elizabeth search for Sally and eventually lure her out of the ducts she is hiding in. To this Booker's dismay, Sally is a little sister and she calls upon a Big Daddy to protect her. Booker defeats this Big Daddy but soon realizes that he is not who he believes. He witnesses a flashback to his past where he understands that he is in fact, Zachary Hale Comstock. This version of Comstock fled Columbia after cutting off Elizabeth's head in a struggle with the Booker he stole the baby Elizabeth from. The guilt drives him to Rapture where he restarts his life and forgets his past as Comstock. Once the older Elizabeth learns the truth she allows a second Big Daddy to murder him from behind.The game plays very similarily to the Bioshock Infinite main storyline and the player is introduced to two new vigors/plasmids (Old Man Winter which is similar to Winter Blast and Radar Range which microwaves enemies). The DLC itself is fairly short however it is more eerie and closer to the first Bioshock game in terms of atmosphere. Ambient noise and splicers make the game reminiscent of it's first predecessor. While short, the DLC is highly recommended and provides a rough 2-3 hours of enjoyable gameplay.Burial at Sea Ep. 2 (Spoilers):The second installment of the Burial at Sea DLC is far more storyline intensive and plays almost entirely differently from all the Bioshock games. Burial at Sea Ep. 2 differs in the fact that the player assumes control of Elizabeth (the one that enteres Rapture after the Elizabeth whom accompanies Comstock in the first part of the DLC). This Elizabeth is originally care free in France and is able to fully control her abilities. However, the guilt of allowing Sally to be taken to Rapture and turned into a little sister is enough to convince Elizabeth to find Sally in rapture. This Elizabeth arrives to find that the journey into a universe where one of her alternate selves is dead collapses her ability to create tears. Now entirely succeptible to the dangers of the world and unable to use tears to see the future, Elizabeth must rely on flashbacks and an imaginary Booker to save Sally.Elizabeth first discovers her alternate self, murdered by the second Big Daddy who arrived to finish off Comstock (see Burial at Sea Ep. 1 Notes). She then moves to strike a deal with Atlas (or Frank Fontaine) in exchange for Sally. Fontaine noting the worth of Little Sisters in Rapture, agrees to release Sally if Elizabeth can bring Fontaine Futuristics back up to Rapture. Elizabeth agrees and journeys alone (with the exception of her imaginary Booker) throughout Rapture to find a way to move Fontaine Futuristics. She winds up in Suchong's lab and strikes a deal with the scientist. She promises Suchong a hair strand (not knowing it is her alternate self's hair) that he desires in exchange for use of his machine which fabricates tears. Elizabeth travels to Columbia during the Vox rebellion where she realizes that the Luteces coerced Daisy Fitzroy into playing her role as the evil leader whom Elizabeth must murder to mature into a woman. She also learns of Songbird's imprinting process as she searches for the hair (after retrieving the Lutece particle which would rise Fontaine Futuristics to Rapture's level). She describes the process as ""The Lion with a thorn in it's paw"". Jeremiah Fink leaves Songbird in a near-death state with only Elizabeth around. After a young Elizabeth saves Songbird's life, it imprints on her thus beginning Elizabeth's estranged relationship with the creature. Suchong wishes to use Fink's plan in order to get the Big Daddy's to imprint on the Little Sisters whom they are designated to protect. When Elizabeth returns to Rapture she is confronted by Ryan whose forces she defeats. Elizabeth raises Fontaine's building to Rapture's level where he betrays her and begins his assault on Ryan after he knocks Elizabeth out. Two weeks later, Elizabeth comes to and sees Frank Fontaine on the losing end of the war. Desperate for a victory, he interrogates Elizabeth about the ""Ace in the Hole"". Eventually saved by a past memory, she barters for Sally and her own life once more and finds the ""Ace in the Hole"" in Suchongs lab. Expecting the betrayal, Fontaine kills Elizabeth with a wrench and as Elizabeth lays dying, she witnesses a future where Sally is saved by Jack. Elizabeth dies smiling with Sally by her side.The game is heavily stealth-based and provides 4-5 hours of gameplay. This DLC is HIGHLY recommended for all players. This DLC is more difficult than any other Bioshock game or DLC and the 1998 mode is more than a light challenge. Take the DLC slow and pay attention to various Easter Eggs related to the series's storyline.			"

												I have just finished this game about 10 minutes before this review was made. I must say I REGRET not playing this game when it first came out and only touch the game just now.People say the game is overrated but this is a game where you must play and finish to understand the beauty of the stroyline. The storyline and the lore is without doubt, imo, the greatest there is. The plot might seem complicated and hard to understand at first but when you continue to play and story is slowly being reveal, you would be stuck wanting to know more. It's like you're waiting for the next episode of a show or a movie just when things about to reach it's peak, you can't stop.The game's atmosphere really is enjoyable. The music, background and scene fit well in every scenario. Gameplay is unique from other FPS and I quite enjoy it. Some character in the game have me emotional involved. This game is a MUST have for every gamer as it is one of the best story telling WITH ACTION GAMEPLAY. The story itself would be on par with Telltales's games but there is more action for you to do. If you want to get the game, you'll be playing for the story but the gameplay itself is amazing.11/10, it's so good I bought Bioshock series pack for all my best friends.P.S It's not just a game, It's an experience  "

												Wow what a game... where should i start?Story was absolutely pure gold and it was one of the best what i have ever played. Okay, i need to admit that ending was a little bit disappointing to me but it was fine for me at the end.Gameplay was pretty normal like in other shooter games. Shoot and run system with some magical skills and tactical defense system. But gameplay was made pretty nicely so it was awesome still to play. Weapons were fun and easy to play.Design and artwork is one of the best what i have seen in my gaming life. Style how the graphics were made was so detailed and floating islands with unique people and wonderful soundtrack nailed for me!Game had stuff to collect and they were challenging to find but it was always rewarding to find them.Graphics are stunning, so you cant play this with old school computer. I played with low end laptop with 1280x720 resolution with medium graphics... but it was still beautiful and awesome to play!Summary: Storybased game with good gameplay and stunning graphics, must buy to people who loves to play and watch good stories.8.5/10!

												BioShock Infinite is the third entry in the BioShock series, notably taking place outside of the underwater city of Rapture and heading to the skies to a flying city known as Columbia. Columbia is set in the early 1900s, and the sort of themes you'd expect with that time period come-up as well. The early innovative machine craze, racism, sexism, a city divided by the rich and the poor, among many other themes. While these themes are explored, unfortunately most feel like they become rather underutilized for the last third of the game as the main story sort of kicks in.We follow a man named Booker DeWitt, who's come to Columbia to wipe away the debt. He has to capture a girl named Elizabeth, who we quickly figure out is some kind of icon for the city. She is guarded in a very Statue of Liberty-type structure, and has a giant colossal bird guardian known as the Songbird. And upon her rescue, we quickly find out why she is so precious to this town... She has the ability to open up tears in reality, which break the rules of time and space and go into other time periods and alternate dimensions.BioShock Infinite is a weird game for me. I both loved it, and didn't at the same time. Maybe a more appropriate way to word this is that I loved parts of it, and other parts didn't quite do it for me. I feel the game was maybe plagued by having way too many ideas, that many of them end up feeling kind of underutilized. And meanwhile other elements feel like they get too much attention and focus.The game is insanely pretty and visually impressed me time and time again to the climax. It doesn't look particularly realistic, but has an artistic and colorful charm, with some fantastic lighting effects, that really bring the world of Columbia alive. This is backed by excellent attention to detail, there is a bunch of small things in the environments that really make the whole location feel believable, if not fantasy-esque. The setting really did it for me, while it's maybe not as well realized or atmospheric as the forefather city of Rapture, it has charms that may strike high with those with a love of early 1900s aesthetics, gardens, and steampunk charm. The characters are also well-designed and expressive.The music in the game is rather well done too. The soundtrack supports each scene, and audio is utilized well in the environment. A few songs one might recognize also creep their way into the game, with some spun into early 1900s versions of themselves. With classic-style renditions of Girls Just Want To Have Fun and Everybody Wants to Rule the World, who can complain?Voicing is also really well handled. While a few actors can be noted on who they are on the spot (such as our everyman voice of Booker, voiced by none other than Troy Baker, though I think most gamers who play the game will know), but they do good on delivery, emotion, and sounding natural.This game is probably too action-focused for it's own good, especially in the last third of the game. Up until that point, I did find the combat to be enjoyable, adrenaline-pumping, and well spaced out with other elements. But to the last third, combat becomes far more frequent and honestly overstayed its welcome. And this honestly is probably the single biggest sin the game commits, as it threatens to ruin the otherwise fantastic endgame the game provides, and may make many too frustrated or just bored of tedium to really enjoy the things around them.I feel BioShock Infinite is at its best when it's not composed of action corridors and shoot-out sequences. And there thankfully is a lot of that here too. There's a lot of things off the beaten path to indulge yourself in. Areas to explore for the sake of exploration, little side distraction, secret scenes you can trigger, things to interact with... I think I enjoyed the game most in downtime to explore the vibrant world of Columbia. It's an element one could skip over the entire game, but I honestly think they'd be robbing themselves of some of the best moments and enjoyable qualities that Infinite holds.And when BioShock Infinite is good, it's really good. If you happen to be a person who loves exploring, world-building, and just getting into the atmosphere of a game and taking everything in, Infinite has moments like this in spades, and the title may be worth experiencing alone for this purpose. It's littered with interesting sights, moments, and memorabilia. And the game isn't super short, it should take someone between 10-25 hours to complete it (the time varies so greatly because of all of this optional content one can either partake in or not, I personally was around the 22-hour mark).But then certain elements feel so underutilized it's honestly disappointing, or certain things feel like they could of been spaced out more. The Songbird's role becomes rather lackluster unfortunately and hardly lives up to the promise such a beast holds. Certain story threads are delved into, but still feel underutilized, especially as so many are dropped so easily, leading to a lot of themes and plot threads feeling non-conclusive, or really just there to be there. The rail segments, where you can hop and ride on rails, are interesting and appropriately adrenaline-fueled, but in the end are shifted over to hardly more than a distraction or a method to one-hit kill enemies. And then even possibilities the game brings up, both in narrative and mechanics, feels like they remain underutilized as well.And I think that's why the combat feels even more tedious towards the end. Because the game seems to want to deny itself delving into the really fantastical and instead rest on what we've seen a lot of in the last few years, a first-person shooter. It's not a bad first-person shooter, but it feels like it was too scared these other more interesting elements would bore some action-craving crowd and drags us back reluctantly to remind us that's the core game here.But I'd still say BioShock Infinite is worth experiencing. While unfortunately the whole is not as great as it could be, the sums of its parts hold absolute brilliance and are definitely worth experiencing. And the climax and finale, while what I expect many won't see coming, are deliciously... Well, that'd be telling.BioShock Infinite is pretty, backed with fantastic atmosphere, world-building, and more brilliant moments that most any other game could envy. But it's because of these moments the tedium of the game, especially as a first-person shooter, really stands out and starts to grate on the player. It's still worth experiencing though, even if it provides both the antidote to what's wrong with FPS in this day and age, and the poison.			"

												Infinite's world is mind-blowing. The graphics are excellent, the city, story, and enemies are creative, and Elizabeth is a great female character. It is incredibly fun to zip around on the cargo rails, watch different factions attack each other, fight off enemy airships, and just explore the city Irrational Games has created.Unfortunately, Infinite is plagued with repetition. For the majority of the game, you must basically kill everything that moves, loot, get ambushed or creep up to a new area of enemies, and repeat. In addition, the gameplay itself is repetitive; while the gunplay is great, there is a seriously limited selection of guns, and while some of the magic abilities are useful, most are virtually useless. The game will also make you fight the same bosses over and over, and you will find yourself saying ""Again?"" throughout. You may also find yourself becoming frustrated like I did during the graveyard scene (or other scenes), but I just turned the difficulty down to Easy and it was manageable.Thankfully, Elizabeth proves to be an awesome companion and really changes up what would otherwise be an average game. You can tell her to create a first-aid supply station during battle, direct her to spawn a aircraft to shoot missles at enemies, and even change the world completely. If it were not for her, it would be easy to lose interest in the game, but Elizabeth and her story were what motivated me to play to the end. Although it has some flaws, exploring the city with Elizabeth is an amazing experience, and so I think Infinite is above average and is worthy of your time.     "

Bioshock Infinite continues the series tradition of thrusting players into a dystopia lead by an meglomaniac guided by a specific philosophy or vision. Comstock, Infinite's equivalent to Andrew Ryan, is a religious zealot and Nationalist whose vision of an jingoistic, WASPy industrialized society suspended in the clouds away from the impurities of those treading upon soil is realized when a couple of brilliant physicsts deliver a technology that allows him to construct his city among the heavens dubbed Columbia. Comstock has his daughter, Elizabeth, held captive in a tower in Columbia, guarded by a large mechanical flying creature known as The Songbird. Elizabeth is no ordinary girl, she is giften with the ability to open tears in space time. Enter your character Booker DeWitt, a Private Eye who has fallen on hard times due to his alcohol and gambling problems. He is offered the chance to wipe away his debts and start fresh if he can rescue Elizabeth. Little does he know, his journey to rescue the girl and wipe away his debt will be one of self discovery as he confronts his past.Infinite, grafts the gameplay of the previous entries onto it's turn of the century setting, mixing gunplay with vigors (the same thing as plasmids) with various enemy types. While the game offers much in the way of variety with a dozen weapons and a handful of diverse vigors, it never forces players to use one over the other. It's a missed opportunity to introduce some much needed challenge to the gameplay as it's just as easy to blow gaping holes in emeies with the formidable firearms that make up the game's arsenal as it is to deplete your salts (the game's magic power) in order to execute your foes in a flashy manner. New to Columbia are sky rails that allow Booker to travel through the air, adding some verticality to the proceedings. high flying aerial duels can be thrilling at first but often you will fail to notice the rails overhead until after your foes have been slain. Combat is certainly not Infinite's strong suit despite the numerous options it provides.Where Infinite is nigh peerless is it's art direction and the way in which is delivers it's narrative. The world of Columbia looks as if colonial Annapolis or Philadelphia as been hoised into the air. The brick buildings and cobblestone streets create and idealic atmosphere that masks the darkness of racism and industrial exploitation that loom out of sight and out of mind of the bourgeoisie of Columbia. The city is bathed in the warmest orange glow and decorated in vibrant colors that make the game stand in start contrast to anything else on the market. Infinite is also littered with propaganda posters and almost every district and area has a story of it's own to tell--reflecting the lives and mindset of the denizens of Columbia. Stong visual motifs are also employed creating several powerful moments even when the game's narrative suffers from errors in logic. Bioshock Infinite offers one of the most beautiful and memorible worlds in gaming. The Burial at Sea DLC expands upon the links between Rapture and Columbia, offering a touch of fan service with a seriously fulfilling narrative. The first episode excels by retooling the combat a bit by limiting ammo supplies. It also delivers an incredible opening sequence that allows players to explore Rapture as never seen before. The second episode faulters a bit with an emphasis on stealth but both episodes offer the same stunning art direction and voice work from the core game. No expense was spare in bringing this DLC to life making it worthwhile and memorable.			"

												Bioshock Infinite has been in my game library since the Christmas sale i want to say maybe fall sale of 2013. Bought it as a combo pack with all three games.  Friend has been raving about the series for years to me. I play the first and am blown away by the story.  Start the second one and couldn't even get past an an hour into and am thinking total garbage.  So the third installment I put on hold for quite awhile.  Finally get a wild hair to sit down and play it.  It is a very graphical stunning game.  I'm a little at a lose on written this review because it's a good game possible a great one with one thing I'm not 100% sold on the story.  The story is good but it was completely rushed it starts out slow like the first one that's fine getting your bearings and the lay of the land.  But then you hit the action and it's done quicker then a plate of oreos' at a weight watchers meeting.    It leaves you wanting more or it does in my opinion.  A person could easily finish this game in ten hours just rushing it not exploring or all that jazz.  I would feel even more cheap, dirty, and used like a five dollar hooker if I had paid full price for the game.  I did not so the feeling passed pretty quickly think I picked up all three and the season pass for idk around $20.  The story itself is good but you wish it had a little more detail to it.  All in all a good game don't let this review discourage your from purchasing it.  And the ending linking up to the Bioshock original wasn't even needed.  Love how they did just not fundamental to the story.  I would rate this game a 7.5 maybe an 8 but more towards the 7.5 mark.   Graphics superbly done. Story I liked it but didn't love it.  All in all if your a fan of the first skip the second and purchase this one.  If your new to series doesn't matter the order you play them just skip the second and your golden.  This game should definitaly be on your wishlist at the very least.			"

												I was never a big fan of Bioshock, for whatever reason, I just couldn't get into it, but Bioshock Infinite changed all of that.The game is set in a mythical city in the sky and it is filled with many unexpected plot twists and amazing visuals, speaking of visuals, I should mention that the game looks drop dead gorgeous (that's a no-brainer right there), but it runs so damn smooth, admittedly, I don't have a amazing video card, and that usually locks me out of experiencing many games a lot of them in full glory, or at all, however, I was playing Infinite on medium and I was stunned, the visuals were so unexpectedly beatiful on medium and the game ran at a steady 45-60FPS the whole way through, the only time it tanked was at the end, where it dropped to around 17FPS due to explosions. But overall graphically I am very amazed.But games aren't about graphics, unless you're a naive 10 year old kid, so how's the gameplay? Well, it's great, a lot of combat situations felt really intense and fun, though I do recommend playing on a higher difficulty, since the game is pretty easy for most parts (and this is coming from a person who is not very good at FPS!), Elizabeth usually revived me if I didn't notice my health dropping, and ammo was plentiful, and so were the guns. But over all the game has a lot of hidden treasures to find, has optional objectives (not too many though, which is somewhat dissapointing), and Elizabeth can unlock doors and chests using lockpicks to get a bunch of good loot too!Now let's get to the best part - the story. Now the story is quite something, by the end I had my jaw dropped without even noticing, there are so many plot twists that just aren't expected, there's a lot of lore to find in the game that does tie the story up together, but it did leave me confused a bunch of times, in a good way, though. Elizabeth is an incredibely interesting character (and pretty good looking too, I should admit), and most of the story is based more or less about her, and her father Comstock, as well as a big (and bad) revolution of the Vox Populi, that are mainly of second class citizens of Columbia, the racist capital of the world.Overall, the game exceeded my expecatations, but what stuck out to me the most was the story, which left me wondering and speclating it long after I passed it.Seriously, give this game a go, it's a masterpiece.

												The scope and ambition of Bioshock: Infinite is in itself difficult to fully take in, but it’s in seeing this ambition conceptualized in such astounding fashion that causes it to become almost exhausting to try and appreciate the vast amount of layers laid in such an intricate pattern required to make it what it is.It’s the rarest of occasions where the incalculable expectations heaped upon it are not only met, but exceeded, in ways I wouldn’t have anticipated despite my own rabid hopes for what the game might be. It’s an experience that’s both familiar yet defiantly willing to take risks in its attempts to outdo its predecessors, firmly steeped in its own heritage but only so much as it can be used to further itself into something even more remarkable, constantly pushing itself to new heights despite the possible catastrophe that could result. And it pays off. What Irrational Games has achieved is unprecedented, deserving of commendation and once again resetting the bar that the original Bioshock did so many years ago. It’s truly something to behold.The setup to Infinite’s plot is likely the sole moment that can be easily explained, materializing with the words that have become so familiar by now but adopt a larger meaning in their greater narrative context: “bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt”. You are Booker Dewitt, a man on his last line of hope in removing himself out from under the hand of some very dangerous people.And this is where Infinite forgoes any semblance of simplicity or predictability, literally ascending into the floating city of Columbia and a far more complex, complicated narrative that all but demands repeated playthroughs to truly understand. Columbia is itself a fascinating world to explore, for reasons Rapture never was or could be. It’s a living, breathing city that unravels at a deliberately slow pace, dropping breadcrumbs for you every step of the way but never exposing itself enough to have you see the full picture and become disinterested.The city feels real, for as fantastical and impossible the existence of a floating city seems; a gorgeous, fully realized environment dripping in early American history and architecture that comes to life in an artistically arresting display of color and visual fidelity. The constant dissimilarity between the beautiful areas you explore and the horrifically grotesque violence that takes place within them creates a sort of twisted beauty that never wavers or deteriorates into mindless gore.In many ways Columbia exists almost to entirely contradict rapture. It's a city floating in the sky, brought up by a fiercely communal, religious figure head that seeks not to eradicate law and God but embrace the ideals of a warped version of Christianity created in his own image. You arrive here not after the dust has settled and the city has fallen, but at the cusp of a viscous civil war that is nearing its boiler point, waiting for you to drop the match and light the flames.In the wake of the many firefights and incredible scenes of destruction that litter the path to Infinite’s shocking finish, it was often the quiet moments that made me appreciate Columbia the most for giving me something Rapture never did. Without the constant fear of being attacked or an oppressive atmosphere weighing you down, Infinite is allowed to show its humanity. Seeing the city the full of life gives a sense of place on a level I've rarely witnessed. Kids running in the streets, venders attempting to sell you their wares; it all serves to establish this robust society before its descent into madness, something often lost in a medium seemingly obsessed with sterile, dystopian wastelands.At the center of this is Elizabeth, the girl previously referred to who immediately upon her introduction becomes far more than the mere bartering tool that you set out for. She’s a character without the flimsy mirage of personality drawn up to hide a lack of depth, or a throwaway damsel that only serves to burden you down. She’s a person; naive, curious, independent, and the one you come to rely on throughout the game almost more so than she does you.The relationship between her and Booker is the grounding force for a narrative that often feels as if it could spin wildly out of control at any moment, but stays firmly on course throughout every path it goes down, the culmination for which is only describable as utterly insane and brilliant.With all it attempts, there are certainly a handful of threads which never get the closure or development they deserve, most prominently that of the deeply rooted racism of Columbia and the rebel for of the Vox Populi that has sprung up as a result. It’s one of the most compelling subplots in the game, though unfortunately has little time to be expanded upon and is mostly a means to a very violent end. Ultimately it’s almost understandable, as there is hardly room for Infinite’s larger narrative to exist in, let alone as many subplots as it has also managed to fit in alongside it.Though the shooting in Bioshock has never been a problem (quite the opposite, it’s one of the most intelligent and mechanically sophisticated shooters ever made), Infinite is unquestionably smoother in every aspect. It’s a faster, tighter, streamlined game that smartly ejects portions of past games to allow space for its new mechanics to coexist. The core of combat is in many ways the same as it has always been, with mostly names being swapped to reflect the change in local, but otherwise preserving the strongest aspects of Bioshock’s combat while expanding upon them in intelligent ways that further the tactical depth of each encounter.The skyhook provides one of the biggest changes to the formula, allowing for a level of verticality the series has never had, as you zip along rails through huge levels which require you take note of the new speed with which you can traverse levels and the vantage points now accessible. It requires a complete rethinking of how fights are approached, and gives the player the tools to take on larger numbers of enemies that in turn are also granted access to these new tools, and make full use of them in their pursuit to take you down.Vigors, Infinite’s replacement for plasmids, offer the same superhuman element as before but now in a much more focused and deliberate manner. Different abilities can be combined into more effective weapons, from electrocuting a murder of crows, to creating exploding enemies by setting them ablaze and then charging into them. It’s a logical evolution of the series’s most unique mechanic, and that only grows further as you come to learn the various combos hidden in the already powerful abilities.The switch to only being able to carry two weapons at a time at first felt like a disadvantage, but effectively worked in making me pay more attention to my surroundings and be more active in choosing which weapons to use and where to find new ones. It ensured I was constantly moving and engaged in the combat, as different weapons were often noticeably more effective against different enemy types and I was rarely given the luxury of having them all nearby. Coupled with the smoother aiming and ability to sprint and aim down the sights fundamentally altered how I played, and by and large made for a more compelling experience.Bioshock: Infinite is a stunning achievement; bold, refined, innovative, and constantly stimulating. It’s a game that never falters in its vision, fearful of how easy it would be to have it all crumble upon the weight of its own aspirations, confident in its ability to deliver something awe-inspiring. There are few experiences more worth your time, and leave you with as much to think about.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com]. "

Long story short: Not as solid as a game as the other Bioshocks, but amazing at story-telling, even if it takes a bit too much from Half-Life 2's book. Excellent as a finisher for the trilogy's story.DISCLAIMER: I don't own the DLC for this title, so I can't give an opinion on it. I've heard the Burial At Sea episodes are really good though, possibly better than the main game. Check reviews for the season pass before you make your purchase.Bioshock Infinite was rated really highly for Game of the Year 2013. And rightly so, the game does an amazing job at wowing the player. The amazing visuals, spectacular voice acting, and brilliant underlying motifs and themes make this one of the most memorable games of the year. However, gameplay features have been stripped down from the original Bioshock, some for the better, but in general the gameplay has ended up being a glorified shooting gallery rather than the maze-like claustrophobia that is Rapture.Infinite takes place in Columbia, a city above the clouds, rich in detail as light floods the streets of moving buildings, vapour passes underneath, and zeppelins float by. The story goes like this (and I will keep this spoiler-free and brief): you play as Booker, a guy who is sent to capture a woman for someone else. That girl ends up being Elizabeth, who becomes your companion after about a quarter of the game. Her characterisation is great; she gives this sense of trapped freedom throughout the entire game. Certain scripted areas really bring out her personality a lot. In the meanwhile, the citizens of Columbia turn against you after discovering a mark of the False Prophet on your hand. This theme of religion is explored pretty well throughout the game as well.The story is told in a Half-Life 2 fashion: you move from locale to locale to progress the game, each place broken up by a ""cutscene"" like area where, while control isn't taken away from the player sometimes, you're contained in an area until the dialogue has finished. It's alright, even if the pace slows down a little bit too much. There's also hidden voice logs around in typical Bioshock fashion just to add a bit more lore to the world.The ironic part about Infinite is that, for a game that has risen from the ocean in terms of locale, it's also lost a lot of depth in gameplay. On surface-level, Booker can hold only two weapons, and can unleash any of his vigour powers (magic spells essentially) at any time in conjunction, such as shooting with a revolver and unleashing crows on enemies. Hacking is non-existent now, and has been pushed into a vigour of its own.Most of the enemies are gun-wielding humans, which means the combat is cover-based. The health accommodates for this by using an armour/health mechanic where armour is cheap but rechargeable, whereas health can only be restored with pickups, giving the player a bit of room for error (which is always nice) without being ridiculously forgiving. Some enemies, such as the Handyman are more tank-like enemies (like the Big Daddies from Bioshock 1), and involve a much different playstyle to take down. However, the gunplay doesn't entirely work in its favour: unlike the Big Daddies, you're more or so launched into arenas with the Handymen, so traps and clever planning cannot be used; a drop in depth.The combat itself is a bit more dynamic that other cover-based shooters, however. Elizabeth has the ability to pull in objects from alternate dimensions or time periods such as cover, grappling hooks, health packs, etc. It's neat the first few times, but it seems a bit too contextual as some areas lack these tears, and combat reverts to the standard peak and shoot strategy, rather than the dynamic cover-shifting that the developers tried to implement.Elizabeth also can sometimes find items throughout the game, which, again, feels contextual. A lot of the time, she'll give items when you need it, which makes her seem a lot more useful than she actually is. However, I think it's a mistep that Elizabeth will sometimes find money during gunfights, and think it's a good idea to hand over as bullets wizz past her head.Finally on combat, there's certain areas with skyhook rails, places where you can latch onto a rail and shoot along as you zoom down the line. The game makes it easy to hop on and off, and a couple of places in the game utilise this in a huge arena-like setting. Unfortunately, it makes gunplay a bit difficult, at least on PC, as you do not lock on to targets, making hitting them while moving a challenging endeavour. This is alleviated by the ability to crush enemies by landing on them, but it does make these sections seem a bit sporadic more than anything.Weapons and vigours can be upgraded throughout the game, and fortunately the amount of money given to you in the game is quite small, only allowing you to upgrade a fraction of the things you can upgrade. However, the fact that you can only wield two weapons means that you can decide on a favourite playstyle and run with that, utilising other weapons only when they're handed to you. The vigours also are not utilised as much as the predecessors (for example, the hacking vigour is used a lot less than I'd like it to be used (I think I used it about eight times in the game)). The biggest issue with Bioshock is that it's the third and final game in the series, yet a lot of its features seem a bit worse than the original titles. It's hard to discuss on its own just because I'm constantly reminded of what is missing, as opposed to what is there. However, the story is subjectively better than the previous titles: the land of Columbia is wonderous and well realised. It's also beautifully modelled and textured, and is a joy to look at.Bioshock Infinite is a very good story, but it's not as solid a game as its predecessors. I'd recommend grabbing the trilogy package if you're new to the series but like first-person shooter titles as, while it's worth playing, it's not as good as the original Bioshock. If you do own the previous games, this game is still worth your money.RATING: 2 UP, 1 DOWNMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals). Ups relate to how much good a game has, and downs are how much bad a game has.[/table]

												The highly acclaimed Bioshock Infinite takes place in the sky town of spingleton, where the bad man Cornstarch wants to take the lady-lamb young Queen Elizabeth from your fingertips. The interesting thing about The Queen is she cries a lot and makes lots of tears that make black-and-white things appear like in the olden days. This is used as a very unique mechanic in battles to overcome Cornstarch's, Slater's and Mr. Vox Populi's men. Additionally, the town of spingleton has many sky train tracks that Booker can latch on an take The Queen on a sightseeing journey whilst being shot at. The enemies also vary quite a significant amount, from the fireman who ironically throws fire and explodes to the handyman who has hands.The special powers in this game, also knows as nigors, are as diverse as the number 8 and offer a great variation of gameplay. For example:In one instance you may step back and press the button for you nigor to fire birds at the enemies to finish them off, or perhaps you may choose a different route and stay back and press the button for your nigor to throw a fireball at the enemy, or maybe you might choose instead to stay back and press the button for your nigor to use the lightning on your enemy and give them a shock (get it?), or you might diverge and choose to stay back and use the nigor that throws a ball of energy at them or even choose to stay back and make horse sounds as they decide to float. The list goes on...The story of Bioshock is even more depthy, as the man Cornstarch and the relationship between him and The Queen becomes more evident. Trigger warning: Spooky ghosts are in this game. "

												To everyone opting to play Bioshock Infinite: I strongly recommend playing the Bioshock 1 before even starting Bioshock Infinite.Regarding Bioshock Infinte (without spoilers): I recommend this game - it's a totally awesome experience, very atmospheric, featuring unique gameplay ideas, very believable characters, strong and mind blowing plot and beautiful visual design. Bioshock Infinite is one of the best action games of the last years. Rating it 10/10.But, at the same time it's a sad game. A drama. A tragedy. You might ask - what makes the game so damn tragic? The answer is - the Bioshock Infinite DLCs ""Burial at Sea"".Having played Bioshock series in the right order (Bioshock 1 - Bioshock 2 - Bioshock Infinite), I enjoyed the whole series immensly.  The  Bishock Infinite DLCs complete the story of the series, but  the story arc unfolds in such way,  that now I wish only to forget what I saw while playing ""Burial at Sea"", and even the whole Bioshock Series is now a one whole drama to me. Some secrets better be left untold, some parts of the story better be buried and never known. You will not find hope here. You'll not find your dreams here. It's like watching ""The Bridge to Terabithia"" again.I have never played such a depressing game in my whole life -_-			"

												I haven't played any of the earlier BioShock games, so I will not include them in this review. (Except here) BioShock Infinite is a visually stunning game with a story so immersive that the ending might leave your jaw dropped! The game tells us the story about Booker Dewitt a man who is out to find and kidnap/rescue Elizabeth, a young girl who lives in the flying city of Columbia, a what at first looks like a idyllic paradise with no problems at all.This however turns out to be quite wrong, like all societys even Columbia have its problems, racism, class struggle, poverty and much more, this turns the kidnap/rescue mission into a trip through a failing society. A society that is eventually flipped into a bloody civil war. I won't go in to much more about the plot, because I want to spoil as little as possible. But the gameplay is quite FPS generic, you get some weapons, you shoot some guys, but you also have your ""special powers"" Throughout Columbia you find bottles, you can drink these bottles and with them come great power, power to kill. These powers make all battles a bit more interesting, and there is also a hook which via ""cables"" in the sky you can travel quite fast around the battle areas, surprising your enemy from above. I would say what makes this game is the story, and especially the ending, however the gameplay isn't bad but it isn't great either. I would recommend this game!			"

												Stunning Game! Blowed my mind!Bioshock Infinite takes the gaming to a whole new level of design, taking you back to the mid 20th century, with a bit of Tainted Love and other musical sounds of the times! Even though it doesn't look anything like the city at the bottom of the ocean (Rapture), it has a lot to do with it, not only through the design of things but also through the storyline! And with the exceptional turn of events, it blows your mind completly and at the same time amaze you.This also may prove a point about many things in, at least, our reality! How many are there really?It gives life to that one theory from one of the brightest minds in the planet. Stephen Hawking.This game is very unique, not by it's design and gameplay but also it's storyline. It is so refined with theories besides the main one.Now I'm being honest about this review. This is basically one of my favorite games of all time. It might not have the most sensational gameplay when fighting people, but it still is what I payed for.Damn it is even more than I was expecting honestly.And I wouldn't be writing this review if it wasn't true. Trust meI've been a Bioshock fan since the first came out. Yea, the game of it's year.But when the second bioshock came out, it teared a bit of my heart. It was really poor from my perspective, not what I wanted to see ( apart from seeing a big daddy's perspective ).I can say I got revived by Infinite, and it was, for sure, one of the best games I have ever played.So if you are considering buying this game, you are a fan of Bioshock 1 but you are still not sure because the second one was a BIG disapointment, seriously: buy it. Worth even more than it's current price. Also buy the season pass. Besides saving $, you get 2 dlcs that twist your mind even more. And that is also where you go insane.			"

												BioShock Infinite it's the third game in the BioShock series released in 2013 by 2k Games and it was made by Irrational Games studio. The first thing that everyone knows about this game it's the hype. And I must say something about this hype: believe it.BioShock Infinite offers a great gaming experience, with a thrilling story, nice gameplay and beautiful graphics, it also has some DLCs that you MUST take a shot. It's story it's probably the brightest spot of the game and you need to pay attention at everything to get the hang of it. After playing a hour or two I felt myself really connected to the game, like a movie but in a movie that you're actually in it (If you're actually an actor it's still a great experience).It's recommended to play the first two games, excellent games btw, the stories are not actually connected but several elements and references from the older games are found in this one.In terms of gameplay it is easier than BioShock cause in this one you have a lot of money and ammo and in the others games those things are rarity.I really recommend this game to anyone that likes a great and well made story and a nice fps gameplay too.

												Just... wow.10/10. One of two games I'd give a perfect score. Infinite offers a riveting story. It has superb voice acting, a brilliant script, gorgeous graphics-style and a high level of replayability. While the game suffers from somewhat repetetive combat, it's still simply an amazing game. You will fall in love with this game from the first second you play it. The very first thing you hear in this game will hook you. If you are like me, appreciating the story most of all, put the game on easy and let it tell you it's story. The game is a true gem. Are you one who enjoys a challenge though, put it in 1999 mode and make Dark Souls seem like farmville. Was my favorite game from it's release upon the release of TW3.			"

												Infinite is more than a new setting, story, and characters; those elements are seamlessly integrated with complex themes, a mysterious plot, and entertaining combat to create an amazing experience from beginning to end. Familiar threads run through it – a lighthouse, a strange city, a charismatic antagonist – but they are homages to the past rather than attempts to recycle it. The core of Infinite is unlike anything else on land, sea, or air.Damn I love bioshock infinite. I love the artwork, the colors, the scenery, the atmosphere, and the story. I felt as if I was actually in the world of bioshock. Lovely game, lovely song!﻿Once I saw the ending, I just sat at my desk for 10 minutes with a blank face.

												I really can't get enough of this game! I mean, not only is it beautiful, but the story is so well written. You play as Booker ""Marty"" DeWitt, who travels through time (and space? I was never clear on this) to make sure his parents still hook up at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance. Instead, you actually end up on a super racist airplane named Columbia with lots of two dimensional characters with muddy motives and the illusion of choice. Oh! And there's also something called the skyhook (its basically a rollercoaster, which I thought was a neat homage to Roller Coaster Tycoon, which was also developed and published by the same company as this game).Mostly though, you want this game for the music. Like, they have Tears for Fears and Cyndi Lauper and its really good.

												BioShock Infinite weaves a complicated and intricate plot around ever-changing variables. Not only is it an evolving story that sees protagonist Booker DeWitt and the mysterious Elizabeth grow closer, but Irrational's latest deals with the hubris of a society built above the clouds, its ideals inflated with so much of the same hot air that propels it above the world below.Though it touches on topics revolving around racism, religion, rebellion and revenge, these themes take a backseat to BioShock Infinite's primary topic: Love. Whether it be a society in love with its own patented brand of American Exceptionalism, a leader in love with his own self-appointed immortal image, or a pair of people that come together to care for one another, BioShock Infinite is a love story.And it's an easy story to fall in love with. Taking place in 1912, BioShock Infinite follows Booker DeWitt, a man with a mysterious past charged with ascending to the once-iconic but now forgotten city of Columbia, a floating city in the sky. Once there, DeWitt must find a woman named Elizabeth and bring her to New York to wipe away his debt. DeWitt, who first appears to be without a vestige of sympathy for the plight of the woman, complies. To describe details any further would only serve to eradicate BioShock Infinite's exceptional ability to surprise.Unlike the undersea city of Rapture – the setting of Irrational's critical and commercial smash BioShock – Columbia is a living world. Players won't draw blood from enemies for quite some time when they arrive in Columbia, a world established and ruled by a figure known as Father Zachary Comstock. Rather, DeWitt and the player are introduced to the technology and ideals that power the city as they move across its interlocking sections; and as gorgeous as the world of Columbia is, it's a horribly grotesque place. DeWitt learns that the city is fueled by racism, misplaced loyalty and morbid patriotism, and it quickly becomes a joy to know the game will eventually allow him to pull it down from the sky, arrogant brick by brick.When players first arrive on Columbia by way of being rocketed into the sky, the focus is a civil war between the ""White Power"" fanatics led by Comstock and a rebellious group dubbed the Vox Populi led by a strong black woman named Daisy Fitzroy. While this story weaves in and out of the overarching narrative, it eventually takes a backseat to more pressing matters: Elizabeth and DeWitt's search for the truth about their existence on Columbia.BioShock Infinite's core gameplay mimics that of Irrational's previous effort: a first-person shooter with a magical component. The ""magic"" in Infinite is composed of collectible vigors, potent elixirs that grant DeWitt special powers, like the ability to electrocute enemies or lob fireballs. Each of the vigors, and all weapons, can be upgraded to increase their power and properties – longer ability duration, extra ammunition, etc. Where things begin to diverge for Infinite versus the original BioShock is in collectible gear, which can be mixed and matched to grant special buffs, like headgear that allows DeWitt to leach health for successfully performing brutal melee execution kills with his skyline hook.The hook is used to traverse Columbia's skylines, a network of massive, suspended mechanical rails that connect different parts of the city. While both DeWitt and Elizabeth can use them to travel the city, they serve as more than just a simple means of transportation. As the game progresses, the pair will encounter arenas with varying levels of terrain with enemies attacking on all sides. Though you can pick each aggressor off from a static cover point, it's far more fulfilling to zip around on skylines and fight from multiple angles.Elizabeth provides DeWitt with valuable resources like ammunition, health packs and salts during battle. Beyond scavenging, Elizabeth can also modify the properties of the battlefield by playing with pre-determined ""tears"" – splits in the fabric of time she has the ability to open. These can introduce things like cover, turrets, and even motorized allies to help DeWitt come out on top.Tears also play a crucial role in the narrative. Elizabeth has been able to open them since early childhood, though as a young adult she's lost some of her grip on her ability. DeWitt, understandably, is terrified of Elizabeth's power, unclear of the true intentions of everyone involved in her life, including Comstock and his own employers. The tears add to the mystery, sometimes appearing with music from the wrong decade spilling out of them, raising immediate questions as to the true nature of the phenomenon, Columbia's place in history and even Elizabeth herself. Though their relationship is quickly strained upon first meeting, with neither truly trusting the actions of the other, Elizabeth and DeWitt become allies and even friends, a relationship made possible by BioShock Infinite's superb voice cast.Engagements are typically a fun dance between mixing weapons and abilities while utilizing the environmental possibilities to cut down Infinite's assortment of enemies – snatching powerful weapons from tears, leaping onto skylines and fighting as you glide across the sky. Some of the battles, however, drag on too long and interrupt the flow of story-telling, especially toward the end of the game.In terms of its immediate adversaries, Infinite lacks any foe as terrifying as BioShock's Big Daddy; though the aggressiveness of the Handyman – a robotic behemoth with a human head that literally begs for death – can be a daunting challenge to manage. Both standard and special enemies, even the mini-gun toting Motorized Patriot, eventually become just another thing to shoot at, never reaching the same dangerous heights as BioShock's giant, iconic protector.The ending of the game is marvelous, and you'll have to trust me when I say that BioShock Infinite's final section – dedicated entirely to its narrative – handily disposes of any minor gripes. There is not only one twist to the tale, but many entrances and exits to a wide array of secrets, diving deeper into the past of the primary cast of characters and the world of Columbia itself. The greatest discovery, however, is the love that blossoms between Elizabeth and DeWitt, and how far the pair are willing to go to protect each other.As a game, BioShock Infinite has its successes and its falterings consistent with any suitably complex piece of interactive entertainment. As a story, as an exercise in drawing the player into a believable and relevant world, as proof of exactly what a videogame can mean to a person... BioShock Infinite is damn near perfect.			"

												Bioshock Infinite - it's a masterpiece. Genius. One of the best games in the world. These games are not more often than once every 5 years. It's a dozens of articles and analyzes of the effects of the game on the future of the gaming industry as a whole. Endless arguments with friends about the ideals and the fact that Bioshock is no way it's, but at the same time manages to touch all the chord of the soul! Talk about what is Bioshock Infinite - senselessly,  uselessly, mindlessly! You must to play... No, this word does not fit here. THIS IS NOT A GAME! YOU MUST TO SEE IT!________________________________________________BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea - Episode 1 is amazing! The first full-fledged storyline Bioshock Infinite addon manages to surpass in part hitherto in any game not seen (the closest was DMC 4), fantastic art, better even than in original game. For the first half hour of the game I made about 120 screenshots, 69 of them were selected for display in the gallery of screenshots. Yes, again - the game logical problems reflected even in the framework of such a linear world that prevent immerse yourself in the atmosphere at 100%, but it is not so important when the game gives you such inexpressible sensations. These games come out once in 5, 10 years. They move... Must move the industry forward and set new levels of quality. Again, this is not a 10/10, but its solid 9/10 game definitely deserves. This is one of those games after the exit of which, you has long can't get yourself under all sorts of impressions and own the grumbling want to shove away...________________________________________________			"

												BioShock Infinite.At first, i felt this game was too over-hyped. I mean its another FPS game. I was wrong. This game is worth playing but even more so when you get all the content (DLC packs)At first i was disappointed that the main story campaign only takes an average of 9 Hours to finish even with exploration and a bit of backtracking, the atmosphere was superb, the graphics were phenomenal, the voice acting was superb, and i really fell for the overall feel of Columbia. Then when i finished the campaign, i just kinda let it sit in my library.But then as soon as the Burial at sea Episodes unlocked, i got sucked back into the world of Bioshock. I tell you, they really did a great job on the damn story on this one. The story is superbly thought out and was simply a pleasure to experience.I really felt for Booker, i empathized with him and at one point i felt like i was him. Clinging to this tiny shred of hope that maybe, just maybe i can redeem myself and save this girl for i have already doomed her in another reality. And i really sympathized with Elizabeth. The loneliness and the feeling of being caged off from the world outside the walls she knows so very very well.The game made me question choices and the illusion of free will for you are given a few choices but with pre-determined outcomes. Despite all the good that it has, it has flaws as well.The atmosphere is great but i wish that i could interact with more of the environment aside from the vendors, the trash cans and etc. I'd like to have a conversation with a random civilian and have that person acknowledge me (me as booker at least) and not feign back to the scripted, backgroundish routine that it follows. The plasmids kinda just help you shoot people better, they are useful for stopping your enemies or holding them in place or disabling them so you can deliver some lead to their systems. After a while, i get tired of the phrase ""BOOKER, CATCH!""I particularly like the SkyHook feature as it allows me to sucker punch an unsuspecting enemy into oblivion (if he were standing on a floating piece of real estate in Columbia) I believe that despite the feeling of it being over-hyped, its a great game.It is a masterpiece that can only be done through the gaming medium. Movies, books and music can only hope to scratch the surface of what Bioshock Infinite's story has done. I doubt that any other medium could deliver this story quite as well as the game has already done. But i wouldn't mind seeing some books, graphic novels and other things about BioShock.This sets the bar for storytelling in games that are centered around a full bodied plot.The DLC's story was a perfect example of content that gives you the kind of clarity that you get when you get to the conclusion of a long fairy tale.The final DLC hits the nail on the head, and is a fitting final goodbye from Irrational Games. Get it on sale and get the season pass.Its a hefty Download but damn its worth it.Would you kindly play the game?			"

												Well, although  not the best game in the universe, this game does both right and wrong things all at the same time. The main complaint I have with BioShock Infinite are its two contrasting themes of parallel dimensions mixed in with themes of religiousism, idolfication, the constitution of the United States of America, sexism, hedonism and people in black sheep's clothing, it does too much. There is no separate transition from this main theme towards the other themes of tears, parallel dimensions Elizabeth can will by the power of her memories.  If this was removed the game would be so much better.Let's get down to the breakdown of the game.Gameplay: Gameplay as others have mentioned I am sure already is the repetitive gunplay. There are many situations where you are forced through the in-game script to pick-up weapons you may not want to use in the situations they make you use them in. This is problematic in one of the toughest battles later in the game against warships, zepplins. The guns however do feel nice to use. The sounds of them might be a little unrealistic or barely noted to pay attention to.Story:      This is my largest complaint with the game , even more so then the repetitive gameplay without much variation. Much of the game is told through kinetoscopes which tell majority of the story through a type of film projected roll of film in black-white old cinematic style. However, the story is better presented through non-verbal actions when you meet Elizabeth and when she interacts with you within the world she was trapped in. However, you as an outsider don't understand everything that Elizabeth understands and knows about the world in which she lives in as an insider. This is why they had to put parallel dimensions in this game to make sense of both an insider and outsider perspective of the situations at hand. However, it is poorly executed and done. Religion:     Many of you that are not religous or even Christian for that matter will not understand some of the biblical references to the garden of eden, Sodom of Gomorrah and washing away the debt of sins. However, without spoiling the story too much, one guy comes to you and says you can wash away the debt of your sins if you give your own daughter away; though, it is really unclear if it is yours or Elizabeth when she was a girl. I assumed it was Elizabeth since she is the one they wanted to take Lady Comstock's place in the end .     Themes:Idolfication: The story takes place in the early 1900's. There are points in the game where you enter in upon factory workers being enslaved and  people are  being tortured for heresy against a rising secular cult of people that are not following the true Gospel of God. Everyone in this game is blinded by idolfication. Even the people who follow Comstock, they are just his followers; nothing more. He is the actual false prophet in the game, though they frame you as the AntiChrist when instead you play the role of Jesus. Your job is not to minister to people but to tell them that they are wrong about following this skeptical guy Comstock and his teachings. He is the one that actually should be accused of heresy. However, during this time, Columbia is promised an eternal state of Heaven. However, they believe it has to be done through a human sacrifice of Elizabeth through the baptism of Booker De Witt. Racisim: They have black and white wash stations characteristic of slavery days. There are various jargon and little things I will not be going over as that would spoil the game's experience for you. Take note that there is much racisim and questions regarding the philosophies of the world along with branding people's names of the last sins they have commited upon death. If it takes place in the 1900's sins should be wiped away through Jesus Christ. Ultimately they believe Booker is the AntiChrist. Yet in many parallel dimensions he is seen as the hero and savior of the world of Columbia.Overall: Do I think Christians should play this game though it stands as one of the most controversial triple AAA games out there currently in the bounds of the Christian worldview and modern world? Yes I think you should. This game teaches you what the nation is like and the times we live in today with modernisim using parallel dimensions and universes as the main driving point and vehicle for the message. It shows you both the good and bad things of religion. What works right when religion is performed in a manner based on biblical teachings, then what goes wrong when those biblical teachings are reprimanded when man's leadership is based on the teachings of our country's founders.7/10 Only because many games don't have the courage to discuss idolfication, racisim, sexism and politics in a worldly sphere and through alternative realities relating to the secular realities of men and women on this earth. Even though the game is just your average shooter, it is worth at least for you to check it out for yourself.			"

												INTRODUCTION:Bioshock Infinite is the third installment to the popular Bioshock series. Set in a city in the sky as opposed to the city underwater, this game features a revamped combat mechanic featuring Sky-lines rails and and a new AI companion, all the while, retaining some of the old features of the previous games.You play as Booker DeWitt, a former 7th Cavalry soldier turned Pinkerton who was tasked by unknown individuals to recover a girl, Elizabeth, from the floating city of Colombia. A simple recovery mission quickly turns sour when the girl you have to take turns out to be a very important figure head.PROS:+ Story: -Needless to say, the one primary factor that drives the Bioshock games is they are narrative-driven. This game delivers a very compelling, interesting and immersive story that makes you want to know more about the city and world of Colombia.+ Graphics: -Stunning visuals and magnificent world design makes Bioshock infinite one of the prettiest games of the franchise. Breathtaking scenery, beautiful texture quality and character designs makes the world alive.+ Elizabeth: -I normally frown at escort missions, specially if the AI is poorly programed for, but Bioshock Infinite (despite being an escort mission start to finish) got past that  by introducing an companion AI who is helpful and doesn’t get in the way. She assists the player through support roles providing money, ammo, and regenerative potions all throughout the game. She's not the revolutionary AI companion that everyone was excited about, but she's the closest one we have.+ Optimization: -Was optimized enough for the PC to allow even mid-range desktops or laptops to play the game in relatively high or medium-high settings.CONS:- Combat: -Retains the fun and high paced combat with guns and magic of the previous titles BUT seriously fails due to the poor decision of limiting the player with only TWO weapons carry limit which does not live up to the previous games who had several weapons at the player's disposal. Too many: (1) Kill Bad Guys, (2) Elizabeth Opens Door, Repeat step one, sequences.- Poor Antagonist (No Spoiler): -Explaining this is a bit hard without spoilers. We were introduced with a great antagonist by the name of Andrew Ryan in the first game but I can't help but feel that the new Antagonist, Comstock falls short. Anything more would be a spoiler. Now even the new Songbird creature (kinda like a buffed up Big Daddy) makes very, very limited appearances and its role in the whole story somewhat becomes pointless once you progress.- No sense of Danger: -This has been an illness since the first game. Death in the Bioshock franchise is more of a minor inconvenience than an actual penalty. Vita-Chambers in the first and second Bioshock games made death pointless. This was carried over to Bioshock Infinite where the Vita-Chambers beeing replaced by Elizabeth reviving you every time you get incapacitated. This totally eliminates any sense of dread that you should be feeling in a high combat scenario.CONCLUSION:AN OVERALL GREAT GAME. Though it has its short comings, I would still recommend Bioshock Infinite to any fan of the franchise. It provides a satisfying narrative and introduces new characters that leave a lasting impact.Although I would still RECOMMEND this game to NEW players in the Bioshock franchise, I think this is best appreciated by people who already gone through the first and second games.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Like my Reviews?

												Gameplay 7/10 - For your standard first person shooter mechanics, This game can get repetitive and fast. I mean it's just liek the standard really but still fun none-the-less! The Vigors add that special touch to gameplay, I mean come on...Who doesn't want to throw a bunch of crows at someones face or hurl them 20ft into the air and shoot the hell out of them? Graphics 9/10 - The artistic direction in this game combined with everything else is, in my honest opinion, flawless. They present the city you enter as an ""Eden"" and when you first lay eyes on it, That's exactly what you feel. The colouring is gorgeous and being in a city in the clouds makes it even more eye popping. Only reason I have not gave it a 10/10 is because all the NPC's start to look identical unless they serve some sort of purpose. But hey, who cares? I just couldn't give it the full 10/10 for graphics solely for that purpose and it's not exactly a major issue.Story 10/10 -  The story is epic. I think it's by far the best of all the Bioshock games, Without a doubt. I love the fact we learn more about Elizabeth and how she develops as a character. You see sides to her that are unexpected and really throw a spanner in the works! I cant really go into too much detail without giving too much away but in my opinion the story will have you gripped frmo the first moment.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is, in a word, amazing. It's difficult to put into words just what an overbearing accomplishment of the industry this game represents. This is one of those achievements that prove that video games can have equal stories to that of books or films, or in this case, even blow a large majority of them out of the water.This is one of those games that really sticks with you long after the credits (and amazing post-credits sequence) have rolled, and in my case puts me off playing any other video game for days on end. Everything else just pales in comparison.Before this I held that the original Bioshock had the best story of the series, and the sequel the best combat, but now Infinite combines the best of, and exceeds both in an emotionally driven work of art that has, remarkably, surpassed the brilliance of the original.

												I'm the type of person who doesn't review games but this game really got too me. I'm not going to write down any ""pros"" or ""cons"" but I will talk about abit of my experience with this game.This game was laying around my house in a case, I was abit sceptical about playing this game considering the games I usually play consists of open world RPG type games so I wasn't really sure how I would enjoy playing a story following game. I have played story games before and I particularly enjoyed portal 2 and beyond two souls (ps exclusive) but I generally would always feel incomplete when I finish a game and I’m unable to keep playing more the often I would be disappointed with an ending and then I would feel as if i wasted my time playing a game that lead nowhere or too have a good story build up for it just too end on a crappy note. This game on the other hand I was actually so happy too finish, it gave me a sense of fulfilment that I generally don’t achieve with this type of game. I was worried about jumping straight into this game because I actually haven't played the first two games but coming to a realisation that Bioshock Infinite had nothing to do with the older games gave me the all clear and I can tell you now that I really want too play the first two before I have a go at the DLC (also because the first two is on sale at the moment) I really don’t know how to write reviews about games without spoiling it but what I can say is that this is the most smart games I’ve ever played it literally is the game that craps all over those people who say that games are unintelligent and that they make you unintelligent when there is heaps too think about when it comes too this game, I finished that game but I am still interested too learn more about the story because I’m sure there are alot of theory’s out there that are going too make this game stay alive. I just wanted too thank my boyfriend for buying me this game and 2K games for publishing this wonderful journey (if I may). Yes this game was an experience I would never forget and I am trying to convince my boyfriend too give it a try now.10/10 -Bree			"

												When I initially saw the trailer for this game before it came out, I was a bit put off. The trailer left me wondering ""WTF is this? Why is this a game about a city in the sky now? Where are the big daddies? What happened to the little sisters? Where's all the water? And why the ♥♥♥♥ is George Washington in this game!?So I finally purchased the game expecting to hate it, wishing through out the whole time that it was like the first 2 games. It only took about 10 minutes for all of that to go out the window. The new world  in Bioshock Infinite is beautiful. Definitely better than  Rapture. Rapture is grimy and there is very little to look at. In Colombia, the atmosphere is a lot more lively. Everywhere you turn there is something to look at, It's like a giant theme-park. Colombia is a lot more open than Rapture, so it allows for combat to be more spread out and not so in your face as in the previous 2 games. The shooting feels a lot better. At first i was a bit bummed like most players about only being able to carry 2 weapons, unlike the previous game were you could carry 8 (I think). It took me a while to see how this 2 weapon system is a lot better IMO. In Bioshock 1 & 2, I pretty much just used 2-3 weapons and it was a pain fumbling around with all the other weapons I had no interest in using. In Infinite you find a lot of the other weapons you aren't carrying around anyway, so it's not like you get stuck with crappy weapons you don't want. Plasmids are still in the game, but now called Vigors. Rather than leveling them up with Adam, you just upgrade them with money in vending machines. No big deal really. The new vending machines are an improvement over the old circus of value ones, I like them. The hacking is gone, don't really care really, after a while it became annoying in the previous games.This game is not about just eye candy, it has a fantastic story just like the previous Bioshock games.  But it does a better job at presenting it. The story is more interactive in this game than the previous, where it was pretty much all driven by the audio logs. Overall i really enjoyed the game. I finished it in 3 sittings. That is something i rarely do, I usually just play like 1/4 of the game and come back to it a few months later in episodes until i finish it. This kept my interest and never really felt dull. It is a great installment in the franchise and I can't wait to see where they take it from here.			"

												This is hands down the best fps I have played. Not only is the combat challenging yet fun, the graphics are beautiful and the storyline is absolutely incredible. Irrational Games has truly out done itself. It's hard to find a game that you can play over and over again and still be pondering about its ending. If you are looking for something to suck you in and throw a couple of twists at you on the way while exploring and checking out the lore, then get this. 10/10 (Still playing again)			"

												After 70 minutes following a white arrow, pressing keys when I was told to press them and shooting everything I came across I realised this game requires no free will on the part of the player at all.  I had no say in what happens in this game at all. I was just following instructions, no thinking required, no decision making involved.BORING!This is a game for those who are easily impressed by pretty things... Not for gamers.			"

												Firstly, I don't really enjoy first person shooters at all. But this game is so different from those! I'm so glad I decided to give it a go.With not much experience in FPS games I was struggling with the fights sometimes, there wasn't much variety in gameplay, but I didn't care, because the fantastic sceneries and the atmosphere totally got me. You start playing and you just step into another world! The graphics, the style, the story... this game is pure art. <3This is definitely one of the best games I've played. My jaw dropped not once, and not only twice... Now after the ending I have to go look for it again, wish me luck. :)			"

												Since I started gaming year 1999 this game is easily one of my top 5 best games i've ever played. The interactions between the two characters, the story, and the combat makes this a very appealing game. The last 15 minutes of the game will be a total mind♥♥♥♥ and you'll probably gonna have to visit Youtube for clarification and it will also leave you depressed and wondering how they can make dlc after it so play the dlc to find out how. Be aware that it's singleplayer only so if you're looking fo multiplayer then you're out of luck. A MUST own for everyone with amazing graphics that can be pulled off with a rather old PC. 9/10, it would be a 10/10 if not for the ending although the fact that this game has affected me so much after spending 14 hours to finish the story it has to get a high grade. Buy it now!			"

												Best game of the series so far in my opinion. One of the best games I've played story-wise, definitely in my list of top 5 best video game series stories ever. up there with Half-Life(including Portal), Mass Effect, Assassins Creed and maybe Metal GearThe mind♥♥♥♥ quality is up there with Inception, Donnie Darko, Primer, Interstellar, Matrix, etcThe original bioshock, I rated it 6/10 at the time, because it was so overwhelming to me, everything was new and weird. After playing Bioshock 2 and this. Now I understand the whole premise of the series, and finally appreciate it.10/10 Much Recommended. I can't wait for the next Bioshock. on this trend I'm gonna have to rate the next one 12/10			"

												This game is perfect for you if you are a fan of really great world and story. You can start with this Bioshock game or with previous ones. You can understand the story without playing Bioshock 1&2 but there are some elements connected with previous games (especially in Burial At Sea DLC). If you want understand the story you should listen to audio journals. Elisabeth might become your favourite video game character ever. The gameplay itself maybe a little bit tiring especially after the first half of the game (a lot of enemies). Personally I love this game and would recommend 10/10.			"

 Bioshock Infinite  The third part of this series considered to be one of my favorite games and why, let me explain to you. The story itself is brilliantly written the same as the characteristics of the major characters. The main character is Booker DeWitt who was a detective in Pinkerton agency. Our hero Going to Columbia on a mission to save a girl and pay off debts. The graphics are very pretty but the biggest role in my opinion, plays here the lighting is simply wonderful.Textures are nice but only on the main characters, ordinary residents, guards, etc... does not differ much from each other. The area on which we will give you a lot of freedom of action and the possibility of exploration btw. in the major areas will move on the ribbons with the help of the hook attached to the wrist. To survive we will use different types of weapons and vigors and the hook which also giving us a food melee weapon and nicely executed finishes. I recommend this game to all, this game is not that difficult but it is not that easy, and for demanding i recommend ""1999 Mode"". :)  "

												boy oh boy where do i start Visuals + Even tho i played on medium, the game still looks AMAZING. i didnt experience any fps drops. (Capped 60)- If you watched the gameplay trailer for this, it looks really diffrent from the game you're gonna play. I never watched it, so its okay for me.10/10 Story + Amazing story. it kept me hooked and i always wondered what's gonna happen next.+ There are some choices you can make, but its very limited. i wouldn't mind more choices (imo)- There's no real other character other than Booker,Elizabeth and Comstock.(Sure, there's Slate and fitzroy etc. but they really dont have personalities and they just advance the plot.)This doesn't bother me much, the game is amazing anyway. - The ending is confusing af9.7/10 Gameplay You can carry 2 weapons at once, and you have a melee weapon wich you can't equip. And vigors. These are basically spell like things. they cost salt, (mana) there's 8 of them and they unlock throughout the game. You can upgrade all of these by spending money.If i go on like this, this is gonna turn into a guide so...+ Weapons, there aren't many of them, but i used all of them at some point. Because...Ammo!Finding ammo is hard. you can loot ammo on guys u killed but it doesnt drop a lot. Even if it does most of the time its not for the weapons you have. So even tho some weapons are really OP (yes, i'm looking at you hand cannon) you cant always use them. this was a good move imo.+ gunfights are good+ Loot system wich is fun+ New game+ option wich i like- control's are a bit diffrent from a classic FPS if this is your first Bioshock game. (Z for aim down sites etc.) but you can easily change it. - IRRATIONAL GAMES, YOU HAD THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE THIS GAME AN OPEN WORLD. I mean look at the city. It's AMAZING, yet we dont get to explore it ? we even have the railroad things to move around quickly. This could've been game changing, and could've made this game the best game i ever played. (its still in top 5 tough)9/10 Elizabeth ''Dude this is the best companion ever''-me+ Congrats to irrational games for really nailing this.As we know from RPG's, escort missions can be really,really BORING. Can you imagine how bad this game would be if this was the case? since she's like %80 of the game.+ Her dialog is very good. She doesnt sound generic and boring. +During battle, she will supply you with ammo,health kits and salts. and money if she finds some, while you're safe.SPOILER+Also,she can drag weapons,medical supplies,some additional cover,turrets etc. from other dimensions via tears she can open.END OF SPOILER LOL10/10 Overall 96/100 Easily one of the best games i have ever played.

												Bring us the girl. Wipe away the debt.Bioshock Infinite is a fantastic First-Person shooter in the sense that it has fun gameplay with a strong narrative behind it,driving the game forward. You take the role as Booker Dewitt, a man we know nothing about, and you are asked to find the girl and if done so, you will wipe away the debt. The story seems to be simple but as the game goes along, it gets more intricate and by the end it had me in awe. Even the second time around. The dialogue and voice acting is some of the best I have ever heard (Troy Baker is God) and it really helps immerse the player into the world of Columbia. I found myself finding and playing every single voxophone, small voice recordings of characters, because I loved the side/back stories behind all the characters introduced.Elizabeth, the girl, is a strong female lead for the game because she is very likable. She has some great AI mechanics which do not hinder the fastpaced gameplay but instead make it more interesting and fun as Elizabeth throws whatever she can at your aid to benefit you. The gun mechanics feel very smooth and the added Vigors allow more variety to be in play from ""shock powers"" to ""calling in a swarm of crows"" powers and it really helps make the game so much more fun. Another aspect which makes the game so much fun is introduced a little into the game and it is the skylines. The skylines allow the player to ride above the ground and land off and attack or flank enemies from all over the area. The main story clocked in for me at about nine hours which I think was the perfect length for a game like this. I played the game originally when it released on the Playstation 3 and I enjoyed the feel of the game a whole lot more on PC. It runs better, it looks better, it plays better, it feels better, and it is better on the PC than the consoles. With some great dialogue, an intriguing story that keeps unraveling until the very end, and some very fun first person shooter combat, Bioshock Infinite is just one fantastic game. 9/10			"

												Wow.That's all I could say when I finished the game, this wasn't just another game, it was an experience, one of the best gaming experiences I've had yet.I loved the first two Bioshock games, but after several hours, rapture began to feel repetitive even it was an unique and interesting enviroment.Bioshock Infinite doesn't suffer from this problem at all, Columbia feels vibrant, alive and unique without dragging on one aspect from the city too long.Many will say that they feared that the FPS genre had reached it's capabilities, but this game is ""the savior of FPSs"" we've been waiting for, I think this game will reach the legendary status of Half Life 2 and the original Deus Ex.Every part of Columbia has a story to tell, even the restrooms!Let's take the restrooms for example here, the game is set in 1912 and the city of Columbia is an attempt to realise the American Dream, but the city relies heavily on immigrant workforces, while the well situated citizens have restrooms that looks almost like a palace, the restrooms of the african and asain workers are just tiles and broken sinks.There is also a ton of propaganda, posters and art all around Columbia which all serve a purpose and make the game even more immersive.The gameplay feels fluent and well executed, especially in the larger battles where you can jump on the so called ""sky-lines"" to soar across the battliefield and strike foes from above or even shoot them while riding the sky-line.The enemy AI isn't dumb either, they will follow you on sky-lines and try to block your way, handymen will even electrocute the whole line to force you off.The weapons and vigors (plasmids) also work great and a lot of combinations are possible, you could for instance lift a whole group of foes up in the air with the ""Bucking Bronco"" vigor and then let a swarm of vicious crows loose on them, and if you want you can lights said crown on fire as well!I've said ""no game is perfect"" many times, but I can't really come up with anything that this game doesn't execute well.10/10, absolutely worth every penny if you're a FPS lover or a sucker for an amazing story!

												I have to say, without further adue, this game is above a decent level. However, I do have my problems with it, coming from a Bioshock 1 fan. I find the openness of the environment to be tiresome, I see many opportunities for this game to be completed easily - especially then atleast at a medium or hard mode.  As I played it, I found the plot to become more and more predictable. I felt as if the concept of Columbia being a bigger wonder than Rapture, yet not being featured as a first game in the series, was sort of confusing. They harness the same knowledge as the founders of Rapture, hell, maybe even more, and they've built a city in the skies... I truly hope there will be a Bioshock 3 and that Infinite is simply a spin-off. I liked the combat mechanics alot. I have to say though - what I truly am thankful for is that I got this on sale, and I'm sorry to bring such a negative review to such talented devs, but this game is not in my taste.			"

												I am not a FPS person, but the Bioshock series is the only FPS series that I like to play.Infinite is different than the previous games when you look at the atmosphere. It is still in an Art Deco setting, but it seems to be a lot brighter at first sight. But it gets darker when you get more into the storyline.I liked the graphics and artstyle a lot. I love the city of Columbia. And you can fly around on a rails through the city, how cool is that?The story is very interesting as well. It is quite complicated, but when you progress you can understand it a lot better. I also think that Elizabeth is a good sidekick, she was quite helpful to me (as a FPS noob hehe). The vigours are a good addition as well, in my opinion.And the DLC are good to play as well. They are not superlong, but give you a better insight of the story.Would I recommend this game? Yes, definitely! My rating for this game: 9/10.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is one of those games where you start playing and you quickly lose track of time because of how much you enjoy the game.+ The gameplay is fantastic, you several special abilities (Vigor's) to use as well as an assortment of weapons to switch between that doesn't get boring+ Skyhooking everywhere is fun+ The plot is amazing and captivating, and the ending will leave you in a stupor much like Inception+ The character developement is awesome, between Booker, the Twins, Elizabeth <3, and even Comstock, the game does an amazing job of getting you to like and hate certain characters+ Imagine you're playing kill the Westboro Baptist Church members simulatorI wanted to play it again after I played through the rest of the Bioshock family in order like my friends recommend, but I eventually got too lazy and distracted as other games came out, but I definitely regret not going back and doing that.9/10			"

												After the great Bioshock (one of my most favourite games of all times) and a quite mediocre Bioshock 2 I was curious if Bioshock Infinite would be so amazing as the previews mentioned. Now I am glad I just bought it on Steam Autumn Sale for less than 10 €...Bioshock 3 is a shooter, quite different from the previous titles. By the setting in a town, floating in the sky, it lost all of it's dark and terrifying atmosphere which made Bioshock once so great.So let's start by the good things:Bioshock 3 isn't bad at all. Technical:Graphically fitting you walk through a shiny world, see scyscrapers and go by the sky-line railsystem from platform to the other. I played the game with highest graphics, but it is only mediocre. Sound is ok, but not overwhelming.Fighting:Weapons are varying and for every taste you get some weapons. In my case the huntsman carbine and the pig flak volley gun... *cough*Enemies act not too stupid. Only few enemy types.The vigors, Jedi-like forces that support in quite funny ways, are quite different and function quite good. Story:The story seems easy at the start, but gets very twisted later. You might need more than playthrough to get everything of the story. Some few hidden places you can find while playing, giving you special equipment like hats and stuff.Now the bad things:I am totally disappointed. Forget the trailers...Technical:Graphically it is ok, but that's it. Nothing special.Another nuisance is the ""invisible wall"". In games from the 1990's an invisible wall as level-border can be accepted. In games from 2012/2013 NOT. Dear programmers, do me a favour: stop creating the illusion I could walk somewhere when I CAN'T!Fighting:Fights are mostly too chaotic. And the enemies can see through walls (in some cases also SHOOT through walls...).A lot of vigors, the half of it would have been already enough. I just used shock jockey, possession (only at the last airship level) and devil's kiss (which traps didn't work sometimes....). The rest is a nice idea. I missed a freezing power. Oh wait... THAT you get in a dlc. Amazing..............................Story:I enjoyed the story, it was pushing you forward, wanting to know what happens next. I really didn't expect the turns, ups and downs of the story. But the end: At first I was irritated, then thought of it all. Remebered the game.... and uninstalled. Seriously? After all these hours? Dear writers, I love good written stories. You did a pretty good job there, but this ending is the most stupid I have ever seen in a game. Ok, maybe not THE worst, but it is very close to that rank.Things that COULD have made Bioshock Infinite better:There could have been so many possibilities to play with the fear of heights of the players, but this chance was missed.I have a fear of heights, but wasn't one time afraid of falling down somewhere.Bugs like waving textures (really annoying in ingame-cutscenes), missing textures or missing sounds should be fixed before selling a game.Only three persons are consistant in this game, the player, Elizabeth, and the prophet. The other persons stay quite faceless.The enemies act ok, but they are all exchangable.If I hadn't bought the game on a Steam Sale, I would be now quite vexed.			"

												When I was done playing Bioshock, I'd assumed that we had a once in a decade game, and anything to come further would just be piloting off of a fluke. Bioshock 2 came along and my convictions seemed confirmed; and then this title's extremely high score was simply because of a level of funding that 2 didn't get, and I'd prepare for it to be not as great as what the 'bought reviews' might say, but still playing it out of respect to the original.I was wrong. The score is justified. It took the original and it transcended.There was a man, there was a game, there was a profound sense of satisfaction.			"

												Should you get ""Bioshock Infinite"" if you loved the previous Bioshock games? Well, maybe. Part of me is satisfied, and the other part is let down. I missed the iconic Big Daddy and Little Sisters , yet Songbird and Elizabeth were incredible characters in their own rights. ""Bioshock Infinite"" takes everything you loved from the depths of Rapture and molds it into something brilliant located in the flying city of Columbia, where a surprising sense of isolation will lure you into its world accompanied with a gorgeous visual style, unbelievably detailed textures and some of the generation's best voice acting. I still miss Rapture when I revisit Columbia, yet ""Bioshock Infinite"" is a game that pulled me in and didn't let go far after I've completed it, and that's something I love about videogames.			"

												BioShock Infinite... one of the most critically overhyped game, is THE biggest disappointment of the year for me by FAR.The game starts out very, very strong by showing you our character, Booker DeWitt and explaining why he has the mission to find a mysterious girl by the name of Elizabeth, and so is sent to the world of Columbia, a colossal city in atop the sky. I say it starts out strong is because it wastes no time in immersing you into what you immediately see a vast city filled with life and soul, but it quickly drops after you're introduced to the actual game.~Visuals           Right at the very beginning, you can see how beautiful the game is. With vibrant colors and clean textures for most of what you see. Although some items thruought the world of Columbia have muddy textures and just things that look downright lazy, it's essentially a nitpick when you see what the real focus of the game is - however those items are still present and detract from the overall ambiance. Enemy models and the such are varied throught the game when it switches the standard Columbia militia for members of a cult organization to supernatural entities.~Sound           Not much to say for this game. The game has a few ambiance setting melodies throughout to keep the mood running the way the situation calls for it, though generally you won't notice the music running in the background at all, there aren't any real unforgettable scores other than Elizabeth's Theme. The rest of the game does a fairly well job of relaying how guns work, the enemies yelling in the background mocking you, the distance of their gunshots, etc. My best mention sound wise, is the soundwork for Songbird - it is genually as creepy as the Big Daddy's cry in the original BioShock.~Gameplay            Sadly though, this is actually where the game faulters. The game quickly starts you on a shooting romp that is seemingly never ending without much variation. From the very first gunfight you have in the game, the only things that change is when you get more weapons, more vigors and Elizabeth starts using her powers, most of which, with the exception of Elizabeth, do nothing to improve the base gameplay the game has to offer.           You can use vigors (very similar to that of BioShock 1 & 2, but in here, you're better off going the ""gung ho"" way as the vigors on this game are pretty underpowered, nearly all of them, except for the ""Shock Jockey"" vigor, are damn near useless or do same thing as others do or does next to nothing at all(Lol wash away your enemies). Elizabeth presents the most to the gameplay as the game (I'm aware of the 90's mode the game has) gets incredibly easier when she tags along. Elizabeth can activate turrets, robots to help you get the enemy, decoys, cover, health, etc to help you in your battles, while there's not variation here either - it's still a welcome addition that's also pretty original in any game.           Sadly, the rest of the game can be summed up with one description: Shooting Gallery. The game literally consists of you moving from room to room in what the game tries to illusionate is an open world, but is actually a long corridor - you effectively run from room to room shooting dozens of enemies, kill them, run in a straight line to another room, kill more dozens of enemies ~ rinse and repeat. It tries to incorporate strategy by incorporating the ""Skyhook"" as a means to move about the combat area, but that only serves to be a cheap way of ""saving bullets"" and killing enemies and it generally very useless outside of combat and in areas that don't have a rail on 'em. All in all, the game was a disappointment for me as I was expecting more story and interactivity from a game that had promised just that. Instead I believe we got a game with an unsettling pace, extremely linear gameplay, a forgettable soundtrack and it was just overall a forgettable, generic experience.**Just to clear up some misconception - No, BioShock Infinite is not a bad game. It's not inherently broken or buggy (PC wise, it's actually one of the better ports out there), this is just what it is, an opinion, to me this game was one of the most repetitive experiences I've had this year and the story bits were too scarce for me to really get into it. I don't have fun mindlessly shooting wave after wave of enemies, if you do, then by all means get the game.			"

												I know I am in the minority on this one but this game did not rub me the right way. I loved the first game for its atmosphere, art style, open eneded level design and perk presence. This game feels weaker in all of those regards in exchange for a more  engaging story, gun focassed combat and linear set pieces. Its not the Bioshock I fell in love with and frankly, I found the game to be dull and a bit to linear.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is the third in the Bioshock trilogy, bringing to a close the story of our Protagonist. A Steampunk-styled, dystopian alternate universe; However, instead of traveling to city at the bottom of the ocean, you are transported to a sky city where everything is Heaven-flavored, that is until it all goes to Hell. Fast. I have to admit, I sort of fell in love with the series after a short time playing the very first Bioshock. I found myself wanting to immerse myself in the story and learn all I could, while trying to survive not only the hidden things lurking around corners, but the scattered people who seem to have gone completely insane. This Bioshock was different. In this, the people of the sky city are told by their rulers, whom they almost seem to worship, that you are The Marked One, who must be killed. So instead of encountering people who are completely insane, you are chased, cornered, and attacked by people of thinly veiled sanity, from a once seemingly utopian society. I would recommend this game, as well as the entire Trilogy, as it was fun, exciting, and worth at least a playthough.			"

												If it weren't a BioShock game, I might have liked it better.I'll skip the poetic details and get straight into my gripes, in no specific order:-Repetitive gameplay that provides little challenge, even on the hardest difficulty.-Extremely linear level design that provides no challenge for advancing the game.-Whereas the previous BioShock games had level design that could convincable be used as a city, Infinite's Columbia wouldn't be mistaken for an actual city in a hundred years. Each area was clearly designed solely to be a combat arena, with the mere aesthetic of a city.-Boring, generic characters that all fit at least one archetypical mold.-The story, though sort of interesting in its own right, was predictable, anticlimactic, and ultimately strayed too far from the original BioShock storyline.-The ""vigors"" we too powerful, the AI was unintelligent, and the weapon/""vigor"" upgrade system was way too easy to access, all of which leads back into the point of unchallenging gameplay.-The hacking system has been removed entirely.-Alternate Ammo Types have been removed (the Vox Varients could arguably be ""ammo types,"" but that's stretching it).-The shield system makes the game very easy (ProTip: Invest in shields, not HP. Shields regenerate).-When your health does manage to get too low, you have to rely on Elizibeth for aid, because Health Packs have been removed.-Elizibeth's ability to open ""tears"" that give you another advantage in the fight were pure cheese.-Most of the weapons were far outshined by other weapons (I used the Carbine and Triple-R the whole game).-The ""Equipment System"" is a crappy reissue (downgrade, imo) of the Gene Tonic system.-The ""Boss Enemies"" are not a challenge.-There was only one real boss fight (two, if you count that the same boss is used twice).and lastly, and most firmly,-The Skylines. Whilst on them, you are practically invulnerable. When diving from them, your attack is a one hit kill. If a Skyline is in one of the fighting areas, I cheesed it to no end because why shouldn't I? That's what it's there for.All in all, the game would have been better had it not been called a BioShock game, but that only alleviates any problems I had with story and/or systems crossed over from previous games being changed for the worse (gene tonics to equipment, health packs to Elizibeth giving you health, etc.). The DLCs are actually more fun than the base game, but they are woefully short.I would recommend this game to Matthew Perry, the actor that portrayed Chandler in the extremely over-rated SitCom ""FRIENDS.""I hate Matthew Perry.

												Bioshock infinite is one of the few games that can be called a masterpiece, the settings, story and characters are all perfectly done and you will be asking yourself the how's and why's long after the game is finished. Gameplay is fun with cool things like vigors and skylines, as well as interesting enemies like handymen and motorised patriots. The DLC's tie in Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite nicely, bringing a well rounded game and series to a close.			"

												As a gamer, I was of course excited to hear about another BioShock title in development, but I was skeptical towards its potential success. Upon release, BioShock: Infinite was praised with positive reviews that I personally noted, but they did not alter my skepticism. How wrong was I? Completely. Totally. Utterly. Rarely does any medium of entertainment--from books to movies---challenge my perceptions or affect my emotions. BioShock: Infinite did and I'm not sure why. The game is a virtual rollercoaster ride that mixes strong dramatization, story, characters and new gameplay mechanics that build up another one of Ken Levine's twisted dystopias. The game also offers one of the most compelling non-playable characters (NPCs) to date that will ultimately lure you into the world of BioShock. The game is beautiful, varied and philosophical in its representation. BioShock: Infinite has displaced the Mass Effect series as my all-time favorite game which is a statement unto itself considering the length of one game versus a trilogy. You owe it to yourself to enjoy the BioShock experience!			"

												This game was very impressive, a great treat for anyone that likes the idea of time travel, steam punk outfits and the lifestyle or anyone who enjoys FPS. This game i felt was intirely on it's own when it came to the bioshock series introducing Elizabeth and Booker who have all these adventures through the floating city of Columbia which has alot of american history elements to the game, while playing as booker and meeting elizabeth you find out little tears that can actually stop time and go further into the past but they soon find out that if you change something throughout time there is consequences. As to gameplay this game is extremly smooth running on my AMD card and i had zero issues with any part in the game, as to weapons and customizable features you can add to the weapons i thought that was really fun, using the grappling hook to travel to different parts of the world was very amusing and it can also be used as a weapon! Very enjoyable game i highly reccomend this game to all my friends and to anyone that wants to play something new! it's really worth every dollar!			"

												Visually stunning and there are areas you enter that make you stand and just take it all in. Without a word of a lie, the music and visuals in the first main room took my breath way. My first walk in city streets left me in awe.And creepy. Do ""they"" need to look at me intensely, even as I walk away?Alas, gameplay got up my nose. Not because it was overly difficult but because it was too cluttered. There were certain scenes that completely flumoxed me because I simply could not see or identify what was going on. OK, I am ""older"" than the average FPS gamer so hamfisted and blurred vision after 1 or 2 scotches is quite common but I just can't escape the fact that I stopped wanting to play extended sessions because it became too much.Some really scary moments if you're not careful and a clever story line with some rather crude references to some belief systems. Some conjecture was raised about racism on the Steam forums but they were taken out of context. Such references imho, acutely remind us of the past and must be seen for what they are.I had some issue with the controls for quite sometime. Coming from Bioshock, I was pressing keys ""instinctively"" in some fight scenes and it made it harder than it could have been. Weapon selection and ""plasmid"" selection tripped me up more than once. Some keys were even difficult to get to when it was full on. (tbh, I didn't check if there was an ability to change bindings and if there is, some may chose to for reasons just mentioned.)One small point if I may, weapon choices started to get silly. When entering a hostile area, the weapon ""choice"" offered sort of gave away what was coming so the element of surprise was taken away. I repeatedly found myself sticking with the carbine and the sniper rifle and not bothering much with some ""ïnteresting"" weapons that just didn't do the damage I expected given their implied ""awesomeness"". This was a let down in my view.Even some of the choices of the ""secondary weapon""system"" became confusing and I found I stopped using them at times because the effects were marginal or even completely unknown.All in all, a good game, beautifully presented and it held a special fascination for me. I just wish the playing field was a little less cluttered but perhaps, given other highly regarded reviews, it's just my age showing through.Pretty intense at times and without giving away too much, employing ""AI"" to assist at times was very well done. 8.5/10gg			"

												BioShock Infinite, yet another game in the beloved BioShock series.  Or is it?The game is set in the year 1912.  Booker Dewitt accepts a job to travel to Columbia, a city suspended in the air, in order to retrieve a girl (Elizabeth) and wipe away his ""debts"".  I don't know how much else I can say without spoiling some bits, so I'll just get right into the review.You see, Inifinite not only has a different setting.  It's very, very different to the first two games, in fact.  So different to the point where one could easily say that it's just a game that only has a different, original setting (as well as some lovely throwback references to the series) in common with it's franchise.  That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the game and find it to be a great addition.The game itself is fantastic.  The story was good, combat was quite good, the setting was fantastic and I found myself enjoying the characters (Elizabeth, The Lutece Twins and Songbird were probably my favourites.  Yes, even Songbird).One who tries to play this game as if it were the original BioShock (or the second) will not do too well.  This game is more of an open-ish world shooter with large areas to move around while in combat.  As well as this, the player can utilize Columbia's transport system (Sky-Lines, metal lines that one can traverse with a grappeling hook) to fight foes and move around the city.  It's a cool feature in general.When watching the game be played, the main fear I had was that Elizabeth would be constantly forced as a character I desperately needed to care about.  While this is true in some respects, I didn't neccesarily find her overbearing.  In fact, I began to enjoy her company as well as the character throughout the game.  That being said, though, she definitely isn't a companion; more of a follower.One thing to note is that you can no longer carry more than two weapons.  Apparently the downloadable-content ""Burial at Sea"" allows this once again as the player returns to the city of Rapture but since this is about the main game I'll just say it's a bit of a letdown.  I'm not thrilled that the change was made, but it's not something I believe you should focus on.Another thing to note is that the little ""boss"" characters that the character finds throughout the game aren't utilized very well.  I find that they're nowhere near as memorable as the Big Daddy characters that the player encounters in the first game.  It's a letdown indeed.  That brings me onto another topic; Plasmids.  Plasmids, or ""Vigors"" as they are now called, just aren't as memorable as the ones you encounter in Rapture.  On top of that, I only found myself using two or three of them on a regular basis compared to the first two games where I would use a wide variety.To sum it up, this is a good game that should keep you occupied.  If you're one who likes to play through games multiple times once you get it I'm sure this could keep you entertained for a while.  That being said, I still can't overcome my biased attitude towards the first game in the series and would definitely reccommend that, if you're willing to pay for this game, you at least consider getting the first one as well.

The video above is my impressions of BURIAL AT SEA PART 2! and not of the Core infinite game.Bioshock infinite as a whole is a quality game, with break taking visuals and amazing sound assets. The story will leave you awe struck, as the characters are interesting and well fleshed out.The expansions of this game will vary in quality.Burial at seas pt.1:This expansion was interesting, I enjoyed it quite a lot. It's really more of the same, but with an expanded story and it takes place in the good ol' Rapture!Burial at seas pt.2:This installment in my opinion was more interesting than pt.1. Though both good on their own, part 2 mixed this up by focusing on stealth, and allowing you to play from Elizabeth's perspective.Clash in the Clouds:This is ok. It's nothing to right home about. Basically an arena style arcade version of the core. Allows you to keep fighting and keep upgrading for ever. Alright if you are hooked to the combat of this game, but otherwise, kind of a filler.Overall the core game is fantastic, and the expansion pack not too shabby.			"

												Quedé completamente fascinado con el juego. Es sublime tanto gráfica como artísticamente, se nota enseguida que es una obra maestra. El modelado y la IA de Elizabeth son tremendos.El gameplay es genial, no aburre. Los plásmidos esta vez son menos pero se pueden combinar mejor y tienen un modo de uso alternativo. Hay suficientes armas, aunque sólo podés llevar dos a la vez. El juego en hard es muy complicado en momentos puntuales, lo que a mi gusto le suma puntos. Luego de pasarlo se desbloquea el modo 1999, un reto que le otorga rejugabilidad.La trama atrapa enseguida. Hay grandes momentos con grandes personajes y muy buenos diálogos. El final... el final es de los mejores que tuve el placer de ver, me dejó con la pija en mano.Claramente está a un nivel superior a la mayoría de los juegos. Se nota que está muy cuidado. Seguramente se convierta en un juego de culto. Ken Levine lo volvió a hacer.			"

												Querida gente, me gustaria presentarles bioshock infinite.Para dejar libre de spoilers solo puedo decirlos en que es una experiencia al fondo y mas alla de lo posiblemente razonable en estas eras, un juego que brilla por su complejidad, por su cantidad de tension emocional, y por una historia mas alla de lo comprensible.de seguro ya sabran que es un juego sobre la ciudad columbia, una ciudad voladora, donde te ponen en la piel de booker dewitt, para buscar a una niña, ELLIZABETH, para terminar una deudasi les digo algo, es que una vez que terminas este juego, sabes que nada es lo que creias que era, nada, desde la religion, la ciencia, la politica, y el trauma de un hombre, por hacer lo indudable, por las premocioniones de una persona, por vender a su hija, por todo el centro, cuando uno logra darse cuenta a finales del juego que tu eres el centro, es impensable como una historia tan compleja se divide en 2 lineas temporales que crean un circulo infinito donde alguien intentta encontrar la redemcion, pero que falla siempre y el mundo decae ante su incompetencia, como logra darse cuenta quien fue quien es y  que hizo, que sus recuerdos se borran a la linea temporal, la relacion que haces con ellizabeth, es tmuy profunda, y al conclusion rompe esta relacion a uno de los finales, no AL FINAL MAS ESPECTACULAR EN UN VIDEOJUEGO, donde se solidifica que era el todo y como es tan inteligente la historia que logra explicar la primera entrega de bioshock, explica infinite, explica las lineas temporales, hasta lo mas basico como quien eres tu, y como sabes que para lograr acabar el loop infinito de dolor, es siendo bautizado en las aguas puras hasta que estas llenen tus pulmones.bioshock infinite usa mcuhos temas y lo tratas de forma impecable.Politica,Redemcion,Ciencia,Fisica,Teorias combinandolo con la Fé,Las premoniciones, y encadenando esas preguntas tan vanales en una respuesta hecha con una tinta jamás vista por tus ojos, el juego va mas alla que eso. es tan emocional, y tan impactante.Finalmente mi veredicto es chorrosientas estrellas 20.000 awards pero hablando enserio, es de esos juegos que debes jugar antes de morir, de esos que cuando en 200 años mas hablen de videojuegos, la saga BioShock Sea el pilar mas culminante y brillante hasta ahora, y esque las palabras no explican lo brillante que este videojuego es, debes jugarlo por ti mismo.te advierto que es dificil, y es muy complejo, ademas que aborda temas que edades muy cortas no entenderian, llamarlo una obra de arte es desprestigiarlo, es mucho mas que eso, es la obra culminante de un artista que ha emprendido todo un viaje para terminar su obra.10/10. MEJOR JUEGO DEL AÑO ADELANTADO. Espinazos en la espalda garantizados, Lagrimas garantizadas, Accion garantizadas, argumento increible y brillante garantizado, Una experiencia que sea tan increible, que probablemente se tache a fuego en tu mente, como una experiencia inolvidable 100% GARANTIZADO!

BioShock Infinite is a splendid experience: From its intriguing, beautifully crafted opening with its ferly images and haunting music - to its amazing finale: a memorable work of art. It tells a very fantastical tale, laden with philosophy and other famous human labyrinths. It begins mysteriously and soon shows a wondrous world of colorful fancy; yet, very soon once again, this lovely world reveals its sad, painful secrets; and then, as we get to know the characters and their motivations, their hopes, their fears, we find a tale that is touched by sorrow and longings for redemption or freedom. But there is something more... Its secrets are unveiled eventually, yet we are still left with so much that is shattered, and which we must put back together. When the world is torn by hands that touch other worlds, other times, this tale begins to tear the heart too, ever so slowly. In the end, the lives here woven together, the truths gleaned or disinterred, the frailty of it all - lead to an astonishing epilogue that, for all its perplexities and sorrows, all its aesthetic or poetic beauties and its dark paradoxes, is very splendid.There are certain scenes, meetings, conversations, revelations, atmospheres, pains, smiles, sounds, tunes, compositions of horizon and voice, which alone are of great artistic beauty. And, as a whole, with its superb visual design, its excellent soundtrack, its interesting world, its plot with so much fantasy and so much humanity, its dramatic might, and its characters, or some characters I came to care about, BioShock Infinite is a very intense experience whose impressions may well be indelible.

												BLEW MY MIND!!The game itself is linear, bog standard gunplay, generic guns. Plasmids, plasmid upgrades and weapon upgrades whilst helpful play no bearing on progress or the style in which you would attempt to play through the game. This isn't the spiritual successor to System Shock 2, it's not even the spiritual seccessor to Bioshock, it's a Shock game in name only in my opinion...rapture references, plasmids, steampunk and noir stylings notwithstanding.It excels however in storytelling, serving up an experience drenched in art and design stylings which are arguably as good as it gets. This is flanked by one of the best looking and best optimised engines I think I've seen of late. Cities in the clouds, beeches, shantytowns, factories, Rapture are all brought to life with vibrant lighting and visual effects. Every scene is a picture postcard, breathing.....alive.Small moments in game such as when you first meet Elizabeth. She's painting a picture of the Eiffel tower in France but after pondering the results of her picture instead decides to open a ""tear"" in space and time and as you look through the ""tear"" Tears for Fears can be heard blaring amongst the background hustle and bustle of a Parisian street, Return of the Jedi is shown as playing at a cinema on said street. Bioshock Infinite overflows with moments such as this and the result is that it elevates a fairly average, linear FPS to a captivating, involving experience.The ending pretty much cements any positive opinions I had on the game, it made my head spin, it was unexpected, satisfying, borderline perfect actually.

												This is probably the best game in the world. That's not to say everyone will love it. I think almost everyone can gain something from playing this game. It is first and foremost an excellent shooter game. I'm no legend in FPS games, in fact I pretty much suck. I played it at default difficulty and the game provided a consistent challenge, but never felt impossible. The learning curve might be a tiny bit steep for players new to Bioshock or FPSs. However the game does an excellent job of introducing you to these gameplay elements, without drawing you out of the environment. And oh, what an environment it is.The game is about a year and 6 months old now, and the version I played during Turkey Weekend 2014 was remarkably stable. There were maybe two or three minor visual bugs, and one instance where I had to reload a checkpoint to continue. That's literally it for errors, everything else was flawlessly executed. Graphically, a quad-core processor and budget video card will let you set the quality to max visuals. I recommend this, because it's an important part of playing the game. Really, do play this game on PC, at max settings. You do yourself a disservice otherwise.To say it is art is to damn it with faint praise.Bioshock Infinite is beautiful. It's like a painting in motion; a world of wonder brought to life in vivid color and ethereal light. The city of Columbia is brimming with breathtaking imagery, particularly during the first half of the game. Shafts of soft light fall on pools of water that ripple in realistic fashion; water that casts reflections on nearby surfaces. Anyone who has been to an indoor pool knows this visual phenomena. There are moments where I had to stop and just admire how gorgeous everything was. In that respect it's unlike any game I've ever played.These sumtuous visuals are complemented with excellent sound engineering and a terrific music score. The careful listener will much enjoy some clever musical arrangements. Everything is voice-acted, and that too has been done with care. The voice actors for the protagonist, Booker DeWitt, and his companion Elizabeth, are excellent. Troy Baker, Booker's voice actor, did a particularly fine job of fitting his voice to the era. There is frequent dialogue between Booker and Elizabeth; these conversations provide a level of intimacy that is all too frequently absent from games with a narrative.In short I can't recommend this game enough. It's like a book you can immerse yourself in. Provides a solid 15-20 hours of play. It's actually worth $50, but if you can get it on sale, do. This review can't do it justice. You have to experience it.			"

												This game is the most amazing game I've ever played. BioShock Infinite has such an amazing story that can keep you up late at night just thinking about it. Surreal graphics, interesting character development, and not to mention some badass female characters. If you don't have this game, then buy it. Don't even think about pirating such an amazing game because the money is well worth it.			"

And when the end dropped, i was flashed!It connects the first 2 games  into an amazing triology and the DLCs ""Burial at Sea"" are more story than gameplaybut in my opinion superb dlcs!

THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVEI remember playing this game this pas summer and my mind was absolutely blown by the story. I'm not going to spoil anything but if you have never played this game and it's on sale, BUY IT. Trust me you will not regrett playing it. It took me about 8 sweet hours to complete the story and that is because i just wanted to do the story, i did not do anything else on the side such as exploring the world. The world is breathtaking. The graphics are 10/10. Runs smooth like butter on my GTX 980 on ultra graphics.Smart AI, Interesting types of enemies, amazing gunplay, fu**ing 10/10 music, etc.. This is just the top of the iceberg, there is so much more to this game and i feel like i can't put some of the things to words.In my 8-9 hours of gameplay i did not see any FPS drops or frozen moments. The game runs at a consistant FPS and never drops. Honestly i don't have any complains about the game. The only thing i would want is being able to carry more than 2 weapons at a time. Thats the only thing honestly and even that is not noticable unless you don't know which guns are the most powerful.Overall 10/10 game would play again "

												Some people say its the worst game in the bioshock triplet and they maybe right, because the first two were too damn good.But some people even say this game isn't worth playing compared to the other parts of the series.But that isn't right.This game offers everything i loved in the other bioshock games: a unique setting, an interesting story, nice visuals (not as outstanding for its time like bioshock 1, but who cares? still good), surprisingly many ways to play the game and some really good voice actors (at least if you play the game in the original language).If you come from other shootergames you may be surprised of the length of the story, another pro.Bioshock infinite offers some funny mechanics, with even more possibilities as in the first two games, simply because of yoour new friend: the hook.Also, its another game i would recommend to play a second time, not just for the achievements, but also to discover some more little twists in the awesome plot you don't get on the first run.After all, i would give 9/10 points for Bioshock Infinite, just to show there is allways the possibility to get better.

												This series is more story than game at this point. I felt like I was shooting enemies just so I could earn the next bit of exposition at times. One of the criticisms leveled against the first Bioshock was the drop in quality during the third act, after the climax. Infinite attempts to address this by ending the base campaign right after the appropriate moment. Those unhappy with the ending are welcome to try the DLC, although I doubt anyone looking for a happy ending will be satisfied with that either. I like sad stories so of course I thoroughly enjoyed it. As always, the value here depends heavily on your expectations. I have to agree with zero punctuation on this one - it's not perfect, you can point out the flaws, but its way more ambitious than most anything else that came out in the same year, which makes it GOTY. Sad that it didn't make enough money to keep the devs in business. AAA games may have to take a rest until they find a business model.			"

												BioShock Infinite is one of those games that you must play before you die, whether you are a fan of the FPS genre or not. The gameplay may be lacking in some parts if you compare it to the previous two titles (BioShock 1 in particular since both 1 and Infinite were made by Irrational), but it still provides a unique experience that you can't find in other shooter games. The story is also compelling enough to keep you interested. The concept of parallel universes, constants and variables can get very confusing down the line, and eventually you'll be left with feelings like ""WTF just happened"". But once you understand it, you can appreciate the story for what it is, and maybe even want more. The two central characters, Booker and Elizabeth, are also very well-designed. Troy Baker and Courtnee Draper's voice acting is top-notch. They really bring the characters to life, leaving a very good impression in the players.All in all, this game deserves to be called a masterpiece. 10/10, no discussion. Thank you Irrational and Ken Levine for making this game. Hope to see more projects from you guys in the future.			"

												Coming from someone who's beaten this game about 3 or 4 times now, with having beaten it very recently, I can definitely give this game two thumbs up from me! BioShock Infinite serves as an excellent addition to the BioShock franchise and if I must say, has become my favorite game of the series. It's a game that has an excellent story, interesting and loveable characters, amazing settings, and more. With the previous two games having both taken place in the underwater city of Rapture, it's nice to see this game take a departure from there and instead, having it take place a completely brand new, different setting, which is the floating city of Columbia. I also enjoyed the game's soundtrack and as well, was taken in by the graphics of the game. It isn't the top of the line realism graphics, but graphics that I find to be quite beautiful. And then there's Elizabeth! She has to be one of my favorite companions of any game. I could honestly go on about her for ages, but in short, she's a character I easily grew to love and who has a very interesting personality, as well as backstory. As well, a companion who is actually seems real as opposed to a not so smart AI. One of my favorite things of this game though is that the city of Columbia as a whole and it's people, as well as so much of the game taking place in bright settings like outside and such, at first glance, it seems like one of those bright, positive games. While this game does have it's brighter, cheerful moments, underneath all that, at the core, I believe BioShock Infinite to be a darker game, when you consider certain parts of the storyline and such, especially when delving deep into the story. Overall, I've had loads of fun playing this game and think it to be a masterpiece of a game, if I do say so myself. I'd recommend this game to anyone without second thoughts!			"

												As rich as the Rapture environement was in the first two installments, Columbia is even more so. Interacting with the NPC's feels natural almost to the point of being creepy. There is a ""Stepford"" feel to the citizens of Columbia.

												Bioshock Infinite is a memorable action game that is somewhat let down by its game mechanics and story.Let get this clear: the world that Bioshock Infinite presents is truly breathtaking as if the creators knew exactly what people had in mind when they imagined a city above the clouds. The city of Columbia is a marvel to look at, and its exploration stays enjoyable until the very end of the game. It is a breathing, living world that really makes this game remarkable and for this reason alone I recommend getting the game and playing through it at least once.However, I wish I could say the same things about the gameplay and the story. While the skyrail is a joy to use, the shooting simply does not feel satisfying and the enemies are too bullet-spongy. Even though you gain superhuman powers throughout the course of the game, you simply do not feel powerful.It doesn't help that I played the game on 1999 mode which in itself, is a joke, because there is simply nothing ""1999ish"" about it. Your health regenerates, exploration for ammo and health is very limited, and the checkpoint system also does not improve on the situation. The developers thought they made this mode harder because you can only die a number of times (I'm not sure if I remember this correctly), but you can easily cheat the system if you just reload the checkpoint before the death animation finishes. Sure, you could spam the quicksave-quickload buttons back in 1999, but you still were on the edge of your seat due to conserving ammo and health.(Not to mention the fact that every time you reload the game, the item drops RANDOMIZE. I have no idea who thought this was a good idea. Sure, some bullets or health here and there could vary I guess, but even the gameplay-affecting modifiers too?)The story, while it starts out strong, it gets way too stuck up its own ♥♥♥ towards the end of the game. While I enjoy a complex story and even the dimension-jumping element was a good surprise ( I also managed to get around 70 of the audiologs), explaining what the hell happened in the last 5 minutes is not good storytelling. It seems as if the developers had all these crazy ideas what should happen throughout the campaign but ultimately failed to wrap things up nicely.Ultimately, I give this a recommendation because the game really shines in its world-building and atmosphere. If you go in expecting a remarkable if somewhat flawed shooter, you're going to get your money's worth out of Bioshock Infinite.However, if you're a Shock-fan that has played through the System Shocks and the first Bioshock, I recommend waiting for a sale.

												I just finished the last DLC of this game (Burial at Sea Episode 2), and I'm just blown away by this amazing work of art.This game is simply amazing. There will be spoilers ahead for anyone who hasn't played this yet. Story ----------------------------------Bioshock Infinite's story is possibly one of the most complex stories that I've ever encountered in a game. The whole concept of infinite universes and 'constants and variables' is an ever present theme throughout the series. After completing the base game, I was left with a few questions, but the two follow-up DLCs: Burial at Sea 1 & 2, gave me such an emotional and satisfying ending that I was left with no ill-feelings. I'll just say straight up that if you love a good story, which is so massive and complex, yet understandable, this game is perfect for you. Gameplay ----------------------------------Bioshock Infinite has some very enjoyable gameplay. Combining FPS, with rapid skylines, and vigors (special abilities), makes this game mind blowingly awesome. Every shot, every power, feels impactful. The visual detail is stunning for a game which has an almost 'cartoony' feel to it. Riding skylines, and hopping from location to location feels amazing and action-filled as you quickly hop off to take down an enemy, only to run back and swing along looking for your next target. For the more tactical players, setting off vigor traps, or possessing enemy structures can turn the tide of battle in an instant. The weapons....oh man the weapons. The time period of this game brings back all the 'old-school' weapons which have a certain kind of feel to them which can't be explained. The detail of the gun models, the sounds, the firing rate, and the damage it inflicts just gives a satisfying feeling at the end of a battle. There are all kinds of weapons for any kind of player. Snipers, pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers, and a ton more. Gameplay wise, this game deserves a playthrough at the very least...but no, there's more...Characters----------------------------------Oh my god, where do I begin?? First off, Elizabeth is possibly the most lovable, attractive, helpful character I've ever seen in a game, period.The voice actors for both Booker, and Elizabeth are simply amazing. They made the characters feel so real, so personal, and the story could not have gone anywhere without top quality voice actors.There's literally paragraphs upon paragraphs I could write about this masterpiece of a game, but no, buy this game and it's DLCs. Play it. Enjoy it. 9.9/10  I wanted Elizabeth to live :'( If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Had me since the very start and left wanting even more at the very end, so much so that I might even replay it a couple of times more.

												Good FPS game. Characters are interesting, and your side character, Elizabeth, isn't a weakling, whiner, or dies easily in battles. That's huge plus. People ooze over the narrative, especially toward the end (no spoilers), but after thinking and a second play through, it made plenty of sense and wasn't too confusing. Definitely mind blowing. If you've read Louis Jorge Borges 'Garden of Forking Paths,' this game uses the same idea. Loot is good, enemies are interesting, and dialogue works well most of the time. A good fps game worth a second run through, or a third.DLCs: haven't played but have watched. Honestly felt like the studio tried too damn hard to connect the stories of Bioshock Infinite with Bioshock, cluttering otherwise good games with a rushed and clearly unplanned ending. Ignore them unless you're interested.			"

A lighthouse, a cryptic message, and an impossible city. The stage is set for another adventure through the grim, but surprisingly sunny, world of Bioshock. The original Bioshock is a landmark in immersive videogame narrative and incredible design. It combined wonderfully designed aestethics with cool gameplay elements and a nice story to boot. For those who were truly interested there was plenty of room to explore and learn more of the fallen city of Rapture. Infinite then had a lot to live up to.Infinite takes you to the flying city of Columbia, a seceded state from early America that left the blasphemous world below behind to ascend to a plane closer to god. You're former private eye with a checkered past who is hired to retrieve a girl from this flying utopia. How hard can it be?Plenty hard. As it turns out, you're expected, and they're not happy. Inifite has you duke it out in the streets of Columbia while listening to the zealous chants of radical prophets and out of control rebels. The atmosphere is piled on at every turn and the game spares no expense to show you new and crazier things than you held possible. It is an exercise in world building of the highest order that adresses social, racial and religious themes to make you, the player, contemplate your actions and you make your way through the game. However, for all the grandeur and splendor found in its presentation, the execution leaves something to be desired. Do not misunderstand, the story unfolds perfectly and you're still given room to explore. The problem is in the gameplay. Infinite borrows much of its combat from the original Bioshock, but trims away a lot of the fat and only leaves a bare bones set of options. Most battles revolve around bullet pumping and a bit of power flailing, while the combat systems in Bioshock 2 introduced so many cool things. This is Infinite's main problem. After a few hours, the sun doesn't shine so bright anymore while you stride into another gunfight. Luckily, Infinite spares no expense to keep the pace up so you can make your way through the story at a proper pace. This makes it a game to be enjoyed for its content, while it skimps a bit on the gameplay. That said, if you fancy yourself a masochist, feel free to dive into the 1999 mode. A super hard mode that leaves you reeling if you don't prepare. That'll keep you occupied for a while. Still, Bioshock Infinite is an experience you will need to try at least once.			"

												I got it when it was $7.50 (the price one buys a game at influences their perception of it). I played it once through on hard difficulty, which took 11 hours for one playthrough. So keep that in mind for this review.Well, definitely great graphics wise. Combat feels fluid and fun, though since I played on hard I spent much of my time hiding and taking potshots at enemies. Plot is overall great for a video game, though there are a few inconsistencies that are present within the plot that is provided to you (which you can wave your hand at and still enjoy the game).The vigor system is more fun to mess with than in Bioshock; the upgraded 8th vigor is insanely good. The enemies you face are relatively smart and challenging (that siren boss killed me 20 times in a row before randomly dying (I was hiding behind a building, and suddenly she died without me doing anything)).I'd have to give it a 9.5/10. In all areas it was good, but it felt a tad short and not all that replayable (to me).			"

												A worthy successor of the first Bioshock, and at the same time a very different experience. Gameplay is impressive, skylines add even more tactics and shooting mechanics are solid. Enemy's DI is only mediocre, but lets not forget Elizabeth. She is not only interesting, living person, but she also helpful in combat. The story is there game really shines, it's really deep and combined with excellent voice acting creates an amazing atmosphere. Columbia, city in the sky, looks believable with unique visual style. And lastly, the music which simply leaves you breathless in many epic moments. 1999 difficulty is not too hard and I recommend it for a second playthough.Overall, Bioshock Infinite is my second favorite game in 2013 (close to The Last of Us).ReDiR's rating: 9.5/10			"

												Bioshock Infinite is easily one of the greatest games I've had the pleasure of playing.Graphically, it ushers in a new standard for the PC. Set in a backdrop of a 1930s city, the environment is vibrant and colorful, but not distracting towards gameplay, although the same cannot be said for the heroine Elizabeth ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°). The textures and intricate details put into the surroundings and characters allow for a spectacularly immersive experience, all the while being well optimised and running smoothly for most mid to high end computers.Just like its predecessors, the storyline for Bioshock Infinite is fairly dark. This certainly does not seem to be the case at first when you enter the idyllic, utopian city in the sky that is Coloumbia–it appears nothing like the dingy underwater city of Rapture in the past two games. However it soon becomes evident that there is much more than meets the eye.Instead of the generic, faceless protagonist in many FPS games, you play as Booker Dewitt, a man with his own agenda, motivations...and regrets. Tasked with retrieving a girl named Elizabeth from the city of Coloumbia, the two develop a complicated bond as they rely upon and learn about each other in their bid to escape from Coloumbia. There is very strong character development in both Booker and Elizabeth as the story progresses, on par with a well-written novel. The plot also progresses at a enjoyable pace with many twists along the way. Although the story is linear, there are moral choices that the player has to make along the way, and you are constantly reminded of that choice for the rest of the game. Despite several plot holes, the story was one of the best I have experienced for a video game, to the extent that I feel that the game would have remained a masterpiece even if combat gameplay was removed and it was made into a visual novel with the same cutscenes.Therein lies the only mediocre aspect of Bioshock Infinite: the actual combat. Although there are some fairly innovative features, such as shooting while moving along aerial rails at high speed, much of the FPS elements fail to leave a big impression. The weapons and abilities that you can use feel largely similar, just as most of the enemies that you fight. There seems to be little variation in tactics involved, the player simply guns baddies down from one area to the next. This is further limited by the fact that you can only have 2 weapons and 2 active abilities at a time. Combat is also hardly challenging with little disincentive to dying. On death the player respawns at the location, with only the surviving enemies from the past engagement healed–already killed enemies do not respawn. This means that you could just slowly try to kill an enemy one at a time before dying if you are having difficulty in a fight, rinse and repeat until you manage to clear it.Despite these drawbacks, I feel that Bioshock Infinite has redefined videogames and the FPS genre as a storytelling medium, and I certainly look forward to replaying it again. (In fact, this lengthy review was written in a bid to stave off that feeling of dejection that one gets after clearing a really good game/book. I hope that stands as a testament to how brilliant this game is.)10/10			"

												This is a good game on it's own. But compared to the original Bioshock and System Shock it is crap. As far as a Shock game i was very dissapointed even though I played through it twise (one time on 1999 mode, hoping for a bit of the old feel, but no).While Bishock and Systemshock feelt ""real"" and dynamic in a way few games do, Infinite feels more like a bland rail shooter. It is not really a shock game anymore, you don't even have a map! (because you don't need one in this ""corridor"" shooter!) And while the splicers in the original Bioshock feelt very thoughtout and fitting to the setting, they just copied them to what is supposed to be regular humans in Infinite, taking another well thought out game setting and turning it totally unlogical. In Bioshock, crazy splicers jumping at you in frenzy make total sense. In Infinte regular policemen doing the same, not so much. They had the good sense to not involve nps:s in the first Shock games to much, in Infinte again, they just screw it up with populating the world in some areas with these ""robots"", just taking away from the feeling this is a real place. The best things about the game are Elizabeth as a character and as an AI. Very impressive. Also the story is interesting, but not as involving as in the original Bioshock.Juding this as a stand alone game with nothing to do with the Shock series I would say it is a good game and give this a honest 7-8/10As a Shock game it is a huge dissappointment : 3/10			"

												I have to say three good things about Bioshock Infinite: it's visually gorgeous, it's very clever in terms of ambient storytelling and Elizabeth is a great charachter. But that's it... there's not a lot to say about the rest: the relation with Elizabeth was the only reason I finished the game. Problem is: just like the rest of the series, the good aspects are only  a nice dress for a linear shooting experience. Story and gameplay don't even try to reconcile and there's nothing substantial about the backstory and its ""philosophy"". It's just a convoluted excuse to blow heads off with guns and magic: the gameplay has been dumbed down for the casual crowd when compared to Bioshock 1 & 2. There's no survival or rpg-lite element. Just... shooting. The story does not make any kind of sense, but that's a given for the Bioshock series. Overall, Infinite is one of the most overrated game I ever played. Vote: 5,5			"

												This game has quite nice art/graphics. That's the only good thing I can say that did right. The gameplay is so ♥♥♥♥ing boring. Not even ""bad"", just boring. Wave of enemies come, you shot them, they drop, maybe if you are  feeling creative you can use the sky rail, but even those get boring after some hours playing this game. The vigors could be used to add more depth, but mostly all of them are just some sort of stun(so it's easier to shot your enemies!) and even the ones that aren't, are completely non-relevant to the game.Story wise, it's a really letdown. It introduces nice themes early, just to be dropped two hours later, with convoluted and shallow plot twists. Soundtrack is okay, but quite forgettable. Can't really recommend this for anyone, if you want story-driven FPS games, there's way better ones out there, like Deus Ex, Half-Life and even the first Bioshock.			"

												I know its kinda weird to write this review. first of all i've got no hours recorded on steam, second one, its already late cause it was released two years ago.but **** it i love this game. in fact i already finished it on ps3 and on pc with ""another"" versionyeah this game is remarkable, the city of colombia is so beautiful, atmospheric and mesmerizing, the setting and art style are so unique, the gameplay with combinations of arms, sky-lines and vigor is so awesome (yeah this is my first game on bioshock series).icing on the cake is the story, the story of bioshock are so unforgettable its like watching a great movie, the feeling and emotions its so real. the issues of patriotism, nationalism, racism, and religion was brought so well.you will love all the characters in this game especially the lovely Elizabeth. its like you have the bond between you as the main character (booker) with elizabeth and you understand what's her feeling and have to protect her at all cost.The best part of this game is the end of story. you're gonna be mind****** in the end. if you love some sci-fi movie like donnie darko, predestination etc, well you're gonna love this one too. the story has stirred me speechless and after i finished this game i cant stop thinking about it.This game absolutely my favorite. so thats why im bought this game (probably because it was discounted) just to write this review after such a long time. 9/10			"

												It's undeniable that the first Bioshock has advanced the narrative in this medium quite a bit, and Infinite is just another step in the right direction. Of course you get the amazing narrative you'd expect; Elizabeth is one of the best companions in gaming. The developers took their time in developing her character and build the relationship between her & Booker. A character of this quality has not been done since Half Life 2, and even then the comparison falls in Infinite's favor.The level design is another standout. The addition of the skyline was ingenious as it allowed the developers to open up the map in a way where it complimented the setting of a city in space.Superpowers, now called vigors instead of plasmids, allows the player to mix a match their play style. There's a decent selection of vigors that allows the player to experiment with certain combos and leads to some replay value. Some of the returning powers from the old game have been streamlined to allow for easier management. For example, instead of having to switch between enemy specific plasmids, the power of possession now encompasses all enemies. This aids the somewhat clumsy interface that plagued the first game.There is simply no other game like Infinite at the moment. It is frankly one of the most memorable games I've ever had the luxury of playing. Thanks to the superb narrative and game design, Infinite will sit in my mind for days to come.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is not a game about Christian fundamentalism or race relations or political extremism or expansionist wars. There’s a little bit of all of those things but not enough to be meaningful or interesting. It’s rather belittling to the seriousness of the topics that are invoked that nothing is ever done with them. I endured the entirety of this game not caring about anything that happened.Separate Bioshock Infinite from Ken Levine and Bioshock, and technically it is a fine game. Everything functions properly. Voice acting is OK. Little details in zones means there’s something cute around every corner. But these sorts of things don’t make a game a masterpiece. It just means the devs had the time and money.On top of the muddled storytelling is the rather lackluster ending that gives the impression Levine simply tried to dress up what was already a terrible, half-♥♥♥♥♥ idea with pretentious intellectualism.I wish I had played the game everyone else seems to be raving about.

												After playing this game numerous times (once on Normal, once on 1999) I can safely say it's one of the best stories of all time. The game, however, sucks.Lemmie explain. In the original Bioshock, you had 7 weapons (8 if you include the Camera) that you can carry on you at any given time. This, coupled with the 3 types of ammo for nearly every weapon, allowed you to approach situations and adjust to them as they came. In addition to the interesting weapons, their upgrades were even more fascinating. The ability to freeze somebody by smacking them over the head, then shoot them with fire bullets? Why not?! The possibilites for an interesting combat experience were endless.Bosses in the original also had depth, and were interesting characters. You knew them, you saw what they'd done, you'd heard their words, and agreed with why they must die for you to continue onwards. They also had a habbit for knowing when it was high time to fall over, meaning, after their primary mechanic was exploited, their minutes quickly became numbered, creating a fast paced, difficult, non mundane boss fighting experience. It wasn't just the bosses that died without a ridiculous amount of bullets being pumped into their face, regular enemies didn't take half a nuclear arsenal to bring down, and with good reason; they were just drug heads in t-shirts with the occasional power. Nothing more.My apologies for ranting, but there's a point to this. The reason I mentioned the previous two things in those long drawn out excuses for paragraphs it to show what Infinite is lacking. You can hold a maximum of two weapons (the melee weapon now passively always being attached) and thus decreasing the possible methods of dealing with an issue by an exponentional amount. The upgrades for weapons in Infinite are also a joke, being the standard ""Reduced Recoil, Increase Damage, Increase Ammo Capacity"". That is boring. This is why I mark off the weapon system as terrible.The second thing to complain about in this game is the combat sections (if they can even be called that). Interesting locations and cool locales taken thrown headfirst into a game of ""Who can be the biggest bullet sponge."" The enemies act with a reckless disregard for their own safety and recieve no penalty for it because they can take more hits than an IS-2 tank. It's not interesting fighting enemies who can run up to you and tank all the damage and just punch you in the face. The mess of a combat system quickly becomes a chore when you realize who Ken Levine called in when the bosses all called in sick: Handymen, a dude on fire, and a Spooky Scary Ghost. The Handymen might quite possibly be the worst enemy I have ever faced in a game (besides of course the Lopers from Return to Castle Wolfenstein). They're not enemies so much as they're trucks that can fly. They take a ridiculous amount of punishment and just don't die after being hit in the ""Weak Spot"" at least 20 times by 12 guage slugs. You also need to fight them every 10 or so minutes, so you spend 1/3 of the game playing and about 2/3s fighting these fun champs, who quickly lose appeal after the first encounter. Now onto the good part: The story. Horrible combat aside, Bioshock Infinite is a must buy. The enviroments are diverse and feel real and full of life (until you start shooting but hey then it's full of Up-Till-Recently life), the big enemies/friends you encounter all feel like part of something much bigger than yourself, and the story itself and watching Columbia fall apart is absolutely golden and shouldn't be missed.An 9/10 story coupled with 3/10 gameplay could easily total to a solid 7.5 game. Highly recommend. "

												The short: Starts out kinda slow, but it's a great alternate world of the Guilded Age that's achingly beautiful to play in. The shooting mechanic is fun but generic, as is the spellcasting/Vigors powers which is a little dissappointing. This is all secondary towards the story telling which is excellently voiced and written, though pacing in the beginning needs work. There are plot holes (the ending, the mother story thread, etc) and jarring game mechanics (Elizabeth's powers) but nothing preventing you from wanting  to see how this all unveils. For all my quibbles, it's smoothed out with the charming characters and world that Infinite presents.The Long:After 2 hours in to Infinite, I stopped playing this game. I felt bored, and as pretty as the world was presented in this wonderous alternate steam-punk reality of a cotton candied 1910-esque US, it just wasn't enought to keep me interested because I've seen this theme many times in lower detail and quality, and after 10 minutes wondering around, it all felt familiar. The clever plot points were slipped in from early on, but a bit too obvious and/or heavy handedly but at least a good attempt was made.  The gun play is typical, movement was typical, vigors/spells were unique enough but nothing unheard of. And that's when I stopped. The story was being too subtle, especially for a player like me, who wants to see all places presented, thus making the story even slower.  After some nudging from friends, I booted it back on and trudged forward. Once you meet Elizabeth, everything this world and story was building upon started to click. Factions, trials, wonders, backstory, expositories, trageties, horrors, betrayals and tender moments all come at you like a torrential storm surge, each trying to overwhelm the other in waves. Weirdly, through this maelstrom of motivations and hatched plots, the characters and why the world is the way it is, was and/or to be all make some semblance of sense, albeit broken sense if you're not caught up in the spectical/revelation and think about it a bit. The voice acting and dialog is wonderful and believable, there is chemistry between Booker and Elisabeth in their voicing and 3D depictions. You get the sense of balance between tragedy and resilience from Elisabeth, while Booker is definately a man with a past and skin he's not comfortable in anymore.The ending... I'll let you be the judge due to the nature of it. It's definitely you take what you will with it since there really isn't a proper answer besides speculation to be honest. The one the game presents is possible but flawed in my mind, but given the game's title, who am I to really judge? Play it and see if you choose to believe it as it is one of the infinite possibilities.			"

												Trying to keep this spoiler free.....I both recommend and don't recommend this game. The main issue I had was I got all 3 Bioshocks, never played them until now, so I ran through all 3 of them and Infinite is clearly the weak link and it's really not a Bioshock game.... The first 2 create this atmosphere and semi suspenseful style of gameplay. Creeping around this dark ruined city under the ocean filled with psychos and genetic freaks. You can hear them shouting their crazy phrases and your sitting there wondering ""Where the hell are they?!"". Every time you encounter a Big Daddy instantly what came to my mind was ""Awwww ♥♥♥♥♥t. Here we go!"". But in Infinite honestly it was NOTHING like the older games. Your wandering around a bright city killing random soldiers and every day people. Nothings even remotely suspenseful or similar to the first 2 games in any way shape or form. There are no Big roaming sort of bosses like in the first 2 with Big Daddies. It's basically just arena gameplay which I never played Call of Duty but it definitely felt like a generic shooter. Just run into an area and start shooting. You can clearly see they lost any element of suspense with the ridiculous introduction of a damn shield. That completely ruins any aspect of surprise because if someone catches me off guard who cares..... It didn't break through my shield and actually hurt me. What's worse is everythings shared through just generic money. Want to upgrade your powers? Use money..... Want to upgrade that weapon? Use money. Non of the upgrades ever had any actual impact on your weapons appearance like the old games. I found it hillarious using a double chamber revolver shotgun in the old ones that totes electricity through the chambers. This one you can't even hold more than 2 weapons. So why would I even care about these weapons which I'm going to have to keep swapping in and out? I can choose a favorite but this area calls for a Sniper rifle so I have to ditch one of my favorites and oh look Elizabeth tossed me a sniper rifle. I can rant forever but it's just.... .... not Bioshock. The story tries to be clever and almost mirror the events of the first game in a vague sense. But the story is just generic and kind of pretentious.			"

												Recent convo with a dear friend with questionable taste made me want to go a bit more in depth on why I have a problem with this game. Forgive my ranting, derivitive wording, and sloppy editing. Ill probably do something about that at some point in the future.Allosaurus Rex, a youtuber I quite respect, described interactive media as running on parallel lines of narrative devices and player interaction; A games predetermined narrative, the players input into the interactive gamespace, and how those two lines influence each other. If the parallel runs properly, then player input should serve as a narrative device on its own, even in a mechanically linear game. Take for example Hotline Miami, its usage of neon psychedelia and bass thumping combat queues to reinforce the players disconnect from the games violence, and binding it to the player characters own disconnect. The game uses its interactivity to reinforce the narrative and connect the player and character headspaces; The gameplay means the same to the player what the actions its portraying mean to the character. The narrative flows and the gameplay flows with it. The core thematic and narrative concept of Bioshock Infinite, as is traditional of the franchise, is the father-child relationship of the protaganist's filtered through a lens of idealistic extremism, with Randian Objectivism replaced as the focus of satire with colonial American Nationalism. The Father-Child of the story being the player character Booker and his ward Elizabeth. The scripted narrative wants us to feel connected to and ultimately protective of this ward, as the authorities want her back under their control. Protect Elizabeth, that’s the narrative line. The game itself is a linear shooter. Once combat, the gameplay proper, kicks in Elizabeth recedes to the background, immune to damage and only interacting with the player to interrupt the flow of combat to spoon-feed them health and ammo, completely ignored by enemies. That’s the player line. The parallel is obviously not well maintained. A narrative focusing entirely on a cast of two characters and their interactions and how Booker, the vehicle for the player to experience and connect to this story, grows connected to Elizabeth cannot subsist on script alone, something mechanical, something involving the player, needs to be established for that relationship to mean anything. A character as critical to the scripted narrative as Elizabeth cannot be a non-entity in gameplay. Even the excessivity of the violence becomes jarring in the games narrative context. In the original Bioshock the body count made sense within the games world; Jack was engineered to take and dole out damage, and the mentally unstable enemies made suspension of disbelief for their behavior easy, but in Infinite there’s no real logical reason that arguably rational people would be so happy to zerg rush a killing machine like Booker. Going even more basic than that, its a failure. One of the first (ultimately pointless) moral choices the player is confronted with is a pseudo-lynching of an inter-racial couple that the player is forced to participate in. You are given a ball and told to throw it at the couple. At its most basic level, a shooter requires two forms of input: aim and shoot projectiles. So when given a projectile and a target to aim at, of ♥♥♥♥ing course you make the choice with button prompts. Instead of letting the player choose this on their own, potentially letting the setting influence the choice as the pressure of the moment is on them, its reduced to binary hand holding. Without a mechanical factor to bridge the gap between player gameplay and character action, you stop being able to connect to the story as a factor in it and just become a spectator to it. You’re just shooting ♥♥♥♥, and that is a criminal waste of potential in an interactive medium. Its a sloppiness that persists even to the scripted narrative alone. Its heavily praised usage of themes like racial inequality and nationalism are barely present. Compared to real-world racism in real-world America at the time, what goes down in Columbia is tame. Barely any mention of abuse, either physical or verbal, of the black and irish underclass is present in the dialogue. And by the half-way point these ostensibly critical aspects of the game world are thrown out the window for a nonsensical many-worlds plotline that ultimately devolves into the most basic of grandfather paradoxes that uses quantum mechanics as a synonym for magic.Instead of solving the core issues with the concepts presented, like escort missions or enemy AI, the developers over-simplified or cut it out to the detriment of the narrative as a whole. This is a pretty consistent issue; The vigors are a glaring leftover from the Rapture setting. They make no sense in the context of Columbia and its culture, and even in gameplay terms they quickly become redundant to the player, as half of your vigors overlap in use. Even the shooting mechanics end up inconsistent and frustrating. A game with a two weapon limit has no business having a weapon upgrade system. Ammo will never be consistent enough for the player to keep their favored weapons, and the curve of weapon introduction insures that at several critical moments of the game the player is left with un-upgraded weaponry as their only valid option. It limits your arsenal, disrupts its own upgrade system, and leaves the player to deal with its schizophrenic ammo drop system where enemies most of the time drop ammo for weapons that you don’t have and can’t get. TL;DR This game is a pretentious, badly designed mess. For all its praised as being this fresh innovative piece or art, its just another sloppy shooter with a bad story in an industry over-poluted with sloppy shooters with bad stories.			"

												For me, BioShock Infinite was sometimes fun, mostly not so. The art design is certainly fantastic, with most praise reserved for the first act. After that, there isn’t much worth looking at. The gameplay as stated is largely the same as the original only with a diminished progression system and the weaknesses in the original’s mechanics are exposed by the frequent intense combat. I hesitate to use the word “overrated” due to how frequently it is misused but I wouldn’t be surprised if this is an adjective commonly associated (and not unreasonably) with BioShock Infinite in the near future.*From an original review on Another-Castle.com "

												WOW what can i say, this game is a superb follow on from the previous games, and if you havnt played any of them then this is still amazing, this has to be one of my favourites of 2013 and would recommend this to everyone.Its an old fasioned steampunk style world, with amazing scenery and graphics, all high up in the clouds.Its a first person action shooter with your basic but cool weapons and magic, that will lock you in for hours of gameplay (atleast 15hrs).Controls are simple to use and easy to adjust if required, and the gameplay is wonderful, really entertaining and enjoyable and ive found no problems so far.DLC is great too, both are short but both are great, quality not quantity as they say.Buy it! you wont regret it.

												The game had a nice intro, and cool concept. However, as you play, you will start to notice how shallow the game is. Environments dont respond to you, NPCs dont respond to you, and you feel like the game has no soul. The flying city did not feel like a flying city. You spend most of the time in rooms and hallways. You get a few chances to take to the clouds, but I really wished there was more emphasis on living in the sky and was hoping for more air fights. At many points in turns into a call of duty duck and cover til you win strategy type of game. The combat gets boring, the vigors get boring, the 'boss battle' is freaking rediculous - but with a great ending - I still felt somewhat satisfied and happy to have played it. If this game were a movie, Id suggest waiting to catch it on TV.			"

												This game is heralded as the second coming of Jesus by many. Is it?Well, no. It's possibly not onlt one of the most overrated games of all time, but probably one of the most boring AAA first person shooters ever released to boot.The one thing the game has going for it is its phenominal art direction. This is promply ruined by some utterly hillarious character models, props and textures that look like something out of Quake 2. Who needs feet on a cahracter when you can just have flesh coloured matchboxes? Who needs barrels of fruit at a market when you can just have a low resolution texture of fruit put over a polygonal surface? And on top of all this it runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥, even on a relatively beefy rig like mine.Now, what about the gameplay? The grand irony of Bioshock Infinite is that it's heralded as a renaissance from all of those dumb, brainless corridor shooters spat out by big publishers for 12 year old boys, but is in reality unfathomably linear and brainless; more-so than the likes of COD. Enemies are brainless, incompletent bullet sponges who charge toward you like wooden targets for you to effortlessly mow down with your weedy, unsatisfying, royal-free sound effect guns. You might remember the original Bioshock for its ferocious and desperate combat. You won't find that here. You might also remember the brilliant plasmids from Bioshock and the variety they brought to the game. You won't find that here. Well, the plasmids are back (why a society of racial puritans would even think of permanently desecrating their bodies I'll never know (the secret society of crow people being a hillariously bad example which the game never explains)), but I'm not exagerating when I say they all do the exact same thing, just with different, console grade eye candy. One click to stun someone (with an easy instakill if you headshot him), or hold it for a trap (which is useless given the AI). Upgrades all consist of having said effect spread to multiple enemies. You'll probably only ever find yourself using the lightning plasmid. In addition to all of this, instead of actually, say, balance and design their levels properly, the vast majority of the game will consist of you being unable to find ammo or items, but your parter tossing conveniently needed items in your direction every five seconds. And if that isn't bad enough, the game effectively eliminates any and all challenge by having absolutely no penalty for death. Yes, that's right, if you die, you just carry on as usual. You'll lose some money, but as you'll soon find it's utterly worthless as there's nothing you can spend it on that won't be pelted in your direction the second you need it.Yet again, this renaissance of the FPS genre is actually even more casualised and patronising than even the dumbest of COD clones. BUT SERIOUSLY, GUYS! IT'S THE GREATEST GAME EVER MADE!The final thing this game is primarily heralded for is its story. It's an emotional and political tour de force! It sets the standards of storytelling for every game that follows it! Well, I can safely say that's complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.The game is set in what is initially an enthralling and interesting universe of what is essentially Utah; an isolantionist state of religious puritans all brought together in their love for their prophet, of whom live in absolute luxury on the backs of slave labour and show utter disdain for whom they view as racially inferior. Eventually all hell breaks loose as the underclass revolts in a bloody civil war against their opressors. All the while you are sent to save a girl for a mysterious unexplained reason from this heavenly hellhole, of whom you then have to save.The universe the game is set in is intially fascinating and deals with what appear to be some great themes; the metamorphasis of religion and government, a post-modernist interpretation of popular revolutions and their fall from grace from the years of hatred the populace has endured. But this is all quickly abandoned in favour of a multiverse plot. Yes. Alternate universes.You skip universes so much in the main story line that you wonder what the point in even being attached to anything going on is, as you're ultimately abandoning it five minutes after you even hear about it. And when it does go back to the themes it was obviously supposed to cover but forgot at the last minute, it does so in the most juvenile, brain dead, shallow manner.OH MY GOD! THEY'RE GOING TO PELT THAT INTERATIAL COUPLE WITH ROTTEN FRUIT!Well, that's quite literally about as far as the game covers racism. Mississipi Burning, this aint.OH MY GOD! THE LEADER OF THE REVOLUTION WANTS TO KILL A KID FOR NO APPARENT REASON! THE HORROR!Animal Farm this isn't.And to top it all off, it ends in possibly the laziest ""OMG SO DEEEEP"" ending imaginable. You may remember Bioshock's (mostly) incredible ending/final act plot twist that revealed you to simply be a puppet of the game and those offering you guidance; both a great narrative plot twist, and a brilliant commentary on our own delusions of free will in what is purported to be a free environment where we make our own descisions, and gamer's general tendency to simply do as they're told because they're told to do it. The ending of this game, however, without spoilers, quite literally amounts to ""what does doing anything even matter any way? You're just gonna die in the end anyway. ♥♥♥♥ it."". Kind of lazy for the Citizen Kane of FPS.Upon criticising the story, you'll likely be criticised for being too stupid to understand its brilliance, at which point the plot in its entirety will be explained to you. The problem is in proping up this game as a literary masterpiece, the fact that its a convoluted, non-sensical, 12 year old's fanfiction of a wreck of a story the fact that it's confusing, or has serious plot holes, or has the political intruige of the graffiti in the sixth form toilets, it's considered as ""ambitious"", or ""deep"", or a ""poltiical commentary"". It's really not any of those. If you find yourself confused at any point, it's not that the story is too complex for you, it's that it's just poorly written, cobbled together tripe.The other grand irony of this game is the way Elizabeth is fawned over as some revolutionary, amazing female role model for video games. It's become incredibly common for pseudo-intellectual third wave feminism to be considered acceptable in gaming journalism (and as a convenient means of demonizing consumers and protecting massive corporations like the one that published this game), but I can't help but find it ironic that THIS character is an incredible female lead, when she's quite literally  a coddled, ignorant and clueless baby (not my criticism, it's a basic plot point of the game), who requires rescuing from a big prison from a big bad man, regardless of the fact SHE CAN BEND TIME AND SPACE TO HER WILL. Outside of the story she's relegated to a useless bumblbing idiot who throws health potions at you and cowers behind cover in combat, only using her incredible powers when you tell her to. Yep, you've never heard a female character being criticsed for being useless for these reasons before, have you?There's an awful lot wrong with this game, and an awful lot wrong with the people who love it so much. Criticising it will often lead you to be swarmed with gaggles of fanboys telling you to ""GO BACK TO COD YOU 12 YEAR OLD!"". It's a shame they're so unaware of themselves that they don't realise that they're playing something with worse gameplay, worse graphics, worse story, and worse replayability than even COD.Perhaps worth it for your own curiousity, but it's far from the second coming of Jesus that the gaming press declares it to be, and it's definitely not worth your time or money if you want a game that's actually competent in the areas a game should be competent in.

												I really enjoyed the first 2 Bioshock games and I was looking for this one to see if Bioshock game can still offer really good gameplay, and a great strory with a great setting. This is why I decided to get the game Day 1 and after reading the reviews I got the idea that it would deliver but after playing the game I was really dissapointed with it as I founded to be the weakest Bioshock game in the series. I will start with the good I would say that the game does look really good, does have some nice areas to explore and it does have an interesting story. However, I realised that the story can become a little bit predictible towards the end as the second half of the game really drags on for quite some time, but it does have a really strong beggining and ending. The story is also riddled with plot holes that really don't make sense once you start thinkinh about it. Then theres the gameplay which the weakest. As for a Bioshock game, the shooting is lackluster and as a FPS it is also lackluster. I have just happened to play better FPS games like Crysis 2 and 3 or FarCry 3, whereas Infinte tries way too hard to be a FPS. The vigors are also pretty useless as you will only find yourself using one or two whereas the rest are not that interesting or fun to use, and the same can be said for the weapons. And finally, the vigor and weapon upgrades are also useless as they don't make your guns or vigors that powerful, no matter how many times you upgrade them. Overall I honestly wouldn't recomend buying Bioshock Infinte but instead go for Bioshock 1 and 2 as they are much better games.			"

												What the hell is wrong with you, guys? No, not you gamers, the developers. They removed everything bioshock... well, technically system shock, but I wont split THOSE hairs right now, from this game. Choice is meaningless. Kill everyone you want, it doesn't matter. Make all your in game choices by flipping a coin, it doesn't matter. Dozens of plots are dropped into your lap and then shatter away to be forgotten without a thought. I hope you kids enjoy Songbird... for all 15 seconds you will see him. He's hyped to hell, but has absolutely no impact on the story or the game in general. But I can forgive a lot, I can... I will not, however, forgive this game's ending. I saw it and stared quietly for some time going ""huh?"" until I managed to piece it together myself and come to a conclusion. The writers were extremely high. Not the good ""purple haze"" kind of high, but the stoner in the basement giggling about God spelled backwards kind of high. In the span of 3 minutes you render the entire game moot, undo your own story, then actually go back and retroactively write the first two games out of existance. I'm not kidding about that, BTW, the forshadowing is strong with this and there are little clues that state the first two games are just this game in a different universe... and you proceed to unmake them all. You not only ruined your current game, you went back in time and ruined your first two games as well. What the HELL is wrong with you? Then you have the nerve to release this DLC featuring Rapture... even though you changed things in such a way that the city couldn't even exist. Your writing is so horrible you lost track of your own ending while you were writing it then forgot it again when you made your DLC. Oh, and before I forget, your game play was utter crap. Two weapon rule wasn't fun in the 90s, it damn sure isn't fun now. Your combat is boring enough to be seen as a chore. In short, you could not have failed harder as a game publisher if you'd simply sent us a fresh turd in a box.			"

												I'm not sure what to make of this.The presentation is very good, the story keeps you going, but there's an enormous amount of inconsistency within the narrative. The game wants to talk about racism but sugar-coats it enormously, to a point that's almost more offensive than the issue it's trying to present. You're ex-military white guy with a gritty voice and dark past #79614, but you have no qualms with killing 600 goons to set the record straight about your guilt.I still liked the game, and if you don't think about the story for more than five seconds you'll like it too... but it's tip-toeing the line between ""recommended"" and ""not recommended"" in my opinion, for this reason.

												Going to try reviewing this again now that I gave it a fair shot and played it to completion. Long story short: It's still not good in any particular way. It looks and plays rather dated. The game is meanspirited, ugly and not as immersive or intelligent as it likes to pretend it is. Almost everything it does well another game or story does better. Want chaotic shoot and loot gameplay with customizable upgrades with oddly frequent vending machines? Borderlands 2 is all that but non-linear. Want to delve into an immersive dystopia presented in a linear fashion? Try Dishonored. Want trippy pandimensional storytelling that doesn't take itself too seriously? There's a lot of good anime like that, try Steins;Gate. Bioshock Infinite isn't bad but it is mediocre and tiresome, practically presented like a Halo level that threatens to never end. On the plus side, if religious racist political zealots grind your gears the game does serve as a nice anger outlet, but I wouldn't pay more than $15 for the whole thing including DLC. It does have a few neat characers like the Lutece twins that are worth seeing, but they're not enough to salvage the game.			"

												BioShock Infinite is the game I regret buying more than any other in my collection. It makes me wish that tears in spacetime really existed so I could warn myself NOT to preorder it. The gameplay is boring, the story feels poorly written and rushed, and the graphics are woefully inconsistent.The original BioShock was a very in-depth game where strategy was key. This game is a Call of Duty clone with a steampunk setting and the BioShock name slapped on.I do not recommend this game to anyone, for any price. Avoid at all costs!			"

												Okay, let me preface this by acknowledging that this game is reasonably well polished, visually impressive and doesn't really contain any content that is particularly offensive.But otherwise this game is incredibly bad, and I am going to lay out why. I think the first thing to do is to comment on the gameplay in comparison with it's forebears, Bioshock and Bioshock 2. This game does not play much like them, yet it plays too much like them. The gameplay was stripped down, with numerous features removed and replaced, and yet no significant work was done to improve the combat. This is a problem because Bioshock combat isn't good, it needs elements to it to give it flavour and strategy, such as hacking, interacting with elements in the environment and making enemies target one another, etc. Infinite only has possession as a function for replacing hacking and mind control but it does this with no flair at all. Hacked turrents/enemies are invincible when they are your ally meaning when the ability runs out you have to deal with them then. The Vigors have almost no narrative reason to be in the game and they lack variety even moreso than the Plasmids from prior games.The weapons are a massive disappointment. Only allowing for two weapons carried massively cuts down on variety of gameplay yet again, their upgrades are not interesting and just change some stats. And you're penalised for not focusing on upgrading only a couple of weapons that you will use all the time. The gunplay is terrible, enemies are bullet sponges making the combat slow and monotonous. I also think that though some areas of the game are very pretty, much of the game takes place in pretty nondescript corridors, or generic open areas.Enemies simply spawn in waves or wander around randomly. They never use tactics, there's only a handful of enemy types. The most interesting part of the game is a fairly standard stealth section and the one ""boss"" fight it has was a massive slog. At no point is this game every truly fun to play for all the obscene amount of money that clearly went into it. Having said that, the story and characters are somehow even worse. Elizabeth, for whom much of the game centres on, is a lifeless and annoying character whom it's almost impossible to feel any kind of bond with because once you are meant to protect her... you don't. She doesn't exist as far as the game's enemies are concerned, and thus you do not at any point ever protect her. You simply mass murder your way through Columbia whilst she can randomly spawn ammo, health or money for you. Despite her years of confinement, she acts like a ditzy disney princess for most of the game and when things do get more serious, she has a complete personality turn and becomes a relentless and single minded fool who spouts meaningless philosophical nonsense. The ending is incredibly stupid, makes no logical sense and is intensely cruel and evil. In the end this game doesn't manage to be about anything. It has no real message to it, no moral, and no interesting insight into any of it's characters or setting, the setting of Columbia is explored for about an hour at the start and then simply becomes a linear tube for Booker to violently fight through. All of it's characters are stock, reprehensible and pretty much at no point is it possible to sympathise with any of them as they perpetuate a cycle of greed, intolerance and murder. At least in Bioshock Rapture had an ideal built on foundations of intellectualism and free knowledge, Columbia is little more than an idealised floating American city circa 1901. If you're familiar enough with the time period, the game makes very few attempts to use that knowledge for gain, like I've seen in other historical period games like Assassins Creed. And above all, it does not serve any of it's narrative aims by being a poor shooter that doesn't even meet the most basic criteria to be a fun game. "

												I used to say that story did not matter in a game if there was a lot to do and a lot of variety. This game proves me wrong. It is an amazing story based game. There are some bugs and glitches but that did not bother me, I was so wrapped up in the story and trying to figure out what was going on as I was playing (not confused just wanted to know the whole plot). There were Easter Eggs and hints at the ending through the game which were hard to pick up on. It is just a FPS nothing special but the story makes the game more than worth it! There are some different guns, some stradegy required at times and some pretty awesome special abilities. Plus the soundtrack in my opinion is pretty awesome too. Highly recommend!Any game that leaves me dropping my controller, just saying ""no... no that... no?!"" because I was so in to the story makes it worth while. And just as a warning, it will hit your feels a little. haha Awesome game!			"

												REWRITTEN AS OF MAY 10th, 2014!First off, I have very little that is good to say about this game.Graphics: The graphics are amazing and beautiful, same as the previous Bioshock games at the time of their release, however a beautiful world does not make up for the fact that the rest of this game is bad and it certainly doesn't make up for the fact that the level design is very poor, but I'll get to that later.Gameplay/Combat: This game makes a very poor use of the already old and tired Halo combat mechanics. You get a shield that absorbs damage until it's broken, then you must get behind cover and not get damaged to get your shield recharged. You're also arbitrarily limited to a grand total of two weapons, not counting your melee, which is just a button you hit and not actually selectable. Aside from that, the combat itself is very poor consisting entirely of ""shoot these guys."" Sometimes you can get Elizebeth to summon an unlimited item cache or an automated turret from an alternate reality, but the turret dies pretty quickly and is pretty much useless, as are the item caches since Elizebeth is a fountain of free items, but I'll get to that later.Story: The story is the most nonsensical convoluted garbage I've ever had the displeasure to endure. I'll try not to spoil anything, but this game makes use of alternate realities as a plot device, which can be really good if done well. Sadly this is not the case. The alternate realities are just a convenient excuse to explain away anything that doesn't make sense, essentially the equivalent of ""a wizard did it."" The antagonist of the game, Comstock, is an evil, radical, super racist, psychotic religious leader and self-proclaimed prophet who built a flying city whose whole reason for being all that is literally the fact that he got some water poured on him, otherwise he would be a poor, drunk war veteran living in a cheap apartment regretting his actions in the civil war. I am not joking, that is literally the whole reason he's evil. The final moments of the game consist of twenty minutes of exposition because the entire plot is such a tangled mess that this was the only way the writers could attempt to make sense of it. And they failed. Miserably.Elizebeth has these powers to open ""tears"" or portals to alternate realities and as you jump from reality to reality over and over you lose track of which was the original, but the charcaters don't seem to care at all, despite their entire world changing each time.Level Design: Each and every level in this game consists of two things. You either get a mob arena, or a small enclosed area for some story to happen or poorly written exposition. I've really got nothing else to say here.Characters: I feel all the characters and their motivations are poorly written in this game, especially the antagonist, Comstock, who I've already talked about. Without spoiling anything, Booker is looking to pay off a debt he owes...By bringing them this girl, Elizebeth. I'm sorry, but what kind of good guy takes a woman he doesn't know to some seriously shady people to pay off a debt? Literally all other characters are cardboard cut outs. You've got greedy corprate shill who shows up for five seconds, strong independent black woman who don't need no man and mysterious duo who are mysterious for ♥♥♥♥♥ 'n giggles.Enemies: 90% of the enemies you face in this game are generic soldiers who use guns. Sometimes you will face a pyromaniac, a dude who sends flocks of ravens at you and a giant part mechanical man who is a bit of a tank, he's essentially the replacement for the Big Daddy, but you don't have a choice of fighting him, he just shows up and attacks you. Last, but not least, you have this annoying ghost-like banshee that makes literally no sense, she ressurects anything in the area and constantly sends them after you. Of course the explination for her existing is alternate realities, because of course it is.Graphics: 9/10Gameplay: 2/10Story: 1/10Level Design: 1/10Characters: 2/10Enemies: 1/10Overall (Average based upon above): 2.6/10Don't buy this garbage game, even if it's on sale.

												Today's Review: BioShock InfiniteOverview: Long i've waited to make a review of this game, and for as much i've played that exact same time is as much as i've enjoyed it, this game is a gorgeous masterpiece of gaming art and a company that sadly do not exist anymore but it can surely teach some other big companies, how to make an exceptional game.Graphics: One word: Amazing. This masterpiece puts on your screen a high quality for a low GPU, giving you a variety of properties to modify but still running on minimum you can see how marvelous this game is.Optimization: *NEW* This might be the best game's optimization in the history of games, and one of my best 10 games of all times, simply flawless in any escale.Sound: Bullet sounds, Music is set in the early 30 and 40's tho the game (between the original game and the dlc Burial at sea) is set with a game of about 40 years difference, voice acting is top quality and you get to feel what the characters experience during the game right until the end.Metascore: 97/100 ""Masterpiece of all times and GOTY 2013, a MUST BUY for any gamer out there""			"

												Can't get into the game no matter how many times I try.  I'm 7 hours in at this point, and I really don't care if I ever play it again.  The first two I enjoyed, and played through all the way to the end, not wanting to stop at times.  I thought the dlc might help, but most reviews I've seen on the dlc say it's mostly garbage.  Not really sure what they were thinking with this game.  I mostly find the girl annoying, the story attrocious, and main character forgettable.  And I realize they're trying to tell a story here, but they literally put the game on rails.  I might go back to the game at some point, but there are too many games that are actually enjoyable to play that I want to get to.			"

												Clearly one of the most beautiful game designs I've ever seen, Infinite gives a awesome story just like every BioShock fan could expect. Or better. The combat system is pretty similar to the previous titles, kinda easy actually, with the addition of Elizabeth, a lovely and charismatic character who helps Booker in Combat. I finished the game in about 10h, so I guess thats the only weak point of the game. I wished it could last for many more hours.To me, GOTY 2013 is here.9.5/10			"

												After playing this game I'm wondering if there is a universe in which I didn't like it. The answer is probably NOT, because this is one of the most ridiculously beautiful game I've ever played.Does it have amazing graphics? Yes, it does.Does it have amazing voice acting? Yes, it does.Does it have the most realistic, fun and talented female companion of all time? Yes, it does.Does it have great variety of combat scenarios? Yes, it does.Does it have a complex, incredibly beautiful, engaging, feelingful storyline? The tears of sadness and joy in my face says so.Does it have a satisfying ending? F*CK YEAH IT DOES!Sadly, I don't have enough knowledge of the English language to come up with any more adjectives to rate this game. This isn't even a game, it's a work of art. Those who say that games can't have the same impact as movies or books ARE F. STUPID. And those who say this game in particular does not have at least one of the best storylines ever didn't understand it. I guarantee it! Read a guide online and be amazed.I rate it 10/10 for the story. I'll add another 3 for combat mechanics, 2 for graphics and scenery, and 2 more for the game longevity. So, 17/10.Oh wait, did I mention Elizabeth? The companion? She's great, oh so great, that I think I'll add OVER 9000 points because of her. Yes, that sounds fine.So yeah... my final rating for this game is an astounding OVER 9000/10. SHUT UP, the king can do as he likes!I also loved the Rapture reference from Bioshock 1. One more point for that.  Play this game. PLAY IT.Did I mention how great this story is?			"

												First, I'll start off and say you don't have to play BioShock 1 and 2 to understand Infinite, as it has it's own story. It might be slightly confusing as to what's going on a few hours in, but it'll kick in. You have to pay attention foremost. Irrational Games went a different route in scenery this time. Although the creepy, dark atmosphere and enemies of Rapture is what made BioShock 1 & 2 so great, you're now in the clouds. And it looks beautiful. Add the soundtrack and it's double that. Gameplay is similar to what you're used to in most types of shooters. You have a array of spells called vigors and you can cast them in combination to get a desired effect. There's weapons too and while you do need to shoot your way out of situations, they're not as exciting as using vigors.Elizabeth is extremely smart and proves to be a very helpful self-dependant ally. So no, don't worry about being a Leon from RE4.Top voice acting, a story that is better than anything Hollywood can ever come up with and fluid gameplay. If you want to play one of the best single players, get Infinite.			"

												STORY : 10/10A great novel for video game. It's good enough for make a movie.it's very complex but it'll make u surprise in climax.  GAMEPLAY : 7/10Shoot, smash, use vigor(magic skill) for kill enemy.Find out for money for upgrade ur gun and vigor, infusion potion for upgrade ur stats(shield,health,vigor).It's linear gameplay in bigmap.Will be much more better if weapon slot is 4 or more.GRAPHIC and SOUND : 9/10Very fantastic but not the best.Like a combination with realistic and cartoon. Great Bloody Fantasy.OST. is very good. The game has a lot of nice music.If u wanna play a real bioshock infinite, I suggest u to play 1999 mode for more challenge and achievement.(after complete the game once in normal or easy mode)When I complete the game once in hard mode, I thought the gameplay is so common. But 1999mode make me like the gameplay. This mode's very hard. especially, Lady Comstock fight.I suggest u to upgrade just Possession, Shock, Sender vigor and only weapon damage for all(except pistol, hail fire and burst gun) but upgrade all for repeater and RPG for the last fight.and don't buy anything from Dollar Bill for ""Scavenger Hunt"" achievement.Equip Winter Shield and Sky-Line Reloader when u can use skyline, u'll become immortal.

												This isn't a video game, this is a piece of artwork (on par with other moving paintings like Shadow of the Colossus) that you have the privilege of experiencing.  The story and characters will transport you to another place entirely, a city in the clouds where the idea of white, American, Christian, capitalist culture has been turned into what can only be described as a haunting cult. Don't go into this game expecting to find the greatest shooting mechanics ever created; that isn't what it's about (which isn't to say the shooting and fighting isn't fantastic).  It's about the immersion from the brilliantly crafted storyline and beautiful writing.  This is one of those rare games where you truly sympathize and connect with the characters, especially Elizabeth - they feel alive, largely in due to the amazing voice acting.  Honestly,  if this had been written as a novel as opposed to a video game, it would be a modern classic.I never thought any video game could come close to making me re-live the emotion I first felt when playing Ocarina of Time (my favorite title ever) but this comes extremely close.  If Ocarina is a 10, this is a 9.99999999999999999~.Play the game.  Wipe away the debt. "

Para análise em português, leia mais abaixo.Bioshock Infinite - Review: The Garden of Eden and the Apple of SinFrom an acclaimed franchise, Infinite had a difficult task for the series: Bring new breath to the Bioshock universe, without lose the characteristics that have made fans in the decaying underwater city of Rapture.Infinite leaves the deep water to travel to the skies. Columbia, 1912. An utopia floating in the heavens. A city of peace and harmony as mankind has never seen before. The new Eden, free from sins.And then, it all fell apart. Behind the masks of the holy city, political, religious, philosophical and scientific conflicts corrode that self imposed image. Nothing is what it seems. You're Booker DeWitt, sent to Columbia to rescue the young Elisabeth, held captive since an early age. What secrets the city hides? How important is the girl? And who is she?With a wonderful ambientation, a steampunk reality of the 20s, mixing the culture of this time with a strangely advanced technology. The soundtrack perfectly composes the plot as you cross several different and well made scenarios​​. You can really feel yourself in that place.Open your mind, prepare your heart and come see all the beauties and obscurities of Columbia.  My Personal Score   Fun: 9/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Ambientation: 10/10   History: 10/10   Replayability: 3/10   Multiplayer: 0/10 --Bioshock Infinite - Análise: O Jardim do Éden e a Maçã do PecadoPartindo de uma franquia aclamada, Infinite possuía uma difícil missão para a série: Trazer novo fôlego ao universo de Bioshock, sem perder as características que conquistaram os fãs na decadente cidade submarina de Rapture.Infinite abandona as águas profundas para viajar a céu aberto. Columbia, 1912. Uma utopia flutuando nos céus. Uma cidade de paz e harmonia como a humanidade jamais vira antes. O novo Éden, livre de pecados.E então, tudo desabou. Por trás das máscaras da santa cidade, conflitos políticos, religiosos, filosóficos e científicos corróem esta imagem que se impõe. Nada é o que parece. Você é Booker DeWitt, enviado a Columbia para resgatar a jovem Elisabeth, mantida em cativeiro desde tenra idade. Quais segredos escondem a cidade? Qual a importância da menina? E quem é ela?Com uma ambientação maravilhosa, uma realidade steampunk dos anos 20 mistura a cultura da época com uma tecnologia estranhamente avançada. A trilha sonora compõe perfeitamente a trama, enquanto vocês cruza diversos cenários diferentes e bem feitos. É possível realmente se sentir no local.Abra sua mente, prepare seu coração e venha conhecer todas as belezas e obscuridades de Columbia.  Minhas Notas Pessoais   Diversão: 9/10   Gameplay: 9/10   Ambientação: 10/10   História: 10/10   Rejogabilidade: 3/10   Multiplayer: 0/10  "

												The story: Just like the original Bioshock, Infinite presents a narrative that is filled with such urgency and purpose that it is near-impossible to just stop playing. Couple that with a story that could rival modern literature with it's never ending twists and turns and one of the best-written gaming sidekick in this generation of games and you have a contender for one of the best FPS stories of all time.The game looks visually stunning; the pre-civil war theme of Columbia mixed with a bright and colourful aesthetic really illuminate the prettiness of the game. Even better if you have a good rig.The soundtrack makes this game a legitimate contender for a ""Gaming Soundtrack of the year"" awards, whether it's a barbershop quartet version of Beach Boys' ""God Only knows"" or an intimate acoustic rendition of ""will the circle be unbroken"", this game is full of frisson-worthy joy to the ears.CONS:Gameplay gets really repetitive after a few hours. As I said before, the story is the real driving force of this game whereas the gameplay kinda lingers in the back. Soon enough you'll be wishing that the room full of bullet sponges would just die so you could proceed to the next part of the story.Handymen: In my opinion, one of the most annoying enemies in modern shooters today. I would spend at least 3 minutes trying to take on of these down. This may seem like a challenge (which equals fun) but it really isn't. It's just a boring shooting contest that you hope will be over quickly.A certain...segment in the middle of the game. I will not say what it is but I think a few people will know what I’m talking about. It's shark-jumping, out of balance with the rest of the game moment that goes on for a good half-hour. Let's just say that bullet-sponges and frustrations galore in this segment.Verdict:Despite the flaws, Infinite still is an absolutely fantastic game, however it goes without saying that it isn't on my top ten all-time list. (But the weird thing is, with all the hype and interest I had in the game, I thought it would be. But I guess it's my fault for hyping it up too much)8.5/10.			"

												This isn't a video game, this is a piece of artwork (on par with other moving paintings like Shadow of the Colossus) that you have the privilege of experiencing.  The story and characters will transport you to another place entirely, a city in the clouds where the idea of white, American, Christian, capitalist culture has been turned into what can only be described as a haunting cult. Don't go into this game expecting to find the greatest shooting mechanics ever created; that isn't what it's about (which isn't to say the shooting and fighting isn't fantastic).  It's about the immersion from the brilliantly crafted storyline and beautiful writing.  This is one of those rare games where you truly sympathize and connect with the characters, especially Elizabeth - they feel alive, largely in due to the amazing voice acting.  Honestly,  if this had been written as a novel as opposed to a video game, it would be a modern classic.I never thought any video game could come close to making me re-live the emotion I first felt when playing Ocarina of Time (my favorite title ever) but this comes extremely close.  If Ocarina is a 10, this is a 9.99999999999999999~.Play the game.  Wipe away the debt. "

												I love this game and strongly dislike shooters. Yes, it’s a shooter, and there is a lot of shooting, but this game is more about the story and less about the shooting. The story is absolutely engrossing. The game world pulls you in and makes you want to know more and more about the city of Columbia. I highly recommend taking your time and listening and viewing all that collectibles. The collectible really do a good job of fleshing out the city’s history and the history of its main citizens. The city is fully realized and I could spend hours walking through it and taking it all in. The character of the city is beautiful at first. Then as you start listening more and more to the chatter of the citizens and you start reading the billboards and advertisements you soon realize this city is not the Eden you thought.While the city of Columbia as a character is completely fascinating, Elizabeth, your female partner which the entire story hinges on, is even more interesting. She exudes innocence, naivety, curiosity, empathy, adventure, courageousness, bravery, and sadness. I’ve never played a game that caused me to feel guilty and sadness towards a character. Elizabeth takes you on an emotional roller coaster that I never wanted to end.When the ride was over, and the last piano key was struck, I just sat in my chair, staring at my monitor. The emotional tug of the game had left me immobile and speechless. I wanted more time with these characters. I didn't want the game to end. I wanted to know more about the city, about Comstock, about Booker, and about Elizabeth. I didn't want this to be the end.As I sat there, mindlessly watching the credits roll by, and listening as the various music played I replayed the entire game in my head. Then, during the credits you get to watch the voice actors sing the song, Will the Circle Be Unbroken?. I listened to the words; I then understood what the song meant and how it relates to the game and the ending.After all is said-and-done, no game I have ever played has caused in me such an emotional reaction. No game has made me want to save a character more and no game has made me sit and stare off into space when it was over. The ending hit me like the LOST series finale. It's over......and I'm sad that it is.			"

												After playing this game I'm wondering if there is a universe in which I didn't like it. The answer is probably NOT, because this is one of the most ridiculously beautiful game I've ever played.Does it have amazing graphics? Yes, it does.Does it have amazing voice acting? Yes, it does.Does it have the most realistic, fun and talented female companion of all time? Yes, it does.Does it have great variety of combat scenarios? Yes, it does.Does it have a complex, incredibly beautiful, engaging, feelingful storyline? The tears of sadness and joy in my face says so.Does it have a satisfying ending? F*CK YEAH IT DOES!Sadly, I don't have enough knowledge of the English language to come up with any more adjectives to rate this game. This isn't even a game, it's a work of art. Those who say that games can't have the same impact as movies or books ARE F. STUPID. And those who say this game in particular does not have at least one of the best storylines ever didn't understand it. I guarantee it! Read a guide online and be amazed.I rate it 10/10 for the story. I'll add another 3 for combat mechanics, 2 for graphics and scenery, and 2 more for the game longevity. So, 17/10.Oh wait, did I mention Elizabeth? The companion? She's great, oh so great, that I think I'll add OVER 9000 points because of her. Yes, that sounds fine.So yeah... my final rating for this game is an astounding OVER 9000/10. SHUT UP, the king can do as he likes!I also loved the Rapture reference from Bioshock 1. One more point for that.  Play this game. PLAY IT.Did I mention how great this story is?			"

												I honestly never played the original Bioshock. At the time of its release, I was a bit of a coward and its guise of a horror game pushed me away. When Bioshock Infinite was released, I didn't make the same mistake, and purchased it immediately.I was not left dissappointed. The gameplay is like many singleplayer FPSs. It's simple and intuitive, with enemies often dying when you shoot them and a number of other means of murder being thrown into the mix.Elizabeth, as your sole companion, is probably the greatest side kick you will ever have in a shooter. She doesn't get in the way, doesn't steal your kills, gives you stuff that you need, and obeys your orders without a second thought.What really makes Infinite shine is its story. It's engaging, confusing, thought-provoking and probably enough to make it best game of the year.			"

												As a great man once said, ""Everytime I ♥♥♥, I produce a quartz."" The same can not be said for this game, there was no quartz cumming involved and I was personally extremely saddened to see this game make that choice. What really sets this game back is the distinct lack and obvious work around the devs did when making this game. In the demo Elizabeth's ♥♥♥♥ were at least twice the size but in this game they're like half. They used to be ♥♥♥♥ing watermelons and now they are merely saggy lemons, anybody would think she's just a typical lemon ♥♥♥♥♥, why would any sane person change that? THIS GAME DOESN'T EVEN HAVE BOOB PHYSICS! After touching myself furiously to the first few demos this game released it was clear that the full release game was not intended to be an extended means of masturbation, which as you can imagine sadened many a poor boy. After crying to my daddy on the telephone, ""how long now?"" I was stricken with the realization that perhaps I could still one rub one out to Elizabeth, even with the lack of breasts that she had once obtained. So I poured myself a glass of fruit loops and let my hand fall into my pants. Elizabeth did not get me going for a second, but there was a shiny knight waiting for me, his name is Booker and I'll tell you what, that man has a lovely jaw line. I have now racked up 320 hours of gameplay on this game and are still yet to finish. ♥♥♥♥: 1/10Booker's Calf definition: 10/10Boob Physics: 0/10Story: 2/10Graphics: 1/10Gameplay: 1/10Overall: 10/10 Booker is a handsome man.

												I played this game and loved it, but I am not going to pretend it was perfect. While it's considered a game, the game parts are above-avarage at best. I'll go over it.Story: You are Looker DeWitt, a man hired to find a certain girl in the lands of columbia for a price. That's how it starts at least. Throughout the story you meet Elizabeth, and unlike most followers in games, she isn't useless and is actually rather charming. The story shows their tale... tales... I don't even know how to describe it because the ending is a mind breaker, but i won't spoil it. Either way you'll see them learn and progress. Especially Elizabeth changes over time. Starting as an innocent lady and eventually becoming a badass. The story is easily the strongest part of the game, even if it's all over the place at times due to the cheap way of ""Alternate Timelines/Dimensions"" yada yada. But in this game it was actually implemented in a very good way. For story alone I would recommend the game. But I'm not done yet.Graphics:The graphics are stellar. Columbia is really beautiful and other areas in the game are aswell, but in a different way. You can see how bad something is going just by looking around in later areas and it's a really beautiful but also a kind of sad place at times. The game is beautiful, no doubt about it.Racism?:Yeah yeah you heard it from everyone, hur durr racist game. Seriously, don't even pretend racism doesn't exist. In fact, I would say it's a strong point of the game. Gives you more of a reason to hate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in charge. So those who complain about this game being racist, IT'S FOR A REASON.Audio design:The music in areas really add to the atmosphere of the game. Both for the darker and lighter places in Bioshock infinite, the music makes the areas really stand out. Sound effects are pretty good aswell. I would say the gun sound effects COULD be better, but it's not bad. It's pretty good. Other than that the sound in the game is great! The voice acting is done extremely well and the actors really helped you get attached to eachother and the emotions the characters felt were well translated by the voice actors.Gameplay:Look. Like I said. The Gameplay is above avarage at best. You have two spots for guns. While this could be used for strategy, there is no reason to. It's clear which guns are better for you and it's not like you're running out of ammo anytime soon. Or health for that matter, as Elizabeth keeps throwing health pickups, ammo pickups and salt (explaining that later) pickups. The only time you ever really get in trouble is when Elizabeth isn't there. And that's a really small portion of the game. Elizabeth kinda feels overpowered, but either way everything around you contains health, ammo and salt too. Seriously, if you have elizabeth with you, shoot away! You won't run out of ammo, at least I didnt.You also have these vigors (or plasmids). They are really fun to use I'll admit. But besides watching crows kill people or lighting people on fire, there is no reason to use it. The upgrades for the vigors and weapons arent anything to be excited about either. Then there is the skylines... A neat feature. But really not that useful for anything other than escaping some mad men. Good luck aiming when you're turning around a corner on the skyline. Now, is Bioshock Infintie worth the price tag?... I'll be honest, it is if you care about story and graphics. If you want it purely for gameplay, then please wait for when it's a decent price, like on sales. But the price tag now is pretty appropriate for this game. It's not the best game ever, but it's damn good at what it wants to do. Create an atmospheric experience with excellent story and graphics. Sadly, they sacrificed Gameplay for it, but it's definitely something anyone must experience. Just wait untill the price is appropriate for you, and then get it.			"

Gladius Dei or ""same, same but different!""Bioshock Infinite is basically a revamped version of BS2 in a new environment. The gameplay is superior over the other episodes and much better balanced. The story is nearly as good as the first one. It cares for the female player, got lotsa eye-candy and has the highest grade of replayability compared to the other parts. In my opinion, balancing story and gameplay, the best of all 3 Bioshock games. If you liked the others, you will also like this one. At best, you played just BS1 and not the 2nd part beforehand (unless you wanna play all 3).storyThough BS2 had not a bad story, the Would you kindly? moment was missing. Now, you got a repackaged BS2 story which takes care of that. It is somewhat unrelated to the other episodes and you could use it as a starter to the Bioshock world, though due to graphics and gameplay, I advise against it.It definitely tries to get the girls to the consoles as in a slightly female colour scheme, a female hero w/o mega ♥♥♥♥ nor skin tight leather... and to top that up, even a change of hair dressing is included! ;P That said, there is enough blood, dirt and gore and Bioshock manages once more to combine high morals with bloodiest violence and beautiful sceneries.A lot has been recycled from BS2, though: It feels a bit like the Syren Alley level and its objective being a whole game combined with the Eleanor meta story. In Ryan's Amusements you had to get a Plasmid inside a propaganda amusement park for kids in order to continue a journey on a train. In Soldier's Field the difference is only that Plasmids are called Vigors and that you continue your journey in a Gondola. Besides an obstacle blocks your carriage and you have to get the Plasmid/Vigor inside a children's propaganda theme park. Fink and his stage reminded me a bit of The Great Alexander - There are many moments which feel like BS2.gameplayUsed to be the biggest pain in the ♥♥♥♥ on its predecessors, but the Bioshock team seems to learn by trial and error. Each part gets better gameplay-wise and now, the mindless spawning and many shortcomings of BS1 and BS2 are gone.The gameplay is much better balanced due to:* ""Killer""-Plasmids are mostly gone in the main game (like Winter Blast for example).* Plasmids are generally better balanced and thus less powerful than before.* Adam is gone as character building source it is now ""all about money"". Since corpses contain money, the infinite spawning of enemies is gone in BS Infinite.* the marvellous Green Arrow which gives you directions on demand!  No more ""Should I turn the quest arrow on or off?"" A+++* The research system is gone and nobody will miss it!* Sadly, the mini-games are gone, too. Elizabeth lockpicks the doors, safes and chests for you now.* Enemies and gear are revamped but the same: Houdinis, now called Zealots, are fewer but tougher. Handymen are basically extra fiery Brute Splicers and the Rumbler returns in a downgraded version as Beasts; there is even a  Mark Meltzer moment. Insect Swarm is also far less powerful now and replaced by Murder of Crows - which is a good thing, since Insect Swarm and Winter Blast was all you needed, even on the most difficult settings.* generally, the gameplay is more stream-lined, though there are more collectibles.* Negative: More CoD-like in the sense of a less tactical approach and the shortage of resources.* Many tutorial elements in the game are too short or simply missing. Vigor Combos for example, though there would have been enough chance for it on some fair stand. * The skyline could be better integrated into the gameplay, but as mentioned below, it seems to be technically the most critical part.graphics, bugs & CoRan it on Win7 64bit with a Geforce GTX760 on highest settings w/o problems. Only major bugs I encountered was on the skyline, there I got stuck under certain circumstances. Also, the only minor bug I am aware of is as well connected to the skyline. It let's Liz circle the skyline for hours, once I am already off - but it doesn't hinder progress and at some stage she is back.Unfair to compare graphics, since I played both old parts on XP, but lotsa eye-candy indeed. And as I found just far more ""picturesque"". Burial at SeaHaven't played it as of yet....Btw: Si tacuisses... !Hm, a game that costs soo much money to produce and is so in love with detail, ridicules itself by misuse of professionell knowledge?The first steps into Columbia makes you believe you entered an alternate world of idiots: * Gladium is like clavem an Accusative version of the words gladius,-i and clavis,-e.* 2 Lockpicks will never open a lock, but inserting a tension wrench[/i] and a lockpick will. Besides but important: Locks don't get damaged by picking (but picking can be detected forensicly). "

The story it tells through it's main characters, DeWitt and Elizabeth, is so engaging and surprisingly well put together, you will find yourself incredibly immersed. If you're anything like me, you won't be able to take a break. It is an amazing adventure, as well as a suspenseful mystery, that all comes together in its final moments to form an incredibly solid ending. It will leave you with many questions, but only a very small number that can't be answered by another play-through or a few more minutes of thought. All of this paired with it's polished look, and smooth feel makes it a must have for... Well. Everyone.One final note: I'd recommend using a gamepad to maximize the experience. Some of the controls using a keyboard and mouse, even with customization, have some seemingly unavoidable non-intuitiveness to them. That's my opinion, anyway.Enjoy!			"

												Absolutely stunning! Great story, amazing characters and acting, and the attention to detail is brilliant!The concept of Columbia is incredible! The game has an amazing feel to it and it just keeps getting better and better!You don't need a high end graphics card to play, but even with a $200 one, you can pretty much have maxed out settings and with that, the game is like none else! The graphics are absolutely mind blowing! The only thing that certain people might not like it the gore. It is fairly gorey, but it does let you know before hand and its not a kid game, so it's pretty expected. Just my opinion, but I think the blood was a bit over done, it's like big pools of pudding flying out of people, but oh well. 9/10 :)			"

												Even though I might be a little late to the party, I still wanted to play this game; which I was finally able to now, during the Steam Summer Sales.I have played the first part of the game and up until now, it has been looking beautiful; the level design better than that of the previous two games; and the main game concepts very similar.The worst thing so far in this game, however, are the controls. Why put melee on 'v'? That's a terrible default place for a melee weapon, especially considering that opening crates/looting bodies has been put on the 'f'-key. Which of those two will you need in the stressfull situations in which you might die within a second? Punching the guy in front of you with your hook-arm-thing, or looting the dead bodies strewn around, because they might just contain some +health? Exactly. [I swapped the two buttons immediately, when I learned that melee was 'v']Other than the infuriating controls, I would still recommend this game, for both the stunning visuals and the fact that people have been rating this game highly. Now let's hope that I finish this game sometime within ten years...			"

												BioShock Infinite has a fantastic combat system and an incredible well developed storyline full of excitement, twists, and unforgettable moments. The relationship between Booker and Elizabeth is classic and entertaining to watch grow as you progress through the game, the diverse characters and their roles in the story are perfectly fitted to the adventure, and the dimension switches were a fantastic addition to the story, causing hardcore twists in the story that will take you off guard. All in all, this game is a fantastic portrayl of good gameplay, good story, and good uniqueness. 10/10 (Review by OrangespongeMan)			"

												If you had not followed this games hype, and you had not played Bioshock 1 & 2, then this game is fantastic, buy it, get sucked into the narrative.If not?Then you're like me. I wanted to like this game, I really did. But the issues begin when the game was first announced. All the ads, all the hype for it went into overdrive, even if you avoided it, it was there in a wave that would easily wash over you. When the game was first announced, it really seemed as if it would be a succesor to the game famous for its storyline, setting, and twists. When it was announced, the game was nothing like it is now. And if you followed just how they set up the game before it was released, all the hype of Handymen and Boys of Silence, then you would be kicked in the groin as you realize the two enemies are thrown into the final version of the game as little more than an afterthought. The game boasted its many possible choices, all the good and bad things you could do with your magical partner in crime...But when it came down to it, not a single choice you made mattered five seconds after making it. Sure, Bioshock 1 & 2 were similar, the Little Sisters gave you mana, but the game actually changed depending on those decisions. The Little Sisters would tremble in fear of the infamous Boogieman who had slaughtered every child he had gotten his topsider hands on, or the Bad Daddy who had no heart unto that steel carapace. And on those lines, Bioshock Infinite took the concept of Vigors/Plasmids and ruined it. It became a gimic, where every single power ultimately did the same thing. The only difference was that an enemy who was obviously well versed with that power was immune. The vigors were almost useless throughout the game, their only use being to incapacitate enemies for short periods of time so you could focus on the much better developed guns. No longer could you work so hard at sacrificing power for quite some time so you could gain a power that earns you a temporary but nigh-invulnerable protector, that would simply be too easy wouldn't it? Enemies you hypnotize seem to lose their effectiveness by at least half, moving in sluggish hazes as compared to the devoutly loyal you could possess in this games predecesors. And on my final point, one of my biggest issues with Bioshock Infinite was its take on the Big Daddy. Songbird. A grotesque beast trapped within confines of leather and metal. The game constantly boasts its strength, unmatched and undefeated. And for a while, running into the beast was exhilerating, I could see why people simply loved the single, giant creature that replaced the numerous abominations of Rapture.  And then, one day, I came upon a realization that ruined it for me.Songbird was not a threat.Various scenes have you running from Songbird, trying to prepare for its arrival, or simply trying to thwart the beast. But at any point where the creature confronts you, at any point where you may be challenged, you lose control of the character. You watch a cutscene of Booker somehow escaping the beast, and then going on to have Elizabeth rant about how powerful Songbird was. There is a type of horror in creatures in a sense of ""show, don't tell,"" and it feels like the makers of this game tried a version of that. Thing is, the illusion of the threat and horror is simply too thin.This is an amazing game, believe me. It simply is not the perfect work of art people claim it to be.			"

												BioShock Infinite is an artistic masterpiece. Beautiful, suspenseful, and haunting at times; it captures a blending of history and myth to create something both wonderfully unique and familiar. Elizabeth is one of the best characters to ever appear in a game and the world is beautiful.Story: 10/10 As we all come to expect from Irrational, the plot of this game is bursting with rich parallels, powerful emotional imagery and an ending (brilliantly foreshadowed throughout) that will leave you both satisfied and begging for more. Ambiance: 10/10 This is where the game really shines. Each set-piece alone could be a work of art, each architectural blend, each cultural costume. All of the visual splendor mixed together with a score that perfectly juxtaposes the glamor and grit of what Columbia represents. Gamplay: 10/10 I expected a rich story and beautiful visuals/music, what I did not expect was game-play (particularly combat) that surpassed Irrationals previous games in terms of enjoyment and dynamic action. This game takes everything that we loved from previous BioShock games and adds a whole new level of tactical planning and on the fly improvisation. Each combat area is a stage set for a brilliant play, each enemy adding new challenge, each weapon a chance to master. Never has combat been so challenging and satisfying in a BioShock game.			"

												Bioshock Infinite is a must-have for those who enjoy the 1920s aesthetic and great characters. The game does not really pick up until you meet Elizabeth (Booker being sort of a surrogate main character up till that point). The story and atmosphere are extremely compelling and the game does not ignore some of the sensitive political and social issues that existed during that era, though it only makes short notice of it and could have served an interesting subplot. It's nothing like its horror-ridden undersea predecessors and markets to a different audience but enjoyable all the same, perhaps even more meaningful, depending on what sort of experience you pull away from it.Only downside is possibly combat. While it's doable, it's not always enjoyable & quite a few gunfights feel as if they've been copy-pasted from other sections of the game making them feel repetitive and pointless.But it's okay because of the story and because of Elizabeth. Everything else pales in comparison to what this game has to offer in terms of depth of narrative and Elizabeth's characterization. Very few games truly capture the heart and I think that this can be considered among them.			"

												Short summary: best story in Bioshock games so far, but worst gameplay.First, I will list everything that went wrong with Bioshock Infinite: Levels are mostly linear: just run and gun from point A to B, very little incentive to explore. There are no level maps. With the ability to ride sky lines, Bioshok Infinite is literally a rail shooter.In rare cases when you find some ""secret"" stuff, game lists it as a secondary objective: ""you found a closed box, go look for the key"". Thankfully, there's no path marker leading to the key.No combination locks. Instead you pick up generic lockpicks and use them to unlock any locked door or safe. There's one door locked with obligatory 0451 code, but it's opened in a cutscene without player's input. You can only carry two weapons. If you run out of ammo for both equipped guns, you're forced to run around the battlefield and search for a new weapon to swap or sit in cover and wait until Elizabeth throws a loaded weapon at you. There is only one ammo type per weapon. Weapons and their upgrades are more boring now: ordinary pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers etc. Upgrades do not change how the weapon looks. No more crazy revolvers with two cylinders, electric shotguns and spear launchers.No passive tonics. Partially replaced by gear, but it's limited to four slots total: hat, shirt, pants and boots, with no ability to increase this limit. Also you cannot mix and match any effects as you wish, as every gear piece can only be equipped in its designated slot.No first aid kits or EVE hypos. When you're getting low on health in a fight you're have to drop everything and run around searching for a tear with health packs or you're dead. The're a small shield that regenerates when not under attack, but enemies destroy it in couple of hits (on hard difficulty at least).No vita chambers. You're probably wondering why is it a bad thing - it's because in previous two games vita chambers could be disabled in settings. In Infinite you have no choice but to accept your ""revival"" and lose money in the process. There are no manual saves anymore too, so there are no reasonable way to bypass that if you liked to play without vita chambers before.  Hacking was removed. There's a plasmid (or vigour, how they call them here) that serves a similar purpose, but it only works for a short time and huge drain on salt (EVE). Using it on a vending machine makes it drop a small amount of money instead of decreasing sell prices.I'm still recommending to play Bioshock Infinite for the story - it's worth it regardless of shooting mechanics and exploration. Just set the difficulty to easy, don't repeat my mistake.			"

												BioShock Infinite is a prequel to the original BioShock and BioShock 2, as opposed to being in the underwater city of Rapture, the main character is launched up into the clouds to the floating city of Columbia... Visually, the game is absolutely beautiful, the settings are breathtaking, the buildings and items and people, so much detail went into them all... The gameplay is perfection, movements are fluid and easy to work with, between your weapons and your vigors, and the combination between them all, it just feels right (my personal preference for most of the time is Shock Jockey and the Hand Cannon)... The story line is awesome, and really makes you think about what is reality, who you are, what you're doing, the people you interact with, and so on... it was very touching and compelling... The characters are amazing and memorable... Booker, Elizabeth, Comstock, the Luteces, Slate, Fink, Fitzroy, all great... Overall, everything works together perfectly, and I couldn't ask for anything better, absolutely well-made, 10/10, highly recommended!EDIT: as of Feb 6, 2016, I have played through this game multiple times, and its DLCs, and have collected every achievement to 100%, so you can take my word for it, I have played everything thoroughly ;)			"

Just set the difficulty to easy, don't repeat my mistake.			"

												Whatever I write doesn't give justice to how good this game actually is. Where do I even start?Bioshock Infinite will make you feel and I stand by this claim.The storyline is so complex and wonderfully written it will make you think about this title even long after you finish it. My hat is off to Mr. Ken Levine.Scenery is beautiful, you will try to experience every little corner of Colombia.Soundtrack is on point, it enhances the experience of whatever is happening wonderfully.Voice actors are top notch, Courtnee and Troy did a phenomenal job to make Elizabeth and Booker come to life.AI is intelligent. Elizabeth is superb.I would say watch  Creating Elizabeth  to see how much depth this character has.If you're thinking about whether or not you should be playing this game, the answer is yes. Everyone should play through it at least once. It's a masterpiece.			"

												Infinite gets a lot of flack for having a ♥♥♥♥ story and for being a half-hearted retread of Bioshock. A lot of this is knee-jerk, ""I don't like anything that happens to be popular"" but there's a fine grain of truth in there that's definately worth addressing.The story doesn't really make sense. It makes sense at first, and then it doesn't, and then you overthink it for a while until it starts to make sense again, and then it kind of eats its own tail in a final hail of riduculousness. I won't spoil anything here; but you will go from head scratching, to enlightenment, to being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the story. That being all of the important interpersonal story elements are good fun and deserve recognition. When people focus on the sci-fi elements they're looking at the wrong parts.The game is absolutely gorgeous and I don't think that needs to be stressed too much because what you see in the trailers is pretty much what you get.Combat is good and I found myself rotating through a lot of different abilities. In the original Bioshock I pretty much found my favorite power and stuck with it through the whole game. Infinite rarely lets you get away with that; I found that I had to use almost every ability I had at my disposal to get through some of the harder portions of the game. This game is a lot of fun if you don't take it too seriously. The emotional elements are good even if the fake-science parts are a little rusty.			"

												I've always been a fan of the Bioshock series and irrational games as a company, I even thought Bioshock 2, made by 2K was a great game, not as good as the others in the series but definitely worth your time.March 2013, the release of Bioshock: Infinite.Who knew, that a game could have such an emotional pull on someone. That it could make you feel and care for the characters, so much that you would be thinking about them, worrying for them and doing everything in your humanly power to make sure that everything went the way you wanted it too. That is the feeling Bioshock: Infinite will bring to you and anyone who plays this game and truly immerses themselves in the story, putting yourself in the shoes of Booker Dewitt and getting the feeling that these in game events are actually happening and that you are involved.This is the best game in the Bioshock series, without a doubt, simple things like the main character being able to speak and having a companion,to huge things like the world being fueled by slavery, racism and capitalism, not to mention the fact that the game is absolutely stunning visually and the added feature of zipping through parts of columbia on sky hooks and landing on enemies heads to send them flying through the air and off the map are all features that make this game such a unique and mind blowing experience.The characters are amazing, the gameplay is easy to pick up and the story is the best story I have ever experienced in a game, the link up with the city in the sky Columbia to the underwater utopia that is Rapture is special and the added DLC of Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2 that bring the Bioshock series to a close, is some of the finest storytelling that not just gaming has ever seen, ENTERTAINMENT has ever seen (Yes better than TLOU).In short, buy this game and play it, I have completed this game 3 times already on the Xbox (where my original playthroughs are) completed all the DLC, and I fully expect to be going back to play this game time and time again, I 100% hope this isn't the end of Bioshock as a series, but if it is, all I can say is it has been an amazing journey, and Bioshock sits at the top of my most treasured games list and will for a long time.

												Bioshock Infinite is absolutely amazing, the shere attention to detail and the gripping story made all the time spent looking in every corner of every random lane and fighting wave after wave of interesting (but occaisionally dull) enemies a blast and had justified the 20+ hours I have spent on this game. I found the story in the beginning a bit slow and uneventful, but the bright and glamorous world made up for that with interesting dialogue, spoken by the people lining the streets and the great showcase of the indoctrination of the people by Father Comstock. As the story/game progresses things change dramatically, throwing in plenty of combat and spicing up the story perfectly.After ruthlessly slaughtering countless numbers of enemies I found the combat got a bit dull, and in a way a bit easy after getting most of the upgrades and new weapons/vigors. The enemies are also a bit on the bland side, since most of them are just a darkish colour and little detail on the uniforms I found my self killing what I thought was the same person over and over again, this was especially prevalent towards the end of the game.The combat incorperates a lot of 'fantasy' into it, with things like Vigors and more modern guns with a little less realism and less punch. The physics of the weapons felt great too, they were not way too unrealistic but they weren't too reaslistic either, which provided a nice blend making those heads look as bigger target as always. If I were to have 1 major complaint about the guns it would be how underpowered some guns can be towards the end of the game, where I ran out of ammo for  my sniper and had only a pistol as a replacement. The pistol been my main weapon at the beginning of the game and could take down enemies in what felt like 1 blow, but the pistol had no such effect when taking down the same enemies later on, making one have to completely spray all their ammo at the opponents head to actually take them down.At the end of the story things get very weird and confusing but when the game ends, most previous events in the game begin to come together, but some do not leading to a lot of confusion and possibly sequels (?). The end left me wanting to play again, so that I can find all those little events that link to the main plot and then giggle, thinking about ""how could I have not noticed this before?""This game is one of a small ammount of games that have left me happy and satisfied at the end, and I can definately see myself playing it again sometime in the future. To get a game this great for only $10 was itself amazing. I have seen games that cost a lot more and has been realeased a lot earlier, that are absolutely terrible. Overall I believe Bioshock Infinite to be well worth the time and money, and that Irration games & 2K have done an exellent job, creating what is probably, a masterpiece. I would definately recommend getting this game, and I guarantee (A guarantee? Who has time for all that paperwork?)  you will have fun!  I give it a 10/10			"

Bioshock Infinite has a GREAT story, wonderful gameplay mechanics, AWARD WINNING art style and a great damn trailer song.

												This game is a contendor for Game of The Year only for its story, the gameplay is subpar. The Story is as you come to expect from the creators of Bioshock, you wander around a city for awhile trying to complete a goal that will lead you to the big twist at the end of the game. It was done very well because of the voice acting, pacing, writing, and its impact. However, the gameplay was extremely boring. First off, all you did was verse the same 2 enemy types that never change over the course of the 17 hour campaign. Then you have the vigors , which are explained in a cool way but are just various forms of stun that distract the enemy for about half a second. The Handymen  and the Motorized Patriots were sad attempts at trying to recreate the Big Daddy that didn't offer any reward. Next, you can only carry 2 weapons that never seem to have enough ammo and make you feel underpowered. Finally you can't carry salts or health packs, so when you run out you have to wait for Elizabeth to ""fetch"" you some. If you like a good storybased game then i would recommand this game for you. But if your a fps junky then this game will annoy you too much to finish it.			"

This game is nothing like the first 2.If you played Bioshock 1 & 2 and loved playing them, then avoid this game if you can. Although, if you've played Bioshock 1 & 2, you may feel compelled to finish the story. I think you will be seriously disapointed in this sequel for everything except the story.

												Wonderful gameplay, I even loved most of the story, but the ending was stupid. There is so much that is good about this game, but it is so blatantly biggoted against everyone that is religious. As you find out more about the backstory of the main villain, you come to find out that the ONLY thing that made him become evil was becoming religious, and it unflinchingly portrays everyone who is religious as evil zealots committed to controling everyone in the name of their faith and murdering anyone who resists. If you are even slightly religious, I'd steer clear. If you're staunchly athiest, then this is the game for you.			"

												I've had some time to think about this game, and here are my overall thoughts. (SPOILER-FREE)Bioshock Infinite is at its core an average single-player shooter game. However, this is not what compelled me to pick it up. I picked this game up for around 10 bucks during the Steam Black Friday sale, hearing that the story was excellent, and far better than what you'd see in an everyday shooter. After about a month of letting it sit in my library, I gave it a try. Damn, were my friends right. The story is what MADE the game. The world of Colombia is sprawling and full of life, which is surprising due to the subject matter. The character of Elizabeth gave the game heart and a way to convey its story through someone else's eyes, rather than the focused and violent sight of Mr. Booker Dewitt. The ending left me speechless, and I talked to my friends about it for hours. I tried the other Bioshocks, but they were not even close to the fun I had with Infinite. They were far too dark and overall lacked the polish of Infinite. Infinite's choice of a lighter atmosphere and a gripping story reeled me in and gave me an overall great experience. It was worth every penny.			"

												Normally I'm not the shooter loving guy. For me they are too repetitive and sometomes boring. But not this game! Despite you plunge right into the story and it's kind of hard to follow sometimes, at least there is a story. And not a bad one either!My most favorite thing about this game is the incredible setting and the dense atmosphere: a flying city, seems kind of odd, but works out and looks great!In addition to this a have to say, that the grafics are just okay and in comparison to titles from 2013 and years before kind of outdated. But still for the comic-like-look of this game totally acceptable.So all in all my pros are: incredible setting  atmosphere Elisabeth (great innovation for a shooter) story soundtrack did I say GREAT SETTING?!?? variety of guns, enemies, locations.Cons: controls are just so-so outdated grafics sometimes you get caught on corners or thing which would indeed tumble overUpdate:This game has some serious stories to tell. Man, it's art!! Kind of hard to follow but damn that end totally amazed and puzzled me!! Great!			"

Anyway as a bioshock series i missed the claustrophobic underwater cities ,under the pressure that any moment somtin will breack and everthing will get flooded... In Infinite , u just run here and there kill booring enemies, and from time to time u fly for a bit , is nice but lack of essence.I dont know why you would want to have the dlc's either , i bet isnt a big difference.Now days games are made by bussiness man and not by true gamers.I think you are beter off playng serious sam , whatever part you like, more fun with it			"

												(9 from 10)Bioshock:Infinite was more in the vein what I had originally wanted from Bioshock 1. And here is why: 1.	It shows the high times of this unique society and its downfall. Unlike the first Bioshock, were you pretty much arrive when most people already left, or died or gone complete crazy.2.	You had a sweet and helpful companion with you (Elizabeth), which in my book is always a plus.3.	It had an interesting ending overall. While you had an extraordinary revelation during mid/endgame of Bioshock 1. The real ending of Bioshock 1 was as generic as it gets.4.	Skyhooks added a certain variety to the generic shooting experience in Bioshock 1. They tried that in Bioshock 1 by adding odd minigames.5.	Graphics are improved, still you often see for which platform it was aimed for (Protip: It was not the PC). They worked with graphical tricks to improve memory management and sometimes it gets ugly.So If not just like to kill some time, but get emotionally involved into an unusual game and its world, you should give it a try!

												This game is stuck way up it's own ♥♥♥. Listened to friends and critics and bought this game for 9.99$ on sale and still feel like I wasted money. The combat was awful, each enemy felt like a bullet sponge. The story isn't very good either, infact it's very, very bad. Its full of plot holes from begining to end. Why doesn't booker cover his hand when he relizes its a sign of the false sheperd? He makes no effort to conceal his hand it doesn't make any sense. also spoilers but why did elizibeth kill booker in the end? if it is infinite universes then wouldn't not matter in the end? wouldn't there just be a universe where he survives in fact there would be an infinite amount of universes where he survives meaning the ending is pointless and ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in every way. so the story and gameplay suck so far, but I will admit that the atmosphere is decent and for the most part I'd say its not great, not good but not bad by any definition. Also if you say Elizibeth fixed the companion mission I WILL ♥♥♥♥ING KILL YOU I SWEAR TO GOD, THIS IS A WRITTEN THREAT. She can't die all she does is give you stuff, you don't have to go out of your way to save her because it's impossible for her die, she is just there to move the story foreward, if you have  a problem don't just taking it out of the game completly you're not fixing it you're just being a lazy sack of ♥♥♥♥. I'd rate this game a 5/10 if you liked this game you're a filthy casual pleb who needs to grow a nutsack			"

												Bioshock Infinite is absolutely amazing, the shere attention to detail and the gripping story made all the time spent looking in every corner of every random lane and fighting wave after wave of interesting (but occaisionally dull) enemies a blast and had justified the 20+ hours I have spent on this game. I found the story in the beginning a bit slow and uneventful, but the bright and glamorous world made up for that with interesting dialogue, spoken by the people lining the streets and the great showcase of the indoctrination of the people by Father Comstock. As the story/game progresses things change dramatically, throwing in plenty of combat and spicing up the story perfectly.After ruthlessly slaughtering countless numbers of enemies I found the combat got a bit dull, and in a way a bit easy after getting most of the upgrades and new weapons/vigors. The enemies are also a bit on the bland side, since most of them are just a darkish colour and little detail on the uniforms I found my self killing what I thought was the same person over and over again, this was especially prevalent towards the end of the game.The combat incorperates a lot of 'fantasy' into it, with things like Vigors and more modern guns with a little less realism and less punch. The physics of the weapons felt great too, they were not way too unrealistic but they weren't too reaslistic either, which provided a nice blend making those heads look as bigger target as always. If I were to have 1 major complaint about the guns it would be how underpowered some guns can be towards the end of the game, where I ran out of ammo for  my sniper and had only a pistol as a replacement. The pistol been my main weapon at the beginning of the game and could take down enemies in what felt like 1 blow, but the pistol had no such effect when taking down the same enemies later on, making one have to completely spray all their ammo at the opponents head to actually take them down.At the end of the story things get very weird and confusing but when the game ends, most previous events in the game begin to come together, but some do not leading to a lot of confusion and possibly sequels (?). The end left me wanting to play again, so that I can find all those little events that link to the main plot and then giggle, thinking about ""how could I have not noticed this before?""This game is one of a small ammount of games that have left me happy and satisfied at the end, and I can definately see myself playing it again sometime in the future. To get a game this great for only $10 was itself amazing. I have seen games that cost a lot more and has been realeased a lot earlier, that are absolutely terrible. Overall I believe Bioshock Infinite to be well worth the time and money, and that Irration games & 2K have done an exellent job, creating what is probably, a masterpiece. I would definately recommend getting this game, and I guarantee (A guarantee? Who has time for all that paperwork?)  you will have fun!  I give it a 10/10			"

												Normally I'm not the shooter loving guy. For me they are too repetitive and sometomes boring. But not this game! Despite you plunge right into the story and it's kind of hard to follow sometimes, at least there is a story. And not a bad one either!My most favorite thing about this game is the incredible setting and the dense atmosphere: a flying city, seems kind of odd, but works out and looks great!In addition to this a have to say, that the grafics are just okay and in comparison to titles from 2013 and years before kind of outdated. But still for the comic-like-look of this game totally acceptable.So all in all my pros are: incredible setting  atmosphere Elisabeth (great innovation for a shooter) story soundtrack did I say GREAT SETTING?!?? variety of guns, enemies, locations.Cons: controls are just so-so outdated grafics sometimes you get caught on corners or thing which would indeed tumble overUpdate:This game has some serious stories to tell. Man, it's art!! Kind of hard to follow but damn that end totally amazed and puzzled me!! Great!			"

												Wonderful gameplay, I even loved most of the story, but the ending was stupid. There is so much that is good about this game, but it is so blatantly biggoted against everyone that is religious. As you find out more about the backstory of the main villain, you come to find out that the ONLY thing that made him become evil was becoming religious, and it unflinchingly portrays everyone who is religious as evil zealots committed to controling everyone in the name of their faith and murdering anyone who resists. If you are even slightly religious, I'd steer clear. If you're staunchly athiest, then this is the game for you.			"

												I've had some time to think about this game, and here are my overall thoughts. (SPOILER-FREE)Bioshock Infinite is at its core an average single-player shooter game. However, this is not what compelled me to pick it up. I picked this game up for around 10 bucks during the Steam Black Friday sale, hearing that the story was excellent, and far better than what you'd see in an everyday shooter. After about a month of letting it sit in my library, I gave it a try. Damn, were my friends right. The story is what MADE the game. The world of Colombia is sprawling and full of life, which is surprising due to the subject matter. The character of Elizabeth gave the game heart and a way to convey its story through someone else's eyes, rather than the focused and violent sight of Mr. Booker Dewitt. The ending left me speechless, and I talked to my friends about it for hours. I tried the other Bioshocks, but they were not even close to the fun I had with Infinite. They were far too dark and overall lacked the polish of Infinite. Infinite's choice of a lighter atmosphere and a gripping story reeled me in and gave me an overall great experience. It was worth every penny.			"

												It was worth the wait. What an AMAZING game! I thought I would miss Rapture too much to enjoy Columbia. WRONG! Columbia is gorgeous. If it weren't populated by over zealous fanatics I would want to visit. This is the first I have experienced a FPS with a protagonist that talks to people, gives commentary, and we learn extensively about his history. Most FPS games that I play you are just a person running around with a gun assigned to shoot stuff. Elizabeth is one of the best sidekicks EVER. Another well fleshed out character. As a Christian, I wasn't offended at the blatant propanganda of the villain. It just showed how people use religion in order to have power over people. The game also gives a twist that you wouldnt guess in a million years. To tell you the truth, the big reveal annoyed the daylights out of me. It's a reveal that if you think about it too long, your head will hurt. Apart from that,  I really enjoyed the game.			"

												They say there is no such thing as a perfect game, but BioShock Infinite certainly almost makes it. Thrown into a submersive plot, in a beautiful but deadly world, BioShock Infinite pushes the boundaries by not keeping to traditional gaming writing.Full of twists and turns, shocks and surprises, tears and emotion, this game feels as if you are not playing it, but rather experiencing it.And that doesn't even scratch the surface of this game. You are accompanied by the amazing Elizabeth through out. With the most amazing AI I have ever seen in a game, Elizabeth feels more like a human than a string of code....BioShock Infinite is a huge step up from the original BioShock, and is the sequel it truly deserves...If you read other reviews for this, and see words like ""unmissable"", ""fantastic"" or ""amazing"" they are not lying...10/10 Game of the year, Game of the generation, and quite possibly the game of my life...

												Bioshock Infinite is one of the best games ever constructed.  If you like shooters with an interesting story, then you’re bound to like this game.  I don’t play shooters very often, but Bioshock Infinite is a game that I can play again and again.Pro:- Richly detailed world- Believable characters- Unique combat- A few puzzles to solves- Optional side missions- Lengthily game play- Engaging storyline- Plot twistCons:- Only one ending, but it’s the right one.The original Bioshock was a fantastic game, but Infinite eclipsed it.  At the time of this review, Bioshock Infinite was selling for $29.99.  Well worth it in my opinion.  If you want to wait for a sale, by all means, but I think it’s worth $30.			"

Set in Columbia, an impossible floating city comprised of a multitude of structures, Bioshock Infinite approaches a similar layout to the first game in the series-not taking into account the System Shock video games-and redefines it from a horror-based open-world story set in the underwater city of Rapture to a more linear swashbuckling adventure with intricate combat sequences as well as platforming elements. I understand that a lot of individuals who favored the first game did so because of very specific ideals-myself being one of them-but I must admit that Bioshock Infinite is still a solid, enjoyable experience; they are both special in their own ways, and should both be given a chance. You play as Booker Dewitt as he travels to said city of Columbia in search of a young woman, Elizabeth, whom he plans to hand over to wipe away a debt he owes; this results in an exciting tale of hardship and intense action.Here are just a few of the features that I enjoyed about Bioshock Infinite:Theme - I am not one to hold a ‘controversial’ theme to my heart because I understand completely that the developers had no intension of offending anyone, so whoever protests “racism” toward this title can listen to one of my favorite Eagles songs titled Get Over It. Most of Columbia’s history melds closely around issues similar to the Civil War, when African American citizens were identified as property, so Bioshock Infinite utilizes the concept of slavery to demonize the majority of citizens and ruling party throughout the game. Comstock chooses African Americans as a favored enemy-therefore receiving a bonus to all attack a damage rolls when facing against them in combat (Dungeons and Dragons joke, do not mind me)-and believes them to be an impure race; this, as well as religious affiliations, paints a majority of individuals within Columbia whom endlessly idolize Comstock as members of a blind faith, and believe him to be some sort of messiah. This hook (pun intended) is a twisted yet interesting one to exploit since the first Bioshock game also features few pseudohistorical references.  Along with the cast of this game, the theme develops into quite a gripping tale unlike many.Gameplay - The key feature that separates Infinite from other ‘Shock’ titles is the swashbuckling gameplay revolving around the Skyhook. With the ability to magnetize to hanging rails above, this new item allows the player to melee strike without the need to switch weapons, perform executions on damaged enemies, and even adds an element of platforming to the fray. Vigors reappear within Infinite’s story but modify play as an addition to combat such as in previous Bioshock titles. Fluid gameplay is also included in this installment, though players may only carry two weapons at a time; though this is one of the newer features to the ‘Shock’ games, it is also one which previous fanatics did not enjoy due to it too closely resembling a modern first person shooter title while also shying away from the first game. Overall, despite its minor setbacks in its combat system, Bioshock Infinite’s gameplay blends very well with story elements and sequences.(Partially) Open World - Though certain sections are closed off after specific story progressions, Bioshock Infinite permits the player to backtrack through previous segments to loot silver dollars-the currency in this title-, health and salt boosts, and to finish side quests, which generally direct players off-route in order to gain other helpful advances. This system is just open enough to fit the swashbuckling style without sacrificing story elements.Clothing/Perk System - Within the numerous actions Booker Dewitt can perform are an array of combination attacks and tactics; however, a player may become too accustomed to one set of combat maneuvers to attempt any of the other functions of the games such as the Skyhook’s flying melee attack. This is where the clothing system comes into play. Clothing acts as a perk or upgrade system since various actions-such as said Skyhook drop-can be modified to obtain additional effects. For example, there is an article of clothing that grants all of the player’s melee attacks chained electrical damage as well as the base melee damage, which would entice players to attempt using melee attacks more frequently. This system, though, could be considered a double-edged blade as it may also provoke players to adopt new strategies or cause them to become dependent on a specific set of upgrades and, subsequently, actions; either way, it is an interesting concept.1999 Mode - Unlocked after completing the game’s campaign at least once, 1999 mode offers a challenge to players that seek it. In this mode, players take increased damage from enemy attacks and the respawn system is dramatically altered in that you lose one hundred silver dollars when you die. Not being able to pay this fee upon death means losing all progress in the current save slot. This offers a fun and challenging experience to those that believe they have mastered this game and wish to juggle expenses between vending machines and life itself.TL:DR - It is difficult  to say what has already been said about this award-winning title. Bioshock Infinite blends well with the gameplay of its predecessors while also retaining some original elements, as well as telling an outstanding story packed with intense action, twists, and sorrow. Infinite is certainly a title to explore if you have not done so, prior fanatic to the series or not. Thanks for reading.Do you enjoy these reviews?

												Love Bioshock! Played all releases and never been disappointed.  This instalment of Infinite is just great, some many changes from the first two, but highly enjoyable and graphically sound.Story is very complex and a little hard to understand or picture, but if you get the DLC's especially Ep1 & 2 BAS then this will explain better, and blow your mind.If you like FPS and played Bioshock 1&2 then get it, you won’t regret it. If you’re new to Bioshock then playing this first is ok.  I would recommend purchasing all editions to benefit the story and references of characters.Just Awesome! "

												-If you want to play a visually very realistic looking game, this game is not for you-If you just want to skip and ignore all the story a game wants to offer, this game is not for you-If you are a die hard fan of original Bioshock 1 and 2, you might get dissapointed with this-If you are none of the one I listed above, then this game is a MUST TRYBioshock Infinite takes place in floating city of Columbia instead of underwater Rapture city.This game is artisticly impressive and perfectly suits the game itself. The story is very rich itself and satisfying but a little confusing if you have not played Bioshock 1 and 2, as I am being on this one(I get most of the story line from internet). Even if this game does not have what you used to enjoyed in original Bioshock and some other gameplay flaws, giving this game a thumbs down is just ridiculous in my opinion. You can disagree with me if you want. But if this is the first time you ever come across with this game or wondering wheter this game is worth your try, PLAY IT. I used to get the pirate version of this game, but this game is so impressive it made me bought it during sales.Even if this game comes out at this year, it will still be my GOTY.			"

It's story, Its caracters, Its gameplay, Its music and the list goes on...It was a completely different game from the original Bioshock and even the DLC, (that I did a review for too) despite being set in the same location as the original Bioshock and being a direct prequel, still is as different as a cat is from a dog. Let's start with the story. The story was a tad longer than the original Bioshock. It does not have different endings like it, but leads to one concluding (un)expected climax. All of the endings (by all I mean the ones from the dlc too) made me sad. It doesn't reach the tears level sad, that it could aswell have, if they had put a little more work into it, but is still pretty sad. Maybe, because I personally didn't understand the characters completely, or maybe just because I am a heartless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who would punch another person for a laugh. One of the game's main mind-tricks are constants and variables. It's always mentioned in the story. They seem to be very important, but in truth, the little parts and the decisions you make don't really matter. The only difference the pendant you chose made, was which one was on Elizabeth's neck throughout the rest of the game. It makes you think that the variables matter, but in truth, the only things that matter and make the story are the constants, which leads me to the characters. The characters, as I said are very well voiced and animated. You can actually feel their inner suffering and wish to help as much as you can, but the game is, technically a sad corridor walk.  If I were any of those characters, I would have taken the other paths so many times, but the game just doesn't allow you to do it, despite being an RPG, with a little bit of open world, (as tiny optional areas to explore). Though, to anyone playing this game, I will again and again recommend exploring the hidden rooms, listening to the voxophones and doing optional objectives, as you will get more money, infusions, and even access some vigors earlier than you are supposed to. Also, it is good for the eye, as the flying city of Columbia, and later on the underwater city of Rapture are very beautiful locations, that require long stares to truly appreciate their beauty. The combat, at least in the original campaign, is a costrated version of the combat from Bioshock 2. Yes you can have both plasmids and guns at the same time, no you can only have two guns on you at a time, or at least until you do the DLC. Combat in the DLC tries to re-capture the Bioshock 2 one, allowing you to have all the weapons on you, using the style of this game's HUDs. Also a major drawback in combat, for me at least, is that different from the first games, weapon upgrades are not visible. I buy a longer clip for my machinegun, and what do I get? the same machinegun with the same clip. Where did the room for 80 more bullets come from? Is it bigger on the inside? It's not that much of a problem, but it's quite a disappointment, for me at least. What do I still have to go over... oh yes, the difficulty! Even on the hardest difficulty the game was fairly easy. Yes, there were a couple places, where I couldn't get pat on my first try, but they were all doable, all thanks to previous preparation, and visiting optional areas. No really, you should really do it. It's better for your own sake. SPOILERS AHEAD, READ AT OWN RISK!Lastly, I want to draw this one last comparison to the original Bioshock and Bioshock Infinite. The original Bioshock's story focused highly on Ideology and psychology, especially with the suddent plot twist at the end. It makes you question yourself. Who am I? What ideology is best for me? Am I truly living for myself or am I just somebody's slave? While still having psychological aspects to the plot, Bioshock Infinite focuses more on science(-fiction), racism and battle of the classes, and religion, a little bit. Starting from the end, the religion part comes from the fact that all the opressive, white, rich capitlists are Christians, who believe in American exceptionalism, thinking that the new ""Noah's ark"" is only for them and the other skin colors are there to serve them as lesser humans. While this makes you feel for the ""Lesser humans"", know, they act just like the higher class says they act, despite saying they don't. The white man claims to fight anarchists, who kill women and children, but they themselves don't hesitate to shoot anyone wearing red on sight. The Vox on the other hand claim they just want to stop the oppression and live in equality and peace, by doing anything but peaceful things. Sadly, the game doesn't let you decide your evil and does it for you. Though it is kind of good too, since you don't have to check are they shootable on sight and can literally kill everyone that comes on your path, and in the end you're left as a neutral fighting for themself and not stupid ideas. Being done with racism and religion, I've still got the science(fiction) aspect to explain. Ken Levine believes in the theory of parallel universes, and lets you use them as help throughout your adventures. That's it.Now if you really read this all through and didn't skip this pointless mumbo-jumbo like you should have, here's my rating for this game.123 Heads/123 coin flips, otherwise the game just wouldn't have worked, and Booker wouldn't have saved Elizabeth.

Bioshock Infinite is my absolute favorite game of all time. No other story I have seen has managed to do what infinite does. An essential part of the experience is the DLC, Burial at Sea 1 & 2. You have to play those. If you don't, you are missing a tremendous part of the story and experience. Especially episode 2. It's one of the most moving experiences I have ever had. Some people may not like this game, for some reason,  but if you like an amazing story, characters, and a ton of fun, pick this up. You won't forget it.			"

												Well, this is a pretty interesting game and it make me start to thinking about my past life.

So I give the game itself a 9 out of 10The 20 bonus is for Elizabeth. The studio build this character perfectly and she is so MOE(CUTE/LOVELY)! Other than that I don't want to talk more.That's it from now.			"

												As someone who plays for the story and the characters, I find the mechanics to be less important than a good narrative, which is why I was able to look past some of the flaws.

												-If you want to play a visually very realistic looking game, this game is not for you-If you just want to skip and ignore all the story a game wants to offer, this game is not for you-If you are a die hard fan of original Bioshock 1 and 2, you might get dissapointed with this-If you are none of the one I listed above, then this game is a MUST TRYBioshock Infinite takes place in floating city of Columbia instead of underwater Rapture city.This game is artisticly impressive and perfectly suits the game itself. The story is very rich itself and satisfying but a little confusing if you have not played Bioshock 1 and 2, as I am being on this one(I get most of the story line from internet). Even if this game does not have what you used to enjoyed in original Bioshock and some other gameplay flaws, giving this game a thumbs down is just ridiculous in my opinion. You can disagree with me if you want. But if this is the first time you ever come across with this game or wondering wheter this game is worth your try, PLAY IT. I used to get the pirate version of this game, but this game is so impressive it made me bought it during sales.Even if this game comes out at this year, it will still be my GOTY.			"

												If all you want is a pretty game with decent gameplay and don't care about / don't pay attention to story, in terms of for example dramatic pacing or coherence, then BioInf is the game for you. Otherwise you may want to read this review to contrast the fanboy fawning from the industry and previous fans of the series.This is my opinion: BioInf is a beautiful game, with mediocre gameplay where longer healthbars simulate difficulty, and a story that pretends to be deep while it's really mostly pretentious, chopped up, and doesn't ""handle"" and of the issues it briefly touches on. I could write you an essay about all the plot flaws; examples being blatantly ignoring huge character events, having Booker act like a total retard (and I mean extra everything total retard even in game terms) to make the story even more convoluted, and not keeping to their own in-universe laws. They introduce story elements like travel in time and between worlds in the multiverse, but don't seem to take into account the obvious consequences; for example, why does Booker assume that if they pass into a new world, his old deal with someone would be valid over there? And concerning all the deep issues it handles; you get hammered by racism, then all the black people go murderbrawl and you have to mindlessly shoot them all, is that what people mean by the game ""handling big and important issues""?Now, I don't think BioInf is a worthless game; it can be fun at times. The intro is fantastically beautiful, for example. But if the question is simply: did I think it was worth my time and money spent? then my answer is no. The original idea of this game may have been brilliant, and the story complex and beautiful, but it feels like it's been compromised too many times in development, and consequently can't hold itself together. It may have benefited from not taking up quite so many ""deep and important issues"" and not branching out into quite so many things. It ends up trying very hard to be something it isn't: a good story.			"

												This review is more about preference than quality.This was a tough one for me, as the visuals and presentation were outstanding, but sadly there is a lot wrong with this game, and it's all in the gameplay. I'll start by saying that all of the amazing things shown in the E3 demos was cut for some reason and replaced by more basic and less interesting content.The game itself is extremely linear run-and-gun, but slower and less convenient. Rather than explore a city, you get locked into small arenas with a circular railway circuit and are forced to fight a number of respawning enemies until a timer runs out and you're allowed to leave.The complexity of levels is comparable to more faster-paced, more straightforward shooters like Serious Sam, but scaled up in size immensely, which while looks impressive, also means it takes ages to move down pretty basic paths. Exploration involves backtracking miles to find secret buttons or clues, meaning a bad hunch can waste over 20 minutes of walking (which happened to me a few times).Combat is run-and-gun, but slowed down with combat mechanics that are interesting at first (and I'm sure many gamers would love it), but for me gets jarring and annoying quickly. You get Elizabeth to spawn in infinite ammo boxes, minor barricades or friendly versions of NPCs to distract enemies (and no escape routes or secret passages as previously planned). You then use a basic 'stun' attack with the vigors and then shoot the enemy in their weak spot to kill them, and you have to do this a LOT and the pace of the game gets annoyingly slow as a result. Because you are expected very strongly to use the vigors, the guns are extremely unreliable. To make matters worse, you have only two weapon slots, you can only switch guns with dropped weapons, and ammo can completely vanish in certain areas, with many areas that strongly lean towards specific weapon types- which skews gameplay in many annoying and frustrating ways.Story was ok-ish, and the presentation of the story was certainly excellent. But again, compared to the trailers, nowhere near as good. The vibrant living atmosphere of a city full of paranoid psychos where Booker tries his best to blend in at his own peril when they could turn on him any minute? Wasn't there. After the opening sequence, the streets are deserted for the rest of the game except for the badguys (police or rebels) waiting to fight you and its a standard first-person shooter. Another problem is the majority of the story is delivered solely via voxophones (audio logs), which are mostly hidden and easily interrupted by scripted character speech, meaning the player must wait for a quiet spot, turn it on, and just sit around listening to it. Some in-world spoken information is easy to miss by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Overall, it's very easy to miss what is going on.Overall, it was a pity, as it could have been outstanding, and there is nothing in the game that is legitimately botched or crappy, and to its further credit, the drawbacks I listed were all fairly ambitious ideas and mechanics that I think many people will love (that I simply didn't), and never to poor or unimaginative design that plagues many other games. If you think an approach like this, or a theatrical experience, is worthwhile in itself, and don't mind the gameplay style, then certainly buy it, if you're like me- maybe not.			"

												First of all I want to start off by saying I am a huge fan of the Bioshock series and fell in love with System Shock a long, long time ago. I can recommend this game if only for the story. This has by far been the most disappointing entry in the series for me. Let's get to the basics shall we?-Structure: One of the biggest let downs of the title. While there have always been directives and objectives and overall goals sewn into the games, this one follows one core goal to the next in a very linear fashion compared to the others. You have a mission and there isn't any deviating or experimenting afoot, you might have a few instances where you can veer off briefly and grab a new piece of clothing or boost,  but these opportunities are few and far between. You have one autosave checkpoint to the next and if by God for some reason you were to get lost, a simple tap of the up on the Dpad will paint a line showing you where to go next. It's essentially a strict path to follow from one story bullet to the next. 4/10-Game play: Another disappointing occurrence in what could have been something amazing. The game play in this title is never fully actualized or as fleshed out as it could have been. What you have is a sprawling city atop the clouds and they're all intertwined and connected with these sky-lines. This game could have been as grand and diverse as the original Bioshock but what you essentially get is a connected roller coaster to fly on from one checkpoint to the next. The gun play leaves something to be desired, weapons feel different in their own right but the feeling has been lost from Bioshock. When you would round a corner and see a group of enemies or a Big Daddy and then mentally prepare on how to tackle it. You could lay down some mines or trip wire, stay close to a puddle of water to electrocute your prey and just have a variety of well planned destruction at your disposal. With this game all you really need to do is throw a bronco and or toss some grenades and empty your clip and wait for Elizabeth to toss you another needed resource. 6/10Presentation: This is where the game really shines and shows that if most things are lost in an Irrational title, they can still tell one hell of a story. What you're presented with is a story that dissects culture as we've come to know. A brainwashed patriotism powered by slavery and a bunch of other somewhat touchy areas throughout history. Racism is thrown up at every corner, and it feels like it fits for an early 1900's era.You can still see some of the overzealous Christian overtones and theme they shove down your throat, for story telling purposes. The graphics are beautiful and colorful with the vivid image of Red, White, and Blue painting the sky and interiors of all the places you'll come to see. While the story crosses into some nonsensical territory, overall it's brought to you in a beautiful way and I expected nothing less. The shining beacon of light in this game is the story so hang on every word it might be all you have or can take from it. 10/10Overall I'm not sure what you intend to take from this game, I wanted to love it, I really did but the story is the only basis I can recommend this title for. Your game time will stretch further than a lot of other FPS games will these days but that's it's job, after all it's Bioshock and not Call of Duty. If you bought this on sale you may very well get your money's worth, just see yourself as paying for a really damn good story. Just remember, there's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, and there's always a city. You'll know it when you need to.			"

												There are a lot of positive reviews for this game, which was initially what compelled me to purcahse it upon release. It was praised for its ""excellent story"" and immersive qualities. While it does have a decently gripping plot, Bioshock Infinite suffers from lack of gameplay quality. Enough so that I would not recommend this game to most players.Bioshock Infinite holds a scary resemblence to Assassin's Creed (the first one) not in the sense that the setting or story are the same, but both have a great story and terrible gameplay. Like in Assassin's Creed, Bioshock Infinite has you doing the same things in the same scenarios over and over again while trying to switch it up by adding new elements to the same system. This repetitive style of development is completely transparent after your first handful of encounters and while not even halfway through the game, you can tell there is no end in sight to the repetition. In order to get through the plot, one has to hack and slash one's way through the dull gameplay; an uphill battle from which I chose to retreat from after about a third of the way into the game.I applaud both Bioshock Infinite and Assassin's Creed for their efforts in storytelling, as it's a quality that is severely lacking in the video game industry and rarely explored. The Assassin's Creed team learned from their mistakes and hit a homerun with their second installment, Assassin's Creed II. Hopefully the Bioshock team will also learn from theirs and create a game that can tell a riveting tale as well as engage the player. However, Bioshock Infinite simply does not cut it.			"

The gameplay is unique and is very well done. Many combinations to use to fit your style. There isn't much to really learn throughout the game, it is a very simple gameplay experience and works so well. It is one of my favorite games of all time. Totally mind-blown about the whole game, it goes further into the story than most games and it does it so well. 10/10			"

												Very well structured and well made game with an incredible story to top it off. The graphics are spectacular, yet the game is not stressfull on your hardware. The DLC is also very worth while as it ties off a lot of loose ends. Over all a Triple A 10/10 experience.			"

												Minimize the game on its raw features and Bioshock Infinite might not seem like a big step on from the original, but the new setting is magnificent, the story is complex and powerful, and Elizabeth is the most brilliant and mysterious character in the game history.  Most importantly, Infinite is an incredible experience, and one that every gamer should go through, connect with and enjoy. Like its predecessor, this is one of the era’s most essential games. Even most important are its DLCs, which you have to play to get a satisfied endig.			"

												Leaving Andrew Ryan behind and scouring the figure of a comparable autocrat/antagonist for a new BioShock title was no easy task for the developers; I acknowledge that, but I cannot pretend I did not forget Comstock's voice and assertions as the story progressed. Unlike Rapture's idealiser, Columbia's had little imposing density in his character. But BioShock is not entirely about its self-righteous and paradoxical authority personalities, and Infinite shines outside this conceptual bubble. In spawning a more ancient, more morally delusional - and picturesque - society, the game becomes more satirical, thus more interesting to add to. A vivid city, Columbia exposes the illnesses of the American ""Thule"", so to speak. Over those clouds lurks a shadow of disguised hate and disciplined stupidity, much like the idealisation of national rights of John Gast's Columbia and the dangerous romanticising of the Manifest Destiny. Only this time, America went airborne, not westwards.Infinite triumphs on this premise. As it unfolds - so subtly -, its characters become less of casual citizens and more of monsters, just as its astonishing streets become filthy paths exposed by rebellious graffiti and mauled bodies. Its beautiful design and graphics provide the eye with constant awe, as though those bright windows and doorways far into the sky were veritable man-made stars. It is a joy to witness the game's visual ascension as you attempt Elizabeth's ""rescue"" and learn more about that floating pseudo-paradise.Oh, and speaking of Elizabeth. Although I expected more than an almost quintessential damsel in distress, voice acting and writing often gave me hope; and her background, fears and convictions throughout the story - not to mention her in-game functions, tacit but exciting as they are - forced me to think back to previous milestones of the story and look at the whole scenario from a standpoint which was not that of Booker DeWitt's. That was unique, I have got to say.BioShock Infinite may not cause as much thematic bewitchment or those dialogue goose pimples, but it offers decent food for thought; which is the safe haven of the series. Its virtue may not lie in character conception or in the renewal of the plasmid feature, for example, but its well-paced and extremely pleasurable gameplay, its audiovisual style, its sidekick system and its plotline premise hold consistency to the end of the chapter, refusing to even steer close to collapse. The BioShock name, though currently with a relatively uncertain future, still shines.			"

												Don't let that Metascore fool you, this game is pretty bad.  If anything it is average at best.  Very linear, the sound sucks, graphics are pretty bad up close even on highest detail setting, the weapons are all just different variations of pistol, shotgun machine gun, and rocket launcher.  The different special abilites are all pretty much the same.  You can either use the ability as an attack or set a trap that stuns enemies.  The game ends up being VERY repetitive.  I do not recommend this game to anyone who would pay more than $5 for it.

												""10/10"" ""100%"" ""A+""Every review of this game (every. single. one) gave this game the highest marks in all of human history. Every review seems like the person reviewing the game actually lived in the Bioshock universe. Every review praised the story and gameplay for ""innovation"" and ""breaking boundries"" (look up a review and I will guarantee that they use those words). Bioshock Infinite was the most mediocre game I have ever played. It was more mediocre than every Call Of Duty game ever. (I haven't played Ghosts, but I think it will be better than Bioshock) I have a hard time comprehending the praise this game (or any Bioshock game) gets. As for the story or setting or whatever, it was average at best and just a bit stupid. The entire game was just navigating your way through a dumb, heavy handed, and tired message about how American Exceptionalism is bad. It's the video game equivalent of the guy standing next to some skyscraper in NYC holding wearing a sandwhich board listing all the evils of capitalism.			"

												Would I recommend this? Honestly, as much good as I heard about it before I played, I have to disagree with what I heard and say no. At best it's a mediocre experience. In every aspect it falls short of the original game, even with borrowed combat that manages to feel even worse than it did 5 years ago. After clearing area after area of bullet-sponge enemies, I really questioned how the combat tied into the story at all. Indeed, this game suffers because of this disconnect. The characters were honestly rather bland and I still didn't really care about them by the end of the game. Even the ending was rather under-done and felt like more of a cop-out than a well tailored finale.On a more positive note, the environment was done very well. Visually this game is pleasing and just as stunning as my first playthrough in Rapture from the original.Overall, this game was a big disappointment to see from such a good developer. If played without comparing it to the original Bioshock, it is a decent game but by no means a ""must-play."" I think 10 or 15 dollars is as much as this game is worth.			"

												This game is a very glitzi shadow of its predecessors.Pro's-Eye Candy.-Story.Con's: -Very linear gaming, with an attempt to portray itself an open enviorionment.-Often monotonous killing of the same handful of enemies.  A task so easy and predictable, you really don't have any need for sky rails or your powers.  You could just as easily pick up solely the carbine rifle and waltz your way through the game.-Vigors that often feel repetitive, uninspired, or just down right useless when compared to simply shooting your victim.-Half the weapons even in their upgraded form pale in comparison to others, such as the Burstgun. They also did away with changing the weapon models to reflect the upgrade, which was a fun aspect I liked in the previous game.-Over priced upgrade stations around every corner, that will eventually make you wonder why you are scavenging every coin to barely afford an upgrade that has such a small overall effect on game play.-Very little suspense, mystery, and ambience when compared to the first two games.-A sidekick who has the ability to summon objects into existence, yet the imaginative designers chose to only have the same four object types which are placed similarly every fight in the game.This game really becomes a grind with an astonishing disparity between environment and gameplay.  As you go through the game it further and further boils down to ""pickup things, enter room, clear room of the same reskinned enemies , pickup things, proceed to next room"".  You start with a new an interesting world that some how degrades into the shooting grind of the airships towards the end of the game... a grind that many other games have done better.The game is worth playing at a greatly reduced sale price, but I am really confused how people think that it should of won GOTY 2013 or that it is a true spiritual successor to the two previous games.

												One of the most over-rated games I've played in years. It feels like a step backwards for the series. So much of the game world is wide open, and yet so empty. The combat is bland and often unbalanced. I'm not convinced that the story is written very well, either (although if I explained why, I'd be spoiling it).The best thing I can say about it is that one scene very early on in the game was quite immersive and did a good job of making me feel very uncomfortable. The developers also did a good job of making escorting Elizabeth not feel like a chore; she generally stays out of the way during combat and even pops in to help when you're in trouble. Nevertheless, it's not enough to make the whole experience worthwhile.			"

												Talk about the perfect game...If you have not attained this beautiful masterpiece then you are missing out. It blows the other 2 bioshock games out of the water combined. The plot, action, scenery, mystery, and suspense will keep you playing this game until you either pass out in front of your computer or your console. I implore any gamer to buy Bioshock Infinite essentially if you haven't understood my pleas to make your wallet cry some more in protest. Booker DeWitt and Elizabeth's characters are so unique and engaging that it instantly captures ones attention and enthralls you. You play as the main character (DeWitt), and Elizabeth is your companion. You may be thinking ""Oh great another pointless npc who will get in the way."" WRONG Elizabeth is crucial to almost all aspects in the game including gun fights. To me, Elizabeth isn't just some pretty face or a damsel in distress--she is the best damn wingman to ever don a dress. There are also a wide variety of new guns and plasmids, err vigors, at your disposal to use that were very much needed in comparison to its' predecesors choice of weaponry. I will stop now before I reveal too much more as I could still go on about this game. Let me just reiterate that this is indeed well worth every last penny you put into this game. At the very least, you should give it a shot at some point in your life, even if you must borrow it from a friend. ~Buy. Now.~			"

It's one of those games where you just wanna erase your memory and play it all again, and although I came late to the party by finishing this game pretty recently, it didn't matter. This game is a timeless effigy to the extent a game can make you feel and care for the characters and is a real testament to incredible gameplay and game design. Not only is it a great entry to the Bioshock series as a whole, it's a game that will always make you crack a smile when you see it in your library, remembering all the unexpected twists the story had (and how it made you ponder the ending for days afterward).Overall, Bioshock: Infinite is a requirement for anybody with even a slight video game interest and the SUPERIOR 'Infinite' game after the new COD was announced with the same name.

												BioShock Infinite is by no means a terrible game, but compared to its predecessor, it has many of the same flaws and lacks the redeeming poetry and vision.BioShock is now a modern classic. Its successor, BioShock Infinite, takes us to a new world that is superficially just as captivating as Rapture, but the similarities are purely superficial. Where BioShock had ideas, Infinite simply has plot devices. Where BioShock asked us to choose, Infinite just asks us to run and shoot.Part of what made BioShock special was that its ideas, emotions, story content, and gameplay were all coherent in a thematically consistent way. Ultimately BioShock told a story that was thematically compatible, and even thematically harmonious, with the conceits and conventions of FPS games. BioShock Infinite tries to tell a story, but the dissonance between the narrative/emotional content and the gameplay content is jarring in the new installment. It doesn't help that the story, though told with exquisite craft and care, ultimately is for all its artistry utterly inane.With a story that is so thoroughly undermined by the gameplay mechanics, Infinite needs to lean heavily on gameplay to be entertainment. Unfortunately, like BioShock, Infinite is merely a competent shooter from a gameplay perspective. Worse, the level designs are now more linear.In sum, it's a competent but underwhelming game, and outright disappointing when set against its predecessor.			"

												With imagination ranging from underwater cities to floating cities built high above the clouds, Irrational Games and parent company 2K never disappoint.Bioshock Infinite sports a new unique combination of fast paced, rollercoaster, shooter gameplay. On top of the innovative gameplay Irrational and 2K do an exceptional job of creating beautiful environments, and constructing a polished narrative and pulling off an excellent story. Infinite might bear a lot of differences compared to its predecessors in the Bioshock franchise, but the story and atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Infinite’s Inception-esque conclusion will have players on the edge of their computer chairs and then continue on to blow their minds. Overall Irrational and 2K, as always worked up an amazing title worthy of winning many game of the year awards. Not incorporating an excessively fun completive or cooperative multiplayer modes are the only gripes that comes to mind. Not to worry. Due to excellent DLC releases I think Bioshock Infinite has the potential to keep audiences hooked and wanting more of Columbia for quite some time. Bioshock Infinite comes neck and neck with its original predecessor in this outstanding series.If you’re looking for a great single player experience with stellar visuals, and some of the best story telling the videogame market has to offer, don’t pass up a chance to enjoy Bioshock Infinite!

												With Bioshock Infinite comes a game like you would never expect it these days !I just finished it and i was blowed away by this ending but i dont wanna spoiler anything.Take the gameplay from the first Bioshocks and make it a little bit better, give it more graphic (Atleast from the distance these graphics are SO damn good! See my screenshots) and throw in a fantastic story and let them develop it for 3 or more years and you get a game that deserves its 96 Metacritic score.To me one of the best games i played in my life and easily the best game of the year, if not of the decade (2010-2020).I cant understand why other games cant do this,  i can only come up with one reason for this, the Publishers ! The best example is EA... they destroyed Bioware, you can see this in looking at their old games and compare them to those new ones.Just stop buying games from such publishers and maybe they will return to let devs make good games such as this one again.I beat it in 15 hours on hard difficulty, tried to collect everything.And i highly recommend playing it on hard.Whatever, thanks Irrational Games for giving me this awesome experience with your game.

At first it seems simple, but then it gradually becomes more and more complex, revealing things for what they truly are at the very end in a very unexpected manner.If you haven't played this game yet, I highly recommend you to do so! This game has it all, from visual and gameplay appeal, to the story which words may hardly describe.

												Had loads of fun with this game. Everything is beautifully crafted, especially the set designs that come in a huge variety but all remain fresh and equally interesting. As with the original Bioshock, the intricate presentation of social themes and ideologies are an important part of the overarching design, and Bioshock Infinite is no different. They are gripping and clearly presented, while refraining from distracting the player from the main narrative. The story, while confusing and even overbearing at times, is intriguing, reaching a fascinating crescendo during the last 20 minutes of the game.The game is by no means 'perfect', but the clear amount of affection and care that has been put into every small detail in all of its many, many different components results in something that is thoroughly remarkable and enjoyable. It's a game that should be respected, and more importantly enjoyed, for a sum of all its parts.			"

The gameplay mechanics are worst (the main example is that they introduce a stupid and mindless mechanic of ""press F to receive a reward from Elizabeth"", which interrupts all combat, and makes you invulnerable during the action so there is no strategy involved, just press F anytime the game tells you to and receive your reward) and interface for dealing with the vending machines is still not improved, the entire game is very linear and there are no choices to make.

												5/10While fun was had, the game was mediocre overall. Just because I had fun doesn't mean others should look for it in a dissappointing game.Pros:-Artistic Direction was great.-Sound/VA very well done.-Skyrails make fights more interesting than previous bioshocks.Cons:-Story was convoluted and generally bad. It doesn't explore the difficult situations that it presents, and roughly halfway through the game the plot dissappears due to multiverse theory. The ending only exacerbates the muddy storytelling.-The choices made in game were pointless.-Voxophones were nowhere near as interesting as audio diaries or audio logs.-Characterization of Comstock, Fink, Fitzroy, Slate, etc. just fall flat compared to Ryan, Fontaine, Cohen, Steinman, or even Delacroix, Polito, Shodan, and Xerxes.-While we're on the subject Elizabeth was not very well done either.-Corridor shooter.-Not enough Skyrails, and conceptually they make no sense.-2 gun limit.-Shields for no reason.-Vigors overly similar in terms of utility.-No hacking or Research Camera.-Enemies lack variety.-Difficulty was implemented poorly, giving enemies more health just makes playing tedious.

												The story line in this game is good, but its not very clear unless you spend time actually trying to go along with it. The graphics are outstanding, the gameplay is fun but can be tricky at times. I will say its very overpriced for the amount of gameplay you get, 8 hours if you just casual play and get stuck at bits (my experience) and probably around 12 if you spend time trying to do extras.

												This game was really disappointing. The story was fine and surprising. However the gameplay was going strictly for FPS fun but did not deliver. It was dull, the guns have no heft and even upgrading them did give them extra oomph. It doesn't help that I am not that creative with my powers but still I did not care for the final battle. I thought the songbird would have branched ending but it looks like it made no difference. Oh well, I can see why people said it sucked. Try it out if you never played any of the Bioshock games and then play the first one to get something really cool. 2/5			"

												With imagination ranging from underwater cities to floating cities built high above the clouds, Irrational Games and parent company 2K never disappoint.Bioshock Infinite sports a new unique combination of fast paced, rollercoaster, shooter gameplay. On top of the innovative gameplay Irrational and 2K do an exceptional job of creating beautiful environments, and constructing a polished narrative and pulling off an excellent story. Infinite might bear a lot of differences compared to its predecessors in the Bioshock franchise, but the story and atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Infinite’s Inception-esque conclusion will have players on the edge of their computer chairs and then continue on to blow their minds. Overall Irrational and 2K, as always worked up an amazing title worthy of winning many game of the year awards. Not incorporating an excessively fun completive or cooperative multiplayer modes are the only gripes that comes to mind. Not to worry. Due to excellent DLC releases I think Bioshock Infinite has the potential to keep audiences hooked and wanting more of Columbia for quite some time. Bioshock Infinite comes neck and neck with its original predecessor in this outstanding series.If you’re looking for a great single player experience with stellar visuals, and some of the best story telling the videogame market has to offer, don’t pass up a chance to enjoy Bioshock Infinite!

Vigors turned out worse than Plasmids, the only big change was inability to store hypos and inability to get ""one use while there is still some EVA"", the principle that was the foundation of Hypnotize Big Daddy price and overall Vigors are weaker and bleaker than Plasmids (so what we can make a trap from almost each of them?

It didn't affect anything than the neck of Elisabeth that you can never see up close as she avoids aim reticule.And the epic plot about the fate of Floating city became a story of interdementional, but all the more petty squabble about parental rights with both of the fathers being crazy, stubborn and stupid.I must still admit - this one isn't always a corridor shooter.

												This is my fave Bioshock game,  better characters that I actually felt like I cared about,  I like that the characters talk to each other and have banter, previous games only chatter you'd get is from audio logs or a radio message telling you what to do next, environment is visually gorgeous and has an immersive if somewhat convoluted story.I like Columbia much more than I do Rapture,  swinging around on sky hooks and using a sky hook to swoop down and kill an enemy. I was starting to get sick of Rapture and am glad this game has a different setting.The game gives the illusion of a vast expansive sky city, it does not have the stuffy claustrophobic feel of the underwater city Rapture. In Columbia you just want to soar and swoop at every chance you can. Though it does make my stomach churn at times using a sky rail is almost like riding a roller coaster.Elizabeth is an interesting character though at first she reminded me a lot of a Disney princess, the way she moves, expressions in an over exagerated disney princess way, she's almost a rip off of Belle from Beauty and the Beast in how she looks, she has same hairstyle, big over large eyes.You have a variety of ways to kill enemies you can ask elizabeth to open a tear so you can have more cover, a hook for swinging off, medical kits, guns, turrets, though that is limited as you can only have 1 tear open and active at a time.But the game is not without frustration.You can only carry 2 guns at a time which is very limiting, though you can swap 1 gun you are carrying for a gun that's on the ground, you can never carry more than 2 at a time.Vigors are often the most fun and versatile ways to kill which are the replacement for plasmids but are much more limited in their use as you can't carry salts on you, you seem to run out of salts way too quickly though  (salts are the blue energy metre simular to eve) to replenish salts you have to find some sort of drink or a bottle of salts. Usually there are salts nearby or Elizabeth will find and toss you some.You can't carry first aid kits either but you have a energy shield which is better, you don't lose health unless your shield is fully depleted and if that happens you can just hide till it replenishes.But even so I found the battles more fast paced and enjoyable than the previous Bioshocks.I dislike most  that there is only auto save and you can't save your game when you want. I wanted to stop playing but it said my last auto save was 10 minutes ago, so had to keep playing for 10 more minutes to get the next checkpoint. It makes it so I have to replay again if I just want to quit playing. The most annoying thing about the game. I had to leave the game running when I wanted a break as my last checkpoint save was half an hour ago, auto saves should be at least every 10 minutes.There is no hacking, I miss that.The only thing that is a tiny bit like it is that Elizabeth can pick locks for you, but there is no mini game associated with it.To sumarise it overall the game is better in some ways than the other Bioshocks but also worse in other aspects.The story overall is rather freaky, tragic and messes with your head, I did a lot of reading about it to understand the story fully. But I better not say anything else as I don't want to spoil it for those who have not played and completed the game.Mostly though it feels enjoyable, fun, scary in some ways and exciting. Though unlike others I would not got so far as to say it's one of the best games I've played. Almost would rate it an 8, but there is too many negatives that the game should not have, it does not deserve more than 7/10.			"

												I have to admit, at first I was skeptical about Bioshock Infinite.  I am a massive fan of its predecessors but the small amount of information that I had heard about the third game in the series had me unsure of whether it would carry the legacy or be a brutal flop.  Finally, I gave this game a try and I was blown away by it.Instead of making a return Rapture, Bioshock Infinite brings you to the flying city of Columbia.  Your character, Booker DeWitt has made his way to this city to find a girl who you have been hired to collect.  From very early on the atmosphere is built in such an amazing way that I can think of few other games that can compete with it.  The story is full of incredibly well-written plot twists, one that even made me stare at the screen in shock which is quite the accomplishment for a game.  Obviously, I want to avoid spoilers but I will whole-heartedly slam down my stamp of approval on the story from start to finish.The gun play and vigors (the new plasmids) are very reminiscent of the earlier Bioshocks and not a whole lot has changed there.  It's still an enjoyable first-person shooter but these mechanics are nowhere near as mind-blowing as the story.  I did, however, find a good deal of enjoyment from a few of the new guns and vigors that were tossed into the game for us to have fun with.In conclusion, there isn't a whole lot more that I can say about this great game without dropping any spoilers.  I had a great time with it and played it through fairly quickly; I had beaten it in around twelve hours and that includes the time I spent searching around the area for additional content to find.  Though short, it is most definitely worth picking up, especially on a sale, and I highly recommend it to all who enjoyed the first two Bioshock games.  You will not be disappointed.			"

												BioShock Infinite has lofty ambitions. It tries to tackle some social and existential questions, provide entertaining gameplay, and wrap it all up in an emotionally moving package. Unfortunately, the game's polish belies its shallow depth.The gunplay brings absolutely nothing new to the table. While the addition of Sky-Lines was an interesting idea, the implementation reduces it mostly to a form of locomotion, rather than a primary form of combat. The game provides challenge through tough, not intelligent enemies, especially on later difficulties where several headshots may be necessary for a simple grunt.As for the story, it attempts to bring in elements of multiverse theory and explores ideas of choice and consequence for each of the characters in the game. However, in doing so, it contradicts itself several times over in its conclusion. I won't spoil that here; there are several videos you can watch to see the ending, along with interpretations if you wish.While the game paints a pretty picture and plays a few nice tunes, it fails to sufficiently answer many of the questions the early portions will give you. What one is left with, then, is contradictions and loose threads, and the game provides very little to alleviate these issues.			"

												""Are you a bad man?"" ""I am a bad man"" ""No you're not a bad man."" *Killing about twenty people* ""Are you a bad man?"" ""That guy is a bad man."" ""That guy is a bad man.""Bioshock Infinite wants to be a game about the nature of ""what-if"" and choice, framed in a story about ex-military officer Booker DeWitt sent to a mystical city in the clouds to rescue the mysterious waif Elizabeth, whose strange world-altering powers and sheltered childhood lends itself to an unfolding narrative of mutual cooperation; encouraging the player to care for an NPC as the two of you battle an unjust world out to get you.What it *is*, is a game about shooting dudes in the face. Lots of them, in hectic combat where you tend to get disoriented a lot and your low health and lack of carriable healing items causes you to run around from cover to cover like a headless chicken looking for that precious popcorn or abandoned soda to boost your all-too-fragile health. And when the red mist is over you are left with a pile of dead police officers and ordinary, well-intentioned people convinced you are a bad guy. Which, after having killed about twenty of them, you kind of sort of feel like. Racists they may be, but nothing in-game ever convinced me these people *needed* to die, and especially not in such crude, gore-tastic manners.Bioshock Infinite has a real issue with story-and-gameplay integration: The story and presentation leaves me ill-motivated to care about the main characters or anything they do. The gameplay, even if it had been better (it is certainly the weakest of the Bioshock games to date, sacrificing the last vestiges of System Shock on the altar of Call of Duty) creates a sharp divide between the themes of caring for someone and cooperating with them and killing endless hordes of very human cannon fodder with nary a thought; apparently only the hopes and dreams of the main character are worth diving into. Booker's dismissing of practically everything about this magical cloud wonderland he finds himself in, or his refusal to engage in any form of self-reflection about himself or his actions, certainly don't help matters.In fact, if I may be so bold I might say this game's core excellence is as a showpiece for the ideas promoted by Spec Ops: The Line. Do I feel like a hero yet? No, Bioshock Infinite. No, I do not.			"

												To quote someone else, Bioshock Infinite is wasted potential. The art deco, like Bioshock, is amazing. But, just like Bioshock again, any topics they bring up like racism for example has no commentary or explanation for it which is just bad. This is because it makes the setting and characters feel shallow, and because commentary and explanation can be interesting and informative in it's own right. The interactions between Booker and Elizabeth are interesting and will probably keep you engage enough to see the story to the end, but most of the game is bad shoot people gameplay. People will argue that the gameplay is bad because B:I got rid of basically all the RPG elements in Bioshock and also made the map design completely linear, but I disagree with this. These people don't remember that Bioshock already had shallow RPG mechanics and poor map design. The maps were design so that each path was a deadend that the player had to backtrack through once a mission was done... instead of making things loop around. This happens in B:I still, but the linearity negates most of it to optional missions. In B:I the vigors (plasmids) nearly all do the same thing (LMB to attack, RMB to make a trap) removing any strategy on which one to choose and removing any reason to mix them together (which atleast Bioshock had). You also can only hold 2 weapons, which ruins any chance of mixing up the gameplay. Like you have limited resources so you have to choose wisely on what weapons to upgrade so you'll probably only hold the same 2 weapons you've upgraded through the game because if you upgraded a 3rd weapon you won't be able to use it unless you randomly find it on the ground in the middle of the fight. Also since you don't have an inventory Elizabeth will randomly throw you items that you need during a fight which means there isn't really any strategy to refilling your health/magic in the middle of combat. Yes there are items that have small refilling benefits but that doesn't replace potions. You also can buy refill potions that are applied instantly and also random refill areas in combat arenas so just abuse these locations?But while they basically stripped down the gameplay to a bare FPS minimum, I think it was a step in the right direction for these developers. But they needed to go one step further, remove the gameplay entirely. Seriously, if this was a Themepark Simulator there would have been more time to flesh out the narrative, characters, and setting which the game greatly needed.I played the game on medium and I would not recommend playing it on higher difficulties because there are bullet sponge enemies and the only boss fight in the game is a bullet sponge that infinitely spawns enemies in which you fight the boss multiple times. I can't recommend this game because of the poor gameplay. I would recommend instead watching an LP (Let's Play or Long Play depending on your perspective c;) and buying some cool looking merchandise from Irrational Games instead https://store.irrationalgames.com/ "

												Bioshock is what I hope HL:Episode 3 would be like, except it has magic. Well, it doesn't call it magic, but it's the same idea. You're a private investigator who can't investigate for ♥♥♥♥ and gets pulled along by the undertow of fate and personalities in the universe. And that's just fine. You can switch between two kinetic weapons out of quite a few in the game ranging from pistols to RPGs. Some are better than others, and at one point the overvariety of similar weapons gets a bit overbearing. You also have the power of 'vigors' (spells). I find these similar to the weapons in that there are some stand-outs that I love using but many fall into the ""me-too"" category, particularly those that are only obtained late in the game. The very first vigor, possession, is by far the most useful and fun in general combat situations. There is also a grusome (if fun) melee attack that tends to become obsolete early due to the prevelence of guns unless you find the right gear to improve it when more difficult enemies appear.The most similar aspect to the HL2 series is your companion, Elizabeth, who assists you for much of the game. Unlike Alyx in the aformentioned series, Elizabeth doesn't engage in (and outshine you at) combat. Instead she will throw items to the player and effectively act as an engineer by pulling turrents and other defensive items out of her tear. Oh, tears... those are ""rips in dimensional time and space, revealing an alternate universe, which does not exist in the current world."" Don't worry, it makes sense in context. While Elizabeth's role could be otherwise filled, she is useful in combat and does not require guarding, a good choice by the devs. She's a compelling character that is the real star of the story, not the player controlled 'Booker."" And the story is quite good, though it's confusing at times and feels like it has a few aborted endings. Most of the time it's compelling, though, and makes you want to keep playing to find out what's going on through the time loops and dimensional warps that occur. The ending is a powerful gut punch, and not wishy-washy at all. There are some choices in the game, but none matter. Or perhaps they all matter, but none can alter the ending- further explanation would be spoilerish and get into the philosophy of determinism. There are plot holes, as with any story that involves some sort of time/space warp, but it's a good story with a puncuated ending that I needed to sit back and recover from afterwards.  Then I quickly restarted so I could get back to the more carefree portions of the game and also start to see the events from the hindsight of knowing how everything plays out. There's a lot of backstory lying unobtrusively around for those who want to look for it in a playthrough.Cons include an awful save system (this is 2015, why can't we figure this out?) and a couple of portions of the game that are too repetitive with no payoff.I'd say the game is a steal at sale prices under $30.I didn't play the first bioshock but I think it might be a good time to pick it up...

												After months of trying to stop myself from playing the game, I have finally beaten (after getting it from the sale) the game in 2 days. The result is that I am not one of of hte many fans of the game. Now, please ignore this review if you are a fan of bioshock, this may indeed anger you.Ok. First off, I want to say that yes this game has a great story. the story is simple but is a well done story that has some scifi elements that made me say, I want to see a bit more. The ending is really good as it deals with a twist that was kinda unseen in the game. The characters, though likeable, I would say a bit forgetable. The characters I think are more memorable is the twins, who are pretty funny because they have a bit of the ""out of this world"" characteristic that you can enjoy. Elizabeth, the main female protagonist does indeed seems to be a very like able character, though not exactly a outstanding character as people would make her to be. However, the biggest problem with the game is the game, which I'm sorry to say, is subpar. Originally, I though that the original game wasn't that interesting to me because the combat system was too easy and too dull for me to continue playing the game. In Bioshock Infinite, I felt that combat felt less impressive than the first game. Fewer weapons and limits to what weapons you can have often drives me nuts when playing games. It even worst that the guns feel less impactful and that combat also felt like a chore for me. The only weapons that felt good to use were the pistols, revolver and the Air Grabber.The special abilities that you collect are also a real dull choice as it's possible to only use 1 or 2 of them throughout the game without even using others more than one moment. The enemies in the game are also a real annoyance, Some enemies, such as the RPG and Handy man, felt really overpowered and that the hints given about the handy man's weak point do not even result in doing any damage. The Ghost level is what I considered the worst level becauuse of how poorly done it is and how even the objective pointer after the 2nd tear was extremely broken because they only lead you aroudn the whole map.Overall, despite the great story, I cannot say this game is considerd a 9s or even the 10s that it recieved. I wasnt' surprised to see this game get awards at all. Overall, this game isnt' not the game we need or want.			"

												Brilliant presentation, mediocre gameplay, badly written storyline.All style and no substance. The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying. One character has the special ability to literally tear holes in the plot. As the ""alternate universes"" angle comes in, any reason to care about the characters goes out the window - if they're all alternate versions, with alternate realities, why care about any of them? Why is one reality/timeline objectively better, or more valid, than any other? On top of that, the gameplay is frankly boring. It does absolutely nothing to advance the shooter genre - on the contrary it's bland and derivative. It is VERY pretty though, I'll give it that.------SPOILERS BELOW------When I say ""The story consists of plot twists for no reason other than to have plot twists, regardless of the mess it makes of the narrative, or what messages it ends up conveying"" I'm referring to the Vox Populi turning on you.The game starts out with the premise that you're fighting against some really awful people, really vile racists and bigots. By introducing the plot twist that you must now fight the Vox Pop, though the developers almost certainly did not intend it, what their game is now saying is ""You know who the REAL evil people are? They're not really the oppressors, they're the downtrodden minorities!"" It's an absurd position to take, and it's an absurd situation to be in. There is no justification for having to fight the people you've been fighting to save, other than it being a hackneyed ""shocking"" plot twist just for the sake of having a plot twist.You can tell that at least one person at 2K had an inkling that this might be the case because before you have to fight them the Vox Pop are mostly black folks, but you only ever fight Irish folks. You can tell because it would make the offensive absurdity of the situation starkly obvious if the second half of the game was all about massacring black people!""♥♥♥♥ minorities, up with Whitey"" obviously wasn't what 2K had in mind when they set out to make this game. But because whoever wrote the plot didn't stop and think that is what their creation says.Then there's simple, silly things it does to the plot. We jump through a portal into an alternate universe after failing to save the weapons dealer. Ok, so how does it help anything at all to defeat Comstock in this new universe? We've still left behind a universe where he wins. Why is this new universe objectively any different?Why does Booker ultimately drowning himself change anything at all? He's just ONE iteration of Booker; why does the death of that universe's Booker have any impact on any others?			"

												There's a cool storyline but it gives itself away far too soon.  And the game is very pretty but you are on rails most of the time so the levels often feel plastic and static (like a Doom level but with modern smoke and flare effects).  So, you are left with obviously demarked shooting areas and then a cutscene --  rinse, repeat.  The shooting is frenetic but not very strategic.   You can swap out your abilities at any time which sounds like fun but it quickly becomes apparent that the differing abilities often amount to the exact same thing.  It is far too easy to hide and shoot thru every dang level.  As a point of reference and as shooters go?   I would still play the first Far Cry over this game.      In that old game, fighting was strategic and varied and the large levels offered tactical choices.    Bottomline -- ""Infinite"" is sadly a C+ game with an A- story.			"

												Despite this game receiving a majority of popular feedback, I find it falls very short as a game. I do however feel that it is a fantastic piece of art. The environments are gorgeous, and exploring Colombia were rather enjoyable. Also the story was well told and quite moving despite some gaps in continuity. However that's the extent of its positive qualities.As game it fails to be challenging, even on Hard mode the combat is incredibly trivial. Elizabeth can keep you feed with an infinite supply of ammo, health, and salts, which you don't even need because you can just kill everything with the skyhook. Aside from the combat the game was incredibly linear, with very few secrets, and of those that did exist none really provided any substantial benefit because the combat was so easy to begin with.And again back to the problems with it being so linear, I can't help but compare it to the first Bioshock, which was also linear, however at least had multiple endings. With Bioshock: Infinite there is one ending, and honestly it's not that good. For a game that has a theme of infinite worlds with infinite possibilities you have only one ending? Really?To sum it all up it's just not a good game; like I said the story was pretty good, but the combat is poor, and the player cannot change the outcome of the ending. In terms of gameplay it's more like Myst or Riven than a shooter. It's just a beautiful enviornment to explore. However, unlike Myst or Riven, Bioshock: Infinate is devoid of any choice or challenge. Overall I'd have to say that you would probably be better off just watching all the cutscenes on youtube, because it would make a better movie than a game.			"

												A remarkable story that puts the Bioshock franchise in a place where anything can happen next and everything from the series were placed together.Deep and engaging characters, astonishing visuals and a truly rich backstory fulfilled with a mixture of history and fantasy, covering aspects of our society like the struggle of social classes or religion and state exploit, make one of the best games of all time.Bugs at the beginning, some boring mechanics, unjustified excessive violence, bad design/budget decisions, the well known millions of chain quests covering the same places over and over, and mostly the unbelievable absence of a decent save system almost ruin the game or make it average, but the good points are just awesome and hold Bioshock Infinite like an awesome, over the top game.It's a good mix of action and story - entertainment and art excellence.(some technical mess, but it's all right)____________________________________________PS For those who needs the subtitle help in a foreign language:You may get lost at the end of the story, because it's deep and explained too fast.

												So beautiful, so incredibly flawed everywhere else.I really enjoy the visuals and asthetics of the game but it tries too hard to be insightful. Its a discussion about history and politics written by someone who took a 100 level college class and likes to argue at parties. It's an -interesting- world but none of it makes any sense no matter how you try to suspend your disbelief.It's not an awful game, the production is AAA quality as one would expect. It's just shallow and soulless beyond its beautiful facade. I keep asking myself, ""Why are these people shooting at me?"" and I literally never have an asnwer. Furthermore the system to direct you tothe nect objective will literally run you in a never ending circle and provide you aboslutely no direction as to how to proceed in the game.Why are these people shooting at me? Where am I supposed to go? Why is plot consistancy so hard? Why can't anyone make a twist ending in a videogame that actually makes any sense without ignoring absolutely everything that happened in the entire game?			"

												This is the most overrated game that I know of. You walk around, from what is basically arena to arena, shooting bullet spongey enemies. The game only allows you to carry two guns at once, meaning combat is very boring, and spend most of your looking around for ammo. The vigors are very boring, mostly just push/pull enemies, or attack/ set mines. The story is passable, but it really bashes you over the head with 'racism is bad', and is made convoluted with to much fighting in an effort to try and make the game longer. The graphics are quite nice, and it's a good pc port, but this does not make up for the absolutly terrible combat.			"

Good graphic, but the gameplay was far to easy and the story felt a bit weak. This one however had stunning graphics, The gameplay was very well done and so much fun.

												tl;dr: EXTREMELY overrated game, if you want a Bioshock experience, look back to the first or second installments, this one is not worth your time or money. PLEASE NOTE: This is for the base game, I do not own, and will not purchase any DLC for this mess of a ""Bioshock"" game.I had pre-ordered this at the very last second because I wanted to see some critic reviews first... there were at least a dozen reviewers giving this game glowing - if not perfect - reviews, and I've gotta say I've never felt more deceived at how off they were or more confused as to what they actually played.First things first, this is NOT a Bioshock game, it may try to call itself one, but it is closer to Call of Duty or whatever other ""modern"" shooter you associate such gameplay mechanics as: regenerating health, 2 weapon carry, overuse of ""press 'x' to do 'y'"" prompts, and other similar elements with.But let's not get ahead of ourselves, what about the non-combat parts you might ask?The world just doesn't seem to recognize that you are there unless there is a scripted event or if you have enemies trying to kill you. NPCs are stuck on an animation loop with a thousand mile stare and provide zero interactivity. There is some eye candy in the visuals department no doubt, but the rest feels like you are window shopping. There's barely even any physics in the game - good luck trying to do something so mundane as knock over a box or have some kind of actual feedback when trying to interact with the world. In fact, for a game released in 2013, there are a lot of things that make you feel like the game is from early 3D FPS days: no facial animations on almost all of the character models, no actual weapon recoil (burst fire increases spread where applicable, that's it), weaponry that differs only with regard to how fast they fire, ultra-linear gameplay when trying to appear open-world, etc.That is about as deep as the ""show"" part of the game goes unfortunately, and the ""tell"" isn't much better.Elizabeth... where oh where to begin on this poorly conceived joke of a 'character'. Let's see, she's supposedly important to the plot, yet completely invisible to, and ignored by the world, friendly or hostile. She doesn't take damage from anything, so she's not any kind of escort. Despite throwing things to you throughout the game she ""finds"" (magically spawns), she's never actually seen picking up anything. In fact, the most you'll ever see her ""do"" is perhaps point at an item, but only when out of combat... and having lingered in an area for a while. And perhaps the worst part is that she is your 'key' to locked doors... you have to wait for her to come over and break locks before you can proceed forward in many areas. It doesn't help matters that she is a walking plot hole device either (as if the story needed any more of those), able to open... well, holes (or tears as the game calls it) to other locales and realities that they try to lead you to believe are parallel... but only when they decide that it makes sense in what they try to pass off as the story.The main ""bad guy"" of the story barely even has any time in the actual game. There's a few scripted minutes where Comstock points out what you are up to plotwise, then he disappears for over half the game, shows up again for a few minutes, then disappears till the end of the game where he is killed in a cutscene. About the only good thing I can say about the 'tell' is that the voice work is well done, but that's really about it.Choices in the game amount to absolutely nothing as well. There is no morality system, but rather an extremely half-♥♥♥♥♥ ""Do not steal or we will try to kill you"" in a couple odd sections which makes no difference one way or the other. Moments where you are stopped and forced to pick something seemingly relevant to the plot are just as pointless due to the fact that not only do they not affect anything afterward, but even if they did, the way the game ends would make it a non-factor anyway.Surely the combat makes up for these many downfalls though right? Not. In. The. Slightest.This is another case of a sequel being dumbed down for no discernible reason. There are a LOT of Call of Duty-esque (or modern military as some call them anymore) things in the combat - regenerating shield (not health thankfully), 2 weapon max carry, standard generic weaponry, no special ammo types, and combat that only sometimes tries to give the illusion of options, but ultimately fails because of not only how arbitrary these choices are, but also because the simplest approach 99 times out of 100 is the most effective one (thanks in no small part to the lowest common denominator shooter mechanics they for some reason decided were needed here). Odds are Elizabeth will give you way more than is needed to make any engagement fairly underwhelming as it is anyway. As soon as you drop below a certain % on your health, salts (EVE), or ammo, she'll magically ""find"" some more for you to use, and this happens EVERY battle, no matter if there actually was something there or not (because scavenging would actually mean she has to do something). This coding is so blatant that it is surprising that they didn't just stick a cooldown timer on the HUD somewhere. What's worse, this is the ONLY thing she 'contributes' (term used VERY loosely) to battles, as the rest of the time she is cowering (usually out in the open), despite having god mode and being completely ignored by enemies, or waiting for you to press a button to yell at her to pull something into the battlefield. She literally does nothing on her own which makes the endless praise all the more baffling that people laud upon her for being a good character when you have MUCH better examples from other games, such as Half-life 2's Alyx, Barney, and even the rebel allies, which can put up a good fight and even hold their own in the many situations you are presented with, that came out well over a decade ago! As it stands, Elizabeth has no presence in, or out of combat, she is just 'there' throughout the majority of the game, leaving you to wonder why they even bothered putting such a big focus on her in the design process.Do you recall the ad where she was about to be hanged by an angry mob and your character swoops in to save her? Yeah that doesn't actually happen in-game... ever... in any shape or form.  It really should've, at least the damsel-in-distress bit it would invoke would justify her existence somewhat.One of the very few similarities to Bioshock there actually are come in the form of plasmids... err... sorry I mean ""Vigors"". Unlike Bioshock though, these are much less varied than the preceding games, much less used by enemies (there's maybe half a dozen that actually use what you use out of the thousand or so enemies you'll fight), and they can be severely game breaking in a great many of the fights. Difficulty is another major issue for those of you who like a challenge. One of the biggest factors for me at least, this game just doesn't feel particularly difficult, like at all. There are a couple exchanges which can get heated here and there, but ultimately it is because you are dealing with an army of enemies rather than having a character that feels mortal, which is only further underlined when you ""die"", since you respawn back into the fight moments later. And no, this cannot be disabled unlike in Bioshock 1 & 2.But otherwise, there you have it, what little that remains of Bioshock returns here in a heavily watered down form, with the rest of the gameplay being pulled from lowest common denominator shooters like Call of Duty and the like to make this mash-up of a game that I really regret purchasing. The game tries to be so much at once, much of which it never was in the first place, and fails in every regard.I don't know what the hell other reviewers were playing, but if you have had the fortune to avoid this clunker, continue to do so.

												I'm a Bioshock fan and I've been looking forward to play this... I finally got my hands on it but just didn't want to believe what I've seen...Two weapon limit and combat mechanics just feel wrong. Enemies are way too precise and feel non-human. Combat feels rushed and hectic. Enemy dialogs are repeatative and annoying. Resources are too tight which makes the scavenge around most of the time instead of focusing on the atmosphere. Elizabeth does help you with ammunition however it does become annoying when she interrupts the combat to throw coins and salts and ammo at you...graphics are good... however if you want to explore Columbia more you'll have invisible boundaries blocking you.So far [after 9 hours] story is also really predictable. Also the NPCs around you almost don't respond to you at all. They all look and act like bunch of robots...To sum up after the first two Bioshock games this game is a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. I just don't understand how this game attracts more attention and better reviews than first two. Save your money for some other game...EDIT:I've just played it through, I must admit that the story did get better than at the beginning (very good ending), however I still find the first two games of the franchise better. Weapons and plasmids were much more fun to use. Combat felt right and fair. And the storytelling was better than in Bioshock Infinite. Instead of a weak start and a good end they were consistently good. It's sad to see one of my favourite games becoming something so dull...			"

												Bioshock Infinite started out a great and incredibly beautiful, but after many hours it started dragging out for far too long. Combat turned from fun to an empty, churny and uninspired chore between story nibblets. It felt like the team lost track of ""fun"" 70% or so into the game. As such, the promise the game made with its fantastic first hours turned out to be a huge lie towards the end. The many many faults with the nimble-as-a-refridgerator controls were at first totally forgivable, but when everything but the visuals crumbled and came tumbling down around it, the painful dance with those blaring faults were pretty much all that was left. The payoff the game convinced me it could deliver was just reduced to a dirty rag tossed to the side.Playing on hard can be a real challenge towards the end, but I find that most of my deaths through the game came from getting stuck in basic geometry, the character not running, or simply not jumping to the various hook-spots when he was supposed to. Bioshock Infinite is also a perfect reminder of why enemies using hit-scan weapons in shooters just aren't fun.I will try to beat it as I'm most probably just one small hill from the end, just to get it over with, and certainly not because I find it entertaining anymore. I'm actually even rather uninterested by the story at this point, as all the characters decided to just muddle up their believability with just stupid and inconsistent behavior.It honestly feels like the original team of the game were not, at all, the same people who made the latter hours of it. Weird. Disappointing.I really wanted to recommend this. I was looking forward to finishing it so I could look up the DLC. I had it in my list of favorites. But I can't recommend it anymore. And I will certainly not touch the DLC. "

												After letting this game stew for a while, I find my opinion has worsened from even my lackluster feelings after beating the game. Before you begin in with cries of you don't get it or you can't compare it to bioshock, I will bisect those two arguments right here and now. First off, yes, I may have missed bits of the subtext but I understood what was going on and it was a bit of a mess. Being pretentious does not mean being misunderstood, it means pretending to be making points and being smarter than you are, and this game is not nearly as intelligent or interwoven as it would like you to think it is. Secondly, yes I can compare it to bioshock because its called bioshock infinite, has psuedo-plasmids and similar combat and even blanketly steals sound assets from the first. The very name invited the comparison and therefore invites criticism regarding that. Now with that out of the  way, no I would not reccomend this game at full price, though at a sale price I can reccomend it for a playthrough at least. The game squanders its potential by not focusing on the more interesting bits, like talking to citizens and exploring the town with dull combat, that is infinitely more boring than Bioshock. Theres no real sense of progression, the fights are just long and drawn out and the abilities are mostly uninterestinhg or just copies of the original games plasmids. And speaking on that, the vigors are just reskinnned plasmids, just without any of the lore, intrigue or even real relation to the universe that Bioshock and even a game that I consider in some ways to be better, Bioshock 2 had. Theres no interwoven lore, the world is just there, the physics ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t pretentious and the main villian and city are uninteresting. I don't like how no one took this game to task for its issues, because maybe I am being pretty critical but the game is not as perfect as advertised. It got talked up and talked up and talked up, and even when I tempered exprectations I was left dissapointed. Its infinitely weaker than Bioshock, lorewise and world building wise and I just don't like it. I also really don't like how a game that did everything better than this one was overshadowed by this one because it was so hyped and deep and ♥♥♥♥. Its not that deep, and when you have a line like ""The city doesn't float cause of the ballons, it floats cause physics!!!"" you know its trying to be that game without understanding that by trying and not doing it falls flat. Worth a playthrough, but bewared the hype, as I personally felt it was far weaker than advertised. Go play  the much better Bioshock, or even Bioshock 2, or hell, go play Spec ops if you want to play a truly great game, and if you want to see what this game could've been, go play the game it helped push away from the perhiphery, Metro Last light, because that game for all its flaws is much better than this one.

												I'm going to keep it short and simple. This game has no replay value. You play the great 8 hour campaign then have to buy DLC if you want to play something new. Not worth what they're asking for. This game should be $20 maybe. Closer to $15 sounds better.			"

												I had tried to put this game behind me. However, with the release of the new DLC, I had to give it another spin to get some monies worth back out of it.I like many others fell to the hype and made the incresingly dangerous decision to pre-order a season pass.While it may look good, it contains the blandest gameplay of the series.While it approches ""strong"" topics, it does nothing with them, and contains gaping plot loopholes.This is not for the ""smart"" gamer. This is pretentious causualised ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I have yet to finish the first part of the DLC, but it really hasn't struck me as any different.Even in the steam sale this isn't worth your money.			"

												Game started out fantastic. Beautiful design, engaging themes, and entertaining situations. Fast forward to around the sixth hour of gameplay: redundant fights, annoying combat, unsatisfying powers, and (if playing on the highest difficulty) maddeningly frustrating fights with the Handyman. Seriously, if you disagree with me, try to beat the Handyman in one of the last fights on the hardest difficulty. There is nothing gratifying with the combat structure in this game.Most reviews that I see gush over the game's story. Look, I get it: the idea of alternate universes, travel between them, and consequences of choices that can alter future choices is intriguing. Unfortunately, getting to these themes involved introducing multiple, underdeveloped characters that just seemed like more and more names being thrown at you. The games storyline with the revolution and the overall ""alternate universes"" theme conflicted and annoyed me for the latter part of the game. Fighting animated patriot machines was... dumb. It seemed like the developers felt they could get away with putting any stupid scenario in the game just because in one of the infinite universes it was possible.I would recommend many other games over Bioshock Infinite. I strongly feel that its success is a product of strong advertising. Not GOTY in terms of atmosphere, story, and combat mechanics.			"

												This game is literally driving me crazy! I can't stop thinking about it. Somebody might say that an average man thinks about sex every 7 second. Well I think about this game every damn seven seconds! It's just that GOOD! Only if I could remove my memory to experience it all over again... I've been seriously depressed lately because of this.I think I made it very clear that this game is worth playing. I loved every second of it and it did make me very confused sometimes, but I did figure it all out eventually. This game has the best story in a videogame I have ever seen, and the athmosphere of Columbia is just perfect. Characters are near perfection, especially Elizabeth. The gameplay is... good. It's not bad, not at all, but usually I just want to quickly shoot my way trough enemies just to start scavenging around and progressing into the story. Just as I said, the story is somewhat confusing to wrap around your head, but you'll figure it out. The dlc:s are also worth playing. I could almost say that I enjoyed burial at sea even more than the main game. I won't spoil anything, but the ending made me cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. OVERALL THIS GAME IS WORTH EVERY CENT AND IF YOU ARE GOING TO BUY THIS DO GET THE SEASON PASS AND PLAY TROUGH BIOSHOCK 1 BEFORE BURIAL AT SEA JUST TO GET THE FULL EXPERIENCE!			"

												This game felt like one of those ""great"" films everyone says is amazing but while experiencing it I atleast didn't really feel it. The visuals are very nice, the voice acting top notch and the atmosphere is interesting, which is normally enough for me, but for whatever reason, it wasn't enough. I found the combat/gameplay tedious, with a few moments of fun, and the story elements are so convoluted it is difficult to admire as a whole, but yes there are some very nice ""moments."" Like those great films I may look back on it and see its brilliance but with the over reliance on long combat sequences and optional side information I doubt I will find the time. Would perhaps be better suited as a film, as the story is so linear and the gameplay not that interesting.			"

												I can't recommend this game -Don't get me wrong, the art style and story are great, the gameplay is challenging and the game is fun, overall.If you can play it for more than 5 minutes at a time.  I wish I'd done some research before buying, but Google search results and Steam's support forum don't lie - there's a world of hurt awaiting a lot of random people that try to play this game, primarily in the form of direct to desktop crashes after random periods of time in-game.I'm no newb to troubleshooting hardware, drivers and software issues, but nothing has worked for me, although your mileage may vary.  2K Games is basically ignoring anyone that reports this issue, unfortunately.  It's really a shame, because the game makes me want to finish it, but I can't stand replaying the same parts over and over, hoping to hit a save checkpoint before the next crash.  So, long story short, it's buggy and basically unplayable for me.  It might work just fine for you, but if I'd known so many people were having issues with it, I'd have spent my money elsewhere.

												If you have played the last two Bioshocks this game is a trash! From the horrifing and atmospheric Rapture we are going on a flying city. Come on! Rapture for its time of period is a dream but this? A flying city in an epoch with steam machines? What a let down!The Plasmids have became Vigors, in that epoch era DNA mutations? It's getting more silly... Vigors are worthless, I finished the game and I only use the crows! Guns... oh guns! Do you remember when you carried a whole arsenal and you combined them with the plasmids? Well... forget it! You carry only 2 weapons. The Hack has gone! The Selling Machines for me were worthless too.In the half of the game I was saying to myself: keep playing, just finish the game, you paid it, just finish it! Every mission I had, I was rushing to finish it because I didn't wanted to play this game anymore!The end was ♥♥♥♥... and the whole storyline!Generally, this game is a big letdown! Don't buy it if you have play the two other games, you will ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of!			"

												Being a huge fan of BioShock 1 and 2, I was excited about this game coming out. For months I avoided everything the /r/gaming ♥♥♥♥♥ had to say about it, avoided spoilers, avoided gameplay videos. Anything to just not spoil what I assumed would be the story behind the awesomeness that was the first two games.I was wrong. So very wrong. This game is terrible. It's a bigger piece of ♥♥♥♥ than Assassin's Creed 3. The entire game is comprised of the dev team sucking each other's ♥♥♥♥♥ for 6-12 hours while moaning ""mmmmm fatalism nnnngggggggg"" over and over. The combat is garbage - you can overpower everything easily without having to worry about things like needing to find all the weapons. The plasmids are pointless. Other than the game forcing you to use some of them to advance the storyline, you can just pick the one you like best and annihilate everything. Or you know, abuse the Tears to just cheese turrets and the like. They respawn, so if yours dies, just hop up on the sky rail and wait it out, then re-Tear them. Or do like I do in all games - walk the ♥♥♥♥ up to mobs, beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them melee style, and laugh as you plunder the soggy remains of their bodies for cash and food. Let's talk about food for a minute. It's everywhere in this city. People just carry tons of it in their pockets. One guy had a pineapple in his pocket. Seriously. A pineapple. Could you tell from looking at him that he was sporting such an epic bulge? No. And it's not like he had some unique brand of pants that enabled him to stuff a whole pineapple in there - they were the same pants everyone else had. Good news for guys hung like a moose, and good news for guys who don't believe in carrying grocery bags.The gameworld is pretty, as long as you don't look at things like the very flat grass and plant life. There's a lot of detail to things - cigarette butts around the trash bins, books with fine detail, and some very questionable artwork, which brings me to my next point.The entire game is a very long and drawn out story about how the white man is superior, and you should persecute non-whites, as well as the Jews. And why would you do this? Because you're super religious and that's what your prophet wants of you. A fair amount of blatant and subtle racism takes place, and the story expects you to just roll with it. The whole thing was more of a cheap addition of ""lolz look racism mmmm fatalism"" instead of making people look at moral or ethical decisions.Early on the game they even present that to you - you make the moral and ethical choice of choosing Elizabeth's broach - a  free bird or a cage. I chose cage, because ♥♥♥♥ that constipated ♥♥♥♥♥. As I played along with someone who chose the bird, I noticed that the game is identical. No matter which path you chose, it ends at the same conclusion and they wrap it up with ""well that's just how it is, everything is decided for you"" and circle jerk it a bit harder. Normally I would add a spoiler warning, but I'm not in this case, because I want to prevent other people from wasting their time and money on this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Elizabeth is your daughter, and you end up dead. Oh and it was also multiple realities, so she's not dead, and you're not dead. It then implies that BioShock 1 and 2 are also alternate realities. At this point I was so annoyed by the level of terrible going on that I let the credits roll in case it was a joke. When I realized it wasn't a joke, I uninstalled the game. Since then I have reinstalled it to play the Season Pass that was thankfully $5 during the Steam sale, thinking it would finally give me the great content I wanted. (I am told that the multiplayer for BioShock 2 is actually the game I was expecting, so we'll see)Nope. You start out exactly how I pictured the game - in Rapture, it's gritty, gorgeous, and how the damn thing should have been. Then Elizabeth leads you on a 45 minute circle jerk about fatalism and alternate realities. You meet the Little Sisters as they first form, which is cool, and then you're trying to rescue one. You fight a Big Daddy, which is a joke - just cheese the Tears and you win. Then you see the rest of your flashbacks, which are the other realities, and then Elizabeth kills you with the help of a Big Daddy because you're an evil man in another reality. In summary: the people who made this game took a massive religious ♥♥♥♥, then wiped their collective asses with the BioShock name and called it a game. Don't buy it. Just don't. Take the money and stuff it in a stripper's thong. Or buy something else, like Super Meat Boy. Or Recettear. Or $30 worth of chicken nuggets. All of these things are far more valuable than this ♥♥♥♥-show. "

												I bought this when it came out for 360 because I was a huge BioShock fan. Mistake.This game is NOT bad, it is a downright overhyped dissapointment. It looks great and works generally fine, there is no amazing soundtrack (not that big a deal), but where it falls short is the content.GAMEPLAY: Gameplay is horribly repetitive. The false sense of open space is actually more confining than the actual confined space found in the first two games. Gameplay consists of pathetic ""vigors"" that have no taste and all have trap versions. The guns are underpowered generally, don't seem cool, and the removal of the weapon wheel is a bust as ammo is no longer conserved. The sky-hook is insanely broken. What could have been the selling point of the game (and kinda was) was boring, repetitive, and screwed up your objective beacon. The Elizabeth tears were alright but anoyying and the constant backtracking was a strain.ENVIRONMENT: The environment is dirt. At first, the environment is cool; walking around a steampunk 1900s racist city and all, seeing the magical tech at work. As soon as the tears start happening and you start running around, you realize how boring it all is. The game doesn't feel like a fight for survival and freedom on a floating city - it feels like MMO quests in first-person on a bunch of blimps. The best level when a ""scare""-factor is actually involved comes too few and too late.STORY: The story is linear and bland. The main story is fairly guessable and not fleshed out. Voxophones, which are like the audiorecorders of old Bioshock, offer little and are too hard to get too. The DLC storylines are too blatant in their fit to the paradoxy of Infinite, getting those weak fools who enjoy this game to drool over the worst dialogue ever.CONCLUSION: A total buchery of one of the best games I've ever played. Removes all the good elements of bioshock 1 & 2, has a ridiculous story, awful environment, and the vigors (the point of bioshock) are extremely underplayed and have no story implementation. What was once a survival horror game is now the posterchild of absurd MetaCritic scores.A good game, not what it should have been. Kind of like a Halo 4 but even more dissapointing. 75/100			"

So many broken livesThis game has the most beatiful graphics, outstanding detailed universe along with most terrifying and disgusting story.Game plot defines 'shock' part of its name - the shocking story of human vices, multiplied by infinity.I wish game was more 'open world', so I could discover more of secret corners and got deeper into people of Columbia lives.I wish it has more options to chose from at every moment, so I don't always have to slaughter inhabitants and cause that many deaths indirectly.But all that would make playthrough even longer and mentally staying in Columbia was not pleasant sojourn the deeper I got into its history.Techically, game is a masterpiece - graphics, level design, enemies AI, user interface - every part of gameplay is amazingly good. As for story, it is something everyone should try to go through and see how long could it take to fix single hasty careless action (won't you agree it is not typical for games?). So, yeah, game is matchless.More kills per minute and more screnshots made than I could predict.PS: even though I was trying to thoroughly learn storyline during walkthrough, I was either too dumb or inattentive to understand the story and had to read wiki to make things clear. So, bear in mind the story is bigger than the main game and maybe even bigger than that DLCs hold.			"

												Most people seem to praise this game for it's story. However, the story itself is unfocused, doesn't push any limits, and uses the timeframe poorly. The parts about quantum physics also make little sense and seem to written by somebody who has no understanding of the science behind it.Gameplay is abysmal. There's no exploration like there was in Bioshock 1. The gunplay is cut and pasted straight from the Call of Duty games, two weapon limit and all. Most the vigors work as stuns so you'll probably only be using one.The only positives I can say it the sound effects are nice, the graphics are pretty at times, and the earlier parts have a cool atmosphere. This game is really only worth 5 bucks though.			"

												Bioshock Infinite, also known as Run Forward While Shooting, Ayn Rand edition.Most game play actually did not consist of Running Forward While Shooting, but rather it was more boring as I stood perfectly still lining up incredibly boring headshots on AI that would generally stand pefectly still.Now, I am not a 'hardcore' game player by any respect. I enjoy my shooters arena like and my plots sufficient in narrative capacities. I don't want to devote hours to learning Meta outside of a game. But when a game has AI that cannot even be arsed to move and shoot competently, I can't even handle how completely bored I am.Definitely an excellent example of why not to buy games from EA.			"

												Bioshock is classed by me as the best FPS game of all time. People say it's like Systemshock and in that case i say i have to buy Systemshock!The first Bioshock was such a good game that i got it through means that i would rather not discuss at first. Played all the way through. Bought it for the Xbox and seriously think if i should buy if on steam just to have it on my computer! I love it THAT much.Bioshock 2 got a lot of flak but i think it still is a good game. It's not as good as the first one but it's a worthy successor to a great game IMO.Now we got Infinite. I saw the trailers and got hyped out of my mind! It's Bioshock but it's in the sky and in a different time? COOL! Maybe we'll get something else, something new something that is just as good with a new twist!Well, what we go was a confusing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with ♥♥♥♥ gameplay! yay?At first i didnt know what to think. The game wasnt horrible. But the more i think about it the more i realised that Bioshock Infinite is just the devs trying to hard to ♥♥♥♥ with your mind.""OOOOOH. Look multiverse theory! Are you confused yet?"" No. Im not confused since i realise that you are seriously just trying to mess with me.Thats the problem with a multiverse theory it gets hard to follow and messy in a heartbeat and they did it so poorly that i wanna smash my head against a beltsander in frustration! The settings go from one to another without really setting the mood and 90% of the time i dont really care since im going on to next version of Columbia in a few minutes.Thats the main problem for me. It doesnt matter if i kill characters in this universe since it  has no impact and in another universe and im supposed to care about said characters! Sometimes i see them die and they dissapear since we never hear from them again and leaves me wondering if they are alive in this universe but maybe they didnt even exist in this universe. So dont bother about them.The gameplay is downplayed so much it's stupid! In the first Bioshock you had the protagonist pockets. You ran around with half an army in your pockets and guided what weapons you should use with ammo! In this they went with the Duke Nukem Forever approch! 2 weapons no ammo! In Bioshock they put care and thought into the design of the weapons. Rapture had a weapons ban so people smuggled in weapons or made their own. You could see that with the grenadelauncher made of soupcans and the crossbow made from a pianowire and a bunch or spareparts! The shotgun looks like something you find over a fireplace and gets cooler as it gets upgraded. In Infinite the weapons act the same. They are boring and the upgrades offer no visual representation to show that you'upgraded them. In Bioshock you find the ""power to the people"" stations. Again made from junk that you find in Rapture. Very cool concept. The resistance fighters made their own weapons and fought Andrew Ryan and theres layers upon layers of cool backstory that you find out regarding Frank Fontaine, Andrew Ryan , Suchong and Tennenbaum all over the place. Backstory sprinkled with codes to safes and tips about stashes of loot everywhere. COOL ♥♥♥♥. But in Infinite even the audiologs are boring! No backstory or anything just rants about how people were stupid and racist back in the days! Woopie! All to preserve the twist at the end and they couldnt even do that right!Booker is combstock! BOOM! just saved you 20 hours of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t! you can thank me later. Seriously the only half decent thing they managed to put in this crap is Elisabeth. I like her but she's just a tool to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!She's one of the main reasons this game falls short! She's the one opening the rifts into other worlds and she's the carrot at the end of the stick. She's also the most aggrevating person to chase after in video game history. Theres a scene where Booker tries to talk some sense into her after he's clearly shown that he's taking her to a place she clearly does not want to go (New York and i dont blame her) She wants to go to Paris (Wrong move there too sweetheart!) and she slows him down with everything from parades to balloons! (CURSE THOSE DASTARDLY HELIUMBALLS!).I didnt have to pay for bioshock Infinite (Thankfully) But i did have to trade away my timestopper. If i had to choose Timestopper or Infinite i'd be paying a whole lot more Faceless void!			"

												Very few games move me enough to have me consider a second play through. BioShock Infinite is one of those games. From the story to the combat, I have enjoyed every last second of the Columbia experience. Please don't compare this to previous games with similar titles... and as such I will not compare them in this recommendation. What I will do is explain what I love about Infinite, and if it jives with what you also love in games, then you will enjoy this experience as well.For one, without any spoilers, the story is tremendous. Not Dickens or Shakespeare, but for Sci-Fi fans who enjoy stories that try to stretch the imagination, this definitely satisfies. Columbia itself is nicely fleshed-out with a lot of details. It's nice to see a city that is seemingly pleasant until you see the underlying fanaticism and bigotry. It is almost uncomfortable and off-putting, but makes the experience that much more real.Besides story and setting, the remaining piece would be combat, of which I found quite satisfying. If you're not a fan of bullet-spongy baddies you've definitely come to the wrong place. I played through on Hard the first time, and the game definitely gave me a challenge. With only two weapons to swap between and a limited amount of Salt for Vigors (read Plasmids), I had to be very careful. It was easy to get myself killed by running out into the open; movement and cover is key. Most of the weapons are satisfying although at first I was a bit confused by the red and blue ammo (each faction has similar weapons with their own sets of ammo); I think subsequent play-throughs I will focus on upgrading a handful of specific ones instead of spreading myself so thin. As far as Vigors are concerned, I have to admit I enjoyed some more than others. While many where useful, when I eventually got ""Return to Sender"" and ""Bucking Bronco"", I was in love. There is a good variety of the usual suspects such as fire and electricity, and some interesting combos you can get (and there is an achievement for finding them all if you're into that sort of thing) by say lighting someone on fire and then charging them to create a bunch of fire-bombs that spread throughout the area. Character building in Infinite is mostly about what weapons you upgrade, what Vigors you buy and upgrade, but also is a little bit about clothing. There are four pieces of clothing Booker can wear, each with its own passive bonus. A lot of the best clothing is found through exploration, so make sure you poke around the levels if you want to find something good. Over time you will find a set of gear that will complement your play style which is especially satisfying.For me, this is a game that will stay on my hard drive for a long while. I'm not much for clutter, so usually uninstall games after completion. While not as consistently replayable as Borderlands, I certainly expect to go through this story again as well as the two Burial at Sea DLC packs. If what I've written piques your interest, then go ahead and buy this game. Still unsure? It's old enough that you can find it somewhere online at a discount, so you really don't have much to lose. It's time for you to go visit Columbia today!			"

												A year later I can't say I ever really enjoyed this that much.  The art work and other aethestic talent poured into this game deserve props but the actual game underneath is a fairly linear, simple shooter.  Put bluntly,  on the PC it's a sprinkle-covered, hollowed-out dog turd but console-wise it's an enjoyable yet just slightly memorable experience that has a pretty face.			"

												This is the first game that I've ever played that was bad enough to bother writing a negative review for. The uninspired combat system (and controls that leave no middle ground between ""not turning"" and ""spinning in circles"", even with an adjustable sensitivity mouse) doesn't hold up to those of the previous games, this game's plasmid equivalents (""vigors"") provide uninteresting powers, and without them being a central plot point, or even having any obvious significance in the story, it seems that they exist solely so that Infinite could be called a Bioshock game.The story itself is so ridiculous that, if you read it in a book, you'd think it was a satire (and Poe's law be damned, no one could take it seriously). It follows the story of a floating city filled with a fanatical religion dedicated to the (literal) worship of America's founding fathers and also racism, possibly best exemplified by a bar where the the most prominent feature is a mural of a haloed John Wilkes Booth shooting Abraham Lincoln (complete with horns and red skin), visited not long after hearing a sermon about Washington crossing the Delaware (Incidentally, said mural was the point at which I closed the game and started looking up reveiws and ""let's plays"" to see if it got any better. Spoiler alert: It doesn't.). I surmise that the rationalization behind this schizophrenic mix of ideological parodies is this: the average person is not, in fact, violently opposed to either nationalism or religion, so to properly vilify your opponents (the general populace of Columbia) heavy handed (even anvilicious) racism was tacked on to remove moral ambiguity and guilt the other aforementioned ideologies by association, thereby justify shooting all the people who were literally just giving you free food and money.The writing was painful, too. The shift to a vocal protagonist was by no means a good one, since being reminded of what you should be thinking by your own character's voice makes for a shallow experience (""Augh! These heights are so scary!"" during a mediocre above-ground experience where falling to your death is, in fact, impossible), not to mention that every third voice clip was to the tune of ""huh?"" or  ""what's going on?"".I won't even get into the time-traveling multiverse garbage.It's really a shame, because I really enjoyed the previous 2 games in the series, but Infinite seems like a poor attempt to capitalize on the reputation of a popular franchise in spite of, essentially, being the worst possible political commentary on nothing at all.In the interest of fairness, I have to admit that the game looks really nice, but fancy graphics do not a good game make.

												Everyone I know, knows I hate this game with an absolutely searing passion.Heavy spoilers, obviously.Before it's release, I was pretty excited for this game, pre-ordered a physical copy, paid extra for release date delivery. Besides the factor of simple hype, the previews made the game appear promising, made it look like a genuine innovation.The game pretended to extend an offer of deep, layered gameplay, varied enemy types, upgradable powers, and multiple ways to navigate given situations. It made a pretense of suggesting that it would tell a fulfilling and engaging story, one that, like it's predecessors, was enveloped in stories about extremist ideologies and their effects.If you expected any of these things from this game, that would be a mistake.However, I'm here not only to argue that the game is pitifully mediocre when stood next to the other two games in the franchise; rather, I'm also going to argue that the game is just pitifully mediocre all things considered.Let's get the positives out of the way.The game is beautiful, the colorful saturation of Columbia is great. Additionally, there's some great, albeit wasted, potential for a good story in the themes the game plays around with about sin and rebirth.Now, to the bulk of it, why this game is horrifically overrated and not even anything above mediocre.On its concept, this is supposed to be a city of nativists, of Americans who want to limit admittance to 'some' and exclude the 'foreign hordes'. There's lots of insane worship of the founding fathers and a lot of racism. Totalitarian collectivism too. Solid foundation for a setting, you could tell a story with all these different issues right? Well, Infinite isn't doing that, it has no interest in doing that.None of these ideas or problems are explored with any nuance or even with any gravity, there's no bite to the racism and no force to the ideology -- it is nothing BUT a setting, the game isn't commenting on or even showing different perspectives about any of these ideas. Instead, we're served up half-baked 'dad rescues his daughter multiverse adventure'! Yay!I think, when you analyze the twists and turns of the story, there's plenty of absolutely absurd and ridiculous plotholes in all the universe hopping that Elizabeth and Booker participate in -- I've heard plenty of rationalization, it doesn't work, this isn't well thought out, it's not a masterpiece, stop.However, I don't think that it's bad because of those plotholes. I think, even leaving those aside or assuming they don't exist, it's just a pretty weak story that lacks for any sort of meaning. The problem isn't the plotholes, the problem is that the writers decided to forgo crafting an interesting world that is telling human stories to write this ridiculous multiverse tale that is essentially one giant wink at the player.BioShock and BioShock 2 tell stories with specific characters, they have antagonists, protagonists, conflicts and resolutions. BioShock Infinite on the other hand, just like Star Wars Episode VII, is essentially just a huge, obnoxious wink saying, 'Hey, remember BioShock?'This story is the BioShock of all the BioShocks! All those BioShocks were just crude reflections of this BioShock, this is the real one! -- is what the writers are trying to communicate to the player.It's as if Ken Levine, looking at the previous entries to the series, the stories they told, and faced with the daunting task of telling a new story, presenting a new world, just shrugged his shoulders and said, 'What if we just presented the *appearance* of a new world and a new story, but actually, it was just this 'meta' wink and nod to the previous games and wasn't a story of it's own at all?Even worse, it's as if Levine couldn't convince himself that he was really making something new or interesting, so he retroactively explains the plots of the previous two games as simply different iterations of Infinite's. It's like he knows, he knows that this story has obnoxious similarities to them, he knows he's creatively bankrupt, and he knows that he's not trying to tell a new story here.Don't despair, says Levine, it's actually a brilliant stroke of genius! There's always a lighthouse, a man, a city, etc.! No! I didn't run out of ideas! Shut up! It's really clever! No one will notice how stupid and utterly empty of meaningful content this is!It's true, the other two games also had lighthouses, men and cities. You know what else they had? Real characters who received real development and real characterization. A city that had an actual history and had real themes to present. The common elements never made the game, rather the writing, the characters, and the environmental storytelling did.Here, Ken Levine is left in the figurative shadow of the lighthouse, and, unable to be bothered to tell a new story, this game's story is some strange attempt to convince the player that the shadow of the lighthouse and the city, the simple, boring frame of the elements common to all 3 games ARE THEMSELVES a sort of meta-narrative about a father who sold his daughter, who sinned and atoned, and who ultimately rescues her.Can I just ask a question? What in God's name IS this garbage? Why does it exist? If Ken Levine wanted to tell a story about a father who sinned and lost his daughter but ultimately made it right, why didn't he just do that? The basic framework I just described does NOT require that it be linked through multiverse sci-fi magic BS to the other titles, it doesn't require any multiverse magic nonsense at all!It's not even a good story if you think of it not as a BioShock game. It's hardly even a story as much as it is just some weird-sounding BioShock fanfiction. GUISE WHAT IF, LIKE, ALL THE BIOSHOCKS BOIL DOWN TO A MAN TRYING TO SAVE HIS DAUGHTER FROM AN IDEOLOGICALLY EXTREME CITY? THEN THE NEW GAME WILL JUST BE THIS CONSTANT WINK THAT SAYS, 'OUR WRITERS GAVE UP!' WOULDN'T THAT BE EPIC AND A GOOD FOUNDATION FOR A STORY?NO! THE ANSWER IS NO!What if, in Halo 4, there was no narrative, it was actually this pseudo-intellectual garbage where, in the end, Cortana explains that in an alternate universe, Chief IS the didact and they're just playing out the latest iteration of Chief's attempt to save her, but in reality, there's always a Spartan, there's always a girl, there's always the covenant.Essentially, what if you take the elements common to all the games and then try to tell a meta-narrative that makes all the conflicts and characters insignificant as it explains them as simply another iteration of the same, unavoidable pattern? Does that make for a brief 'wow' moment when the player has this explained to them? Yes. Does it make for a good story? No, no it doesn't.It is, at it's core, the absence of a real story or of real writing. It happens when the writers mistake the common elements for actual writing or simply run out of ideas.Hey, though, that's just the story, right? What about the gameplay? It's bad too!Hi! What is a gun-upgrade system in a game with a two weapon limit where you switch weapons frequently b/c of limited ammo? The correct answer is pointless!What are a series of powers and abilities against enemies that all die in a few shots in constrained, linear shooting galleries? Useless? Yes!What is a rail system that allows for some amount of mobility but is mostly just used as a transition or for cutscene setpieces? A gimmick? Yes!What are transdimensional tears in reality? Are they varying ways to approach a given situation? No, they're not, they're just pointless!What is a 10-hour long campaign of shooting galleries that plays like a Call of Duty campaign but with a plot that is less-well executed, with all of the mechanics and depth that made its predecessors interesting removed? One of the most critically-acclaimed games of all time? For some reason, haha, yes! Kill me!Haha, wow this game sucks!			"

												If you like games where there's an amazing world (if you have the rendering muscle) you'll probably like this game. If you're looking for a game that rewards your mental sentiment or a game that even gives you a choice in the end; look elsewhere. My favorite BioShock is the first one. It had the right ballance of puzzles (hacking mini games) action (""zap'em then whack'em!) the right amount of plot twists (""Would you kindly"") the right amount of philosophy (worlds grity, you don't get to choose how you start but in the end you're what you make of yourself) So, my recomendation: meh. I could go on about rewarding failure but this is much much better than BioShock 2 (seriously, no backtracking!?)			"

												One of the worst sequels ever made. Everything is a step down from the original: Story, gameplay, setting. Everything.Gameplay is Call of Duty tier: kill hordes of mundane enemies over and over completely lacking any thought or satisfaction in the deed.  Guns are terrible. Seriously, there is not one gun in the game I do not reflect back upon with utter distain. In the original Bioshock weapon and plasmid upgrades were bought through separate resource pools. But in this game, EVERYTHING, and I mean EVERYTHING, is bought through the same pool. This means you don't have any room to experiment with the ""Vigor's"" (which are just cut & pastes from the older game), and have to invest in solid shoot'em'up tactics because when you get right down to it, Vigor's are just something to call this game a ""Shock"" game and not a ""Call of Dutes"" game. You can only carry two guns at once, and there is easily 10+ ♥♥♥♥ tier guns polluting the gun pool with their ammo. Which means in certain engagements, your main upgraded guns will likely run out of ammo and you'll be forced to use terrible re-skins in their place. Shooting guns is sticky, slow, tedious and all around not fun.Story takes a dive 1/4th into the game and from there on its a run and gun shoot'em up, all the way to the end with its exceptionally ill thought out ending (which doesn't resolve anything), but makes scrubs who don't want to feel stupid for not getting the ending shower it in praise for ""depth"", when in actuality it's simple, dull & poorly thought out. Ken Levine Scrapped the real Bioshock Infinite when he ran out of time wasting it on MP no one wanted, and was forced to put this ♥♥♥♥ out on the market. Literally, nothing promised in the original hype was delivered. Everything was recycled from the REAL Bioshock Infinite to create a presentable new game, and it certainly shows. Especially in character dialogue.Setting is un-imaginative and in comparison with Rapture, Columbia doesn't hold any water (no pun intended). In Rapture, the city felt like a living enemy. The ocean and crumbling city always loomed with you, and you were always aware that you were in a tin-can with a sheet of flexi-glass between you and death. In Columbia, you can just jump off the side and insta respawn with no consequences Super Meat Boy style. Enemies lack explanation or purpose in the world of Columbia, (take the fireman & patriot) & those that do are incredibly un-original or just half-♥♥♥♥♥ (crow racist people, Handy-Man).If you buy this game, I have no sympathy for you. Enjoy your middle of the game ♥♥♥♥ tier boss battle with Ghost lady 3 times over, while trying to justify your purchase by telling people like me ""it was 2deep4u"".			"

												Bioshock Infinite has the biggest potential yet failed quite hard. Gameplay is nothing like from the previews while the actual gameplay really needed to be polished. The game storywise is a huge messed, keeps on jumping to theme and theme while making me care less for characters as the story goes on and there’s certain plot elements that does not make sense. Elizabeth is the most likable character yet there is some strange characterization to the context of her situation and the previews show that she supposed to be more helpful outside of giving ammo and potions. Environments graphics are good but character details, besides Elizabeth, is very poor and the game keeps struggling with my computer even when I but the game at its lowest graphics. If you’re still curious of this game despite my warnings then I highly recommend you to buy this game on a HUGE discount.Atleast the game better than Mass Effect 3 :P			"

												There will be Spoilers.I was very disappointed with this game, having played it after finishing the first Bioshock game. The writing seemed very lazy, offering cliche time travel explanations for much of the experience, and unrealistic character behavior left and right. The character of Elizabeth was not particularly likable and was a complete Mary Sue (pretty much flawless, unrealistically skilled in various implausible facets). The storyline concerning her didn't very much interest me. I could not relate to her at all.The main Protagonist, Booker Dewitt, was a bumbling nobody who toppled an entire nation, capable of challenging the United States, single handedly. We have all seen many games able to pull off this type of protagonist in more believable ways than Infinite. He comes off as some cliche "" evil with a heart of gold""  type of guy. I happen to be sick of this type of character.I didn't like the low amounts of ammo found in the game, and how you would have to abandon your upgraded weapon for a cheap handgun many times due to the lack of ammunition and the limited number of carried weapons allowed at one time. Superior weapons found near the end of the game also reminded you of the useless thousands of dollars spent into upgrading the earlier weapons.I am used to the tedium of backtracking in video games and I don't usually count it against a game unless it is exceptionally tedious. In a game where there are MULTIPLE UNIVERSES, why are the revisited areas almost exactly the same? Some color being different, or a swapped out statue in one universe was not enough to impress me, and it felt cheap and lazy (Does the same architect posess the ability to traverse worlds and walk planes of realitiy through tears in space/time, just like Elizabeth?Seriously?).Vigors. Useless, useless vigors. I was very disappointed with the vigors. Throughout the entirety of the game, as soon as the lightning Vigor was available, it became the exclusive one used. Barring the times where the game needed you to use a different Vigor ability to progress, Lightning was more than enough to get through the game easily, especially with the upgrades it unlocks. That is not to say I would have wanted to use any of the other vigors anyway, they seemed so boring and useless to use. Why don't enemies use Vigors? Except for those few special enemies with increased health, why don't average Columbians use Vigors? What's up with that?Elizabeth being able to lockpick seems like a forced reminder to keep the illusion of how useful she is. It's strange how many large, important places of interest have their security entrusted to the same cheap, flimsy lock. Columbia sure would be a breeze for Jill, the master of unlocking, to get around in.Only two weapons at a time. You can only carry two. Irrational games decided to hate fun this time around, I suppose. It's not like there is any large tactical advantage or disadvantage to carrying one over the other, it's like they tried to go for realism in this lone, weird gesture, when they tried it with nothing else. All it did was leave you no option, in some situations, but to weild a rocket launcher in a small narrow corridor, ensuring that you would lose precious health.Constants and Variables. That is what Elizabeth tells you after you inquire about the nature of the tears in space/time. ""Constants and Variables?"" ""Yes."" and it is left at that.Yeah, whatever you say, Irrational Games.You cannot carry medkits or salts. Why not? ""Because we said so"", say the men in the cubicles.This game sucked.			"

												For me it was best single player game of 2013. Finished it on Hard difficulty and then on 1999 mode. I recommend to start it on 1999 mode as the game is too easy even on Hard difficulty.			"

												They wanted to tell a story and forgot about the game completely. Boring corridor/area shooter. Decent aesthetic and some really good voice acting. Nothing else going for it really. I got bored and quit then went back a few days later. Got to the guitar scene. Uninstalled.			"

												Do you want a game with worse gunplay and plasmid uses than the other two Bioshock games? Do you want an ending that trys to be deep just to be deep? Do you want worse plasmids than Bioshock? Do you want what looks like a big boss enemy actually not be a cool fight after all after he is instantly killed at the end? If you want a pretentious crap ending with worse gameplay and the only thing going for it is the cool setting then look no further than Bioshock Infinite.This game had so much potential it's a shame.

												The combat in this game was pretty fun.  It was fresh and exciting, at least at first. The skylines were fun to zip around and made for some challenging fast paced combat. The amount of detail that went into building this new world to explore was insane. It had a distinctive voice of it's own but still fit in with the rest of the franchise very nicely. However, I did find the gameplay to get a bit repetitive towards the end. There wasn't a whole lot of strategy that went into the combat and I found I could stumble through any encounter without too much thought. I also just didn't care for the story much, this could just be me but,  it felt like they just kept dragging on the ending for eternity and it made the last two hours or so of gameplay horrifically boring. I understand in this genre of story telling that its intentional to leave a lot questions unanswered and have the audience wondering just what exactly they experienced but, it just felt poorly executed in the long run.In general, I'd say I would've felt better if I had perhaps rented this rather then spend the forty bucks on it. I don't regret playing it but, I just wasn't terribly impressed and probably won't play it again. "

												This game is absolutely amazing. You can tell that there was an enormous amount of thought put into every detail, down to the very last corner. Bioshock Infinite is my favorite game to date, no question about it.To start, the art direction is very good. Everything is arranged to be very appealing, and the colors are very balanced. I loved just walking around the city and soaking it all up. There are 1912 style shops to go into, and they are all populated. In one area, there is even a good, three-minute quartet that you can just sit and listen to. I was very impressed with the magnitude of everything. Seldom are you placed in a small, dark room or hallway. Most of the game is set in colorful areas with large statues and airy buildings.I liked that it did not actually put you in the dark, but gave a dark feeling when it was appropriate. As per the Bioshock games, some of the events are quite dark, and I liked the uneasy feeling without the dark corridors of Rapture.Combat is a step up from other games in the genre. The introduction of ""skylines"" allows you to jump quickly from place to place, making everything very fast paced. I didn't quite like the inventory management as much as in the original Bioshock, however. I found it much harder to deal with my Vigors, mainly because you couldn't just scroll through them like in the other game. Still, you get used to it - that's a fairly minor gripe.I can not say much about the story. If I told you what was so great about it, I would spoil it for you. I can say that it puzzled me, and it was a few hours after finishing the game that I worked everything out. I felt like some of the points were repeated too much though. I get that they try to help everyone understand it well, but I would rather just have it all thrown at me - that way it's more fun to work out on my own.Overall, Irrational Games has gone above and beyond what anyone expected. The only way you would find this game worse than the original is if you are somewhat nostalgic. Even if you did not like the first or second game, I highly recommend that you still give Bioshock Infinite a try. As a side note, there are a few things that you will not quite understand if you skip the first game. They are little details, but in a game like Bioshock Infinite, it is the little details that really count.This game is worth every cent. If you can not afford it, you can wait until the next sale. The trilogy tends to go for $15~.Some screenshots:

												Bioshock infinite is a typical sequel that is quite lazy, even though techinally it isn't a sequel it still feels like it.Columbia is a nice world to explore however this does not excuse the gunplay being one of the worst I've seen in my life, however you could say this is just my opinion but they went for the boring 2 weapon system that forces you into certain weapons or else the game will be very hard.The vigors are basically reskinned from Bioshock and they made even less sense then in Bioshock 1 considering these things are just magic from the looks of it ingame.Many people praise the story and the apparent non-linearity but I disagree with those people because it follows the typical damsel in distress(providing some money/supplies help is a very small expection) with no real morals. And it is so short I got about 8 hours out of it and I didn't rush through it, hell I spend like 2 hours walking around but the story is so short that it made me think I was halfway at a point but the game was over then. And the plot gets so bad and illogical eventaully with certain aspects being cheaply used.At least the game is very polished and bug free.4/10 Somewhat intresting story but incredible short, bad in gameplay and overpriced for what it is. Just my opinion though.			"

												weak gameplay, uninteresting combat. story is great up to the ending. first one is still the best bioshock. the city is a awesome looking up until you realize you didn't get to explore most of it, the game is have very linear levels with a lot of backtracking. uping the difficulty only turn enemies in to bullet sponges w/ no change to the combat itself. boss battle are weak and repetitive. far as story goes, for the most part it work, for the majority of the short campaign of this game you do really cared about whats going on around you. the ride is nice but the ending is almost ME3 level.okay game, maybe 7/10. would not pay full price, wait for it to be on sale.

												I got to say that this game was a huge dissapointment and this is coming from a fan of the original bioshock titles. Almost everything is worse in infinite compared to bioshock 1 and 2.You can only hold 2 weapons at once which makes it so the game has the typical modern ""we only give you the weapon you need for the situation"" style. The weapons are all very boring, a rifle, a machine gun, shotgun, sniper... Very unoriginal and boring weapons and the upgrades for them are only ""better ammo capacity"", ""more damage"". Very generic and unoriginal. There is a noticably lower amount of vigours/plasmids/powers in infinite and there is a more limited amount of salt/eve so you can'ät use them as much. The levels are very linear and are therefor not very interesting and you never have any problems with resources such as ammo or health. Another very dissapointing aspect is that several of the special enemies did not get implemented the way they were promised too especially the more interesting ones. The only redeeming aspect is the story of the game and that might be worth your time but for the full price I can seriously not recomend this game for anyone as long as you don't believe that the story alone is worth it.Play the first two games if you want something really good and skip this one or pick it up on sale but for full price I would say no.

												(Mostly spoiler free)When all's said and done, a fairly disappointing game. The gameplay is certainly subpar, with lots of elements removed from previous titles. There is a nicely large variety of weapons, but this is completely undermined by the utterly unnecessary two weapons limit, which serves only to stifle player choice and undermine the upgrade system as well. Enemy variation isn't much to write home about. The regenerating shield is the first time that regenerating health has been tried in this series, and unfortunately really hurts the combat, since it makes cowering behind boxes and popping out to fire one of the most effective combat tactics. Also the only boss fights which occur in this game are terrible. Not just hard, but horribly designed: infinitely respawning enemies, limited weapons and a bullet sponge boss, with money deducted and enemy health restored every time you die.The story starts off quite strongly, although as more of the plot is revealed, plot holes spring up all over the place and the conclusion is confusing, rife with its own plot holes and unsatisfying. The world is also poorly constructed, with the player murdering hundreds of innocent people for the crime of being law enforcement officers, then continuing to have normal conversations with Elizabeth, making Booker seem completely insane. Vigors are an adapation of plasmids from earlier games, but while plasmids were integral to the plot in Bioshock, vigors are very much an afterthought, with basically no bearing on how the city operates.Elizabeth as a character is confusing. She has spent her whole life locked up in a tower, yet seems to be normally socially adjusted, which seems unusual. As a gameplay element, she is strangely shoehorned in. She cannot be injured or captured by enemies, who will completely ignore her, and can occasionally ""find"" ammo, health or salt (vigor power) around the battlefield, although these are not available through standard searching, only through Elizabeth. Her addition to gameplay is redundant, and only serves as an excuse for poor design in terms of ammo.Visual design is fantastic, but there is little else to recommend about this short game, especially replay value. Don't buy it.			"

												Every time I replay this game, I get a little better. Everytime I fire my trusty Hand Cannon, or shot my Founder's Machine Gun; I am reminded how important Life is. When I am getting chased by a Fireman I can feel time slow down; as I reflect on how awesome it feels to shoot vigors from my hand...If you like story based shooter games with awesome guns: play this game.If you want to help the Vox: play this game.If you believe in the common-folk: play this game.That's all I have to say.
