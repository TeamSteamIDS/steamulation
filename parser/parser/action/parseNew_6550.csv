D - Difficulty - It is well balanced , its little bit hard for the first time but can be beaten with practice , patience , efficient weapon/style uasage and learning enemy moveset  . You need to be extremely good for higher difficulty levels . After all video games need to be challenging , they are more fun that way . DA was tougher than SE .C - Combat - ♥♥♥♥in amazing , its so much fun to hurl enemies into air , use them as a skateboard , mixing devil arms and melee weapons in the combat and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of enemies . Style play  promotes  chaining of combos . Use of different styles , different weapons and devil arms brings variety in combat and gives fresh and fantastic experience . They just nailed it in this department , style switcher mod for pc takes it to next level . There so many brilliant combo videos on youtube and all are  amazing .B - Boss Fights - Boss fights are simply outstanding . Agni&Rudra , Nevan , Beowulf , Dante's shadow , Vergil fights etc ( one of the best boss ever )  all are amazing . No cutscene , qte♥♥♥♥♥♥just pure dope gameplay . You have to learn their moves and fight effectively . Bosses are designed well too and give  sense of achievement after beating them . Normal enemies are not that great and not that bad and there is a room for improvement . Loved vergil's and doppelganger's taunts .A - Action - Right in your face intense action . Amazing combat , style play and hordes of enemies keep the action going on . Few puzzles are here and there which save your fingers from getting sore . DMC3 is all about cool & stylish moves/action . DMC3 is one of the best action games ever made . S- Story - Pretty straightforward story , DMC3 focuses more on action/combat and this what i expect from a action game . Minimal story and loads of gameplay . Cutscenes are top notch and action packed esp. when dante gets devil trigger . Vergil & The Lady cutscenes are equally epic . SS - Sick Soundtrack - Battle theme pumps you up and with metal in the background and action going on the screen , one can never go wrong  . Metal + action games combo  gives birth to amazing gaming experience  . Battle theme do get repetitve and sometimes it gets irritating . Vergil 3 and doppelganger themes are great . Last but not the least , just listen to Devils never cry . So ♥♥♥♥in gooooood SSS - SonS of Sparda - Both Dante and vergil are fantstic characters , esp. Dante . Their chemistry is so interesting , both are twins but completely opposite to each other and whenever they interact its fun watch them . Dante is such a badass character with bring it on attitude and vergil on the other hand calm and more  deadly foe .Their design is pretty great too with old school red vs blue touch . No words to describe the battles between them , play it and experience it . Unarguably one of the best combination and boss fight . Rarely you have a opponent who is equally as powerful as you and defeats you . Being your own brother makes things more heated up( only in game :P )Pc port is bad but can be fixed easliy with few fixes , thanks to modding community . Replay value  is great with playable vergil ,  bloody palce mode and ofcourse trying different styles and maximizing them .Masterpiece 9.9/10			"

It doesn't support many controllers without a mod and it has known performance issues. I would highly recommend getting it, but not for PC.			"

												Last and Final Warning... DO NOT BUY!!!!!(Fixes for this game are at the bottom of the review. Click on the link) DO NOT GET ON PC!!!! Get the HD Collection on PS3 or Xbox 360 instead. This Game is an AMAZING Game. However, the PC Port of this game is HORRIBLE!!!!! the controlls don't work right and you have to do a ton of unecessary fixes just to have some functionality, not even full functionality. and the resolution is about the same resolution as the original PS2 game so it will not play in HD or in any wide aspact ratio. This is a total waste of your hard earned money. your better off getting the ""Devil May Cry HD Collection"" on PS3 or Xbox 360 where u get the first 3 original DMC games including this one, the controls flow like you where born to play this game, and the resolution is FULL HD! now that is a WAY BETTER buy then this PC version piece of crap. keep in mind that DMC 4 and DMC:Devil May Cry (Remake) works amazing on PC so just becuase this one sucks on PC doesn't mean the other 2 on pc are bad as well. I would recommend DMC 4, and DMC Reamake over this game aswell. Have fun with those other DMC Games. :)I HAVE AMAZING NEWS!!! this link at the bottom of the review will help you fix every single problem this game can dish out! :D. it's in the steam forums. if you really want this game, than you have to see this link. This link will give you everything! how to get full controller functionality, get the proper resolution in game in full screen, and more. this is highly recomended for more advance computer users so, be warned, some of this fixes for some people aren't easy but for most it should be a piece of cake ;) have fun!http://steamcommunity.com/app/6550/discussions/0/864969320373351964/#p1 "

												Most of the negative reviews here are because of technical issues that are solvable on most systems. Fullscreen works by pressing ALT+Enter (maybe not while in the menu or title screen or cutscene, but ingame), widescreen support is available via a hack. On some systems, the resolution may be limited to 640x480 or 800x600, but that is not the normal behaviour. You should get the highest 4:3 resolution closest to your native resolution without a patch. XBox controllers are not officially supported because this game uses directinput for controller support, which is the predecessor to xinput. If you have one of the recent Logitech gamepads (F310 for example), you can choose between directinput and xinput via a hardware switch on the controller, then map the controller keys correctly (setup controller) and the game works out of the box. If you have to use an xbox compatible controller, you have to fiddle around to get the trigger keys working. This is because the trigger keys are analog and on the same axis on the xbox compatible controllers, but are two seperate digital keys on the older standard. Please note that this game was developed before the xbox compatible controllers had been invented! It would have been nice of Capcom to have this version revamped like they did for PS3 and XBox, but they have not.  It is not optimized for the PC and it is an old game, but I still think it is awesome.			"

												No need to worry about port anymore. Styleswitcher mod fixes everything and turns DMC3 into a dream come true who those who want to experience more out of the game. Ever wanted to use style switching from dmc4 with the 5 different weapon arms and gun arms in the game, then get dat styleswitcher mod. Want to customize some other aspects of hte games engine to allow for even crazier combos, styleswitcher mod. Is this game worth it even if you already own the the hd collection...sadly, only with the style swticher mod. So yeah, as a port, absolutely flawed to the core but a super fast fix in just 5 minutes with styleswitcher mod. Why can't I stop talking about it? It's the best thing that ever happened to dmc3 that's what...though, that's my opinion, so why don't you make your own giving it a go. Infinite combo potential awaits you.http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/It's very easy to set up. Check out styleswitcher mod combo videos while you are at it.AND DON'T LISTEN TO PEOPLE SAYING OTHERWISE NOT TO GET IT! Do yourself a favor and just use this fix for a game that surpasses even the HD version.			"

												This is the third installment in the Devil May Cry® series, but, in lore, the first one.You take the role of the hero in the previous games, Dante. You get to learn more of his past, how his Devil Hunting store came to be and you get to learn more about his brother, Vergil.It's an old game, but still, one of the best Devil May Cries out there, and one of the most fun! You've got several modes of difficulty in this game, some of those being seriously ridiculous and fun.Being it a Hack and Slash, you can't defend. Only dodge. The more you diverse your attacks and taunt your enemy, the more style points you get, to escalate from D (Dope) to SSS (SSStylish). So do levels rank to that based on your performance throughout them.Although, if you get this game, I advise, GET A CONTROLLER and the software Xpadder. Otherwise, this is going to be a major pain to play without. It was made to bear one, it's meant to be played that way.In short, great game, definitly worth getting!			"

												Jesus Christ where to start. The Good:- My god, the gameplay, the gameplay is perhaps one of the best hack and slash experiences EVER. Tear through endless demon hordes as Dante, the cool protagonist of the series. (EXCEPT DMC4) - Difficulty is just right, across all modes you get what you asked for. Although some newcomers may have a hard time trying to beat the harder difficulties like Dante Must Die. - The level of replay ability for such a game is great. Even after you beat every difficulty mode as Dante and Vergil (Two different campaigns) you can still fight huge and dangerous groups of demons in Bloody Palace. The Bad: - Some parts of the game are not so fun, which will make you wanna stop playing and take a break. Puzzles that are very horrid will show up, although once you get through them you'll have a good time fighting bosses and enemies. - The story, I will admit I'm attached to the cast and the story yet looking at it professionally it's not the best. Most players will ignore the story and focus on gameplay which is fine, as you won't be missing that much unless you care for the series. - Your boyfriend/girlfriend will leave you after she finds out you spent a week playing this game and not responding to his/her texts. The Ugly(Oh god the ugly):- DEAR GOD, THE PORT OF THIS GAME IS SO ATROCIOUS. Exhibit A: For most folks this game does not work AT ALL. Exhibit B: For all folks, Xbox controllers are not supported. Exhibit C: WHY CAPCOM but wait, there is a fix Yes, some saint that goes by the name of serpentiem has fixed all these problems with Style Switcher. A mod that not only lets you chose styles in the middle of combat, but also repairs the busted PC port that is this game. http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?- The graphics have not aged well; this is not the kind of game you can expect to look good although the graphics have that PS2 feel to them. I had a lot more to this review but Steam has a pretty strict character limit so, this is the end of the review.

												once you find a way to get a controler working properly its a pretty enjoyable game... took me a couple days but finally got my logitech f310 to work properly for the most part. The biggest issue I have now is the camera function doesnt work well. To get the controler to work right I used Xpadder 5.3 and played with the settings till I got it to work mapping L1, L2, L3, R1, R2, R3, and the left stick to WASD. I used xmod which seemed to give me the best use of the controler. no issues with changing the display resolution, but had to figure out how to get it to play full screen (alt+enter) at the title screen, afterwards the game has continued to start in full screen... the second issue I came across was figuring out how to exit the game, again alt+enter then click the red x. Yet to try it but I think alt+F4 might work for exiting as well. So far great game but the porting was♥♥♥♥♥♥poor.			"

												Like real talk, the port is♥♥♥♥♥♥no question. It should by no means still be even on the store at least not at £15.99 in it's state. But with a the styleswitcher mod it's good as new, you wont even mind the smell. Step 1: go here http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/? or your local mod distribute of choice and grab the game. Step 2: Dump all the contents in the zip into the root folder of the game and click the install that was in there. Step 3: Now with that you can enter the styleswitcher.ini and adjust everything to your liking, fixed audio, fully functional resolution options, fixed fullscreen for users with that issue like me. (contains instructions for people not knowing what to do with the .ini)Also contains within the mod further instructions to fix the games outdated controller support which is just fantastic.Don't get me wrong, just because mods exist doesn't excuse the original state it was in, this game doesn't deserve a possitive review, the fan's who went out of their way to fix and find fixes to the game deserve it.

												How to make this party Cuhrayzy: The Step-by-step guide1. Buy the game, install 2. Google for DMC3SE style switcher mod3. Follow given instructions4. Lauch the game5. Show your MotivationOptional step: Mess around with mod settings for desired level of Cuhrayzy.While the mod might cause crashes or other problems, I personally can recommend this game only with it, for it makes the PC-version clearly superior version compared to original, emulated or HD-remake. Easily the best starting point for this series, story and gameplay-wise, for DMC1 & 2 struggled to find the thing DMC3 finally brought us: Stylish and fast combat, with different combinations of styles and weapons to find and enemies to beat. The main point is combat, which has level of depth rarely seen: Chance to newer players to learn, challenge for those wanting to best Temen-Ni-Gru and ultimate challenge of mastering the combat to ascend to Realm of Super Smokin' Style. I've played this game semi-regurlarly for almost nine years , starigt with the PS2 version, and still finding new stuff to try. That might be a hit-or-miss for some people, since everything else is made to set stage for ever-increasing showcase of crazy combat: The Story, the music, the levels. Two of the latter are not bad and with mods it is possible to put your own soundfiles (or just mute the music and listen some other music). Story is there, if you want life-like characters, good narrative and thought-provoking themes, go read a book. Here you find classical Capcomesque anime-style story about young, superhuman demonhunter who is most likely blowing his pay-check on pizza and energy drinks. So if you want to clash with the forces of Demon Realm with Style, get the game, apply the mods and get on the ride to experience a piece of best Third Person Action made by Capcom and in my opinion, the history of action games.PS. While mod helps with keyboard & mouse controls, i personally recommend to play with a gamepad.			"

												Word of advice for those who buy this you need two things-Style Switcher mod (for most fun lets you switch styles like DMC4 and some fixes and tweaks)*OR-(though I don't condone piracy but since this exe is outdated) Get a cracked 1.3 DMC3SE.exe file (fixes A LOT of framerate issues)(sadly they don't work in tandem)The Good-Stylish but aged combat style system (fixed with this mod)*-Banging Music-Fun-Vergil-Unlockable costumes-High replayability (which can be extended by the mod)*-pretty challengingThe Bad-A bit unfair boss fights (basically fake difficulty)-The problems with the games' combat shows on higher difficultiesThe Ugly-Poorly optimized due to audio bug(mods and patchs previously mentioned mitigate some of these chinks in the armor)-Overpriced for how old and un-updated it isIf your willing to tweak the game and the game happens to be on sale I say buy it.

												Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening. -Or Special Edition, as it is now.The best game in the series yet, in my own humblest opinion.The story is awesome, gameplay is top notch just like any other DMC game.Now... The port.. is bad.. It IS playable and you CAN use a controller.But it is STILL A BETTER PORT THAN DARK SOULS 1 WAS. But people seem to ignore that.I love this game to bits.If you do happen to own a Playstation 2, 3 or 4, consider getting the original or HD versions there instead.EDIT: Yes, I was able to complete it with my keyboard entirely, but I do enjoy it more with a controller. The controller support is good.			"

												DMC3 is a wonderful game, but stock the port has some issues:Only 4:3 resolution optiionsSwitched analog sticks with controllersPoor default button layoutThis annoyances are pretty significant to me BUT the DMC3 Style Switcher mod fixes these issues. I did run into a bit of trouble getting the mod installed, but now that the annoyances are taken care of I'm very happy to have this game.Out of the box, maybe I wouldn't reccomend it, but with the mod, yes. This is still the skill based, combo slinging, and currency grinding game it's always been.			"

												Devil May Cry 3 is absolutely CUHRAYZEE.+ Undisputed god-tier gameplay that's fun as all hell with the highest skill ceiling in gaming because it has so much depth and exploitation that you can basically become a god.+ Loads of weapons and styles that offer unlimited gameplay potential.+ The style meter that keeps track and judges your combat performance and how often you switch your attacks up.+ Powerups that you aren't forced to rely on and are even frowned upon since they detract from your ending mission rank.+ Fantastic boss fights at the end of almost every single mission.+ Fantastic level design that manages to be more than linear corridors.+ Metal as f*ck music that perfectly pumps the moment.+ Likable characters all around with cheesy but fantastic voice acting.+ Goofy but charming cutscenes that are absolutely cuhrayzee.- Like two bosses out of the entire game manage to be lackluster.- Some styles will be more useful than others and you may end up relying on just one or two the entire game.You must know that the PC port is absolutely garbage and you will NEED to download the ""StyleSwitcher"" mod from Nexus to get this game to run properly. It's so bad that the f*cking music files of all things make the game drop frames slightly, even with the mod. If you wish to play this game in an optimal way, buy the DMC HD Collection for either PS3 or Xbox 360 which looks and runs perfectly at 60fps and comes with DMC1, 2, and 3, all great games (except 2..).The game itself is a 9/10. Play it any way you can but be warned the PC version requires work and some sacrifices like turning off some sound and music files.			"

												The issues with this game.Frame Rate drops randomly, not sure if that is for everyone or if there is a fix. Also, some sounds act up for me, like the Gigapede boss music cut off half way through the fight.The good stuff? It is dmc3. I have a guide on how to fix the shotty controller settings for MotioninJoy, so that isn't much of a issue if you have a ps3 controller for the game. So if you get this game, and not a cry baby about ""my game isn't always at 60FPS!"" then this game is for you.. If not, There is the DmC HD collection for console. Which is also nice when that doesn't glitch.(which only happend once to me.)Kinda amazed steam allows the game to have so many bugs though, and still be sold. Felt it should of been fixed long ago.

												before you read my review or buy the game remember DMC3 is a amazing game I highly suggest you buy it, I have bought it three times now but DON'T buy the pc version if you don't want to tear your hair out in frustration but more of that later.Lets start the actual review now shall we?First the story - The story takes place a few years before the first devil may cry, Dante who has yet to pick a name for his shop is just hanging around when a man named Arkham enters and tells Dante his brother has a invitation for him. Dante is then attacked by lessor demons but quickly (and stylishly) kills them all and this starts the events of the game and overall the story is pretty good best in the series has some insane motioncapture and good voice acting (compared to DMC1 and DmC this is oscar worthy)Second the styles - You can choose between four different styles which are Swordmaster where your melee weapons have more moves, do more damage and let you combo in the air easily, Gunslinger lets you use your guns in extremely stylish ways from spinning in mid air while fireing down to curb stomping a demon while shooting him in the head and its a pleasure to watch the animations, Royalguard works as a block button but it doesn't stop there sure you can block and take reduced damage but if you perfectly time your block you can absorb all damage and release it in a extremely damaging attack that if you build enough damage up you can instant kill some of the tougher demons, Trickster gives you another type of dodge, a teleport, a air dash and the ability to run on walls, Trickster can be used to create insane combos if you know what you're doing. There are two other styles quicksilver and doppleganger which let you slow down time and create a copy of yourself and thats about it but if used right are deadly (doppleganger unlocks a hidden two player mode to)Third the combat - The combat in this game is insanely fun with a total of 5 devil arms (melee weapons) and 5 fire arms (guns) for Dante and the ability to bring any combination of weapons (two devil arms two fire arms) and one of 6 styles to choose from this game has a crazy ammount of depth in its combat especailly since all weapons and styles (except doppleganger and quicksilver) can be upgraded and gain more moves.Fourth Extras - With the special edition you are able to play as Vergil who has 3 devil arms and no fire arms but shoots summond swords instead and a single style (he has less depth then Dante but is fun to play) After you beat the game once you can start a new game as Vergil you will be given a cutscene that takes place before DMC3 but don't get your hopes up he ends up going through the same levels as Dante (from the Devil May Cry all the way to hell) The style switcher mod does work on Vergil but you can only use dark slayer (Default style) and Dante's quicksilver style (due to the other styles not working right or them already being a part of Dark Slayer)Fifth should you buy it - In short yes you should buy this game...... if you have a playstation 2 the pc version is a extremely bad port and it is fixable (I fixed it after spending over 10 hours configureing it) it just takes a lot of time and a lot of reading user guides on how to fix it. On the brightside of the pc version is the ability to mod and the famous style switcher mod (go get it now) which lets you change to any of the 6 styles at any time in game without having to stop at a statue to change them (it also comes with other features that let you customize the game further but I won't get into that)If you use a controller be prepared to break it in half with your teeth out of pure rage when you find out the triggers don't work and the sticks are reversed (right stick moves you left stick turns camera) there are fixes for this but they don't always work and if you are useing Motioninjoy be prepared to just quit (I made a discussion post on how to fix a ps3 controller with motioninjoy but if you are useing any other controllers good luck to you)I also hope you have a somewhat decent computer cause this game runs like hell the framerate is subpar and requires you to delete audio files (really?) to get the framerate up but it stops the badass soundtrack from playing if you do so (luckly for me my computer can handle it)Final - Do i recommend this game? again yes if you can get a console copy or if you are willing to spend 10+ hours fixing it, if you have no choice but to buy it on PC buy it when it goes on sale it usualy drops down to $7.50 but this is one of my favorite games of all time it just has a bad pc portLet's Rock!

												Capcom. Wtf man? Ok - without checking forums (and I should never have to do that) it won't run in anything other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ windowed mode. It's not designed to, or adapted to, 360 compatible joysticks which is pretty much the only stick anyone has. Sure you can reconfigure the joystick but you'll have to remember  what the hell button 4 or 7 or 2 is, and there's no guide or helpful hint so you're just left stabbing in the dark. The only way to get the game working properly (and i'm not sure that I can) is going to be if i go and check forum posts - that just shoudn't happen. It should work perfectly out of the box for the vast majority of setups. They haven't even tried. I should have known after the Ducktales affair (where Capcom released a game that they KNEW was fundamentally broken) that Capcom were going to butt♥♥♥♥ me on this one but like a fool I thought it couldn't be THAT bad. Boy was I wrong. Buy it if you want an example of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy a port can be. Otherwise avoid like the plague.EDIT: After checking the forums you can apparently edit the ini file to get the 360 controller working kindasorta but for some it doesn't work and too bad if you're not comfy with editing files like that.Then you need the styleswitcher mod to get the most of the game, And then, no matter how beastly your pc, there are a couple of points where there's really bad framerate drops due to *gasp* music playing. Once you get through all that...it's apparently not too bad. The sad fact is that Capcom could and should easily release a patch that would fix the 360 controller problem. But they won't. Why? Because they are a pack of something that ryhmes with punts.So still a big no go from me. And it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy another Capcom game.			"

												If you come here expecting a 4K experience, you came to the wrong place. Maximum you'll get from the game is 1400x1050, which can be enhanced with mods, but I haven't dwelt on those. What I did was use the Windowed Borderless Gaming software to upscale it to 1920x1080. This is a straight up port from the PS2 version of the game. So much so, that you need to either Alt+F4 out of it or boot up Task Manager to terminate the .exe. Another gripe you might have with this game is the control scheme. Again taken straight from the PS2 game, so if you plug a Dualshock 3 controller to your computer with no modification to it's drivers, it will work perfectly. However, you won't be able to use that controller for any other games in it's current state as it isn't recognized as an X-Input controller, which is what other games ask for. Nevertheless, there are tutorials out there in the forums to help you out in configuring your controller so that it works perfectly without too much hassle when switching between games. Now, once you do get your controller running decently with the game I can guarantee one single thing; absolute fun. Being the straight port it is from the PS2 game, the mechanics are exactly the same and they're so intuitive you'll only need a couple of tries till you get the hang of the moves to then execute them to great effect. However, while the skill floor is reasonably low, the skill ceiling is super high. To master the game you WILL have to pour a lot of time and effort into it. Therefore, it boils down to the following: If you want to complete the story, you'll be able to do it without having to practice for hours. It's very accessible for that.If you want to complete every difficulty and unlock everything, get ready to climb those Rocky stairs over and over again. You'll need to learn how to perform every combo consistently, every enemy moveset and understand every mechanic thoroughly, as there is a mode where you die in 1 hit.In conclusion, if you don't mind going through the hassle of solving the issues I pointed out, then;This party is just getting started!- Dante "

												As a huge Devil May Cry fan, this game hold up the standards just as well as it's predecessors,possibly even better (I'm looking at you DMC2).From a general game perspective, it is a solid Hack and Slash game with memorable characters,a simple but enjoyable story, and more importantly you get to beat the crap out of demons while being a totalbadass. (Also it's pretty challenging so, if you don't like handholding- this is the game for you)I've had and played this game for about 4 years now, and still love it dearly. (Although it only says 30 hours on Steam, I also played it a lot on PS3 later).But recently I came to notice how low the Steam ratings for this game were, and I read through the reviews to see why.From what I've seen, it's all in regards to the port itself, which is understandable.I've personally never had a problem running the game on Steam (even without downloading patches or anything).That said, I do think that the in-game references to the controls are complete jank, because they are based on anumbering system for buttons that VERY unclear. This can be solved by a simple google search to see what each buttondoes. I don't think the frame-rate is optimal (especially for a hack and slash) but it's not unplayable,I really didn't notice it all that much when I first got into the game, but only after I'd had my share of a varietyof hack and slash games and really came to know the genre, did I notice the difference.I also never had a problem using a controller as the controller scheme menu is actually pretty easy to understand,although customization is a bit annoying.In summary:I guess from my experience, I'd say the game is still worth is, especially during Steam Sales, assuming that you can run it.Like I said, it is a bit jank here and there, and it's not an excellent port by any means, but if you are looking to have a hack and slash game that's easy to run on most computers just to casually play whenever, this is the game for you.

												Decided to review it to save the fools who are looking into this on launch.TLDR: Amazing game. Brutally difficult. You gotta ""git gud"" as they say if you want to make it past the first few levels of the game. Combat is fluid, graphics are okay for the time. Isn't much better than the PS2 version. Story's ""meh"" and the cutscenes are so cheesy it's...still kind of good. It was during the whacky time of Capcom after all.Now for why I'm giving it a negative review:The PC version adds _NOTHING_ from the PS2 version of ""Special edition"" If you already have it on PS2/3/Xbox360, there isn't much of a reason to rebuy it unless you wanted to play on your PC. The port is godawful. Doesn't recognize controllers, awful keyboard button layouts, awful resolution settings, this game is a MUST to get a mod just to make it playable. A bunch of reviewers kindly put the link down to ""patching the game"" into a playable state. I'll copy and paste it here too as a sign of thanks for actually reading this review, i guess.Basically; great game, awful port.http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/? "

												This i an AMAZING game that I played years ago on the PS2.  Everything about this game is rediculous.  The combat, the story, the cutscenes, it's all over the top crazy action, and I love it.  I bought this on Steam to try to replay it with some better graphics, but unfortunately, this game was not optimized for PC at ALL.Controller support is awful, you CAN get some of them to work, but it isn't easy, and you have to a lot of research to find out how to get it to work.  Graphics are technically better than they were on the PS2, but widescreen support is not built in, so if you are one of the normal PC users that have a 16:9 or 16:10 screen, you will have blackbars on the sides of the screen.  There is a mod to 'fix' this, but it basically just stretches the screen, so it looks awful.Capcom didn't try very hard on the PC version of this game, which is unfortunate, because it's one of the best DMC's.  Try Devil May Cry 4 or DMC, they have way better support, so they know how to do it right, just not wortgh their effort to fix this version I guess. TL;DR version - Great game, but badly ported.  Play the game, just not the PC version.			"

												I'm sure other reviews here will say roughly the same as I'll say.This is a rather poorly made port of DMC3 for the PS2. It's not entirely unplayable as some may lead you to believe, but it's bad enough to make you want to not play the game despite how fun it is.Most console controllers will refuse to work for the game and what DOES work will leave you wanting more, such as not being able to use one of your joysticks. You CAN download a program to fix this and it's really not the main issue with the port because it can be fixed. The real problem comes from the fact that you will have massive, and I mean MASSIVE fps drops in multiple locations resulting in it being neigh unplayable.But in those non-large areas where fps is stable and you fix the controller up, it works rather well for a port.I wouldn't recommend it because it's far too much work to get everything in working condition.(At this point there might even be a fix for the FPS drops but I didn't care to look for it)THAT ALL BEING SAIDIf you don't have a problem with everything I said, feel free to pick up this game.

												You REALLY need to want to play this game if you want to fix everything in this terrible port. You need to download the style switcher mod and/wide-screen mod (and delete some songs out of the soundtrack) to make it playable at least. With the style switcher mod you can have 1080p/60fps gameplay galore but be warned it can become a hassle to install. Now to the game.This is still to this day the king of the character action/spectacle brawler genre. The trifecta would go as dmc3, bayonetta and Ninja Gaiden Black. To this day no other action game has the complexity and freedom that this game provides in its more or less 20 missions. This is no ""dial-a-combo"" action game, you're free to create your own combos as you wish, just remember that with that freedom comes the weight of complexity as it is no easy game. The skill ceiling goes through the roof, just look at any MAD combo on YouTube. The good thing is that this game is constantly challenging and if you're willing to put the work it will grow with you abilities. There's a lot of difficulty modes which you unlock by beating the game in the difficulty that comes before it and with each new difficulty comes new challenges, a more aggressive AI and even a mode where you cannot get hit. Seriously...this amount of depth has not yet been rivaled by any game in the genre. TL;DR : if you like action games, tough bosses, depth in your combat mechanics, freedom to play as you want, a difficulty that has a pretty high ceiling but eases you up into it this is the game for you. Be aware that you have to be willing to pull off the mods to make it work correctly and also be aware that this game asks a lot from you as s gamer. If you're up to the challenge and you're willing to put in the time this is s sure recommendation. Just like crossfit or a pretty long book, this isn't for everybody but if you're up for the challenge I assure you you'll love it.			"

												ONLY BUY IF YOU WANT TO GET THE STYLE SWITCHER MOD. IF YOU DO, THOUGH, YOU'LL ENJOY THE BEST ACTION GAME EVER MADE.Download this mod and follow the instructions down to a tee: http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?Pros:+ Concise Pacing and Structure+ Tough but engaging difficulty + Controls (with the Style Switcher Mod) are smooth and responsive+ Incredible Scope of Combat with the weapons, guns, and styles of playing + Contains the deepest and most rewarding mechanics that can still go toe-to-toe with Bayonetta, Ninja Gaiden, and God Hand+ Great Boss Battles+ Perfect Musical Score+ Dante and Vergil are great characters to play as, alongside having one of the best rivalries in gamingCons:- Without Style Switcher Mod, the game is garbage to run on PC- No real tutorial- Camera is awkward to use- Puzzles are mundane, with occasional lack of direction- Some bosses are clearly better than other (*cough cough* ARKHAM SUCKS *cough cough*)- A few enemies are not as fun to fight as the others (Fallen, Dullahan, Soul Eaters, and Blood Goyles can ♥♥♥♥ right off)Neutral:_ Bloody Palace is both frantically great and tediously long_ Dumb Story with cheesy linesOnly buy if you are willing to mod it the Style Switcher. But if you do, every other hack and slash will look boring and easy. Devil May Cry 3: Dante's Awakening Special Edition is still the finest hack n slash/ 3D character action/ spectacle fighter ever made.			"

Devil May Cry® 3 Special Edition ReviewOne of the best hack'n'slash games ever made, is available on Steam with worst PC port i have ever played.PC portThis is without a doubt, the worst PC port i have ever played. Controlls are terrible, sticks are inverted (left stick controlls the camera, right one controlls the movement), framerate is awful, and graphics are downgraded. What the hell Capcom!? But..... thankfully Style Switcher mod exists. It fixed resolution, controlls and graphics can look bit better. However it didn't fix framerate for me, so i had to delete some songs from the game in order to make it stable, which is just bad. StoryDevil May Cry 3 is a prequel to the original Devil May Cry (which totally deserves to be on Steam...). One day, while young Dante was minding his own business in his shop which he hadn't opened yet, a misterious menacing man called Arkham appeared, and gave Dante an ''invitation'' from his brother Vergil. Vergil thirsts for poweri suppose because he was unable to save his mother and protect his son Nero, and he wants to obtain the strenght of his father Sparda. But in order to do so, he must sacrifice humanity, and that's when Dante is going to try to stop him. In the mean-time, a young lady called Mary (see what i did there?) wants to avenge her mother, by killing the one responsible for her death. The one and only, Arkham. Dante and Mary will occasionally meet each other, and as expected, they will start from hating each other to having huge respect for each other. And now, without saying what will happen, a war between good and evil begins!Cutscenes are awesome, and i rarely skip them. Story is nothing too special, but it's quite amusing.GameplayThis is one of the best hack'n'slash of all time. There are many weapons, items, enemies, and of course, huge difficulty. Is it unfair? No, it's totally fair, and if you died, then it's your fault for not being good enough. Should you feel bad if you die? No, because this game can be ridiculously difficult at moments, but practice makes perfect! Now, there are 2 playable characters:Dante: Haves 6 styles, 5 weapons, 5 firearms. Trickster Style is for those who prefer to have an ''escape'' and ''approach'' ability, which makes it great for evading attacks from enemies and going towards them. Swordsmaster Style is for those who want to go full berserk on demons. Gunslinger Style is for those who prefer more firepower over slashing. Royal Guard is for those who grew up with SF3 and want to parry everything. Quicksilver Style is for those who want to have ''NOW FREEZE!'' button, which usually means your enemy is defenseless, or you're getting pressured. Doppleganger Style is for those who want to.... well honestly i don't know much about this one, let's just say for Naruto fans, because of clones..... Now, if you have Style Switcher mode installed, you can be all of the above at once! As for weapons and firearms, the combo possibilities are endless, so you won't get bored easily.Vergil: Haves 1 style, 3 weapons, 1 firearm. Dark Slayer Style is perfect for evading, approaching, and trolling your opponents. It's so fast, and it works just like you want it to. His main sword Yamato doesn't have many combos, but Judgement Cut ability is ridiculously broken. Beowulf and Infinite Edge are great too, but not as much. His ''firearm'' is basically summoning swords which can fly at your enemies and spin around you for area damage. Best thing is that they  won't stop your attack animation, which means you can spam it as much as you want while beating hell out of demons.All in all, gameplay is fantastic.GraphicsI loved the PS2 graphics, so why the hell are there so many missing details and filters in PC version? It looks washed out. Thankfully, Style Switcher mod haves an option to make graphics slightly closer to PS2 version, but it's still not good.SoundtrackSoundtrack is very atmospheric, and it makes you feel like a badass demon slayer. Genre? I..... suppose electronic rock/metal, i don't really knowOverallOne of my favorite games of all time, with worst PC port in existence. Installing Style Switcher mode can be a pain in the a*s, and after that, you have to set up your controlls and other stuff. Again, this didn't fix horrible framerate for me, so i was forced to play this game without music. IF YOU'RE A DIEHARD, THEN BUY IT ON SALE, IF YOU'RE A NEWCOMER, DON'T BOTHER AND BUY DMC 4: SE OR DMC HD COLLECTION INSTEAD!Devil May Cry 3: 9.5/10PC version: 2/10 but 7/10 with Style SwitcherP.S. Where's my HD Collection on Steam Capcom?			"

												This game was obviously not optimized for PCs in mind. When I started playing it, it was stuck in 640 x 480 resolution with no way to change resolution or to change to fullscreen despite an option for the former in the options menu. What gives? Also, there was no xinput mappings, so my XBox One controller mappings were all over the place; in fact, to move, I had to move the RIGHT analog stick! It made the game extremely unfun and unplayable. Stay away at all costs until or unless these issues are resolved.			"

												A great game if you want a game that challenges you and lets you fight with style! Challenging but entertaining fights, a combat system that is fun to explore, and an amusing protagonist to join the ride. It's a bit tricky in the beginning, and you may need some time to get into the mechanics, but it feels very good and rewarding once you get going. At the end of levels you can get ranked from D to S on various things, so there's a lot of room to practice your skills. A less good part of the game would be a bit dodgy platforming in some parts, but they are generally far and between. Oh, and this is not a very good port on it's own. If you want to buy this, remember to download the mod that fixes it up as well!I loved this game, and if you like Platinum style games you may enjoy it too!			"

												First and foremost I'm playing this game with the steam controller and have found a preset that works for me, what didn't work for me where mouse & keyboard or the xbox one controller. The game is a true classic and if you can life with a few drawbacks(the resolution is not up to date, the keyboard controlls are horrendous and most gamepads are not supported from the get go [check the forums to see how to get modern ones to work]), it's absolutley worth giving it a shot. I do however strongly recomand to install the style changer mod as it resolves many issues one may experience with the game & to play it using the steam controller(many good presets are available) or at least a suported one if you don't want to fiddle arround with remapping tools.

I was really shocked by the Mission 2. Some interesting enemies and the really hard boss (for me in that period lol). Also I am really moved by the story between Dante and his brother Vergil. This game companyed me for nearly 10 years and thanks to it, I met a bunch of good friends. I bought it from steam store just to in memory these good days.10/10			"

												Although the controls were bad, and the frames would drop sometimes (Mostly when there are more than 3 enemies fighting you), this game was still very good. But I just had one issue with the game that annoyed me. I played with a Xbox 360 controller and had I tons of trouble setting it up. My keyboard controls would be transferred to the Xbox controllers buttons which made it really confusing and hard to play, but once I did it was smooth sailing from there. Good story, good characters, and great boss fights. Devil May Cry 3 may have annoying controls but over time you will get used to them and enjoy the game.			"

												What should I say about this port that hasn't been said already? It's unreliable. Glitchy. Broken. Basically nonfunctional.Devil May Cry 3 is one of the most critically acclaimed action games to ever exist, and its PC port is more akin to some early 2000s Hentai JRPG frontloader. BUUUUUUT the Style Switcher mod actually fixes these problems while adding some optional goodies, so... Game itself = As stylish as it gets PC port = Less appealing than anything Jason Friedberg or Aaron Seltzer has♥♥♥♥♥♥outPC port + Style Switcher = Sh*t's so stylish it makes you grow a beard.Also, DO NOT LAUNCH CONTROLLER CONFIGURATION AFTER YOU'VE INSTALLED STYLE SWITCHER, ♥♥♥♥ING DON'T.

												A very good game poisoned by Ubisoft's and Sourcenext's desire for money and laziness.+Combat.+Music that fits the game's style+Challenging bosses+Actually the story is quite strong with this one (compared to the others)+Action at its finest (cutscenes too)-♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, so bad that the music and sound effects make the game lag-Sometimes it passes the level of challenging and becomes unfair (khm...I'm looking at you Nevan)-You can only carry 2 melee weapons and 2 gunsIn overall: Could be a very good game if it wouldn't be such a bad port. But if you don't mind doing some work to make the game work (widescreen and controller support and decrease the lag), then buy it on a sale, because it's a really enjoyable one. But next year is DMC's 15th birthday and this game's 10th one, soooo...could we get a better rerelease with widescreen and proper controller support with achies and other useful stuff, Capcom?			"

												Well, this is awkward.In case you live under a rock, Devil May Cry 3 is an excellent game, and the Special Edition is a gem among spectacle fighters. However, this port is completely unacceptable. Japanese video game companies aren't exactly known for great first attempts at PC porting, and Capcom is no exception. They DID more than make up for it with DMC4 and DmC, with the PC ports being the superior versions of the game, but this is one I can't whole-heartedly recommend. If you picked up the DmC Complete Pack, you basically got this one for free, but since that bundle no longer seems to exist, I can't recommend this, especially not as a single purchase. Unless you're one of the PC Master Race and refuse to own even what is possibly the best console of all time, drop by a GameStop and pick this game up from a used games bin, for a better experience and a much more reasonable asking price. The Steam version of DMC3:SE should only be an absolute last resort.			"

												Let me say one thing first: The game itself is excellent.However, this port of it is one of the worst things I've ever tried to play.The game launches at 860x480 and crashes if you try to change that.A standard Xbox 360 USB controller isn't supported by default so you have to rebind all the controls. However, something is wrong with how the game detects your inputs, which results in you having to control your movements with the right analog stick while needing A, B, X and Y for combat.So overall, I'd say get this game on console and avoid this heap of trash.

I also can not close this game out without bringing up my Task Manager which is fun.The default controls for my gamepad are completely screwed up and totally backwards from the original scheme. without even going into the game itself, this is one of the most poorly handled ports I've ever seen to the point where it's literally UNPLAYABLE.Avoid this at all costs and buy DMC4 Special Edition instead.

												Devil May Cry 3... the king of the hack and slash games and arguably the prime of the series for its insane yet fun difficulty and its skill based gameplay. Unfortunately however this port to the PC is an insult to this legendary game from its god awful controller layout where community members have to manually add their own layout fixes to this lazy port and along with that at  times crappy frame rate issues have occured regardless of how powerful my pc is. For those new to the series PLEASE do not buy this port! I highly recommened instead buying it either for the PS2 or the HD collection for the XBOX 360/PS3 to see how amazing this game really is.EDIT 16/01/15: A mod called ""style switcher"" for this PC port has literally fixed almost every issue completely, it makes the game look 10 times better with fog and gamma fixes, fixing the terrible controller button layout, 1080p support (making it sharper and more crisp than the HD collections DMC 3) and widescreen, even allowing you to switch styles with both Dante and Vergil just like in Devil May Cry 4!!! Unfortunately however the framerate issue still applies, but this can be fixed by removing a select amount of audio files (but that means less badassery during combat :c).If you ever (though i'd still not recommend this crappy port) decide to get this PC port please mod it with the style switcher mod!

												It's a good game but, not the best port. I strongly recommend using a 360 controller of some gamepad. You do unfortuantly have to mod the game by changling the controller script to make the triggers work. But after that it's solid. it's the special edition version so you get a few extra not seen in the original ps2 version. I would reccomend the console hd collection over this. but if a pc is all you got then this isn't a bad place to start in the Devil May Cry Series.			"

This game is amazing and it gets a well deserved 9 out of 10 if you enjoy stylish and fast paced action with awsome characters and that Anime feel then surely you will enjoy this awsome game.			"

												Its a really bad port runs worse then a emulator you cant full screen or at least I and other people cant with out spamming alt+enter and bad controler support. You need to actually fix the game youre self by going to sites most common things need fixing-the music becuase for some reason the way they handled it the music makes the game run bad-another thing to fix is the full screen so it actually goes to full screen by its self-lastly fixing the contoler becuase it wont work with a 360 controler.There may be more things that need fixing I think I heard theres some graphical bugs like no lightning and ect...So my last thoughts are just play this on a console or emulate it Becuase it would be easyer and and better.

												Does not work properly. No native controller support, you have to use 3rd party software to make it work, not to mention messing around with the game's ini file to set the controllers right. No native support for modern wide-screens, you have to download a 3rd party patch for that as well. I have also read about issues where the game's fps drops dramatically, where your only solution is deleting a significant number of sound files. Sadly, I never got to see those fps issues.I started the game, it looked like crap, the sound was off, and my Sabertooth was not detected at all.Not to say the computer didn't detect it, I had no problem using Steam's 'Big Picture', but, the game simply refuses to work with it.I tried to use solutions from the forum, sadly, I lack knowladge in controllers and thus it is a bit complicated for me. Amongs things I could not understand, is the fact that ControlMK did not show me which key was which, and those that know Sabertooth, know that it has, in it's full configuration, 16 keys, not including the two analog sticks, and the 4 directional buttons on the left lower side.Left with not enough guidance, and no background knowladge of my own, I am forced to give this game up.

People actually recommend to pirate this game (though I refuse to do it and in no way suggest it) as the files include a fix for the numerous issues this port has, and people also suggested to me to emulate this game's playstation 2 edition because even when emulated it runs better and more stable than this port.This makes me sad.

												This game tells the story of the sons of Sparda and Eva, Vergil and Dante.And true to its' franchise, Devil May Cry 3 did not disappoint one bit in the hack and slash bit. Indeed, it set the baseline for what should be termed as a proper hack and slash game. Its' successors madse this game's legacy stand out for its' hellish difficulty and a story that left many loyal to the franchise.Maybe Capcom should've reworked Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition from scratch with a better engine instead of the crap that was DmC: Devil May Cry.

												Let's have a look on one of Capcons most action loaded games Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition for the PC.Platform: PCPublisher: UbisoftDeveloper: CapcomGenre: Fantasy Action AdventureRelease Date: Oct 16, 2006Story: The story so far plays earlier than the orginal Devil May Cry game for the PS2. Its's about the half devil Dante Sparda who tries once again to save the world from the influence of the devil possesed Arkhamand his horde of undead creatures from hell. In this game there is also some very cool new character introduced named Vergil Sparda who is actually Dantes evil twinbrother and most fearsome foe.Virgil works together with Arkham in order to open the gate of hell which was closed long years ago by Dantes father the legandary Devil Knight Sparda. So Dante starts his journey to climb up the unholy tower of evil called ""The Temen-Ni-Gru"" which is summoned by Arkham in order to connect the human world to the demon world. On his way up he crosses lines with a strange woman called Lady who tries to shoot him on sight.The whereabouts of the Temen-Ni-Gru as well as the identity of lady seem very dark and unclear. What the end offers... i can't tell, just play to find out :D 8/10Gameplay: DMC3-Se is a third perspective fantasy action adventure which combines very fast gameplay with lots of combos and various puzzles throughout the game. The fighting system is devided in ""styles"" whichDante can switch between Missions and also level them up to perform even greater combos. There are also special obiects called orbs to collect as well as a very great varaety of fire and melee weapons throughout the game. 8/10Controls: This is one of the main problems with the PC version of DMC3-Se because its totally bugged and you need a patch in order to convert the right keyboard comands to some gamepad. 4/10Graphic: This is unfortunately another minus for the PC port as you will see some graphics in ingame arent drawn very correctly as the PS2 version and also some parts of the game seem pretty greyscale due to the direct X output of your PC, nevertheless the FMV movies are really great. 7/10Sound: I have to mention that the sound is absoluty awesome. DMC3-Se brings some very good soundtrack and very nice soundsamples combined with very thrilling metal music. 9/10My Review: First of all I have to say that I have played only the PC version of DMC3-Se hench I am writting this review for the PC version of that great game.The game starts right of in Dantes office with one of the most impressive and action loaded FMV movies I saw so far. After the nice introducing of the control tutorial you are directly thrown into action to kick some demon butts. You will learn very fast the combos and special attacks if you play the first time through this game. Actually you can change between 4 styles called Trickster, Gunslinger, Royal Guard and Swordmaster. As the names describe, each style is bound to some very cool and unique special attack and combos. For example if you like using long range weapons than you can choose Gunslinger for improving your shoot abillities but if you prefer short range you can go along with Swordmaster. All in one I really liked the style system and the idea of combining different styles. So after you have killed tons of demons and alot of other evil guys you will be introduced step by step through very cool FMV movies to the story of this game which is in my opinion really great. The game is divided in 20 Missions, and you will come across some very cool and though bosses, one remarcable of them will be Dantes twinbrother Virgil who actually seems to interfere with Dante on purpose. The boss fights are one big plus in this game because they really deliever some thrilling and decent difficulty (at least if you play on very hard or Dante must die mode). What I really liked about this game is the character developement its really different from DMC2 which was... to put it bluntly ""it sucked"". I would generally say that the difficulty in this game is fair and really depends on what scale you play. I beat this game on hard mode in 9 hours but some other guys sure need between 15 - 20 hours. Also after beating the entire game you can unlock Vergil as a playable character, and this is included in the Special edition only as well as some other nice feature I will mention beneath.So what are the differences between the original Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening and Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition you may ask ?Well here they are:Difficulties:- Easy mode- Hard mode - Very Hard mode- Dante Must Die mode- Heaven or Hell modePlayable Character:- ""Vergil"" is playable after beating the game once with Dante. He brings his own uniqe styles as well as flying swords as his long range weapons.Extra Mode:- ""Bloody Palace"" is available after beating the game once with Dante, its some kind of battle arena where you are thrown in with a limited supply of orbs and must fight random enemies and bosses.Extra Outfits:- 4 new costumes for Vergil unlockable- 6 new outfits for Dante unlockableGallery:-you can unlock diverse Artwork and CGI work form DMC3 hereDemo Digest:- You can preview all Ingame Movies from here- There is also some timelimit in the end of the game where you can beat 100 enemies in order to unlock a hidden endingMiscellaneous:- There are different locations in the game where you know can fight Jester (its that annoying clown BTW)- Lady wears some fency new suit depending on the outfit you choose in Ingame- There is a yellow and gold option at the beginning of the game which allows to use the yellow orbs as restore point after dieing.These are the differences available in the Special Edition of DMC3 as well for the PS2 version as for the PC version which was only released as the Special edition by the way.FInal Words: DMC3 SE sure is some special game for fans of the Devil May Cry series as well as for action fans who like fast and flashy gamplay combined with metal music and gothic ambience. I was very pleased about the importation of this game to the PC and really forgot fast about the undeveloped control settings which is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥indeed for people who wants to play the PC version on a gamepad. All I can say is that you should stick with the PS2 version if you are a die hard fan of DMC as for me I also liked the PC version therefore I give this game a 7 out of 10.Endrating: 7/10			"

												Definitely. Add a SSS to that ''Definitely'' if you see the price drop. A word of caution, if you have a XBOX controller, there are HIGH chances of it not working.Devil May Cry 3 is nothing short of genius and none of it gets ruined by the horrible port (considering there is a guide towards multiple fixes in the forums). The numerous weapons and styles guarantees a playstyle up your alley, and difficulty gets cranked to insane levels, bosses to dream for, enemies to punish, loveable characters, some mods are even available on the PC version and, well, it's nothing short of being one of my favourite game.Now go kick♥♥♥♥♥and chew bubblegum.

												So Devil May Cry 3 is a game I played a long time ago on the ps2, and I played the original. The original was much harder as the medium difficulty for that game was the hard for this version of the game. Somehow I beat the game and it was fantastic. Sadly this pc port was done by, get a vomit bucket, Ubisoft. As we all know, anything Ubisoft touches usually gets destroyed, and that is exactly what happened to this pc port. The controls don't work, the right stick controls the movement which is impossible to play with, the game has no support for widescreen moniters, it has a max resolution of 1280x720. Now these issues make the game unplayable. However thanks to the amazing mod authors, all of these issues are fixed with 1 simple mod, Style Switcher. Style switcher fixes the game to allow all resolutions, fixes the controls, makes the game compatible with most widescreen moniters, and it even allows the ability to switch styles with the dpad just like dmc4! It requires a few ini tweaks but overall is easy to install. The game itself is fantastic, theres no question about that, but the main reason this game has downvotes is because of the port, which is all fixed with this mod. So if you want to play dmc3, buy this, get the mod, and play one of the hardest, most rewarding, and one of the best games on ps2.			"

												As much as I love Devil May Cry 3, the PC version is absolutely unplayable. I've spent hours trying to get this game to run correctly, trying every solution I've found online and nothing has worked. One thing every game needs in order to be played is a proper control system. With the six different programs I've downloaded to run this one game with a Playstation 3 controller, I can finally use my four basic buttons, but having to use the right analog stick to move Dante and the left analog stick to move the camera is torturous. I found myself using the right analog stick with my left thumb just to be able to move around. I understand that this game is old and has never worked right, but if Valve is to sucker people like me out of their money for it 9 years later, I think it's about time it got fixed. I wish I could get my money and all the time invested into trying to get the game to work properly back. If you want to play this game, you're much better off buying the PS2 version, but whatever you do, do NOT buy this horrible PC version.			"

												It is difficult to say whether I would recommend this. It is a fun game but with some quite severe issues. I'm not convinced that it is enough fun to outweigh the problems. This is a very shoddy console port with the controller arbitrarily mapped to the keyboard without any thought about how it might play. You can remap them but you can't use the mouse. Eventually with help from the forums I managed to configure enough of the controls to a controller for it to be playable. Once I got the game working the difficulty of this game is horrible and the button combos for special moves terrible. Eventually once you have died a few times it unlocks easy mode. Only at this point does the game become fun. It has an enjoyable story and excellent level design. Dante manages to come across as confidently awesome where it would have been very easy to be arrogant and hateable. So whether you buy this game or not depends upon you think it is worth the rigmarole of getting it up and running.			"

												I think it says something that even with a terrible port job the gameplay still shines. (this ain't a review of the game, just a bad port warning)There isn't native gamepad support because this is an old PC port. You can still play with a keyboard and you can get a gamepad eventually working. But there is one glaring problem with this port. There is a bug in the sound engine that makes certain noises cause frame rate drops. You can avoid this by deleting sound files.... but it's pretty ludicrous to have to play the game with muted sounds.If there was a way to fix that sound glitch without needing to remove the files then I could recommend it, but as of right now  (and the forseeable future) DO NOT GET THIS PORT. Pick up DmC HD Collection on PS3/360 instead.			"

												IMHO its criminal to sell this game in its current state and Steam owes me money. Here are all the problems: no fullscreen, choppy music, terrible/nonexistent keyboard controls (you literally can't navigate the menu w/ a keyboard), and ONLY three crappy resolution options. Oh but we aren't done, there's more to this crapshoot. Once you do get a controller to play this game, you better hope you got a PS3 controller, otherwise you have to manually edit files in the game to get an Xbox 360 controller working--but guess what! This still won't solve the control problems! The camera controls are nearly nonexistent. R3 snaps the camera to Dante's back, sometimes. Terrain/walls/obstacles within a level will stop the camera in its tracks whether you're using R3 or the stick itself (which pans the camera at a snail's pace). In a notoriously difficult game, this is unacceptable since you will be getting attacked offscreen. Yeah, it only cost me a few dollars, but I'd have been better off using my money as fuel for a fire. Do yourself a favor and tell Capcom how unacceptable this is with your wallet by staying far away from this terrible experience.			"

												Unless you have a controller that works with this game, do not even attempt it. the default controls for the camera are the arrow keys, and you cannot bind them to the mouse, neither can you bind attacking to the mouse. As of combat, it's 1 button to rule them all, why use anything besides your sword attack, if the only other attack you have is weak guns, only used for maintaining your combo, or your ""style"" attack, which does barely anything. And for those of you who say, ""well this dante is better than the one in DMC"", I do not see much difference, except that this dante in fact, does not even care about anything, his emotions feel faked, he's not even a prick, who is like ""oh you stepped on my pizza, now I'm mad"", but he's like ""oh you stepped on my pizza, this party is gonna be good"". What kind of response is that?Also, even if you get a controller working, the spaces and invisible walls your camera has to deal with, make an overview of the battlefield impossible. For once, I think an AAA sequel of a game has been better than the old ones.Oh, something popped up in my mind, this game is made for square screen resolutions. You can press alt+enter to enter fullscreen mode, but if your pixels turn rectangly where they should be square, this is not an improvement. So please, for the love of your wallet, do not buy this.

												There is no doubt that this is one of the worst ports I have ever seen in my life, but the game is also one of the best I have ever played in my life. Devil May Cry 3 is really difficult game not to mention that this is the Special Edition which came out in order to be easier. I agree with everyone else that it is almost impposible to play this game on PC but if you have a cotroller and if you get thorugh the problems that this port delievers you will enjoy the hardship that this game will make you go thorugh, even so it is recommended that you play this game on the PS2 version its without a doubt the superior version. I am as a DMC fan can't describe of how amazing this game is and even tough I knew about the problems with the port I just had to buy it and its worth it because the game is plain AWESOME			"

												This is in my opinion, the best Devil May Cry in the serie, the problem is the port, the game is almost unplayble with a wireless 360 controller except if you do some changes to it but even so, In my opinion, for a ''Special Edition'' It should be better than that, more screen resolution choices would be great too.Despite this game being great, the ''Special Edition'' isn't that great, for a remake at least.They could have done it better.9.5/10 for the game itself.4.5/10 for the port.I'd still recommend this game though cause it is a really great game and it works.

												Let me get this out of the way. I love Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. It is a fantastic hack n'slash game that I can recommend to anyone. However, don't get the PC version because of the controller compatibility issues. Any regular controller, like for example a logitech gamepad, the game will say that the controller import is not compatible with the game. The button layout that the game expects you to use as the default control settings is beyond terrible. Now you can map the buttons on the controller for different commands, but the game does not recognize the left and right triggers as buttons. The only way to make your controller sync up with Devil May Cry 3 is to download a program like Xpadder and customize your own default controls setting and then sync that to the game. The thing is you'll have to shell out $10.00 to download Xpadder. So that will be the determining factor if you want to by the game or not. Personally, I'd get any other version of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition over the PC version.			"

The game is prone to utterly random lag even on a PC capable of playing 2011 level AAA titles on full settings.Legitimately, if you have a decent PC by 2014 standards, it's actually better to play this game through a PS2 emulator.

												I've been wanting to play a Devil May Cry game for a really long time, but couldn't because of my religious parents. So when I saw the PC port, I put it on my wishlist because I've only heard good things about DMC and I love Dante's wit and sarcasm.I should have read the reviews first, and then removed it so that my good friends didn't waste their money getting it for me. I can't tell if having a gamepad or a controller would have made any difference or not. I spent the first, probably, 15-20 minutes trying to figure out what keys did what, and then trying to configure them to what could best suit me. But it was futile.This port is beyond unplayable in the state it's in right now, at least for me(I don't know about anyone else). It wouldn't even let me past the ""Style Selection"" menu because when I'd press 3 to select, it would just move the cursor down the list of fighting styles. I gave up. I'm probably never going to be able to play this game unless Capcom and Steam release an updated, BETTER, port because of the ""sensitive"" nature of the game. At least I was given 3 and 4, and from what I've read, 4 is at least an okay port. I'm very disappointed in the lack of effort that was clearly put into this release, though.TL;DR: Don't buy the port unless you're good at coding and are willing to dig deep and research how to make this game dance for you. Buy the DMC HD collection instead if you can get the platform for it. "

												I love DmC:3.  I love the Gold edition to play around as Vergil.  I love the music and, despite the games plot always being ridiculous and hammy, this is one of the better plots I could get invested in (though I haven't completed 4 yet so my opinion might change....""might"" ).*clears throat* ...with that said; I love the game (on PS2 or PS3).  This port to the steam (currently) is NON-PLAYABLE (unless you PC players are truly experts on playing action games like this on a Keyboard and don't mind wearing out or breaking your keys).  So far, it doesn't matter what Gamepad you are using; I've tried the PC Microsoft Xbox controller and using a gamepad program to make my PS3 and PS2 controller work on my comptuer (and I have made it work for several games without problems INCLUDING some where I had to custom input the functions for each buttons)...but it is STILL UNPLAYABLE.  Most of the functionatlly still works; the sword/gun/jump/camera/taunt/tricks button can still be used properly and rearranged on the game's setup screen like normal,,,but the Analog sticks DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY.That's the only real problem at this time (which is why I can't comment on anything else graphical or compatibile-wise because I'm stuck in level 1).  The left analog stick does NOT function at all for this game.  For some reason you have to move with the right stick; but even if THAT functioned correctly I don't think most players could play this game at all like this.  And it's STILL bad because the only thing you can do to move is either left or right (or just up or down).  Either way; you can NOT move properly to enjoy playing this port.I'm not officially ready to say this Port SUCKS, because I am REALLY hoping Valve/Steam team are getting feedback like this and tell them they need to fix/patch the control schemes if anyone is to ever play this port at all.  Otherwise; for now until they do so, Do NOT purchase this game unless you more of a game collector building up your library.(To note: I have read some of the Steam user's guides to set-up your gamepad controller for it to work properly and said they had success...but I've tried and retried several times and I don't think the Game itself will register it at all, only keeping to what it's currently control functions are...which is crap.  Also, the port does come with a Gamepad Config that will NOT RECOGNIZE the Xbox controller...it recognized my PS controller, but nothing was accomplished as I hoped.  Plus, there is a option to switch/Reverse the L and R analog sticks...but it didn't do anything at all! ).			"

												The PC version of this game is riddled with problems. Flat out? It does not work out of the box. You're gonna have to fight against issues with nonfunctional default controls which need much remapping, to say nothing of the total lack of functionality with the 360 pad, which I have to imagine is the most commonly used controller among PC users. The game plays in a windowed mode by default.... a VERY tiny window. The list goes on. I've no doubt that those who take the time to get it into a functional state will enjoy it, but don't spend 20 dollars on this unless you REALLY want a project on your hands... or you hate money and want revenge on it or something. Filthy, filthy money... grr...			"

												Let me get this out of the way. I love Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. It is a fantastic hack n'slash game that I can recommend to anyone. However, don't get the PC version because of the controller compatibility issues. Any regular controller, like for example a logitech gamepad, the game will say that the controller import is not compatible with the game. The button layout that the game expects you to use as the default control settings is beyond terrible. Now you can map the buttons on the controller for different commands, but the game does not recognize the left and right triggers as buttons. The only way to make your controller sync up with Devil May Cry 3 is to download a program like Xpadder and customize your own default controls setting and then sync that to the game. The thing is you'll have to shell out $10.00 to download Xpadder. So that will be the determining factor if you want to by the game or not. Personally, I'd get any other version of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition over the PC version.			"

												UPDATE: It seems the first link and second link for the joystick support in my review died. Look in the DMC3 Guide. Control fix is below in Update 2.UPDATE 2:  MotionInJoy setupIf you have a PS3 controller and MotionInJoy you can play this by choosing a custom profile and assigning:L stick x+ to Ry+L stick x- to Ry-L stick y+ to Rz+L stick y- to Rz-R stick x+ to Slider+R stick x+ to Slider-Do this and you'll have analogue movement and camera rotation!Anyways, I don't believe this is a bad port. If people tried resarching a little more you can get the werid and bad controls corrected.It's a great game overall though, I have it on ps2 but I got it on the PC sense I am not sure where my PS2 DMC3 Copy went off too. It's great to play this game again. But all I can say it's not a bad port, With a little research and mods to the game it will help correct it.			"

												Many people are saying the port is awful for controllers, but are simply too lazy to look in the discussion page for this game to search for a fix, so I'll ignore that.The keyboard controls for this game can be easily found by going into the options and looking at the controls as well. Not only that, but they work just fine, so ignore the idiots that are too lazy to solve problems and just write an angry review after 10 minutes.About the actual game, the port has some problems with some lag in a few areas. It's not excessive lag that will affect gameplay, but it will slow down the game for a second. One spot I can think of off the top of my head is the area on Mission 7 where you have to jump down to enter the library. I noticed slightly more lag with Vergil, but again, it did not affect areas where I was actually fighting enemies. There are also fixes for the lag if it seems like it's actually affecting your gameplay, so again, if you plan on getting this game, take a couple minutes to look for some common questions and answers. It's a good game and you don't need a console to play it, so there's no point in throwing a hissy-fit when you encounter small problems with the port. "

Unfortunately it's unbelieveable at how half♥♥♥♥♥this port to pc was. I know about the mods and fan made patches out there, but that doesn't automatically make it ok that this port is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Having to rely on your customers to fix your game is unacceptable. If you're looking at playing this for the first time, I suggest going for the original ps2 version or just go for the HD collection.

												The game itself is amazing, one of my favourites in fact, but unfortunately this port is borderline unplayable. If you want to play it, get it on console, unless you fancy downloading god knows how many mods, and fiddling with the terrible UI so you can actually map the controls to something that doesn't require a third hand.I highly recommend DMC 3, but I do not recommend this version. For the love of all that is holy, get it on console.			"

												I'm sure this game was good on console back in its day, but this is the epitome of terrible PC ports. You have to input custom configs into the game files just to get the buttons to work with modern controllers (because the keyboard controls are a joke), and even then, you need to get a program like Xpadder to manually map the L and R buttons because the game doesn't recognize them. On top of that, it is poorly optimized and gets random lag spikes for seemingly no reason. Do not buy this game.			"

												I love this game and the series since DMC1 which is the best one in my opinion, a timeless classic no doubt. (DMC2 is not real and never happened for me). And while this is a good game sadly this port is not.This port has many many issues and it can't be fixed even with the Style Switcher Mod, and is a real shame since this could have been the best version ever, the framerate is unstable in many parts and the recommended fix is to delete some music files which I find preposterous to call that a real fix.The game stutters (and no, it's not your computer) the audio system is broken, many of the effects like when you swing the sword around sound a lot worse than the PS2 version and even the music, and I haven't even mention the sound crackling, plus no real controller support and then you need edit a config file to add your pad manually or download 3rd party stuff just to use the triggers to change guns on the fly, which is something I never had to do ever before in my 20 years playing games on PC.Now let's talk about graphics, yes technically with a mod you can play the game at any resolution you want which is a huge advantage over the console versions, but taking into account the bad performance and that the game is missing a lot of visual effects, for example it has no shaders or colour correction, so you lose the original atmosphere of the game, no dynamic shadows just generic blobs, no depth of field or bloom, NO v-sync, weird and worse quality textures compared to the PS2 version., or that the game crashes from time to time, you might start to understand why I hate this port and I don't recommend it, there's even some bugs that are exclusive to the PC version like one that can make you lose thousands of orbs, or that the game can randomly  corrupt your saves. In conclusion this port is bad,  this is not the case where you install 1 or 2 mods and the game runs completely flawlessly. It seems like Nothing can get rid of the framedrops NOTHING who cares if you can run the game at 60fps if in many random parts you will see your framerate drop to 20 or 40 for no reason. I don't know about the others but I'm pretty sensible to stutter and framedrops. And This is not acceptable for a such a good game.I wish Capcom would step up and port the HD collection like their last ports which have been received positively but it's highly unlikely to happen.If you want to play the game, They're other better ways to enjoy this game Like running the original PS2 version on PCSX2 if you know how to configure it or grabbing the HD Collection if you have a PS3/XBOX360 around.

												I do love DMC and have probably clocked well above week's worth of gameplay on the PS2. It really a great action title that's just great for those looking for a challenge, But I cannot reccomend this version if you are not willing to remove files such as the battle music and fiddle with a .ini to get a modern controller working just right with the game. I already have a PS2 copy to play still so I think I'll just live with that. If you do not have a console and insist on playing this game just know there will be a few hoops to jump through to get this game at it's peak and that it may never be quite as great as it is on a console, you can check out it's entry on the PC Gaming wiki to find all the fixes and links to certain mods to make your time easier,And while I don't care for these mods as I wish to play the game vanilla, there does seem to be mods which add to the gameplay such as giving Dante his style switch system from DMC4 that also happens to add a FoV option.

												Devil May Cry 3 Special Edition is a fun game, with well developed characters, a great story, challenging puzzles and awesome gameplay and battles. However I did not like this version of the game, pc over XBox 360, due to the difficult controls and movement. I prefer the Devil May Cry HD Collection for the XBox 360 over the PC version simply due to the easier controls, movement, and camera angles. This game also has the issue of starting out with a small screen instead of fullscreen, if you want the fullscreen you have to change the resolution. Now this isn't much of an issue but it is an annoyance that shouldn't even exist. With the HD Collection for the 360, you get the first three DMC games for about $20, instead of spending close to $40 here on Steam for each individual game. If you're looking for a really good hackin' slash, action packed game look no further than DMC 3 SE!			"

Unless your willing to invest around an hour changing things in order to play the game correctly. Controllers are barely supported. The right and left triggers are not recognized in the game, so you need a program that allows you to configure those triggers to keyboard buttons in order to switch your weapons in game, unless you want to press (Q) or (E) to switch your weapons mid game. tl;dr - Amazing game. Terrible port. Don't buy unless you're willing to spend around an hour to get the game functioning correctly.			"

												This game is a broken port of the console version. Very badly made without thinking from the perspective of the PC player control ergonomics either using keyboard or gamepad.GRAPHICSThe graphics are typical of the older Play Station games (think of Resident Evil 2 and 3, except that background buildings are also in 3D). It's dated for 2015, but nothing sinful from when it was originally released.But the sinful thing in here is that there is no fullscreen mode. It can only be viewed in windowed mode. Max resolution is at 1600x1200. (Even DOS games has fullscreen).SOUNDIt's ok. From the intro to the rock tunes of the (in-game) broken jukebox, it does fine. Positional audio was not used.CONTROLSIt's a bad port mainly because the control scheme is unbearably bad... keyboard or XBox controller.With the keyboard, you can configure the key map. The problem with using the keyboard is that [Jump] is reflected as [Style Action]. Pressing [Style Action] is still [Style Action]. I can't make Dante jump.Buttons can also be configured with the XBox controller... except for the directional movement which is unfortunately placed to the Right analog stick. Forget about no rumble feature. I just want to move the character properly, which I can't.GAMEPLAYIt has a lot of potential and I can feel that this could have been a good game. Camera control poorly done as well, though. I can only reset the camera view to it's default location. I can't do anything else with it.OVERALLI can't even play it, so I can't recommend it at all. The DMC franchise has gone a long way, but unless they've made the controls better, it is probably best to play the older parts of the franchise in the console rather than the PC.			"

Guns are also are also good but not to po like the whure in DMC2 Dante also has 4 new styles Trickster,Swordmaster,Gunslinger and Royalguard he also get's 2 bonus styles Quicksilver and Doppelganger Ko now let me explain what each style does 1.Trickster alous Dante to preform faste doges by pressing the B butten it can also teleport you to enemys2.Swordmaster Gives evry mailai wepen a secondeary attack3.Gunslinger gives evry gun a secondary attack4.Royalguard let you pery attack5.Quicksilver slows down time6.and doppelganger is prety self explanetoryThe level disain is also realy good and whail it's all in the same casel it stil not dull or boringThe bosses are realy hard but never unfair (get gud) my favourit are the Vergil boss fights the 1st one is not that hard but the other to defenetly are the music it good but i wish ther was a litel bit moer veraiteOverall 9/10			"

												Question time:Did Capcom mess up by making a bad port? - Yes, royally!Did they have a brain fart when they made Devil May Cry: HD Collection only for X360 & PS3? - Yes, but that's just my opinion.Is this game worth buying? - YES! YES! AND F***ING YES!!!BUT:Be ready to spend less than 2 hours (or less than that), just to make it compatible with your controller and to enable Widescreen support. Feel free to work out the Style Switcher mod too. It was the second time I bought this game, because the first time I refunded it and didn't want to deal with the fixes. However, I thought of giving it another shot, so I purchased it while it was on sale and...It's totally worth it in the end! Two things I love about this game: the gameplay and the soundtrack. It makes your blood pump and really feel the action. The story is compelling, even for a game that focuses more on action.You will not regret the time spent on making those fixes. Check out the Steam discussions forums or other forums and you will find your answers right away.			"

												Question time:Did Capcom mess up by making a bad port? - Yes, royally!Did they have a brain fart when they made Devil May Cry: HD Collection only for X360 & PS3? - Yes, but that's just my opinion.Is this game worth buying? - YES! YES! AND F***ING YES!!!BUT:Be ready to spend less than 2 hours (or less than that), just to make it compatible with your controller and to enable Widescreen support. Feel free to work out the Style Switcher mod too. It was the second time I bought this game, because the first time I refunded it and didn't want to deal with the fixes. However, I thought of giving it another shot, so I purchased it while it was on sale and...It's totally worth it in the end! Two things I love about this game: the gameplay and the soundtrack. It makes your blood pump and really feel the action. The story is compelling, even for a game that focuses more on action.You will not regret the time spent on making those fixes. Check out the Steam discussions forums or other forums and you will find your answers right away.			"

												YES this is a bad port. YES this is a great game. YES I've played so much...AND YES I would recommend this.Most people who give this game a negative review simply did not put any effort to learn how to play.There are not really any performance issues windows 7, even without mods.The biggest problem is that it is extremely difficult to play without a controller (I personally use the keyboard... because)If you don't want to bother learning to play, then don't buy.If you are motivated and want to experience a great game on the PC instead of PS2, then go ahead and buy, you won't regret it.Also, important note: There is NO Mouse support. It's either all keyboard or all controller.			"

I simply gave up tring to make the Xbox 360 controller work. Just buy a PS2 USB adaptor end play with PS2 controls (with the Controller Patch). But then again, we are talking DMC3, probably the best in the series yet. The only game to come close to Ninja Gaiden Sigma 1 and 2 in fast and hardcore gameplay. Great Game!			"

												Devil May Cry 3 SE isn't a perfect port.  In fact I'd say it is pretty bad.  But a bad port doesn't make for a bad game.  Thankfully with mods like the excellent Style Switcher, DMC3 is made a whole lot better.  If you are looking for a CUHRAAAAYYZEE spectacle fighter, this is a good place to start.  You could always buy the console version second-hand of course. P.S. Style Switcher is very configurable and you can re-enable the music and cutscenes. I suggest you do.			"

												Probably one of the best hack and slash games I've ever played. While the game is a dreadful PC port, the game is excellent. Everything holds up really well, especially the combat. While the game is old, the combat rivals most modern hack and slash games, it's that good. The story is kind of dumb at first, but gets better as the game progresses. The graphics aren't bad, especially for the time. The soundtrack is an alt-rock/metal type which fits in perfectly with what's going on in the game. If your going to play this game, use a playstation 2,  3, or 4 controller, because playing with a keyboard is impossible and trying to get an xbox controller to work with the game is too much work.Raw Score: 9/10Score with bad port factored in: 7.5/10If you can look past the port issues, you'll love this game.

												Devil May Cry 3 is probably my favourite action/hack n slash game of all time.  I had the special edition on the ps 2 about 9 years ago, and i loved it like a small angel that fell from heaven.This port, however, is a worthless, broken and disgraceful sham.  If you've got a console, get the Devil May Cry HD edition instead.  If, like me, your a solo pc gamer, there's no way to get the full goodness of this game, even with all the mods.First, the controls are broken.  You can kind of get it to work with mods, but as far as i'm aware you can't get the shoulder buttons (lt and rt) to work, and you actually need them.  I also couldn't get my second analog stick to work the camera, which makes the game most unenjoyable as you can't adjust the camera manually.  I could kind of deal with that, but...The framerate is awful.  This is a 2005 ps2 game which stutters and grinds down to abysmal rates on a PC that easily handles Skyrim.  You can fix it by deleting select audion files, apparantly, but left with the choice of losing audio or tolerating a crappy framerate, i choose to just uninstall it and leave my memories untarnished.If you've got a console, get the HD collection. You might also want to try Devil May Cry 4, which is a much better and all round pretty sweet PC port (though sadly an inferior game),  If you get this on pc, be aware that you are buying a woefully grim port of classic.

												While I am a huge fan of the Devil May Cry series, the simple fact that this version has such lackluster control makes it worth collecting purely for a completionist. The story is still good, and the game itself is as enchanting as the console versions - but the partial controller support is a big pain in the butt. Not to mention all of the mods you would need to download, figure out, and install just to put it on the same level as Devil May Cry 4 in terms of playability. All in all, a great game bogged down by poor redesign and an incomplete transition to modern PCs. If you don't have the patience for mods - and unless someone has the kindness and time to put together everything into one, easy-to-handle package - you're better off with the console versions.			"

												Stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing game on the planet. First of all. every time you turn on the game, theres a ♥♥♥♥ing movie your not allowed to skip. Secondly, the controls are ♥♥♥♥ed. The default setting controls make no sense whatsoever - jumping is NOT the A button, and the camera is your left control stick and movement is the right control stick, making it ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to control anything. Then even if you go try to change the controls, your not allowed to switch the two sticks, and you have to take half an hour to decode their labelling system of the ♥♥♥♥ing buttons - instead of using the universally accepted A, B, X, Y, or any of the buttons from any other commonly used controller, their buttons are labelled 1 to 11. And since your not allowed to use the triggers on the controller, theres only 10 buttons on the ♥♥♥♥ing controller, so I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ button 11 is. Do NOT waste your money on this game unless you intend to somehow play it with a keyboard, in which case my personal opinion is that you're insane.			"

												So before anything I need to say I played this game on PS2. In my opinion, this is the best Devil May Cry. The difficulty, the story, amazingly stylish gameplay and the most important part of this is Dante. He is so cool and likable, also Vergil is great character and fighting him for me is one of the best fights in the game. BUT!!!!! Like I said I refunded this because I couldn't get it to work (resolution, controller support etc.). But on the other hand, I didn't try hard enough to fix it all. I'm sure IT IS POSSIBLE to get this to work on PC and it's definitely worth going the extra mile for it. So all in all. If you are ready to work around all of these issues with this port and try to fix it BUY IT. If you are like me and can't stand going and fixing stuff you just bought and downloaded DON'T BUY IT. And if you have a PS2 then go and buy DMC 1,2 and 3 for 20$ or something like this and spent your weekend being awesome. "

												I couldn't be bothered to put up with this port for more than an hour. I only had a 360 pad, but there was no way for me to comfortably map the buttons.Furthermore, it doesn't run smoothly. I can live with sub-30FPS in a lot of things, but I can't live with it in an action game like DMC3. It's kind of a shame since DMC3 is one of the best action games of the 2000s and considered by some to be better than 4 (which received a FANTASTIC PC port and its own special edition). Even RE4 received a decent pre-RE4HD port, so I don't know what went wrong here. Chances are that you probably have a 360 or PS3 around. Pick up the HD collection and enjoy DMC3 on that instead.			"

Прежде всего, DMC 3 – это ультимативный слэшер, вобравший в себя все лучшие наработки Die by the Sword, Rune, и Severance: Blade of Darkness.Геймплей: 10.0Графика: 10.0Звук и музыка: 10.0Интерфейс и управление: 9.5Общий рейтинг: 10.0 P.S: Единственным минусом могу отметить отсутствие русской локализации, но ведь это легко решаемая проблема.

												This game is awesome! Fun fast combat, brutal combos and over-the-top action that is unrealistic in many ways (Dante rides a rocket in midair like a skateboard) and because of that i LOVE this game. Just get it on console though, the PC is awful and if you dont have a controller or a fix for the game, a waste of money.			"

												this game is quite good, i almost had the same fun when i played it on the console (ps2).. vergil and dante is still badass as ever.  but is it just me or there is anyone else who cant play on fullscreen? this kinda annoying when you have to play with a charizard background is still there (yes, my wallpaper is pokemon).. i just hope they fix the screen, at least make it fullscreen. but this game is really worth $5 afterall			"

You will always move Dante with the right stick unless you manually install mods. Capcom, you are 100% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Like... Just use the ***damn PS2 controls.			"

												While I am a huge fan of the Devil May Cry series, the simple fact that this version has such lackluster control makes it worth collecting purely for a completionist. The story is still good, and the game itself is as enchanting as the console versions - but the partial controller support is a big pain in the butt. Not to mention all of the mods you would need to download, figure out, and install just to put it on the same level as Devil May Cry 4 in terms of playability. All in all, a great game bogged down by poor redesign and an incomplete transition to modern PCs. If you don't have the patience for mods - and unless someone has the kindness and time to put together everything into one, easy-to-handle package - you're better off with the console versions.			"

You are better off buying a Ps2, buying dmc 3 on ps2, and shoving your pc up your♥♥♥♥♥for letting steam make you belive you were going to get to experience something amazing from your past. I pray to God who ever created the pc version looses their whole family in the worst possiable way you could ever imagine. do not waste your money on this!!!!

												This ""special edition"" is worse than many BETA games on Steam. As soon as I booted up DMC3 the display was warped and distorted on the beginning cutscenes... and the worse part about it is that you can't skip it and have to endure it for a good several minutes each time you boot up the game. Just when you think that's over, the controls are awkward and uncomfortable. It's barely even playable and the guides on Steam couldn't resolve my display and contoler issues. But just when you decide to leave this trash of a port the game doesn't have a real exit function for PC so you're forced to close it with task manager and wait for your computer to respond. Sure, maybe you could be able to get this game to work, but the amount of hassle it takes to enjoy the game really isn't worth it.

												DMC3 is one of the best action games ever but somehow Capcom ruined it for the PC and made one of the worst ports possible. This version is a direct 1:1 port of the console version and is impossible to play. I have tried every gamepad config option through both the game's choices and MotioninJoy's emulated controllers and none of them work properly. Either the buttons refuse to map in game, axis' are reversed/swapped, or the controller just isn't reconized. I have a PS3 controller and it works with every other gamepad game I've played before. Yes, keyboard controls are technically possible but ridiculously cumbersome considering the control scheme.Even if my gamepad worked, the game starts off windowed and max rez on my 1920x1080 monitor is 1280x960, with all other options being 4:3 and no widescreen support. All cutscenes are heavily compressed and look significantly worse than the console versions. Actual gameplay looks better but considering that I can't play it kind of ruins the experience.Pick this up on PS2 or use an emu instead because this is unplayable.			"

												This PC port is utterly broken, it's been broken since the original release. Do NOT buy this crap, it's not playable on PC at all.  If you don't have a DirectInput controller, it won't work in this game at all since it was released before X360 console. Keyboard controlls, assuming they work which they usually wouldn't, are a total mess. Good luck playing on a keyboard, if you actually finish the game on broken controls, you deserve a trophy.Don't get me wrong, DMC3 is one of my favorite games of all times, but there's just no point in buying this on PC if you can't play it. This isn't just so really bad port, this is one of the most terrible ports in history along with Resident Evil 4 & Dark Souls 1. I say it again, DMC3 is NOT playable on PC so you're better off finding a used PS2 to play this gem. Don't waste your money on this broken half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port that can't be played on PC.			"

												Let's get this party started! Devil May Cry 3 is the best. It just is. With a charming cast of supporting characters, Dante at his best, both gameplay and personality wise, as well as the best music, enviroments, enemy design, and bosses, weapon selection, and extra content of the series, I cannot tell you how much I love this game, but  I can say it is a lot. So much feels connected and satisfying, and the game just has so many satisfying moments it's enough to make me sweat more than anything else does.Shamefully however, Ubisoft ported this and they did a pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ job too. No widescreen support is lame, really bad controller support is ♥♥♥♥ing awful and actually manages to make DS3 bluescreen somehow. And the cutscene quality is pretty dissapointing too,  but thankfully most of this can be fixed. Now I can get on to the good stuff though. Dante's gameplay just feels great because he not only has the abilities to bring interesting stuff to the table, but enemies that flow around them. If there's something that feels awkward to fight, it's because you aren't thinking outside the box yet.  DT explosion is an okay mechanic too, I like it better than ""DT improves style moves"", but it's just filler most of the time I think.The bosses in this are really cool too, Nevan in particular is a favourite of mine, not due to her sexuality, but due to the fact that she really compliments Dante in her scenes, if only one boss could become a Devil Arm, it should be her. The other bosses are pretty cool too, with Cerberus' great music and Dante's cheeky one liners at him, those twin swords guys making for an interesting fight that forces you to think of it as a double boss; as well as the Vergil and Jester fights that gradually get harder and more interesting as the game goes on, which make for a very cool REAL final boss fight, although fighting side by side with a certain character for that one boss was cool too. I also really like how while Dante tends to be an overzealous cocky badass, he does understand what it means to actually be human and actually shows emotion as well, which is good, since Lady is a great receptor for these feelings, as well as an attractive character style, sexually, and personality wise. I also do like Vergil's conviction and dedication to his personal creed as well. Arkham and Jester are also very cool as well!  Another thing I really like is how powerful styles get to be at level 3, it really makes you feel powerful with whatever you choose, but you also don't feel dependent on them, with the strong weapons and guns as well.Playing as Vergil is also pretty cool, although I must admit he feels a bit too eh for me. I also like the ability to pick whatever level of Bloody Palace you want to go to, it's just neat, but I wish there was a boss rush mode sometimes.Also have to say the credits sequence is a HUGE turn on, ♥♥♥♥ I love playable credits.One hell of a party!/10			"

												♥♥♥♥ THISThis game is on my top 10 list and I was going to bring back some memories while I was playing on PS2. I had over 800 hours on PS2 and I really enjoyed the game and pushed it to it's limits. BUT STUPID PC VERSION DOESN'T WORK AT ALL.To play the game you must install a mod , and patch the game which takes around 1 hour to do properly. After that you enter the game and it's ♥♥♥♥ing windowed ( BUT THAT'S NOT ALL) as soon as you press ALT+ENTER to make it full screen YOU WILL SEE THAT CONTROLLS ARE HORRIBLE AND THERE IS NO POINT IN CHANGING ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU CAN'T.

I feel sorry for all the work they dedicated and it's still unplayable. I was messing around with some settings and files myself, but still couldn't make it playable.Game is locked onto a low resolution which makes it look like a N64 game and it's horrible to look at.

MODS DON'T HELP AT ALLThis game is ruined on PC. I can't describe how my heart is broken that I can't play this blockbuster of a game on my PC to relive some memories. Waste of nerves and frustrating as ♥♥♥♥. Just play it on PS2 like I am going to or buy a PS3 trilogy .It's a lot more profitable to get a PS2 or a PS3 and DMC collection than buying this crappy port and try and make it playable.

												There's no question that the minute you boot this game and see with your own eyes just how bad this port is you will feel an immediate and pressing urge to redeem a refund as soon as humanly possible. However, I implore you to reconsider that course of action. For as terrible a PC port as this game is, all the severe gameplay breaking bugs can be resolved, given you spend a few minutes following the ""Windows 10 Complete Experience"" guide for fixing the game. 


DMC3: SE On Windows 10 - My Guide for the Complete Experience 
A Guide for Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition
By: nealiosis

			A summary of the steps to take on Windows 10 to configure this game so it will function properly with full music, custcenes, and XBOX360 controller support.		


Once the fixes are applied and functional, the pure majesty of this game is revealed. The graphics are so remarkable, the combat is as fluid and responsive as an olympic gymnist, and the game itself is devilishy addictive and fun. This game is an all-time great game and this PC edition (once you have fixed the issues) is, without a doubt, the definitive build of this product. Its a true and legitimate masterpiece of a game and don't let yourself miss out on one of gaming's greatest gems because Capcom skimped out and hired a team of incompetent chimpanzees to port the game to the PC platform.

												Terrible Port. Do not buy. Lacks any kind of modern controller support. It refuses to recognize Xbox One, 360, or another random controller I have. Any other version is better than this.Edit: You can mod it to make it playable, but the Port is still not really worth it.			"

Don't waste your time, just by the new one. Dante's personality is pretty weak in this game as well. The lines and cutscenes aren't cheesy, they're just embarassing.			"

I say it right away, STAY AWAY FROM THIS GARBAGE!This is by far the most s h i t t y port I've ever seen, the first RE 4 port was a pile of sh it but compared to this it was a pile of golden s h i t  you could still enjoy, somehow.However this game is pretty much like you're playing one of these cra p py PS emulators, the controlls are horrible, no mouse support at all, I can not even change the Resolution ingame for whatever stupid reason, nearly everyone's got some issues with it, it is just a pain to even get it to work properly.I can still only play in window mod since the unchangable 640x320 resolution will get you eye cancer in less than a minute.

												SSS/10 dont get turned off from this game just because of some comments about the perfomance, all you really need to do is search for ""Style switcher mod"" which is not only a essential mod but it also fixes the perfomance issues which are caused by the BGM engine ""AKA soundtracks"" not sure how capcom ♥♥♥♥ed that up but notheless this game is badass in my opinion almost as good as the special edition of the 4th, if you are a DMC fan or just a hack and slash fan definitely get this game i swear you wont regret it! ( Just dont forget to download Style Switcher so that you can fix some of the issues.)+Replayability (Blood palace and difficulty.)+Weapon Variety.+Sick combos.+Awesome story mode.-Somewhat annoying keyboard controls and controller issues.+100 times better than DmC.+Old School.420/snoop dog SSS/10 10/10			"

												Be aware that controllers only work after some significant .ini tweaking and if you have a Logitec 310 it seems you are out of luck. I strongly sugest reading the pinned forum post. Even if you have a listed controller from that post it is hit and miss. Given that the entire series is consoland controller based it is downright criminal to release it in this condition. This is not designed for keyboard and while I didn't study the page in depth I didn't realize that controllers would be an issue until I started it up and couldn't play it.Overall this feels flat out fraud. Valve should be issueing refunds to everyone and banning this product until it notes the substandard controller support front and center or fixes it.			"

If you spend 30 minutes learning which buttons are which, it's time well spent for what the rest of the game will offer you. I would also recommend checking out DMC4 for a much better port, maybe the best port ever. However, DMC4 is not as good a game as DMC3 is, and even with a few issues here and there, DMC3 is the absolute best hack-n-slash game out there.

												Garbage port. Pretty much impossible to get it to run unless you use mods and even then it will lag unless you disable music. On the plus side there is a style switcher mod out there which allows you to be able to switch between all styles on the fly silimar to DMC4 which opens up a whole new world of combo possibilites.I'd only really recommend this port to diehard fans who wants to play this game with the styleswitcher mod. If you're new to this series I'd recommend picking up the DMC4: Special Edition over this one, runs smooth as butter and plays great even though as a game it's inferior to DMC3. I'd also recommend to pick up the HD Collection on PS3/Xbox 360 for the best version of DMC3 over this one.			"

												This is a great game, but the PC port is shackled with uncustomizable controls and audio/visual technical issues. You can't have sloppy controls in Devil May Cry. It ruins the satisfying feel of the game, and makes it difficult for the wrong reasons. Do not buy this port at any price, track down a console copy because this is not a finished product.			"

												What is with this game!?!?  Dante looks like some goofy anime guy with white hair? Also from the looks of it he is working in some shop where nobody even buys anything and people only ever come in to use the toilet (LOL)  Not cool at all, even though he says 'party' and 'crazy' all the time to TRY to look COOL and it DOESN'T WORK!!!  Dante doesn't even say ♥♥♥♥ YOU once!!!  Vergil is in this too but he talks quiet and dresses like a horse rider.  There was this lady (Don't remember her name) with a bazooka but NO SIGN OF KAT!  YOU DON'T EVEN GET TO GO TO LIMBO, you just run around in the dirty street or through big hallways.  Another thing is that the game is so hard! It's IMPOSSIBLE to get a SSS rank because there are too many combos!!!  Rating: 1/10 Make the combat easier and CHANGE DANTE BACK FFS.			"

												You want a challenge? You want a game that demand skill? Well look no further, this game offers both of these things. Even on Normal mode.It's ridiculous on how hard this game. So combat wise it's a pretty fun game but it has some problems.The weapons have few moveset in the start and buying upgrades for them on the first run is pretty hard. Grinding souls just isn't an option on Normal mode either in my opinion. So it's best to stick with a weapon and that would most likely be Rebellion.For the styles it's pretty much Swordmaster that you need. You can hit enemies in the air then because you'll always do a downward thrust. Later on you might use Doppleganger though because it can double your power on stunned bosses. Which is nice.For items you need to be aware of one thing. The price goes up when you buy one. It goes up a lot. Using an item and continuing a stage makes you lose the item and start over the last checkpoint. Keep that in mind when fighting bosses.As for getting the game to work. It ran fine on my system and my PS2 gamepad worked just fine with the game. But if you have a 360 gamepad you might need to look up on a fix.But honestly, I'd pick up Devil May Cry 4 instead as the controls are better that time around. It can still be a lot of fun as well.

It doesn't support an XBOX360 controller by default, and even though you can basically set up a usable configuration with it, you can't use the triggers, the right stick is permanently bound to movement, and the left stick isn't used.So unless you don't mind downloading a third party controller-compatibilty program and losing analog control, steer clear of this for now.

												Well, the PC port is pretty bad, but not to the point where you ABSOLUTELY can't play and enjoy it. As for the controls, seriously guys, as many people posting about how the XBox controller won't work there are still people who continue to say so. Rather than complaining, go out and get a Logitech controller, adjust the controls with the gamepad application in the main file, and you're set to go. It's like playing on your PS2 all over again. But aside from some graphical errors, the game is still as great as it was when it first came out. Using an emulator takes too much time, what with finding all the files you need or having to actually purchase the game CD from one of the few small town stores that sell old and retro games/consoles. In my opinion it is better to just buy it on here, and spend a little bit of money for a simple Logitech controller. Or if you're too lazy to edit controls or get a controller, find a store that sells old PS2 games and consoles. 10/10 Will CONTINUE to play.			"

												AntiMacro is better gamepad to key mapping, as it is FREE, multi OS, and supports Win8.1.http://www.webupd8.org/2013/09/map-keyboardmouse-input-to-your-gamepad.htmlHere are the configs for the Razer Sabertooth Elite:[Controller (Razer Sabertooth Elite)]START = 7SELECT = 6CIRCLE = 1TRIANGLE = 3SQUARE = 2CROSS = 0L1 = 4R1 = 5L2 = R2 = L3 = 8R3 = 9L<->R = 1Use AntiMacro to map the L and R trigger to Q and E, then map the guide button with hold, alt, F4, and release under advance.  Also here is the general guidelines on how to fix your controller:1, the top line is your device name in Windows.  For Win 8.1, you need to go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers, then right click on your gamepad and select ""Game controller settings"".  Put whatever name that comes up for your controller inside [].2, the numbers for the button is exactly the name of the button minus 1. For example, the A button for my Razer Sabortooth Elite shows up as button 1, so 1 - 1 = 0, thus map ""0"" to the cross or X button.  You can ID the buttons within Properties > Test from the ""Game controller settings.""3, L and R trigger and the guide button need to be map with AntiMacro as mentioned above.4, L<->R is to swap the left and right stick, which needs to be enabled with a 1 for the Sabertooth Elite (0 to disable).5, the mapping was based on the PS2 verion of the controls, so change them to your linking in the config file for custom mapping.  DO NOT TRY TO CONFIG INSIDE THE GAME, and just leave anything to default and you will be fine.			"

												Often regarded by long time DMC fans as the best all around DMC title, I can agree that it is very well put together and a hell of a lot of fun. While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)Fast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.My only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).Regardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games. You won't be disappointed.			"

												The game itself is about what you'd expect from the Devil May Cry series, i.e. an awesome and over-the-top hack-'n-slash adventure starring everyone's favorite wise-cracking devil hunter, Dante. However, this has got to be one of the most badly ported games of all time. The first time I installed it, the control stick's usual ""LS for movement, RS for camera control"" was reversed and couldn't be changed, and it, much like Dark Souls, is borderline unplayable without a controller. I can only recommend this to anyone if they're fans of the series who can put up with a really wonky control scheme.			"

												Terrible PC port. It's so bad the awesomness of the title doesn't make up for it. Get it on a console instead. Or skip the title in favour of DMC4 and DmC (yes, even that), if you don't have a console. Don't buy DMC3 on PC.			"

												In any right thinking world it would be illegal to sell a game as broken as this godawful port of a classic.  The first hour of trying to play this game will consist of finding 3rd party widescreen fixes and editing .ini files to get it to work at any sort of modern resolution and with any controller less than 10 years old. Even when you do find the patches you may be unlucky like me in that fixes actually cause the game to CTD so then you have to spend even more time trying to work out which line in which .ini file it is that's causing the issue.When you do get it to run, it will run like poop  unless you delete half the ingame music.THESE ARE ALL WELL KNOWN ISSUES AND YET STILL STEAM SELLS IT!!  To play this game as it should be played, dust off your old PS2 and browse the trade in bins. This version is a rip off.			"

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥Sorry for being vulgar, but this game needs a warning label.This game is practically UNPLAYABLE with out a controller.It doesn't even go to full screen, at least on my computer.This is literally THE WORST(that is saying ALOT)THE WORST, port of ANY game I have ever seen in my life.Whoever did this port should be ashamed of themselves,The publisher should be ashamed they let this be released,I am nearly ashamed of myself for supporting this now..DMC is a legendary game.This is better on a horribly programmed emulator, Stay away unless you REALLY want DMC3 on your steam and have a XBOX controller.P.S. I dont even make YouTube videos, but this gives me a STRONG urge to show how bad this port truly is,.Just to show a example of one of the worst PC ports ever, and the PC rarely get a SUBPAR port. I can't stress how much of a achievement this game has made. It is almost, unbelievable.			"

												The game itself is good.  However, getting it to play nice with a 360 controller and finding a decent resolution is a chore.  But I thought it was worth it in the end.This link posted by another reviewer helped me get setup: http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?I think this is what worked for me to get the 360 controller to work correctly with the game.

												This game is a bit unenjoyable.I think we have all heard it's one of the worst ports of remembrance.You can actually play the game with default settings with the controller.You have to hold the x-box controller a little different to where your left thumb is on the right control stick.To play in full screen hold down at the same time the ALT & ENTER buttons.You also can't change the gun on the fly.Gun changing has to be done through the menu.Other than those hassles  it's something you should be able to adjust to.I'm playing on easy and once I have that down I might try it on higher setting.The reason I say NO to the game is that  there are better choices of DMC on PC.They all play the same.So don't listen to people say this is the best on PS2 when the makers have stood by the same formula with all current DMC games.This game is playable as is. No need to download a bunch of MODS unless you know what your doing.I've seen many people mess up thier PC's  and games with MODS.Many PC elitist will call you an idiot for not knowing how to install MODS and try to sway you to be using them.DMC 3 is a more advanced MODS for the user.

												Recommended but for fans only ! I would even say fans that don't mind putting some effort into fixing the problems. It's a pretty bad port ! Be advise of what you're getting. Things that don't work as expected :  Dualshock 3 not detected (setup as a 360 controller with DS3/Better DS3. Work in every game but this one).  Can't launch in fullscreen. Got to press alt+enter everytime. Resolution isn't saved. Got to set it to 1280x960 everytime (That's the maximum, original 4:3 format mind you). There's some clipping on both side of the screen when in fullscreen. Ok so that's my complaint after just got out of the shop and facing that 3 headed dog. I ended mapping all the keyboard buttons on my Steam Controller and it works well enough. Gotta say that I'm a fan of the serie, played them all back on the PS2, PS3 and now on PC. This port is just really really bad but if you put some effort, you can make it work with patches and fixes by the community. Just know what you're getting into. Be advised !!			"

												First let me hit you with the bad news, DMC3 is poorly optimized for Steam. There is no question about that. However, with some tweaking you can get this game in playable form. There is a mod for the game called, the ""Style Switcher"" that enhances the game greatly with HD richness. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get this mod to work and it's a long process of steps. The good news is that I was able to get the xbox controller working and the game playable at full screen without implementing the ""Style Switcher"" mod. Sadly, I'm missing out on HD enhancements. Instead DMC3 is displayed more in tune with it's PS2 counterpart. That means some jaggies even at a higher resolution. Still, the game is totally playable you just have to make a few edits, which are all explained in the DMC3 community guides section here on Steam.I played the original on PS2 and skipped out on DMC2 because I read lackruster things about it. DMC3 is a prequel to the original so really nothing is missed. DMC3 is a stylish-high action-combo masher- adventure title. It's a huge step up from the original (which was very enjoyable) and perhaps from DMC 2 (so I've heard). Despite negative reviews here on Steam I'm going to go ahead and recommend the steam version of DMC3. I would highly suggest NOT purchasing it for $19.99 and wait for the game to go on sale. That's exactly what I did. Just be prepared to make some edits in the game's files, which is a very easy process. I wish I could say the same about the ""Style Switcher"" mod. That will require some patience and possibily some trials of errors.DMC3 is well praised from both critics and fans as being the best entry in the DMC series. Don't miss it as it's a great game just wait for a sale!			"

												DMC3 is a great game, but the PC Version is not enjoyable at all you need to fix the game yourself if you want to play it with a Controller (because playing with a Keyboard isn't the same) or to play it all. Another thing is that the resolution has to be fixed aswell, because the game starts in a small window even after changing the resolution manually and when i tried to do it in the game it crashed.Buy this game if you like downloading mods and fixes and if not play the console version, it's just a shame the see such a  great console game being ported so bad.

												DMC 3 was my jumping in point when it came to classic action titles. The combat is meaty, fast paced, and all around fun. As a lot of the people claim though, this isn't the best port. In fact, I'd say it's a pretty bad one. That being said, it's work-able if you have a 360 controller and you're willing to use joy to key. Just a warning though, this game can be difficult. If you're new to the series, I seriously suggest being willing to try easy mode once you unlock it, (by dying enough on normal,) and then after a while you'll be demon slaying with the best of them. You'll just need practice.			"

												WARNING: HORRIBLE PORT.I got this game on a Steam sale because I have it for PS2 and, honestly, it's awesome.Devil May Cry is one of my favorite series.  The first and third installments are really, really good.  I've heard bad things about 2, but I've only played it a little.Imagine my surprise when I launch it and it's a small window with awful resolution and aliasing.  There's no fullscreen option.  I spent the next half hour or so trying to find online fixes.I get it: it's an old game.  You know what else is an old game?  Half Life, but I can run that in full screen.  Don't put crap like this on the store if it's only going to be a step up from minesweeper.  It's a good game if you can get mods to fix it (working on it), I just launched it like, an hour ago and I've been doing other stuff.  I'm about to try it again with mods.  If it doesn't fix it, I'm getting a refund.tl;dr: Game is awesome, PC/Steam port is unplayable.  Don't buy until they fix.			"

												Devil Mary Cry 3...an excellent game with a couple of problems.  For the graphics hounds out there, this is a port so it's not quite optimized though the graphics are good and from the PS2-era.  The controls...take a bit of time to get used to.  Once those drawbacks are overcome (or you install a controller) you have a game with a great combat system, awesome (if smug) protagonists and a certain antagonist and God knows how many difficulties to try the game at, if that is your cup of tea.

												A stylish fighting game classic. This may be considered the peak of the Devil May Cry series. It is also out for quite the while now, so it seems hardly necessary to go into too much detail that has already been covered over and over again.Storywise, you battle your way through an ancient tower to face your brother Vergil and foil his sinister intentions... but whose plan is really in action here?Gameplaywise, this game really shines. You can achieve mastery in four styles with different foci (Gunslinger, Swordmaster, Trickster and Royal Guard), plus two slightly more gimmick-like unlockables. You acquire an arsenal of five melee and five long range weapons, each category of which you can equip two and seamlessly switch between them. This is hardly astonishing nowadays, but it still blends together magnificently. There is also the bloody palace, an arena mode that provides slaughter aplenty.This version comes with new difficulty modes (compared to the original on PS2), which may or may not be of interest to you, and with a playable Vergil. This is a fun variant of the fighting gameplay, but does not introduce a lot of new content otherwise - the levels are simply the campaign all over again, minus the story cutscenes.One thing that should be mentioned is the optimization of the steam version. I bought the game in retail originally, and there were quite a few problems with it not recognizing gamepads correctly or at all - I ended up with a JoyToKey-workaround, which rather nullified the use of analog sticks, and still had trouble mapping the controller because some buttons were not registered, some double, and some of the in-game controls refused to be changed. The steam game comes with a controller configuration application, a nice little thing that took all this work away and actually succeeded in using both sticks and the various seemingly problematic buttons. This little addition increases playability a good deal for me.If you do not have this game yet and care for action / (sword-) fighting games with a really well thought-through combat system, I highly recommend looking into this.

												I definitely reccomend this game, to whoever is reading this, it is definitely worth it, even if it isn't the best of ports, and you don't have a PS2, get it, and play it. There are very easy workarounds to get the resolution you want, and to fix the gamepad controls.I never really got a chance to play this game on the PS2, since it didn't seem like a game I would really be interested in, however after a few years of being released on PC, it caught my attention, most noticeably, it's really, really high rating, and I thought to myself, is this game really that good? Short answer: YES.Back in 2007 (with a 2004 Packard Bell PC) I was just glad I was running the game, I was new to PC gaming, so I didn't really have a clue what to expect. The visuals weren't really impressive, especially in 640x480 resolution, but I did manage to get it to full screen and a slightly higher res. The main problem was the keyboard controls, they were very unusual at first, and the game also was probably the hardest one I had played to date on PC (mind you, it was probably only the 10th game I played on PC) Just the second mission boss was owning me again and again, and probably went the same way about 10 more times before, I got fed up and stopped playing, and this was on normal difficulty.A few days later picked it up again and started playing, this time I somehow managed to scrape by the first boss, and off I went, one of the best games I have ever played, and also gave me the mentality to never give up on a hard game, it's always more satisfying when the game is hard, unlike DmC. DMC 3 truly is an epic game, with cheesy (but funny) one liners and whole load of awesome action, the cinematics are awesomely done, the storyline (though confusing at times) is awesome. It really disappoints me that there hasn't been a true continuation of the DMC storyline, even in DMC 4, the main focus was not on Dante. But I am getting ahead of myself, and there are spoilers if I keep going on, and someone is still yet to play DMC 4, so I'll just stop here.Now that I have the game on steam, I had a few problems with the controls again, but this time for the gamepad, I was already used to the keyboard controls, since I played through this game before, and I also wanted to play it in 1080p this time, and with the help of the Steam community and a few mods, I got it to run as I wanted it to both the resolution and the gamepad, except for the quick weapon switches the triggers on the 360 controller are the only buttons that don't respond, it doesn't bother me much since my favourite weapons are the default ones anyway, Rebellion is just too good, and Ebony and Ivory are just the trademark guns you can't go anywhere without them. Besides that, the game looks better than ever, and I would definitely recommend you get this game, especially in a sale, since they didn't really do a good job on the port. Trust me the extra work will be completely worth your time, I wasn't into these kinds of games before, but this game just got me hooked to the DMC story.			"

												<h1>Look out for a sale, grab the Style Switcher Mod, and enjoy one of the best hack-and-slash action game ever made.</h1> <b>A precaution:</b>If using Style Switcher, <i>do not</i> change the HUD value from 1.0. It will make one of the boss fight unable to be attacked with a melee weapon.Also, you don't want it to drop below 50 fps (this may be possible even on a relatively powerful rig; it's truly a bad port). DMC3 requires good timing and good reflex - low fps will screw you up.And perhaps contrary to most people, I did find playing with a keyboard to be more convenient and reflexive, especially when it comes to changing weapons, and going ""full assault"" with Vergil. Do try playing with a keyboard, seriously. "

												By 2015 it is hard for me to understand why this game is such a classic. Hammy, trite dialogue, a plot that is skin deep and a protagonist that is a grade A♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag... it's definitely not your regular AAA game. Still it has it's charm, and despite a couple of really terribly designed bosses, is a good but fair challenge. It has high action, hack and slash elements with a nice levelling and point system that keeps you coming back for more.The PC port is terrible, a true travesty. However, follow the guides an this can be running in 1920 x 1080, with an xbox controller without a hitch. It's a shame that the community is left to fixed this travesty, but when it's on a good deal I would still recommend purchasing it for nostalgia or a good Sunday afternoon fun.Back to the game, several professional reviews said the game world was massive... Don't be fooled, after about midway most of the game is just level revisits with something slightly altered. The game feels big enough, but is no Dark souls in scope.7/10			"

												After playing DMC3 on PS2, I love the game so I sought out to collect the entire series on PC. However, DMC3 on PS2 is very different compared to PC. There are mod fixes for this weird, terrible port but I'm just disappointed that the community made it rather than the developers. In the end, it's still a fun game once you got every issue sorted.Pros:- Vergil's fancy, badass combos.- Dante's usual personality.+Combat.- Dat music.- Bosses are fun to kill as well as challenging.- The mod fixes make the game even better depending on your tastes. Either remain with the single style, or play like DMC4 with the instant style switching.Cons:- Weird screen resolutions.- XBOX 360 controller takes a bit a meddling to fix and get going.- The music and sound can sometimes cause the game to lag.

												Devil May Cry 3 seems very classic when compared to DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition (which I'm not to fond of, but that's a different review). Dante is back in his 3rd game in the series, the bosses are fairly difficult, and this game overall is quite a challenge.Which might be because it took me (an experienced DMC fan) over 10 minutes just to figure out all of the buttons. The camera angles feel weird and confining, and as far as I could tell.. unchangeable.3.5/5 "

												I love Devil May Cry series, but this game needs a mod in order to work properly with a controller, and even if you use that mod, the game doesn´t change the buttons of the tutorial for the buttons of the controller you are already using, so you´ll have to be guessing all the time which button is which... I recommend Devil May Cry 3 as a really good game, but if you don´t have a controller nor you are very familiar installing mods and things like that I do not recommend buying this game on Steam.			"

												Tried to play this game with a controller... but they have both movement and attack keys on the right side of the controller. I would need 16 fingers on my right hand to play that. Oh, and I would adjust the settings to balanced on the controller, but they don't allow it. Terrible port. Don't buy on Steam.			"

												Being the first game I completed back on the PS2 I'm actually rather attached to it. However this port is beyond redemption. as i began to play the first level I noticed that each time i hit the melee key it did a different thing: sometimes jump, sometimes shoot, sometimes the actions skill; this was the same for the other three keys that are supposed to represent those actions.There is no fix. There is no Controller support. No mapping program solves this. You cant play at 1080p.and to top it all off theres no sign of a proper HD Collection port for PC to divert the problem.I bought this game under the pretense that I was buying a game. This is a bugged mess that makes a mockary of its original. This needs a working fix made.			"

												By 2015 it is hard for me to understand why this game is such a classic. Hammy, trite dialogue, a plot that is skin deep and a protagonist that is a grade A♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥bag... it's definitely not your regular AAA game. Still it has it's charm, and despite a couple of really terribly designed bosses, is a good but fair challenge. It has high action, hack and slash elements with a nice levelling and point system that keeps you coming back for more.The PC port is terrible, a true travesty. However, follow the guides an this can be running in 1920 x 1080, with an xbox controller without a hitch. It's a shame that the community is left to fixed this travesty, but when it's on a good deal I would still recommend purchasing it for nostalgia or a good Sunday afternoon fun.Back to the game, several professional reviews said the game world was massive... Don't be fooled, after about midway most of the game is just level revisits with something slightly altered. The game feels big enough, but is no Dark souls in scope.7/10			"

												AntiMacro is better gamepad to key mapping, as it is FREE, multi OS, and supports Win8.1.http://www.webupd8.org/2013/09/map-keyboardmouse-input-to-your-gamepad.htmlHere are the configs for the Razer Sabertooth Elite:[Controller (Razer Sabertooth Elite)]START = 7SELECT = 6CIRCLE = 1TRIANGLE = 3SQUARE = 2CROSS = 0L1 = 4R1 = 5L2 = R2 = L3 = 8R3 = 9L<->R = 1Use AntiMacro to map the L and R trigger to Q and E, then map the guide button with hold, alt, F4, and release under advance.  Also here is the general guidelines on how to fix your controller:1, the top line is your device name in Windows.  For Win 8.1, you need to go to Control Panel > Devices and Printers, then right click on your gamepad and select ""Game controller settings"".  Put whatever name that comes up for your controller inside [].2, the numbers for the button is exactly the name of the button minus 1. For example, the A button for my Razer Sabortooth Elite shows up as button 1, so 1 - 1 = 0, thus map ""0"" to the cross or X button.  You can ID the buttons within Properties > Test from the ""Game controller settings.""3, L and R trigger and the guide button need to be map with AntiMacro as mentioned above.4, L<->R is to swap the left and right stick, which needs to be enabled with a 1 for the Sabertooth Elite (0 to disable).5, the mapping was based on the PS2 verion of the controls, so change them to your linking in the config file for custom mapping.  DO NOT TRY TO CONFIG INSIDE THE GAME, and just leave anything to default and you will be fine.			"

												Often regarded by long time DMC fans as the best all around DMC title, I can agree that it is very well put together and a hell of a lot of fun. While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)Fast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.My only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).Regardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Classic, brutal, stylish. DMC3 makes you realize how easy recent action games are. It's incredibly fun and mercilessly punishing. Surprisingly, the graphics have aged pretty well and the combat engine is just as fast-paced as it was on the PS2 port, better even.Though I love this game to death, it can be frustratingly difficult and can turn off casual gamers. The default keyboard controls also take some time getting used to. But for everyone else, ♥♥♥♥ing play this game.			"

												Being the hardest game in the series Devil May Cry 3 will defiantly offer you with some challenging game play, pack with dynamic boss fights some puzzles here and there and lastly a descent story.While the game itself isn't bad in any respects but one thing that stands out is the awful controls. Once i bough it i tried playing it only on the keypad but the keys were too close together and it just felt awkward to play.So i decided to buy a controller for the pc but that didn't work either. The buttons were programmed wrong and it was impossible to change and not because the controller was broken but the game automatically programmed it that way.All in all Devil May Cry 3 is a good game non the less but DO NOT buy it on pc unless ypu want clunky awkward controls!

Always worth a revisit.If you are in the more modern era of gaming and didn't play game like this when they came out, prepare for the frustration of locked camera angles that often make little to no sense. Like running against the clock while only being able to see behind you, or in combat and unable to see the corner of the room that the last enemy is hiding in when he dashes at you to ruin your SSS ranking is combat style.

												Capcom kinda butchered the port but hey, it's still Devil May Cry. I've found that the keyboard configuration is actually really fun and effective once you get used to it.

Although, to be fair, I'm not exactly a DMC pro considering the original PS2 release was way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed hard and 12 year old me could never even make it past CerberusAnyways, what I'm trying to say is give the keyboard controls a try! If you're new it might help since you can keep a finger on the attack, shoot, and style buttons at all times. If you're a seasoned DMC veteram who's gone through Heaven and Hell unscathed, it could be an interesting new playstyle that lets you suck at and eventually master the game all over again.

												May i just say... this is one of the best games of all time, and best action game of all time.Yeah this port is lazy but me being the pc guy i knew exactly what to do, i managed to get this game running at 1080p and got my controller to be fully compatiable with the game after some tweaks, some 5 minute work.This still isn't an excuse to make people tweak the game just because capcom was lazy porting it.so if you're not willing to do some work before playing this just buy it on ps2 or emulate it.also if you don't have a gaming pc don't buy it, yes yes i know this game has ps2 graphics but capcom was being lazy, so yeah you'll need a medium range gaming pc to play it PROPERLY, something around gtx 750 ti should be a smooth experience, yeah i know... crazy, im serious.if you guys never played this game and want a good detailed review you can visit this link : http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps2/920607-devil-may-cry-3-dantes-awakening/reviews/85364(this review isn't mine but it adresses everything about the game that you need to know!) , my opinions about this game are 100% in match with what this guy in the link says, and i think many other people's too.Would i recommend this game? Yes definitely, its a MUST for all gamers.Would i recommend this port? For people who don't mind doing some tweaks and google? Yeah. For people who just want to game after downloading? No.If you take your time tweaking this port it should be a better experience than the PS2 version.Final Verdict (my opinion) :The Game : 10/10 Absloutely amazing action packed game!This port : 3/10 - you can make it a 10/10 port with your own tweaks, but rating capcom's work... it's really lazy.

												Originally I was a big fan of this game on the Playstation 2 and it still remains my favourate DMC game, so on sale for just over £3 I felt it was a bargin. However there are major porting issues which render the game unplayble via a control pad if your not prepared to download the software to fix them (there are guides on the web and links through other reviews). You can get it to work close to full screen with alt + enter and once you have a controller software set up the game seems to run ok apart from the  camera. This is because the developers current config software maps both the camera and movement to the right analog stick on  PC controllers.  As it stands it is only worth buying as a sale item and I would love to see a fix released on the controls.This game would also benefit from the steam workshop (if someone would release the modding facility for the game)			"

												With a little bit of effort and the Style Switcher mod, this title is a great alternative to the PS2 version.  This is still one of my favorite action games to date, and the gameplay is still challenging.  However, you will have to do some work if you want it to work.It's made even more dynamic with the ability to expand on Virgil and switch styles on the fly (using mods).For those who have never played a Devil May Cry title, this is arguably the best of them all.  Though there's options to start on Easy, the game can become extremely challenging.  Once you clear one difficulty, the next one is unlocked.  The hardest difficulty gets extremely hard with more enemies in each level, faster enemies that deal more damage, bosses with fatal (or near) attacks, and if you don't clear enemies quickly, the become much harder to kill.I think this is one of Capcom's best titles, even though the voice-acting and cutscenes are corny.  Controller extremely highly recommended.			"

												Great game, and it runs well even on my outdated laptop, but the controller support is pretty awful. It doesn't support an XBOX360 controller by default, and even though you can basically set up a usable configuration with it, you can't use the triggers, the right stick is permanently bound to movement, and the left stick isn't used.So unless you don't mind downloading a third party controller-compatibilty program and losing analog control, steer clear of this for now.

												Devil Mary Cry 3...an excellent game with a couple of problems.  For the graphics hounds out there, this is a port so it's not quite optimized though the graphics are good and from the PS2-era.  The controls...take a bit of time to get used to.  Once those drawbacks are overcome (or you install a controller) you have a game with a great combat system, awesome (if smug) protagonists and a certain antagonist and God knows how many difficulties to try the game at, if that is your cup of tea.

												Extremely difficult to setup to work with gamepad. I've visited the forums and followed the steps and nothing actually changes anything to help me use my wired Xbox 360 controller with this game. Outside of the lack of ability to use a controller, the max resolution is only 1600x900 AND there's bad screen tearing during cutscenes and general play. It's just a really bad, lazy port. HOWEVER, if this game is coupled with DMC4 as a bundle and it's really cheap that way, get it. DMC4 is like capcom's apology for this trash because DMC4 works fantastic and is way gorgeouson pc. Much better than consoles.			"

												I recommend this game solely based on the story. It was over the top and a blast to play through and see. You can watch the cutscenes on youtube (and I also recommend that), but it won't feel quite as fulfilling as completing the game yourself.The recommendation however is not an absolute must buy thing. The problem for this game is in its control scheme in that I found it awkward during some fights. Aside from the controls (which are quite a big deal in this game) I don't have any real problems with the game. Camera controls could be better at times and the platforming levels are best left forgotten. The platforming however is largely optional in bonus levels that are timed.			"

It's a complete mess... but until a very much wanted HD collection comes to Steam, this is the DMC3 we get, but at least it's still ♥♥♥♥ing DMC3! One of the best games of all time.Install the mod, stick on your favourite music and rock n' roll!On a legit note don't buy it unless you really, really want to and it's super cheap.			"

This is because the developers current config software maps both the camera and movement to the right analog stick on  PC controllers.  As it stands it is only worth buying as a sale item and I would love to see a fix released on the controls.This game would also benefit from the steam workshop (if someone would release the modding facility for the game)			"

												-> NOT RECOMMENDED DUE TO ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC PORT. BETTER OFF TO BUY THE CONSOLE VERSION ETC. <-Devil May Cry 3 is actually a fun game as usual, probably the best one in the franchise that I played. Main character is of course Dante, and his evil brother Virgil. The gameplay is my most favorite from this game, ranged weapons to choose like dual pistol, shotgun, rocket launcher, some laser weapon, and even a sniper rifle. For melee, is his very own big sword, fists, dual swords, a ♥♥♥♥ing guitar (whoa), and others that I may forgot. Devil triggers are pretty cool too, I think my most favorite one is the one that you can clone yourself for double the destruction. So for the bad side of the game, only the keyboard works, gamepad controls are broken for me, what a shame. (I'd recommend XPadder if you really need the gamepad controls.) Theres also this weapon changing from the pause menu, why not during ingame for blazing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the combo'ing? (though this is possible in DMC4, but whatever.) Rating: 7 / 10 Pros: Obvious gameplay is obvious, lots of weapons to use, a ♥♥♥♥ing guitar as a weapon (holy♥♥♥♥♥♥, Devil Triggers are game changers to cause more mayhem. Cons: Problems with gamepad, Weapon switching should've been ingame instead of in the pause menu.			"

												First and foremost, this is a bad port of the PS2 version, I wouldn't recommend it if you own the original PS2 version or the recent release of the PS3 & X360 HD editions. It suffers from low-res graphics, and I could only change the resolution to 1024*768 tops, unless you mess the exe file with a hex editor..On top of that, i absolutely hate the controls, as the Gamepad Configuration that comes with the 1.3 update doesn't support Xbox Controllers for Windows whatsoever, thus I have to move Dante via the right analog stick, which is really annoying and frustrating..Well, you could find 3rd parter softwares such as XBCD Setup Utility, JoyToKey and Xpadder to solve the controller mapping issue, but it's troublesome..Other than these issues, it's playable - 4.5/10			"

												One of the best Devil May Cry games. I strongly recommend this game.But the biggest flaw with the steam version is that it has no controller support. None at all.Witch is strange cause I own the same game on DVD and that version has at least some controller support.If you plan on buying the steam version then I recommend that you read this post first:http://steamcommunity.com/app/6550/discussions/0/864969320373351964/ "

												This game is RAD but the PC port is just BADIt was made way back in the day when Capcom didn't even know what they were doing when it came to porting their console games to PC and this and the original Resident Evil 4 PC port kind of just suffer from bad controls, graphical glitches, and other wacky nonsense that just kind of ruins the experience.You can actually just play the game on a PS2 emulator and have a better experience than this port			"

												This is definately a very fun game with a wicked sense of humor.  It is the prelude to the Devil May Cry series, so you don't need to play the other 2 before this one to understand it.  Be warned, you definately want a gamepad for this, and it is EXTREMELY hard.  This is not for the faint of heart.Also, be aware on the front end, this port is horrible.  Be prepared to do a lot of Jerryrigging in order to get the game working properly.  Specifically, downloading from a different source the sound and music files in order to fix the frame rate drop.

It's a shame that this port is so terrible, but with the help of the very talented modding team behind the aforementioned fix, you too can enjoy DMC3 in all its stylish, nu-metal-blaring, bishounen-loving goodness. It's damn near the best game in the series next to DMC4, and a paragon of the character action genre. Just wait for it to go on sale for uber cheap.			"

												I really want to give this game a good review, but I can't because this version of the game is literally broken. Devil May Cry is one of the less forgiving entries in the series, but does crappy port of the game does no justice. Some people will try to defend their purchase that it is rather playable, but you need to do some advance configurations to get the game running with playable settings.Control support is barebones to the point that you might as well play with mouse and keyboard, oh wait, that's broken too.Graphics are really choppy and the setttings are barebones as well.The game aside is good but this port is horrendous.I got this game with a DMC 4 bundle so I don't really care that this is in my library, but if anyone were to buy this game seperate please, I beg of  you don't buy it, and buy DMC4 seperate as it is worth the money.Do yourself a favor and go buy the console version or the DMC HD collection, or emulate it, whatever. Its really upsetting that this game is still up for sale and Valve won't take it down because they want to have DMC games in their library. Trust me, you'll love yourself for buying the console version instead of this poor excuse of a port that hasn't been updated forever.EDIT: So I found out that there is a mod that does fix the support for controls and video settings. BUT my review still stands as a thumbs down as no one should buy this game full price just for a third party mod. Just get the console version with the HD Collection.			"

												Let me start this review by saying I didn't play this game anywhere near launch (started only recently), and have had very little experience with the Devil May Cry series before I started playing this game. I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.With that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.First of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10The gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War). Exploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.The controls in the game however are problematic. While I've got them to work perfectly with my Logitech F310 (in D-Input mode) and Net Way PS3/PC Gamepad, This game doesn't support Xbox 360 and One controllers without some tweaking, so I recommend having an older, Direct-Input controller to play with as Keyboards aren't optimal for this type of game. 10/10 (with a gamepad, otherwise 6. yeah, it's that important)The graphics of the game are showing their age; it is a relatively old game, and doesn't support high resolutions. Also, the graphics of this version are inferior to the PS2 and HD Collection versions as some of the more advanced lighting and shadowing effects are missing, and there is some very mild lag in some areas. The game is still perfectly fun and playable with these faults, but it's still something to keep in mind though if you care a lot about visuals. The character and environment designs however were pretty good for their time, and still have a bit of charm, even today. (7/10)The music here is a mixed bag: I'm not a fan of the heavy-metal esque battle themes, although they fit the setting of the game. The rest of the music, like ambient sounds and effects are immersive however, and the goddess statue and final boss themes were very nice IMO. (6.5/10, although if you like the battle themes you might give an 8 or a 9)Finally replayability. This game isn't very long (about 12 hours for my first playthrough) but has immense replay value, with a lot of harder difficulty levels to unlock and test your skills with, an alternate playable character with unique weapons (Vergil), the ability to carry your upgrades and items from playthrough to playthrough, and the Bloody Palace, an arena with near endless battles, this game can keep you busy for a very long time if you want to master it. 10/10.Verdict: DMC3 SE is a fantastic game, with a ton of replay value. If you have a gamepad and don't mind a minor graphical downgrade, this is a solid reccomendation. If you're with a keyboard though or want the best graphics available, I'd recommend getting the PS2 version/HD remake if you can. Even if you can't, there's still a very solid game here. (No final score, as there are too many variables depending on your hardware and everyone has their own priorities in games. I only try to advise. Who am I to judge what you find important?)			"

												Devil May Cry 3 seems very classic when compared to DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition (which I'm not to fond of, but that's a different review). Dante is back in his 3rd game in the series, the bosses are fairly difficult, and this game overall is quite a challenge.Which might be because it took me (an experienced DMC fan) over 10 minutes just to figure out all of the buttons. The camera angles feel weird and confining, and as far as I could tell.. unchangeable.3.5/5 "

												I love Devil May Cry series, but this game needs a mod in order to work properly with a controller, and even if you use that mod, the game doesn´t change the buttons of the tutorial for the buttons of the controller you are already using, so you´ll have to be guessing all the time which button is which... I recommend Devil May Cry 3 as a really good game, but if you don´t have a controller nor you are very familiar installing mods and things like that I do not recommend buying this game on Steam.			"

												Recommended but for fans only ! I would even say fans that don't mind putting some effort into fixing the problems. It's a pretty bad port ! Be advise of what you're getting. Things that don't work as expected :  Dualshock 3 not detected (setup as a 360 controller with DS3/Better DS3. Work in every game but this one).  Can't launch in fullscreen. Got to press alt+enter everytime. Resolution isn't saved. Got to set it to 1280x960 everytime (That's the maximum, original 4:3 format mind you). There's some clipping on both side of the screen when in fullscreen. Ok so that's my complaint after just got out of the shop and facing that 3 headed dog. I ended mapping all the keyboard buttons on my Steam Controller and it works well enough. Gotta say that I'm a fan of the serie, played them all back on the PS2, PS3 and now on PC. This port is just really really bad but if you put some effort, you can make it work with patches and fixes by the community. Just know what you're getting into. Be advised !!			"

Another thing is that the resolution has to be fixed aswell, because the game starts in a small window even after changing the resolution manually and when i tried to do it in the game it crashed.Buy this game if you like downloading mods and fixes and if not play the console version, it's just a shame the see such a  great console game being ported so bad.

												This game is a bit unenjoyable.I think we have all heard it's one of the worst ports of remembrance.You can actually play the game with default settings with the controller.You have to hold the x-box controller a little different to where your left thumb is on the right control stick.To play in full screen hold down at the same time the ALT & ENTER buttons.You also can't change the gun on the fly.Gun changing has to be done through the menu.Other than those hassles  it's something you should be able to adjust to.I'm playing on easy and once I have that down I might try it on higher setting.The reason I say NO to the game is that  there are better choices of DMC on PC.They all play the same.So don't listen to people say this is the best on PS2 when the makers have stood by the same formula with all current DMC games.This game is playable as is. No need to download a bunch of MODS unless you know what your doing.I've seen many people mess up thier PC's  and games with MODS.Many PC elitist will call you an idiot for not knowing how to install MODS and try to sway you to be using them.DMC 3 is a more advanced MODS for the user.

												A pretty terrible port of an otherwise good game to the PC. Controls mash up rather poorly with the game making the use of outside software a necessity, and it still is a difficult and unreliable fix.Overall Rating: Relatively Unplayable			"

												Windowed only, and window too small (1/4 of screen taken up), can't use with xbox one controller, other reviews mention audio missing. Don't recommend, but do recommend on console.			"

												The game itself is amazing, the PC port is bad but if you can get past it then it's absolutely worth it.			"

												I feel as if a patch was released because im having no issues at all out of dmc3,  No fps lost on any kind of level....runs great and plays amazing!  However i did uninstal some kind of audio packet or something on my pc.  Before it use to run terrible but now it is playable so far....Will update after a while just beat the first boss no problem "

												honestly the days of dmc 3 being unplayable on pc are pretty much over , just install style switcher 3 , follow a guide on how to use your gamepad which is simple as hell and boom it'll run smooth as butter and the laptop im running it on can just about play dmc 4 se on low settings and all the nice effects turned off so im sure you will be ok, if anything its farr better on pc with a nicer look as it looks less grainy to its ps2 brother and the style switcher mod makes it the best action game out there if you want a rating to convince you its an easy 9/10 as i do get a few very minor graphical bugs but they are small and usually cutscene related so yeah pretty damn brilliant overall			"

												Just learn to set the graphics to max, configure the controller, set to full screen and play only the gold version and you will get the best hack'n'slash on pc.  "

												With a little bit of effort and the Style Switcher mod, this title is a great alternative to the PS2 version.  This is still one of my favorite action games to date, and the gameplay is still challenging.  However, you will have to do some work if you want it to work.It's made even more dynamic with the ability to expand on Virgil and switch styles on the fly (using mods).For those who have never played a Devil May Cry title, this is arguably the best of them all.  Though there's options to start on Easy, the game can become extremely challenging.  Once you clear one difficulty, the next one is unlocked.  The hardest difficulty gets extremely hard with more enemies in each level, faster enemies that deal more damage, bosses with fatal (or near) attacks, and if you don't clear enemies quickly, the become much harder to kill.I think this is one of Capcom's best titles, even though the voice-acting and cutscenes are corny.  Controller extremely highly recommended.			"

												The game itself is good.  However, getting it to play nice with a 360 controller and finding a decent resolution is a chore.  But I thought it was worth it in the end.This link posted by another reviewer helped me get setup: http://www.nexusmods.com/devilmaycry3/mods/1/?I think this is what worked for me to get the 360 controller to work correctly with the game.  Hope it helps some future player:[Controller (XBOX 360 Wireless Receiver for Windows)]START = 7SELECT = 6CIRCLE = 1TRIANGLE = 3SQUARE = 2CROSS = 0L1 = 4R1 = 5L2 = 11R2 = 12L3 = 8R3 = 9L<->R = 1  "

												Initially I gave this game a worse review, since it's still an atrocious port of one of the character action greats. It's got no fullscreen option, bad controller support, occasional slowdowns and bugged music in some parts. Playing this on a Playstation 2, or playing the HD collection is obviously the better option.That said, I managed to play this game in its entirety by fiddling with my controller (one of those cheap Logitech gamepads with input options) and setting my computer's power option to High Performance. Once I did the latter, the game ran almost perfectly, but with no fullscreen. If you're willing to try your luck with this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥or you have the patience to install the Style Switcher mod, buy this port on sale.Otherwise, play it on a Playstation or emulate it. "

												I tried to play this game after finishing DMC4 Special Edition but this game really doesn't want you to play it.FORTUNATELY I have found a perfect solution:EMULATE IT ON PS2!I couldnt stomach installing Styleswitcher and even then it wouldnt fix the atroucious graphics and resolution. On the other hand the emulated version is extremely flexible when it comes to graphics settings and there is no issue with the gamepad whatsoever.Show your love by buying this game but spare yourself the trouble and just emulate it, you will far more pleased than doing a messy install for style switcher while suffering from bad resolution.

												Awesome game,terrible port.If you are planning on playing this download the Widescreen Patch first,pick your screen resolution and drop it into the game folder.If you are using the controller use joyttopad program to get it working properly.If you rae using PS3 pad use Better DS3 software to get it to work properly.If the game is laggy while you are playing you will need to delete certain audio files( weird,i know,but it works). All in all the game is freaking awesome ,but this port is the worst port i've ever seen so far,don't get discouraged when you install it first,it will take some time but you can get it to work. "

												This port is really bad but you can enjoy using the Style Switcher Mod but if you don't want to play this port then I suggest you buy one of the console versions			"
