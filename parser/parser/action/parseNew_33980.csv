												This was possibly the worst game I have ever played in my meaningless existence; and I've played a lot of games. A lot of really bad games. So many, in fact, that one might say I am a masochist. And yet this remains the most horrid, putrid, wretched game I have ever had the misfortune of playing. I hate Bohemia for making it, I hate myself for buying it. 1.75/10			"

												Unpolished and seriously underrated, yet quite fun game on the mainstream theme - ""zombie rampage"". This time - in the distant town somewhere on Mid-West of USA. What I like about the game - is that it stays on the bright side of things. You know, the Zombie Games are usually Dead Serious. Not a bad feature, but all of them are so similar on the basic level, that it is absolutely no fun. Stubbs the Zombie was different, one-of-a-kind gem... But there are too little count of games trying comical approach on the zombie pattern - and that's a mile behind the cinematography. Which is strange, as generally games are far more creative with things, in comparison with Hollywood...Now, Pound of Ground is not something worth a long review, really. The ""Hero"" there doesn't have Ash Williams charisma and chainsaw, but other than that - it's the same type of guy.The game starts a bit confusing, but quite soon you'll get a bat to crush z-sculls, then a car, a pistol, a shotgun, a long-ranged crossbow, and finally, a dynamite. Zombies will be upgrading as well, there will be monsters with distant attacks, sages-which-raising-hordes, and even bigger things on the dessert. Controls are a bit off, but only a little. In general, it is rather easy-going arcade game with semi-open world, some zombies to kill and some hills to jump with your red cabrio. Full complete in less than 10 hours, and way better aftertaste, than with so many other Zombie games. Especially when we're talking about smaller ones, like Dead Pixels, which so many people seems to like without proper reason...Sure, Pound of Ground has many flaws, if you care to look for them - like strange name in the first place, followed by wacky start of the game, somewhat clunky controls and gameplay in general... and not-so-good code, as the game tends to crush every now and then, usually on the loading screens.On the other hand, it is doing well the thing the games are generally made for - it is entertaining. I really like it just the way it is (except for unstable code, of course). It is short and fun, if a bit mindless, comedy action game about zombies. With great fusion soundtrack, which I really enjoyed.My mark is 8/10. I usually play serious long-winded games, like epic RPGs and strategies... But sometimes you just can't force yourself to take the playtime so seriously. After 16h-work day, for example... And Pound of Ground is perfectly fitting that niche of short and easy action. There should be more games like that!			"

												I went into this game expecting it to be one of the worst games I have ever played and in that I was disappointed, I am a bit of a Masochist when it comes to games and I do seek out bad games as well as good ones.The other user reviews on this game plus TB's ""Why do I own"" video made this one sound like that would be that bad it would make a great video, So when it came on sale for 1€ I grabbed it.The game is average. It does not do anything well but doesn't suck at anything to badly nether. It is what it is. If people really need tips on actually bad games they can feel free to drop be a line because this is not it.Would I recommend this game? if it's on sale for a euro or two I guess why not but not at full price. but note it's just an average game with nothing that really stands out it doesn't do anything to wrong but nothing to right nether.For those who want a hot tip on a game that far worse than this and to prove my point. Get ""Dark Apes:  The Fate of Devolution"" Play that a while and this game will seem rather good :P			"

												Pound of Ground is a (mostly) open-world zombie bashing, redneck loving, apocalypse saving, nightmare of a title.The gameplay can be fun...sometimes, but in general it's painfully clunky. Car driving mechanics are decent and I'm always a sucker for games that let you run over people/zombies. Plus using a Louisville slugger to launch zombies never gets old.The story is god awful wacky with voice acting to match. The best thing about the story is that the developers obviously weren't shooting for something serious--and they did a superb job in that regard.Overall I have mixed feelings, but because the game crashes too much, I have to go with a thumbs down. It's playable, but I came close to uninstalling it on several occasions.			"

												This is the stupidest, most hilariously inept game I have played in years, and yet it has this sick charm like a brain-damaged boxer who keeps trying to fight... you know it'll get savaged when you put it up against anything at all, no matter the opponent, but it'll go down swinging with a smile on its face.You play as ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Johnny Five-Aces! (Except they call him ""Johnny Major"" but look at the dude. He has the whole damn outfit.) Everyone speaks this hilarious not-quite-English that results in things like a farmer mangling attempts to hit on you for half a minute, and a hero who sounds like a drunken Garcia Hotspur from Shadows of the Damned.Bonus for some of you who will remember it: this is the game that was infamous on launch for having a RED, RED CAR! as a selling point. That's the kind of quality you're getting out of this whole game. Get in on the ground floor and pound it. Pound the ground. Pound of Ground.			"

												""Mindless fun"". Literally.Pound of Ground is a simple, open-world game, focusing on stemming the tide of a zombie horde in what is presumably the Western Wastes of the USA. The operative word here being ""simple"". You either shoot zombies, beat them about the skull with a bat, or run them down in your very own hot rod. There are little ""metagames"" strewn about, such as setting distance records for jumps in your car, or how far you can knock away a zombie with your bat, and these help stave off the monotony that sets in with every zombie-killing game.The graphics are chunky, and the voice acting is evident of a development team whose first language wasn't English, but the music is pretty cool, and the cartoonish nature of the visuals make up for any cutscenes you'll inevitably want to start skipping.The lack of polish on this game makes it hard for me to recommend to anyone when it's not on sale, but it's definitely worth at least a run through it's demo.

												Well, I just finished up Pound of Ground in two sittings and I was not impressed. I'm a fan of zombie shooters but woof, this one is rough... This game has crashed roughly ten times randomly during gameplay, which never happens while I’m playing any other game. Nothing more annoying than driving across the map over and over again after a crash from loading another section of the map.. It's full of repetitive missions and tons of open field back and forth driving. This game is only worth it if it’s on sale (75% or higher) and or you need a good laugh because the AI in this game is so awful that it’s actually funny. 6/10 and I’m being generous. I’m recommending the game because a D is still passing.			"

												Going into this - I was not sure what to expect.  What I foudn was a game that felt like a Playstation One generate title with pretty graphics.  That being said... the gameplay felt dated, repetitive, and clunky.  Overall the idea was there, and the graphics, but the actual combat felt clunky, boring, and the guns lacked power/aiming.  I got about 75% of the way through the game (Finished Snake City) and didn't feel like playing anymore.  This is a Third Person, cartoony style game, with lots of voice acting scenes, silly humor, -- in a sandbox open world style of levels.  Just didn't do it for me.  I estimate it takes a decent game 4 hours to beat.			"

												Let's start by the fact that it has a demo (+1), Always better trying a demo than buying a game and feel like being cheated.It is an open empty world. Meaning that you can run a lot, everywhere, and find nothing. just plain fields.Run, or drive. You got a car to enhance, by buying new engines, protective gear (SPIKES) And Nitro, helpful if you've got one of these moments where you want to jump from high cliffs. Careful tho, as your car is damageable and can lose parts of its body.Driving is quite enjoyable and responsive.You got 5 weapons (One of them is a baseball bat which sends zombie flying scoring home runs).You simply are an average hero who's going to save the world from a zombie invasion. Nothing more, nothing less.It's an average game, with a debatable humor (I found it funny, tho.), go-there-and-do-this-then-come-back mission type,a race, an entire city to free from mafia (Zombie).The soundtrack is pretty good, it's jut a bit limited and you'll end up hearing the same song three times in a row, too.Graphics aren't the best, but cities and other places are, in my opinion, detailed. By detailed I mean that there are a lot of particulars that add a bit more dynanism and entertain the eye. I often found myself moving the camera around, trying to find something odd, unexpected.After all I still recommend it: calling it the worst game ever is overly exaggerated, although there aren't 5 bosses and the story isn't exactly well written. It's just an average game, enjoyable if you don't expect that every game you own is a GOTY or received a score of 90 / 100.The only real advice I can give is to not buy it on full price, wait for at least 50% discount.

												Gameplay mechanics are decent.Driving is good, way better than the driving in Watch Dogs. You have some weapons you can choose from. Story is cheesy - and that´s a good thing. The game doesn´t take itself too serious. The negative comments probably come from the fact that the section where you get hunted by a rocket-launching truck might seem too hard at the beginning and the savegame isn´t placed that well either for this section. The art-style is fascinating - it´s not good but it has something steam-punky that catches you. The soundtrack is a bit misplaced - sounds a little bit like grunge. But it is bearable. Definitely a buy when on sale or in a bundle. - and don´t freak out during the chase-section - it´s really not that hard.			"

												Sometimes i don't understand what could've made people give negative comments on a game. Including this one. The game's great. It's all nice, fast-paced, easy-to-master action along with a lot of good humour in the story and dialogue. Normally i'm not the biggest fan of any comical setting, but i can't even mention this as a minus of the game. Cuz everithing or almost everithing in it is good or even great. Unless you don't get the right way to fight in it or forget that none in this game should be taken serious.The only real minus is that it crashes sometimes, when loading the next mission. But it's easily cured by restarting the game and replaying the last episode (which is normally short enough and not annoying if you like active fighting and extreme driving).P.S. And too much theoretical analysis can destroy any greatest hit's reputation).Не понял с чего так много негативных комментов, как будто не про эту игру речь вообще. Вполне классный, легкий в освоении экшен с юморным сеттингом и историей.			"

												First of all, let me just say I have no clue when or even how I got this game in the first place. Maybe I inavertently got it during a sale, or perhaps I got it from a friend...I honestly don't know. What I do know is, Pound of Ground is definately one of most awful and boring games I have ever played in my life.The story/script feels very uninspired, practically to the point where it almost feels as if there isn't a story at all...mostly just humor that feels forced and can be hard to listen to. The gameplay itself feels very bland and dull as well, considering practically all you do is run/drive place to place to engage in boring combat with zombies with whatever weapons the game gives you (mostly the baseball bat) and blow up the occasional generator. The pacing feels off at times, some levels are long and tedious, while others are rushed and sloppy. Oh, and sometimes the game just crashes for no apparent reason.Really the only redeeming factor to me is that some of the music is pretty cool, but the characters are too annoying and the gameplay is too repetitive and gets old quickly for me to enjoy it for long. Really the only way I can reccommend Pound of Ground is if you like to play terrible games with badly translated dialogue. Otherwise, steer clear from this one. 1.5/5.0			"

												Nice little game.You run/drive around and kill zombies.The story is told in a funny way, the graphics are ok enough.If you are bored, try it, it might be what you need to fill some time.Don't expect anything great but it is fun to kill zombies with your bat and get the more money the farther they fly because of your hit.Driving with the car is not too much fun but it is ok.I don't want to kill my time with this one, so I go on, but I can say anything more worse about it than: ""i have a lot of better games"". Like I said, if you are bored, try it.			"

												A qwerky mix of action, comedy and driving. A visually nice game with a HUGE map to drive around and strange characters to meet along the way. The game is a difficult one to figure out, it's trying to be a game like Psychonauts but also trying to be Grabbed by the Ghoulies. It's fun and has lots to do and explore but at the same time I can see alot of people getting bored with it. Driving is alot of times just going back and forth and it gets boring and hell, its a pretty big part of this game. However if you are a fan of Psychonauts or any of the games from Double Fine Sudios and early Rare Ware, like I am, then you may just find some gold in them there hills. 8/10			"

												This little game is incredibly stupid. The story, the protagonists, the dialogues. Really. In-cre-di-bly. But i would lie, if i'd say that i didn't enjoy it. Especially the zombie killing part. Actually it can be A LOT of fun, if you don't expect too much and switch off your brain for a few hours.			"

												This is a warning! Not that i belive that anyone on my friends list would ever consider buying this game, but if they do, DON'T. I cannot express how bad this game is and i only baught it because of its low price at the halloween sale. Christ, it ain't even worth 2,50, there is not a day that goes by without me regretting this purchase. GOOD GOD, this is a bad game.			"

												It's okay action adventure, I don' understand why everyone is mad. Don't look at time - I played a demo, and it was quite long. Funny thing that when you launch the game it tries to join you in its steam group and fails with that (""missing api key"" - yes, you can't just give someone a link to join steam group).			"

												Dear god stay away from this godless piece of crap game. How this was allowed to be sold is beyond me. The game's story is complete nonsense. The opening cinematic jumps all over the place about a farmer shooting down a ufo and the government dropping a nuke and the hero doesn't know who he is but just knows he has to do something about the zombies... besides the generic blah of the story the game is written AND VOICED in the most terribly broken english I've seen in a published game in years. Oh, and the level design is a cluttered mess and strips you of the ability to jump. So you can see you destination right in front of you but a tire or random debris blocks the way so rather than; oh I don't know, WALKING OVER IT you have to find a way around. I picked this game up on a sale and even though it cost about 5 bucks at the time I still feel cheated			"

												This happens to be one of the worst games I have ever played in my life and I'm not saying that lightly. It's bland; the shooting is terrible, the animations are terrible, the textures are terrible, the voice acting isn't even humorously bad, it's just bad, the driving is worthless, the collision detection is bad, even the hit detection is bad. It actually made me angry that someone could make such a terrible game and have it marketed over steam. After about an hour of trying to like the crap that I had bought, I deleted it and put in a game category called ""Happy thoughts"", so I wouldn't break my screen whenever I saw the name in my games list. On top of all of this, the choice of colors for the ""atmosphere' actually managed to hurt my eyes, the game is either too red, to blue, or too green. Not some reasonable shade either, the most annoying 5th grader powerpoint type colors, you know, the ones with the flashing lights and the animated slides. Stay away from this.			"

												Fairly short time waster, if you are looking for a hardcore zombie game, this is not it.The storyline is a bit half baked, and the utterly rediciouls diloge from most of the charecters show that the game does not take itself seriously.  Which works for it, as if it had tried to be a serious game it would have failed horribly.  But the sillyness and townsfolk that are apparently in the 'special needs' catagory, make it somewhat amusing.Often you will be in the car, which you can upgrade into a zombie murdering machine (that is, if you can manage to even run them over).  But the way the car handels is at times, a complete nightmare.It crashes fairly often for me, often while loading a cutscean or loading a diffrent zone, ocasionaly just getting in the car made the game freeze.  So it was difficult and lengthy just to get a single play through in.  The achievments are easy enough however, if your into one of thoes steam stat websites.Overall, 4 out of 10 dragons.			"

												Somehow it's like the old school games on Playstation 1. Not a bad game, maybe too easy and too short (6-8 hours of play).A little bug with your sight when you leave your car. My advice, don't leave your car when you are too close of zombies and/or wait some seconds before to walk.			"
