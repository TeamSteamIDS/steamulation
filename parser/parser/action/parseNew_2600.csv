												Since there's no chance in hell anyone's going to see this review, I guess there's no point in me telling you that this is objectively one of the greatest roleplaying experiences in video games ever. There is also no point in me telling you that white wolf unarguably makes the greatest vampires and one of the darkest atmospheres in any kind of game, just as there is no point in telling you that this is the kind of game that has to be experienced because we will probably never get another game like this again. And since nobody can see this, there's definitely no chance anyone will ever know that I personally recommend pirating this 100% so you don't accidentally fund a terrible publisher that ruined an amazing development team. But since this is just a review, you can make your own decisions.			"

												The looks of this game are somewhat dated, but some ardent fans have made a texture-and-bugfix pack that alleviates this a little. Game is surprisingly good at conveying the V:tM atmosphere of the better pen & paper sessions I've had (the worse ones got bogged down in dice rolling -- for a system called ""story teller"", the mechanics can be annoyingly gamist). Lets you play as any of the classic clans and either sex (but looks are determined by the combination of those two factors and can't be customized further, except with clothes). I thoroughly enjoyed this game, was sad when it was over, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone liking the pen & paper V:tM (or even just the Kindred: the Embraced show), and anyone enjoying a decent blend of fight/RP/drama elements, as long as you can get over the yesteryear graphics.If this is your kinda thing, wait till it drops to 9.99. If you're not sure, wait till it drops below 5 again. Then go for it. You'll thank me later.And then you'll be sorry because there is no multi-player, nor a steam workshop for additional campaign, so that all good things must come to an end.			"

												This is it. The quintessential vampire game. There are many reviews that highlight its pros and cons, so I will just say this: it's very good; play it. Be aware, however, that installing the unofficial patch isn't just recommended, but necessary, since the game is very buggy (which is by no means the developer's fault, but rather the publisher's). So check out the community hub for guides on how and where to get patches and various mods. First timers should also be careful in choosing the clan for their inaugural playthrough. For instance, Malkavian are a... peculiar breed, and some of the dialogue may be a bit confusing; you might also hear voices and talk to objects. Nosferatu, on the other hand, have an altered physical appearance (more ""monstruous""), so moving around and interacting with various NPCs can be a challenge; thankfully you can use sewers, and an innate cloaking ability. Even Ventrue can be difficult, because they are selective with their food; so you won't be able to feed off rats or homeless people. But all in all, the clans are pretty balanced, so it's down to personal preference29th Oct edit: It seems Paradox bought White Wolf, which means chances for a sequel have just gone up. By a lot. Rejoice!			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines is an immensely intriguing vampire-role playing game by Troika Games, and an exellent example of a ""flawed masterpiece"" and had a lot of things going for it.For starters, you are thrown into the game with the option of choosing between 7 different clans (vampire bloodlines) that each play a good bit differently. There's the Brujah: fast hard hitting rebels, the Gangrel: animalistic loners, the Malkavians: bat-**** crazy psychopaths, the Nosferatu: sneaky grotesque monsters, the Tremere: a vampire sect of blood mages, the Toreador: artsy fast vampires that are closer to humanity, and Ventrue: the most power hungry members of vampire society. Every single one of these classes feels distinct, as every clan has advantages and disadvantages. For example, the nosferatu get more blood from feeding on rats than the other Kindred (Vampire: The Masquerade's term for vampire), but cannot seduce anyone because of their monstrous appearence. The Ventrue are the only kindred that can use dominate (basically mind control) in dialogue, but they cannot feed on animals and may vomit when feeding on ""lowlife"" like street bums.Now, the gameplay is extremely engaging. Combat is fast, fun, and allows you several options. Every kindred clan has their own disciplines, or vampiric abilities, that allow you to choose your own approach to conflict. Do you use obfuscate to invisibly sneak past the goons? Or do you use ""fortitude"" to soak up their bullets and ""animalism"" to summon spectral wolves to tear them apart. It's your choice. Of course there are the standard ways of fighting: guns, unarmed, and melee weapons. There are a good variety of each weapon types (except unarmed) with upgraded weapons available to you along the way. Another potential tool for combat is feeding. As you need blood to maintain your sanity and use your disciplines, you will need to drink blood. You can drink blood from any humanoid you choose, hostile or not, but it can be more difficult to drink blood from hostiles. This is tempered by the fact that you have to stop yourself from completely draining innocent humans, but don't think twice about draining a thug. There is one problem with feeding, but I'll cover that later.I need to mention the dialogue too, as it's absolutely awesome. The facial expressions on the characters in this game are better than some of the facial expressions I see in the games coming out today, and the dialogue choices are absolutely brilliant. The Malkavians and Nosferatu get hilarious dialogue options, including an infamous one where a malkavian player character can actually get into an argument with a stop sign. A stop sign! And if I remember correctly, there's a conversation with a TV as well.The quest system is absolutely one of the best parts about this game. The side quests range from defeating demons to hunting down serial killers to fighting of zombies in a graveyard. You'll always have some sort of want to complete them because completing quests gives you experience, not killing enemies. I think this is an exellent system because this keeps you from being penalized for using stealth and guile over brute strength and bloodshed. There are quite a few missions where things turn out better in the end if you choose a stealthier, more thoughtful approach instead of going full Rambo. The main quest is no slouch either, with multiple engaging quests.I enjoy the game's atmosphere quite a bit. The endless night conveys a mysterious feeling (to be fair, it's not like you're character can feel the sun anymore) and the music lends itself to this. While sometimes the music can feel a little repetitive (combat music is determined by area, so if you get into lots of fights in one area, you're gonna hear that music a lot) I never found myself annoyed by it because it was good. There are lots of songs from real bands, such as Lacuna Coil and Tiamat.Now, time for the ""flawed"" part of ""flawed masterpiece"". The game was rushed out on the same day as Half-Life 2 because the idiocy of the game's publisher, Activition. As a result, the game has several glitches by default, so don't even think about playing the game without an unofficial patch of some sort. The late game feels less fun because it's all combat, and becomes quite tedious because before, combat was more spaced out. I don't mind mandatory combat sections, but the last portion of the game gets excessive with these. Because of the mandatory combat and power of late game weapons, if you don't have your gun skill fairly high by the end, you're screwed. Melee skills only work well when you're not being shot at by 10 enemies, and that's a rarity near the end. Also, the series of levels, the Nosferatu warrens/sewers can be very boring, unintuitive, and downright frustrating at times, as there are few sources of blood, annoying enemies, it's long as hell, and mandatory. Lastly, there is the problem with feeding. When used against normal human enemies, I don't mind it. But when it's used against a human boss, it's pretty overpowered. There is no way for an enemy to escape from your grasp besides you getting hit, so if you get your teeth on a boss while they're alone, they're done. But all in all, these things don't break the game by any means, but they should be mentioned.One last thing that makes the game great, and it should be no surprise what this is: mods. There are two mods particularly, Vampire: The Masquerade: The Final Nights, And Bloodlines Antitribu (although this one is somewhat buggy at the moment). Both (and other mods I'm forgetting ATM) add in cut content, new character models, brand new content and quests, and even new systems like the companion mods and blood loss that take the games immersion to new heights.If you had your interest piqued by this review, you should definitely pick up the game. Even now, more than a decade after the games release, I still give this game a playthrough every now and then, because it's just that good.			"

												This is not Twilight. This is not Dracula. This is not Anne Rice. This is not Buffy. This is World of Darkness... and a masterpiece.Vampire: TMB's world is mysterious and complex, rich with lore from White Wolf Publishing's WoD tabletop games. The quests are memorable, characters desperate, locations varied, and character customization extensive. It is easily one of the best written RPGs ever published, right up there with the Fallout series.I would blindly recommend this to anyone remotely into verbose games. NPCs have very unique insights into the world they live in, and constantly share their philosophies with the player (the voice acting is excellent). Naturally, anyone who finds themselves bored after a few paragraphs of hearing NPCs talk should skip this game.Edit:I should have probably also mentioned that although VTMB's writing is stellar, there is also quite a bit of combat. The game strikes a nice balance between letting you feel like a ridiculously overpowered rampaging creature of the night, and a mere shadow of other, elder vampires: some fights will be hilariously easy (especially against human foes), others will be tremendously difficult (high-level supernatural enemies, yikes!). Character creation and levelling up is very comprehensive, and should be a joy for anyone who likes putting thought into how they will play the game.Please note that the game was extremely buggy when released, and is moderately difficult to run on modern PCs. See here for post-installation instructions: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035Shoutout to modder Wesp5 for keeping this game playable even 10 years after its original release!

Don't forget to grab the unofficial patch by Wesp5 (updated until now!) who fix a TON of bugs and restore unreleased content.One of the best rpg I've played so far. A masterpiece.To put it simply: Fantastic story, amazing voice acting, great atmosphere, loving soundtrack, multiple ways to complete missions, dialogue changes depending on clan, high replay value and multiple endings.Combat mechanics are a bit odd and outdated but whatever.Highly recommended to all rpg fans.

												This is by far one of my favorite games. I seriously play it at least once every year or so. VTMB is not your basic Vampire RPG. The game allows you to switch between first and third person, features both melee and ranged combat, and allows you mutliple paths to any of your goals. This is set in White Wolf's World of Darkness universe. If you are familiar with table-top RPGs and the World of Darkness, good, if not that is okay (I was not).The World of Darkness is your basic modern urban fantasy universe. You the player take the part of a newly created vampire thrust into a world of intrigue and darkness where ancient vampires pull the strings of humanity and each other in ever-shifting alliances and plans. The game allows you a high degree of customization, when creating your character you can choose from one of 6 clans, which feature different superpowers that your character can build as you level. There are no classes, you build your stats how you want them. Your quests almost all feature multiple paths to completion. Need to kill a vampire hunter? Well you can talk your way into her place of work (if you got the speech skills), sneak around the pack and pick some locked doors (if you have the stealth and lockpicking skills), maybe hack some computers to put the place into lockdown and get civilians to leave the area (if you have the hacking skills), or maybe you just want to kick in the front door and go to work with your katana/shotgun/teeth&claws. In this game there are mutilple paths to your goal. A few different endings (choose one of the factions or yourself), and enless playthrough ability. Visit the community forums for this game and download the fanmade patches, they will give you extra quests, clans and plug some bugs.Seriously. I can't reccomend this game highly enough.			"

												Firstly, you will need the unofficial patch to play this (so here it is: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647.) The original devs were pushed to release this early by activision, thus it was very buggy. BUT that said, this is easily one of the best RPGs ever concieved. (Also ignore the low play time, for some reason when I installed the patch on my last system the patch only worked if I launched it off of steam, my play time probably numbers in the hundreds of hours.)So, Pros-The Role Playing aspect of this game is very deep, I haven't played a game in a long time that rivals it. You can play as one of 7 vampire 'clans' (which are basically sub species of a sort.) Each clan has it's own unique skill sets, meaning each clan have strengths and weaknesses. Whether it's the toreador with their seductive ability to manipulate practically anyone, the nosferatu, who can stealth their way into just about anywhere, or the brujah who are your more naturally brawling vampire type. Each of the seven clans has distinct strengths and distinct weaknesses. -Skill specialisation means that you can't be a jack of all trades, if you commit to being a silver tongued devil that talks their way into and out of everything, then you won't be as good at fighting. The opposite is also true, and considering that being good at persuasion/seduction doesn't result in bloodshed this means your vampire will naturally be able to accomplish things that a violent vampire would not, again the opposite is true.-Because of this, the game has vast replayability, as even a slightly different playstyle results in quite a different story. -Speaking of replayability, Malkavians are amazing, but they are insane, I would not recommend playing them on your first playthrough. Nosferatu can also be really fun, but are hard to play because you cannot be seen by mortals.-Leads me on to another important point. The Maquerade itself. The Masquerade is a conspiracy of vampire culture that maintains the illusion to mortals that they don't exist. Meaning that you can't behave in a supernatural way in certain areas, lest you violate the masquerade and incur the discipline of vampire culture. Certain abilities can still be used, depending on whether they are discreet or not, this is another layer of depth to the roleplaying system, as some vampire clans are naturally more capable in masquerade areas. For me personally, I am an avid player of the Toreador (It appeals to the part of me that adore the Anne Rice books.) This clan plays exceptionally well in masquerade areas because they are the most 'human' of all the vampire types, whereas the Nosferatu for example cannot be seen in these areas due to their appearance.-The Characters in this are not necessarily believable (some are very convincing, some are less so,) but either way the characters are... well... characters... You will love them, and you will love them a lot, the voice acting is amazing, and so is the facial animation, (which is ridiculously expressive, notice I say expressive, not necessarily realistic.) Dialogue options are also insanely awesome in a bethesda before bethesda kind of way. Cons-Combat (it pains me to mention it, but I have to.) The combat in this game doesn't bother me, but it can be a bit twitchy. Don't worry, we're not talking morrowind levels of twitchy, but it's a little twitchy nonetheless. But it's very easy to overlook because everything else in this game is so on point. -I should probably mention this as a con, but I just see it as an inevitable mechanic: There are points in the game where you simply cannot avoid intense combat. This can really annihilate a social vampire, so it's good to invest the odd point into ranged weapons once every now and then (because ranged weapons are generally the best thing to deal with the late game combat.) This seems to put some people off the game but it really doesn't bother me that much, and again i'm willing to overlook it because everything else in the game is done so damn well.In summary this game is one of the gems of the rpg genre, and you can't call yourself a fan of roleplaying games if you haven't checked this out. it is THE example of a flawed masterpiece; something which had so much ambition and very nearly lived up to it all but fell just a little short. But in spite of this the game is still way above average, and very close to perfection. And it represents something that more games developers should aspire to, because this game went for the moon, and damn nearly got there. Games aren't this ambitious anymore, they don't try to be this unusual any more, and if something did in this generation of gaming, it would truly be a masterpiece.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a RPG about vampires, their clans and that vampires don't show their true identity to humans for fear of being eradicated. First, vampires have a bad stand with gamers. They all remember how being a vampire sucked in Elder Scroll's Oblivion or how girls made them watch those stupid twilight movies. We have all been there, mate! ++ Jeanette and Therese.+ Good atmosphere+ Believable characters+ Picking a clan over another one matters.+ Big skill tree+ Good facial animations that hold up even today.+ Good first half of the game.+ Funny dialogue-- Major technical issues. Don't try out this game in an unpatched state. This game was an unoptimized and buggy mess when it was released and only the patches fixed it.- Combat could be better- Second half isn't as good nor fun as the first.- Some animations are awful- The endings felt a bit rushed. Some choices during the game should have mattered more.- Some maps or rooms needed more details or objects.The Masquerade is built on an early source engine version and was an unoptimized and buggy mess when it was rushly released. Note that installing either the official or the unofficial patch is essential. Additional links Unofficial Patch: http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patchPerformance issues can be solved by vampyri_lestat's guide: https://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/914819-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines/faqs/43148Replay value: Potentially high (with different endings, clans, skills and some choices during the game)Rating: 8.5/10Recommendation: Yes			"

												Bought this game while on sale thinking it was gonna be pretty so-so. I'd heard things about Vampire: The Masquerade before, but never actually tried it. Boy am I glad I did. This game is like a hidden gem. The graphics are outdated, but what else can you expect from a game that's over 10 years old? If you enjoyed being able to make your own story in Dragon Age or Mass Effect, you may enjoy Vampire: The Masquerade, as it allows you to choose conversation options and shape your character's path. Although you can't customise the appearance of your character (other than clothing), you can choose between 7 different races of vampires of each gender, each with different abilities. Other clothing options can later be bought from the different locations throughout the game, each giving more armour and a different look from the last.The story begins with your character and the opposite gender version of your character's race getting 'friendly', and your character will be Embraced (turned). Unfortunately, your sire has commited a violation of the Masquerade by Embracing someone without permission, and is executed for their crimes. Left sireless, after an intervention by the vampire Nines you are allowed a chance to live, but you must 'serve' LaCroix, the prince. During the story, you'll learn what Sabbat, Camarilla, Kuel'jin and many other things are. But I won't spoil the story for you, go play it yourself.The downside of this game is that, in order to play it, you must do a few things. There are a few bugs that will not allow the game to play on Steam. To combat this, you must run Steam in administrator mode and change the compatibility properties of Vampire: The Masquerade. I changed the properties to run the program in compatibility mode for Windows XP (Service Pack 3), and disabled visual themes and desktop compositions. Doing these steps should allow you to run the game. But that's not all. Even though this game is old, there are still unofficial patches being made for it. I recommend installing Wesp's unofficial patch 8.9 at least, as this will fix the resolution error with the game and make the interface clear instead of blurry. Each patch contains everything from the patches before, so you can install the latest one without missing anything. The patches fix a lot of bugs and add things to the game. However, with each patch you must make it a fresh install, delete everything from the patches before (this includes your save files) and replace them with the new patch. The game may crash if you do not do this. You should replace the folder named Vampire inside your Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines folder with the patch folder, which will also be named Vampire. You must also disable the auto updates for the game in the Steam properties, or it may install the old official patch over your unofficial one.Overall, I really enjoyed this game. Some of the boss fights were quite challenging, there is a lot of side quests and missions to keep you occupied, and you can choose your character's destiny in the world of darkness. You can choose to be a saucy seductress, a badmouthed badass, anything really. And if you choose a Malkavian, you'll have different conversation options than the other races, as Malkavian's have a sort of split personality and insanity. I wish there was a sequel or something. Sucks that the World of Darkness MMO based on this universe was recently cancelled as I was looking forward to it, but what can you do.~ 9/10 ~			"

												VTMB is probably the most glitching game ever, but that doesn't really matter as I'm enjoying its amazing story and gameplay over and over again. There's always a new way somewhere to do things differently, depending on your clan, skills, gender and behavior. I'm so sorry that vampires have been so unpopular lately, but let me tell you, this is a classic. Sex, violence and fun, sometimes madness, just as it's supposed to be with vamps. I really really like the 1st and the 3rd person view switch! I give it 9,89/10! Can't wait for the HD rebirth :)			"

												It has everything a good RPG needs: A deep class system, interesting story, fun dialogue, frantic first- and third-person combat, set in an atmospheric world inhabited by humans and vampires alike. You play as a vampire and whilst having access to a vast and diverse array of powers (depending on your chosen class), you will also have to disguise yourself so as not to be discovered by humans and thus breaking the ""Masquerade"". Along with the main quests, the world is filled with many fun side missions, both of which are told through rich and interesting dialogues delivered by some great voice acting.Overall a great and unique game set in an atmospheric world; especially a must have due to its refreshing and unused setting.

Posted: December 31, 2014
												Many moons ago a developer named Troika Games released Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines yet through its lifetime it has managed to linger behind the curtain despite the generally unrivalled quality it bears. I wish to open the curtain and propose you to join me in this ‘sombre dance’. To start off you get to choose between 7 quite varied classes, called clans. Want to play as a Nosferatu and deal massive damage but have the sewers as your main travel path, or would you rather be of the noble kind, a master of eloquence and persuasion but lack physical prowess? Or maybe you fancy the clinically insane that suffers from schizophrenia? I chose the clinically insane because... well as if you wouldn't...and it turned out I chose well because the Malkavian is indubitably one of the most creative character you can play in video games.From the start, you'll notice major technical issues and design decisions that indicate the game was released on its last legs. Their dream nearly did indeed turn to dust as the company went bust soon after its release. In spite of this, the team managed to make a game that unfortunately today is a merely an ash, but a game that still to this day goes against the grain. Eventually an (unofficial) patch was released that made the game much more playable. It takes a very conventional approach to customization. On offense you can choose to specialise in guns, unarmed, melee and powers known as disciplines. The defensive counterparts also exist. Each clan has its own set of disciplines that you can specialise in. In addition you can level up skills including hacking, lock picking, intimidation, seduction, research etc and some of these skills add extra dialogue options which can lead to otherwise unavailable rewards. Loot isn’t as abundant as in Bethesda games for example but it exists in moderate amounts. The game features your standard health bar and a blood bar for good measure. You fuel your blood bar by using civilians as sustenance. The refuel rate varies on the civilian type and caution is required since if you get caught you lose masquerade points and once that reaches zero you lose the game for reasons you can find out for yourself. Additionally killing civilians (for example) will lower your humanity and once that reaches a certain point your character does bad things. The graphics are dated but definitely passable.These aforementioned issues, these run of the mill customization options are ultimately trivial because the game manages to supersede its faults completely as it ironically isn't devoid of spirit and soul. The game induces perturbation, states of uneasiness, disorientation and even sheer unadulterated terror in both expected and unexpected locations that’ll make you just wish you could give it a maniacal final vale and go make a sandwich while playing Skyrim or something. It isn't all doom and gloom though. This atmosphere, this ‘sombre dance’ can quickly shift to an upbeat vampiric club rave (literally). Of course this tonal shift is entirely at your digression but it's this type of juxtaposition that makes the sinister and foreboding moments all the more significant. The game has quite a few unique takes on conventional missions and a cast of absolutely impeccable characters. These characters can be usually manipulated depending on the clan you choose. For example If you choose the insane schizophrenic, you can use mind control on people to make weird gigglies and other disturbing lines come out their facehole which consequently will make gigglies come out of your facehole. To please the masses there’s also tons of philosophical yet hilarious one liners too.As an encore the game washes you with its masterful soundtrack. It’s an eclectic bunch of tunes that amplify the various moods you’ll feel in the game. Whether it’s ominous or calm, frantic or upbeat it does its job. At times there’s an absence of music where ambience is created by the sound of the world around you which in my mind is a soundtrack in itself. This natural ambience can be felt in many places but for the majority of people it will be most memorable in the Ocean House Hotel, considered by those who’ve experienced it as one of the most frightening areas in video games, alongside Shalebridge Cradle from Thief Deadly Shadows. No other game has matched the level of trepidation I felt in The Ocean House Hotel.Upon release, a significant portion of those who played it hated it because it was marred by its technical issues of which it became infamous for but the biggest cause of its demise was its release alongside Half Life 2. Luckily the game is still on sale today so bless your blood vessels by biting into this magical game like the pale lotus eater that you know you are because once you are done, you'll realise that this product, in this large market where the generic usually flourish most, is an ensemble of special silence and Troika's genuine, bittersweet farewell kiss.Mod Recommendations: Unofficial patch: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647 "

												Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a RPG from publisher Activision and developed by Troika Games. For years I'd been hearing from various people about  how great this title is and now that I've played it I must totally agree. Roleplaying games are my bread and butter so this title definitely delivers with its core RPG elements. You create your character and as you progress through the game you acquire experience points which you can then distribute to many different skills and abilities thus allowing you to customize your vampire to your liking and particular style of play be that close or long ranged combat or stealth. The game is action oriented and played in either a first or third person perspective similiar to say Fallout 3 or New Vegas. Graphically the game is dated especially compared to many of the titles from recent years but with the addition of the unofficial patches by Wesp5 and various others you can update the title with high resolution textures and an abundance of bug fixes and enhancements that make it look fairly great for a game that was released so long ago. I myself am a fan of games with retro and outdated graphics and this title just has a nice style to it that fits the dark and forboding theme perfectly. Even better, the dialogue that I've been having throughout the game is one of my favorite aspects of the title as the voice acting is top notch and done so very well. Released in 2004 this game also seems to have been doing things slightly ahead of its time...things that we take for granted as they are very common place in the games of today. Pound for poind I'm loving this title and plan to spend many hours playing it so it is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! P.S.-Thanks to Section Nine http://steamcommunity.com/id/Section9/ for providing the links to the patches for the game.			"

												TL;DR - you can suck blood and dance in clubs 11/10Oh Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines, you were and still are ahead of your time. You had a great soundtrack before great soundtracks were necessary.You have an incredibly absorbing world full of darkness and gothic tropes that are executed flawlessly and make you root for characters that would otherwise haunt our dreams.You have the Masquerade violations that can kill my game regardless of how powerful I think I am. No law like the Vampire law.You make vampires and other creatures of the night the terrifying, evil creatures they are instead of love-sick babies.You have a haunted house level that puts some modern horror games to shame.You have the ability to dance before dancing in clubs was cool in RPGs.You have a plot that makes my blood pressure rise and fall like I'm being drained by a hideous Nosferatu.You have a LOT...of bugs.But,You have us, dear Vampire...you have us to patch you and bring you to a new generation on Steam.R.I.P Troika and long live the Masquerade.

												Great opportunity in the Halloween sale to pick up this legendary game very inexpensively.  I highly recommend this game, at least then nobody can say you haven't played it.Upgrading your character is pretty much the same as the pen and paper RPG, which itself is very straightforward.The atmosphere of the game is excellent and not at all like the whiny vampires of recent genre pieces.Characters and story are pretty memorable, with a couple of npcs changing and upgrading depending on the choices you make within game - I can't say much more about that without spoiling the story, but good luck to you with achieving the best results!Technically, I would expect most pc to be able to handle this game; it's a bit poorly optimised which is understandable if you know the games' history.Overall, very highly reccomended!

												Bruh its a vampire game where vampires don't sparkle, buy itEdited------After the poplularity that my review has gotten I have desided to create a real review of Vampire: the masquerade Bloodlines. By far it's a classic rpg that set the standard for a new generation of rpgs, if your ok with a lot of bugs and not the best graphics due to being outdated this is like a game equal to Skyrim in how much fun and how much time you can put into it. There are a total of 8 playable vampire races that are all very different and provide a different experience that never really gets old, just don't play as a Nosferatu♥♥♥♥♥♥becomes impossible to play as. There are a bunch of different play styles that include, guns, melee weapons, magic. As long as your ok with a good amount of bugs drinking the blood of everyone, and a huge spike in diffculty by the end of the game and the graphics, this game is probably a 9/10 truely a masterpiece in the field of role playing games and if you are a fan of rpg games I personally recommend this game to any and everyone.

												Vampire; the Masquerade - BloodlinesBefore purchasing please note you will need to download an Unofficial Patch to fully get the game to work.Storyline, lore and depth is heavy in this game. When you first lay eyes on it, it might be an eye sore, but trust me. Start to sink your fangs into the first few victims and get lost into the twisted personal horror game that lets you cling to your humanity while witnessing unGodly, unspeakable things... or let loose and become the monster you always wanted to be all the while walking the thin red line of not breaking too many Kindred laws.The RPG element comes from the table top version of the game, point in intel, point in strength, point in charisma or melee, the concept is easy to use for beginners and easy to follow if you hover your mouse over any stat. It will tell you exactly what other stats benifit from your choices. Lacking in Hacking? Lacking in lock picking? (Dues Ex - like skills) Just add points to whatever helps you make you better at what you like doing.Game play: When you start you pick a clan, each clan has their own strengths, their own weaknesses. Adding to the replay value of the game. Brawl your way, punk your enemies into submission, lie or whisper sweet nothings into the humans' ears to manipulate them into giving you what you want. Stealth your way through the city via sewers and back alleys, stick to the shadows - or walk among the humans and other vampires as their superior. It's all up to you.Lots of side quests and though the world is not too vast (hence the game was made in 2004) you will have plenty to do with the portions of the city you have access to. Some you will need to gain specific skills, others you will get to as the game progresses.The music is awesome. 90's and early 2000's gothic/rock, dark metal music. Will be looking for the OST of this game.Voice acting, Jeanette! And many others. Even a popular actor from the TV show Futurama voice acted in this. Jeanette's voice actress did a role for Harley Quinn as well. Love her work! One of the strongest parts of this game is conversing with the NPCs. Some are funny, others will make you annoyeed, but none will be boring. Certain powers and certain social skills will effect how NPCs interact and react to you. Some you will need to threaten, if your threat is high enough, some you will have to persuade, others you have to flirt with, and some (if you pick clan Malkavian) you can just talk crazy talk with them. All adding to the depth of each NPC and some making you wish you could talk with them all night long.The game is a Horror game, and some jump scares, but the feeling I get from playing the game... CREEP FEST. The atmosphere of the game when you get into a haunted house, or exploring a mad house, or going into a den of those trying to hurry the end of the world... and the sewers! It will make you think twice about opening a manhole, in real life and in game.Over all this game is a CULT CLASSIC. If anything, get it and play it so when you nerd it out with your friends online or in person, you can give them lots of bloody tales of your own experiances in Vampire - Bloodlines.9.5 / 10 Play it! Worth every penny at full price and at 75% off. No reason not to on a big sale!			"

My Review on VTMBTl:dr Awesome game with (in my eyes) no downside, high replayability, nice characters and a dark story/atmosphere. If you are not sure if you want it, wait for a sale. If you have no problem with older games in your library and love RPG’s, get it instantly and stop reading.Now to the main part of the Review....So I was thinking that I need a new RPG to play. It should have a nice story, good gameplay and some open choices for the player. After a long time searching I found Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. I waited for a long time, before grabbing it on sale and what can I say....I love it.First things first as you may read in other reviews, this game has many bugs. Luckily there is a nice Community that fixes them and brings patches for the game. Before you play it make sure you download the latest patch found here: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647. Now let’s start with The Review itself, why do I love this game so much? First, it is inspired by the Vampire: The Masquerade Pen and Paper, and the universe of it, a universe that is deep and complex, and instantly took a place in my heart, where Vampires live along mortal people with rules they have to keep, called the Masquerade. In that world, there are 7 playable and some more (Npc only) Clans that all play in a different way and even have a small impact on your story. The Clans are called: Brujah, Gangrel, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue. At the beginning you pick 1 of these, decide if you are female or male (sadly no more customization) and then you allocate your ""standard skill points"" in your character sheet, whilst every clan has his own abilities and different bonuses on some of the attributes.Then the Story starts. After a pretty, long but well-made intro sequence you can control your character. The controls feel a bit strange at first and you may have to enable mouse look in the options to get a free camera, everything else should feel similar to rpg players/source users.The graphic is also well designed and fits the dark theme of this game perfectly well, as does the synchronization. What I liked was the fighting style. You have different melee and ranged weapons that reach from a Tire Iron and a magnum to a katana and a flamethrower. While you fight in 3rd person with your melee weapons, you switch to 1st person while using your ranged firearms. Also nice : most of your attributes increase more than 1 ability, example: 1 point of dexterity will get you +1 lockpicking and +1 sneaking skill, strength will get you +1 unarmed and +1 melee and so on, so there are many different ways to design and actually play your character, which leads to the next point. The Story has to my knowledge 5 endings, that trigger with your final choice and your positioning to the factions (called sects), which are the Camarilla (the ""standard"" vampire community) the Anarchs (fighters against the Camarilla) and the Kuei-Jin (eastern vampires that are slightly different). And while you don't actively decide your standing, your actions that you make in the story ""speak"" for you.And finally The Difficulty...... I love it. The Disciplines between the clans are well balanced and with the right combination of Disciplines and weapons, even the hardest bosses turn to ash in seconds (recommandation: Flamethrower)So what can I say.... I guess the fact I recommended the game and my playtime + this review are showing it is worth playing, but again get the unofficial patch and if you are unsure get it on sale. Now excuse me while I enjoy my 2nd playthrough.			"

												This game is a cult classic.  You should be warned that this game is broken and will not function on most modern machines.  There is an Unofficial Patch made by Wesp5 that fixes nearly all issues with the game and also adds new content. Based on the board game, and sequel to Redemption, you play as a fledgling Vampire in California.  The story starts as you create your character.  Here you choose your background, bloodline, and gender.  Backgrounds change your stats slightly and your powers as a vampire will differ depending on your bloodline.  Some bloodlines have some side effects, however.  The best examples are Malkavians and Nosferatu.  Malkavians are insane and schizophrenic.  You'll talk like a crazy person, hear voices in your head and see things other people don't see.  Nosferatu are cursed in a different way as they can't be seen by humans without violating the masquerade.  This does not make it impossible to beat the game as a Nosferatu, because the main quest NPC's will still be approachable.The masquerade is a system in the game where if you get 5 bad marks it's game over and you'll be executed by your peers.  You earn bad marks by displaying certain powers in public or are seen feeding.  You can redeem yourself if you have bad marks by protecting the masquerade.  This usually involves killing someone who is speaking  too much or who isn't playing it safe like all other good little vampires should.  Graphics are decent and passable.  The game is an older game, so don't expect mind blowing visuals.  City hubs are fairly small but there's a lot to find if you set your mind to it.  There are some nice facial animations that you won't even see in games nowadays which adds to the immersion.  There's also several mods for the game to add atmosphere and even more depth to the classes.  Gameplay is basic.  You shoot things, you smash things.  You talk to people, you kill people.  There are extra dialog options if you level your seduction, intimidation, or persuassion skills.  These skills can be vital to completing some quests perfectly.  You can also recieve bonuses from certain NPC's for having them at the required level at certain points in conversation.  You gain experience from doing quests and you level up to gain strength, wisdom, guile, skill, and become more attractive.  If you're sexy enough you get free hookers! Just like IRL! =P  The beginning of the game will mostly be fetch quests, with a few baddies to either slaughter or let live.  It's a game where you can put the fate of nearly everyone around you in your hands.  Being good is rewarded with extra perks like your very own slave ghoul girl, or an extra item/money/experience.  There's also a decent but easy stealth system that's based on how many points you have in stealth.  If you max out stealth, are in the shadows and crouch you're pretty much invisible.  There are also assassinations you can do with each weapon while stealthed and behind your victim.  My favorite is the baseball bat.  :)Audio is very good as well.  Just make sure you turn Environmental Effects off or there will be a constant echo.  Voice actors are all top notch and AAA grade ones that you'll know if you've heard them before.There are some very good mods for this game available as well.  My favorite being the original Unofficial Patch Plus, but there are other that increase the difficulty of the game and add new quests and bloodlines to choose from.  When installing these big mods you need to remember that they aren't compatible with eachother.  E.G. Final Nights mod will not work with Camarilla Edition nor with either work with the Unofficial Patch.  Both mods have an Older version of the Unofficial patch that come with it, which still fixes a lot of bugs.  There's also several mods  that are still being produced constantly by fans.  Every now and then you should check up and see what new mods are out to keep you coming back for more. All in all, if you are in need of a good RPG that's open world with a lot of freedom and are tired of Fallout 3/NV, Skyrim, etc.  Then you should definately check this game out.  Especially if it's on sale.  Well worth every penny spent.			"

												Oh, Bloodlines. The epitome of ""cult classic"". This game is the most unpolished gem I've ever seem in my gaming life. It was difficult to overlook it's many bugs, and in it's time, this game suffered from incredibly poor losses (also because of a bad business launch date). However, as the time passed and the modding community adressed most of it's glaring problems, this game finally blossomed into an experiece worth of the pantheon of the best RPGs ever made.Because make no mistake: underneath that filthy layer of bugs and it's shortcomings of production/lack of content, lies one of the best RPGs ever made. Seriously. I wholeheartedly recommend you to buy it, whatever the price tag is, with a simple caveat: use the mods that fix it otherwise your experience will be undeniably disapointing.The way the IP behind this game is treated (Vampire: The Masquerade, one of the best storyteller RPGs ever) is incredible, it will plunge you down to the World of Darkness and hook you up with an engrossing mature story with all the right touches of horror and sensualization we all love about vampires. Never before or since playing a vampire character would be so cool.The mechanics are not the high point but enough to be called ""good"". The engine is the same as Half-Life 2, and it aged pretty well. The voice acting is ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING. The story as multiple endings and the choices you make matter (to some degree), making for an incredible narrative. The Vampire Storyteller progression system is here, with slight tweaks, and it's awesome.You basically play as one of the classic Camarilla clans. I won't say much more, because the word of advice here is THIS GAME IS WORTH IT< VERY MUCH WORTH IT, JUST USE THE MODS TO FIX IT. "

												One of the best video games of all time and one of my eternal favorites.The world, story and atmosphere are unparalelled.In contrast to other known Vampire fictions, this one happens in modern day Los Angeles where by luck (bad or good) a steamy night of wild debauchery drains all of your bodily fluids and thrusts you into the world of the undead.Even though the stiffs are divided between faux-regality and anarchists, they all follow rules of the Masquerade - as a bearded man once said ""Sheep need not know that the wolf is here"". And by all of them i mean those who are not hairy beasts or necromantic golems of stolen flesh. But that's another story.A choice of 7 clans offers gameplay more diverse than any class choice in any other game ever could.You're not just picking your skills and appearance here. You're picking your unlife.For instance, as a diabolic Tremere you will often find yourself using the blood magic exclusive to your clan to explode your enemies from inside out.As a deformed Nosferatu, your non-human appearance will force you to live and travel through the sewers, as any human who sees you will surely get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heart attack triggering 6 GTA Police stars.Meanwhile as my favorite - an insane Malkavian, you will be a spoiler spewing machine who encounters events exclusive to those not of sound mind and all of your dialogue choices will represent your twisted psyche - in a hilarious way.The game is packed with varied weapons if you think that a revolver would be a nice bonus to the vampiric powers, a lot of side-quests if you're thirsty for these, and a cast of characters that you will not forget. Like a vampire♥♥♥♥♥♥who sure likes to party, half of the time.Just be warned, use Wesp's Unofficial Patch. Devs meant well but they were cut short, thankfully community has carried on their legacy.The game is a must play.			"

So this just gives more reason to play this game!			"

												A game that's been both a wonderful gift and terrible curse for me. Despite the struggles it faced upon first release and the obvious flaws (lovingly patched by the ever-dedicated fans) V:TM-B wins me over time and time again. I daresay it's my favourite game. I'd also wager it's one of the most re-downloaded games out there. Sadly, there's also the greatest downside to this game - there's not much out there like it. If you're like me and end up adoring this little gem, you'll discover that soon enough. It's pretty much spoilt other RPG's for me.Of course, Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption exists. Try it. It's not the same. Eternal struggle.It's a cult classic for a reason.			"

Part of you will want to see where the story goes, even as another part will want to go back into the dark to suck blood and kill the wicked, and that mix will keep you plowing onward.Not only did Vampire: The Masquerade redefine the RPG genre but it was also one of the best RPGs back in the day and is worthy of anyone's software collection.

												A truly unique game. Even if you're not a huge fan of the vampire/werewolf mythos like me, you'll still have quite a bit of fun in this game because it immerses you into its world so effectively. Troika deserves full marks for this one, even though the game has its issues and the numerous glitches that the community has worked greatly to improve. Those same efforts only highlight how much this game is almost universally loved by those that try it. Great game, definitely recommend trying it, if you're on the fence that badly wait for a price drop but please do yourself a favor and play it at the very least.Do not play without the community-made patches, however, as the game was rushed and contains glitches galore without said patches.Here's to hoping White Wolf or someone else ""embraces"" this franchise and brings it back from the dead.

												 As a rule, when a game is so poorly made that it almost doesn't work without a fan patching it, I normally consider it a failure. When the last half of a game is just a maze with enemies that you kill while feeling lost and confused and the combat system is pretty sub-par, I consider it a waste of money... ... But the first half of this game is So Bloody Good! It has story! It has characters! It has non-violent solutions if you're a social character! It has sneaking solutions if you're a stealth character! It has hacking and knowledge solutions if you're an intelligent character! Remember how everyone praised Deus Ex for having all these things? Multiple solutions to problems that allow your character to focus on things other than shooting and stabbing? This was like that, only you drink blood! Then there's the last half of the game... You can almost feel the moment that the money runs out and Activison come knocking at the door, demanding the alpha build be put in stores tomorrow. There's a perceptible shift from multiple solutions, story focus and character driven conversations into: ""Go to this place and kill everyone. Enter this 5 x 5 room. You see 3 orcs, roll to hit the nearest one!"" This game was almost something very beautiful but, like a relationship with a shallow woman, it just needed more money thrown at it! Like heating a microwave dinner, it really needs more time than they gave it. Buy it on the cheap, patch the game, play the first half... If you reach the part where you have to start just running around and killing enemies constantly and you're invested, see it out, otherwise maybe use a cheat or something and just skip the boring, endless corridors of mooks.

												This is easily my top favorite game of all time. The atmosphere is incredible, the story is inticing. I loved just about everything in this game. My only complaints are 1) There's lots of glitches (However with Mods it is completely fixable, and there is even added content with some)2) Graphics are a bit outdated now (There are mods to help, but they can only go so far)I REALLY hope there is a VTM 2 in the future.

												This game is the definition of style. The atmosphere, the visuals, the characters, the music, all of those things get you right in the mood to walk on the streets of LA as one of the cursed undead. If you like vampires and/or RPGs, then you quite simply need to play this little gem.However, you must know that the game is kinda buggy and needs a bit of fixing from your part, so make sure to download the unofficial patch.

												I doubt I'll see anything else like this for as long as I live. That's the true tragedy of V:TMB. As the years pass, and the game industry grows increasingly stagnant and problematic, only the biggest most profitable game franchises can survive. This means that year after year we'll keep seeing the Elder Scrolls, the Call of Dutys, the newest Mario spin, and whatever else; probably Final Fantasy 55 at this point. Point is, a game like this wouldn't even come close to piercing the surface of mainstream interest, let alone acclaim. So, firstly, enjoyment in this game hinges entirely on how much you like vampires. This game takes after the actual role playing lore and books very closely. That means a lot of weird terminology, specifics, and politicking. Unfortunately, this is where V:TMB runs into problems. Limitations, namely. I can see the vision the creators had, and their dedication to the niddy gritty is appreciated, but the game is held back by itself in a lot of cases. This is a clunker of a game, and I don't think anyone would be able to defend that. Everything feels so... Crude. It just doesn't hold a candle to games that had their engine in better order. Even contemporary or earlier games could handle some of these problems. Inventory management is a chore. Flipping through separate pages for items is a pain. What's worse is the combat, which won't get any mercy from me. It's pretty bad. And not bad in the charming way. Just bad. Things rapidly go downhill after your first fight. Hits lack impact, and the thrill of sending enemies spinning with a three hit combo wears off fast when every enemy in the game does that. Ranged combat fares the same. None of the guns feel especially satisfying to use; aside from maybe the sniper rifle, but that's just from the sheer power of it.But let's talk about something immediate. This game won't run without a patch. It simply can't understand recent hardware enough to run without a patch. The thing is, this game hasn't been updated at all. The original creators left this game in a state, like a poor abandoned puppy. So, downloading a patch will be your first order of business if you buy this game. Which, I don't know why you would, considering its current year, but whatever.What about the rest of the game? The characters in general are very convincing for their roles. I wanted to talk to them as much as I could. Customization for the player character isn't what I'd consider modern, but it is very interesting. How you want to play will likely rest on your choice of lineage, or vampire clan. Sidequests on the whole are rewarding. The plot itself is interesting, sure, but falls short on some points. It feels like you get some real choices here. Not only with what kind of ending you want, but also how you want to play, or role play, I should say. I have yet to see another video game that legitimately lets you play an insane person; an insane person that speaks in gibberish riddles no less. Now, whether that's a result of my patch or the base game, I'm not sure, but its impressive nonetheless. This game makes big strides for player freedom, but has limits of its own to worry about. It feels like you're put on story rails, and after a while of playing the main storyline, I'll admit, it got a bit exhausting. It seems like everywhere I turned in this game, it was lacking that extra bit of grandeur it desperately needed. It's a shame.It's dated. It hasn't aged well. It tries, sure. It chugs along as well as it can. But what goes through my mind when I play this game isn't ""wow what a blast from the past,"" its more like ""what would this game look like if it was made today with twice the budget?"" This is a true role playing game. There's rolling dice for damage. There's leveling up your stat points, and spending blood points to use any one of your hereditary vampire powers. This is serious nerdery at work here, and I love it, because no other games but the most fringe nerd experiments would embark on this complete transition. Its exceptionally admirable. But apparently it wasn't made to be. Instead we get rpgs that streamline and dumb down formulas. We get games that are rpgs in name only, We get games that fail to bring anything interesting to the table at all.What I'm saying is, this game is a miracle. For every stilted exchange, there is a cool little sidequest. For every half finished stealth section, there is a piece of interesting lore shown to you. Whatever immovable objects that had to align to make this game possible, I'm thankful for them. It might not be the best or most entertaining game, but damned if its not a piece of gaming history. Unlike Fallout, its unlikely that this franchise will ever see the light of day. But for a quaint little vampire game, that's not too bad.			"

												The stronger points of the game are that it has a fantastically dark atmosphere, believable and often intense characters (something which alot of games lack), and a solid storyline that does the game justice. Also, you choose at the beginning which bloodline (faction) you are part of, which will directly affect your relationships with the characters in-game, offering variation and replayablility, if you don't mind already knowing the storyline the second time through. Finally, the level design is very well done, giving varied and interesting locations that will keep your interest, no rampant cookie-cutter design here.On the down side, it is a dated game, having been released in 2004, so you will probably only get the most out of it if you don't mind the avatars looking a bit blocky compared to what you might be used to. I'm sure it was 'fairly' close to cutting edge graphics in 2004, but if you can look past it, the game will suck you in and you won't notice.It was mentioned that the game doesn't feel finished by one reviewer, and while I disagree, I can see why that might come up. The game is completely set at night, so far as I can remember, so you won't get the bustling city feel that daytime would bring, and also it doesn't have a huge amount of side quests that seem to pack into games these days (to cover up lack of original content), but there is plenty to keep you occupied.. you won't get bored.Also, apparently the game was quite buggy at release. I'd used the official patch when I played it, and didn't come across any problems. I certainly didn't come close to checking on forums, as one or two others had, but everyone plays a game differently, and it's becoming standard practice to check forums rather than think a problem through, or work around it. Regardless, apparently the unofficial patch made by fans is the best, from what I gather.Overall I greatly enjoyed the game and thought it to be underrated, definately a pleasant surprise. At no point did I get bored, even though there are many areas, nor did I question whether I'd see it through to the end, unlike quite a few games which get churned out. The storyline was interesting, and I found myself carefully watching the behaviour of all the characters, not quite sure who to trust, as it should be in a vampire underworld. The hotel level was especially spooky, I might add ;) good job on that. I only wish that there was a sequel.			"

Initial Note: Don't be fooled by my game time as shown by Steam. I own the boxed version and have completed it in excess of 5 times, so spent a fair few hours in this one.A flawed but o-so beautiful gem. A game that is pure genius, oozes atmosphere and drags you in. If it wasn't for the bugs, clunky combat and lackluster final stretch of the game, it would be a masterpiece.... well, to be honest, it IS a masterpiece, in-spite of that. An RPG at heart, built on the original Source engine, it is a game like no other. I have not played a game that pulled me in quite like this since, and I doubt I ever will do again. Its characters, story and the adult way in which it plays out is simply gaming gold. If you try it, I would highly recommend getting hold of the community patch - which fixes 95% of what was wrong with the game at launch. Please, developers - give us more games like this.

												I hate RPG genre games, I have never been able to play them but this game showed me the light.Pros:                                                    Voice Acting is Superb!

The Sects.Character Skill Tree.Side Quests.Radio Podcast (seriously take a break and listen to it).Atmosphere and Soundtrack.Cons:   The Graphics didn't age well (But it's fine by me). The Loading Screens so many off them.The Game becomes less Talk and more Action near the end.The NPCs lack Variety in character models.This game came out in 2004 rushed, the team worked tirelessly with the odds stacked against them. I recommend playing this game with a non history made character as it makes sense since your'e an average person, newly ""embraced"". To play this game you MUST INSTALL the 'unofficial patch 9.4' at least, Special Thanks to all the programmers and community members that volunteered with polishing up this game.

												One of the best games I have ever played, I haven't even beaten it yet I think the furthest I've got Chinatown. If you want to play a true RPG, where dialogue is important along with how you progress your character. It has a unique mix of urban and supernatural. The game is from 2004 though so the combat is simple and the graphics leave a lot to the imagination but you won't get an experience like this from any other game of the era.God please grant me a sequel the this game.

												I hate vampires, but I absolutely love this game.This game is a classic RPG. You choose a clan and your starting stats, and choose how to build your character as you go. The world is interesting and fun to explore, and you will meet plenty of interesting characters along the way. Considering I've stuck with mostly fantasy RPGs, and some post-apocalyptic RPGs, this one is a breath of fresh air, and tempts me to behave in a way I don't normally in other games. Replay value is high, since clan choice highly effects dialogue, playstyle, and vampiric abilities.Grab the unofficial patch, and enjoy!			"

												I've just completed my first playthrough, and all I can say is consider me a parrot. Anything positive or negative you see in someone else's review is no doubt something I will also be saying.In short:-It has its share of flaws, primarily in the combat - but it doesn't matter. There's nothing else like it, especially in todays market. I found the combat a bit clumsy but enjoyable, and only the occasional bugs made me swear in anger. I got this bug a few times where I couldn't change weapons or couldn't change my view from third to first person. It got annoying, but reloading usually fixed it.-Class variety is excellent. (I've watched other people let's play classes besides the one I chose, and the actual storylines and character to character interactions vary drastically with some classes; The gameplay experience will also be very unique with some character types.)-Multiple outcomes for missions/multiple ways to approach missions (think Deus Ex but a bit dialed back in some cases) plus multiple endings.-Great story, great characters, great voice acting.-------------------------------If you do want to get this game, make sure to download and install the Unofficial Patch. It's a simple google search and drag and drop install, and it fixes many issues with the game and even adds missing quest lines and balances combat for the better. There is no reason not to experience this title. I waited many years, always thinking to myself it would be too dated, too cheesy, not worth it, etc. I was wrong. From start to finish, you will be under this games spell - like a devilishly handsome vampire seducing you with his cold stare. Embrace the night, uphold the masquerade, and as many others have said before me - do not open it.			"

Product received for free
												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is the best half game ever. I love this game, everyone should. It reminds me a lot of Deus Ex and if given more development and money this could have been even better. It pains me when I see all the wasted potential of this hidden gem.The writing is top notch, the stat system is robust and the choice of clans is a really great addition with some clans in particular pretty much changing the entire gameplay. The combat takes a lot of getting used to and that is not an understatement but it's fine enough considering this is an RPG and not a standard action game. The graphics are really good for the time considering the engine it is using the feel of the game is not like anything else you'll see. For those of you unaware, this takes place in a modern Los Angeles setting with hidden clan of vampires. It's like Angel but with nosferatu.However all that comes with a problem. The development is incredibly depressing to read about and I'll save you the details of what game came out the same day, but the point is this is clearly unfinished. The longer the you play the game the less freedom you get until finally you end the game with one of the most disappointing final missions I've played. It really is a shame since I do love this game so much.You need to play this if you love WRPGs. In fact many people consider it one of their favourites let alone favourite games of all time and I can understand why for the most part but it just slips out of that for me due to its diminishing quality over the game. This game still has fan patches being made constantly and for your sake get it immediately. Bloodlines might not be perfect but it'll be hard to find a game as rewarding, fun and memorable as this. Rest in peace Troika, you will be missed.			"

												This game is like wine; the more it ages, the better it's getting.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines truly is a unique hidden gem among games that for some reason never loses its charm no matter how much you play it. It doesn't strike me as surprising to see that even to this day that there is an active community still creating patches, mods, and content despite its release in 2004. With that being said, the replay-value is tremendous and upholds alot of unique writing mixed with extensive vocabulary and a passion for extravagant settings, atmosphere and level-design. Admittedly, considering that this game has been overseen by many, there still is no game that comes even remotely close to what this game is offering you despite how much it has aged over a decade. Now, it would be unfair if I wouldn't mention its disastrous state when being released with its horrendous bugs and glitches that more likely scared people off from buying it, however, I could talk about how the developers struggled creating this game based on the Source-Engine when the engine itself still was being developed. Also this game is extremely unpolished, unfinished and it doesn't take a genius to see where exactly they struggled developing the game when in its initial state is almost unplayable without the patches, that gladfully fixed and added alot of content throughout the game. But I'd like to keep that aside for now, since there's more to this game than meets the eye.You're starting off as a fellow kindred - a newborn vampire so to speak, and suddenly your fate will be met with a hidden vampire society called ""Camarilla"", that have a strict code of conduct they must obey in order to survive and uphold the masquerade that serves as a protection from humanity finding out about the existence of vampires within their society. As soon as you leave the meeting, you are on your own without anyone to rely on or trust, except a vampire called ""Jack"" that simply teaches you the basics of your new life as a kindred. Now, if that alone isn't less of any help, you will be put out there all alone by yourself and any wrong move disturbing the masquerade such as violently exhibiting agressive behaviour may even lead to your immediate execution - of course, after breaking the masquerade a several times understandably. Anyhow, you are pretty much relying on yourself without any explanations as to why you became a creature of darkness, but these answers you will have to deliever yourself, which makes this game so unique in the first place. There absolutely is no hand holding you, telling you to go there and do this - no annoying quests that play out the same repetitive cycle that is: gathering, combat, exploration and boring dialogue. Every quest in this game is incredibly unique and well-thought giving you alot of choices how to respond and thus change the outcome. Oh, have I also mentioned the dialgoue choices? There's plenty. And I mean plenty to choose from. From seducing to intimidating that perfectly well suits all your roleplay needs at once. This is all about you being you.I could also talk about the graphics and performance of this game, you know, the technical side of things! But there really isn't much to see here except outdated graphics and a stable framerate. Make no mistake, this game still has some pretty aspects when it comes to graphics but overall it's a fairly ugly game, but that shouldn't keep you from playing it as when it comes to characters you have facial expressions you've never seen before except in Half-Life 2 and some other exceptional games, even to this very day many games lack fluid animations and facial expressions - and VTMB gives you exactly what the games nowadays are missing, not only technically. Anyway, you are more likely to ignore the ugly graphics once you indulge into this masterpiece and I can assure you that it will be that way.The soundtrack you may ask? Well, generally the soundtrack is pretty much mediocre or at least decent to a certain scale. Many of the voice clips are re-cycled especially when it comes to fighting, but that only goes for cops or generic enemies you will have to deal with from the beginning. The voice acting in this game really is good! I mean it's nothing groundbreaking but all of the voice actors or at least partially some are known roles in games that come out these days, or memoreable games that people adore. So in that aspect I can only say that I enjoyed the soundtrack as well as the voice acting.The storyline of this game is very well-written and that goes for side-quests as well. Never have I felt so indulged and motivated to look around and eventually come across a random character that may fill me in a quest that has a particular humour, charme and dialogue that's going to keep you busy for a decent amount of time. So, all I can really say without spoiling is that this game and all quests in it are memoreable all the way from the beginning to the ending. Although the game slighty gets weaker when it comes to the storyline near the ending of the game I must say.Now that I covered pretty much every topic I wanted to talk about, with all of that being said, this game is a must and you shouldn't miss out on playing it. It may be old and look crappy but don't judge this book by its cover, not this one. Don't ask yourself once, or twice, but play it immediately when you have the chance to. But please download the latest unofficial patch so that this experience is worthwhile and won't get interrupted by hasty bugs and annoying glitches.			"

												...A Note about old games needing patching.The game is not broken.  You can install it on an old XP machine and play it fine(as fine as back in 2004 at least).  WHining about ""selling broken games"" is dumb.  I own music on Vinyl that never got converted to digital.  Should I be able to get these albums FREE, or for like $2, because they won't load, as-is, to my Ipod??  No, because I know they are vinyl records, and if I want to play them in digital format, they need to be ripped and converted.  The game wasn't meant to play on a 32 GB Win 10 machine.  ""But GOG sells it patched?!"" SO Buy it there.  GOG isn't 1/50th the size of Valve.  My mom used to cut the crust off my bread.  SO therefore any restaurant that doesn't is terrible?Nobody forced you to buy the game.  Go try to play your Super Mario Bros 3 NES cart on your wii U, as-is.  Go try to play your copy of Parappa the Rapper for PS1 on your PS4.  As-is.  You can't   That doesn't mean nobody should sell these items.  Old Code isn't useless, and isn't without monitary value.  Giving a bad review to a game because it doesn't play as-is on your new machine just means you are ignorant, and don't understand media, and how it works.  Flame on.  I'm Ready for my 12% recommended review score.  Just please take what you just read into consideration.			"

												There's only one reason to give this game a poor review:IT DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT ONE OF THE UNOFFICIAL PATCHES YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL.Now, this isn't a great hindrance, as you can find the guides to help you right here on Steam.  There are even guides that will aid you in getting the graphic-enhancing mods to work that come with one of the patches (I chose Wesp's Unoffical Patch since it seemed to contain more goodies).Yeah, yeah, I know the game's developer's are out of business.  I know it 'only takes five minutes to install the patch'.  Doesn't really matter.Someone is asking people to fork over $20 for a decade-old game (as of the time of this writing, you can get it for $5 though!), and someone is getting that money.  That 'someone' could at least update it with a patch of their own that is included in the purchase.  Whoever is getting paid for this game is relying on the cult status this game has achieved to put money in their pockets and giving their fans the middle finger as they do it.Which is a shame because, what I've played so far, it's a great game.  Not top-notch, but pretty good for its niche.Graphics:  They're a decade old and even with enhancements, it shows its age.  Animations are kind of stiff and clunky, and everything is sort of reminiscent of the way the original Blood Rayne looked.Voice-Acting:  Some of it is Grade A, some of it is Grade F.  Pretty hit or miss, as usual with most games, your protagonist stays silent.  Nothing wowing here, except for how terrible some of it is.Gameplay:  Pretty basic.  Forces you into third-person view whenever you do melee fights, which I find irritating.  I'd like it a lot more if I didn't have to see my own character's awkward flailing strikes.  There are some nice elements, such as your ability to be a silver-tongued rascal, or computer-hacking nerd, or lockpicking sneak really coming into play.  I also like how faithful they are to the source material, with Nosferatu having to stay hidden from humans, the rivalry war between Sabbat and Camarilla, etc.Story:  It's nothing to sneeze at, but it's not quite as great as some people claim.  Your dialogue choices are often clunky and ridiculous, but the whole thing weaves together fairly well.TL;DR:  Get it while it's on sale.  KNOW YOU WILL HAVE TO MANUALLY PATCH IT TO GET IT TO WORK.  DO NOT IGNORE ALL THE REVIEWS TELLING YOU THIS, THINKING IT WILL WORK ON YOUR RIG.If whoever is making money off of selling this game would patch it themselves, I would give it a positive recommendation.

												This is by far the best Vampire game I've ever played! Even still, many, many years after it's release, I still play through it once every couple years. When released, it was an utter mess, but after so many years, the community has fixed most of the problems with the game.Sure, the UI is really old, and some of the mechanics might be a bit frustrating at times, but the storyline is absolutely fantastic, and a lot of the features in the game were really groundbreaking at the time. If you're an RPG fan, or a Vampre fan, this game is a must play for you! Give it at least an hour or two, once you have acclimated to the antequated parts of the game, you will be able to appreciate it for what it was... what it still is. The best Vampire RPG ever made.This game despirately needs a sequal!			"

												Probably one of the finest RPG's out there. The characters are not only memorable, but just damn well done. I cannot remember any NPC's in Fallout 4. I played this game a year or two back, and vividly remember every chilling moment. The storyline is beyond excellent, with the pacing of the original Deus Ex. You have plots within conspiracies within plots. Bonus points for having each 'sub-race' of vampires having different experiences. (The insane one is especially fun. Same with the sewer noseferatu types.)Truly no other game out there does Vampires as well as this one. You really feel like you are just a person in this beautiful dark world....that being said... the UI takes more than a little getting used too. Also some areas are downright brutal for certain builds.This game and the original Deus Ex hold a special place in my heart......and I played them both for the first time within the last five years. That should say something. An ageless classic.			"

Seven playable clans, four (technically five) different endings that will have you coming back to the game and playing it over again, and a fun an engaging story.

												A deep RPG whose strengths are able to overcome its various flaws.You start by picking one of seven vampire clans, which have their own advantages and disadvantages, slightly different starting stat upgrade choices, and 3 different special powers (some of which are unique to certain clans, others can be found among multiple clans).  Dialogue choices and NPC dialogue can change depending upon the clan you choose.  Especially interesting is the freakish looking Nosferatu clan who are suppose to stay in the shadows.  If you choose them, some NPCS will refuse to speak to you and may even freak out if you attempt to, others will comment on how hideous looking you are.  There're even unique events that happen if you choose the Nosferatu.  Sorry old woman working at the diner...As a vampire living in a normal society, you have to keep your existence hidden.  If you start sucking blood out on the main streets or use certain special powers, people will notice and you'll get 'masquerade' violations.  As you start getting more and more, vampire hunters will randomly show up to kill you.  If you get too many violations, you'll be executed by the vampire clans.  You earn experience by completing quests and use that experience to choose how to upgrade your character.  You can choose to spread experience around or focus in certain areas.  How you build your character will change how you'll be able to complete quests.  You can choose to focus on social skills, which will make it easier to talk, seduce, or intimidate your way into certain areas.  You could focus on stealth, lockpicking, and hacking to make your way around.  Or you could just beat the crap out of everyone in your way.The dialogue choices in the game are deep, and there're plenty of interesting & likeable characters throughout the game who will react to you based on how you talk to them.  If you insult some enough, they won't bother talking to you anymore or give you their sidequests.  The game also has several different endings, some of which will only be available if you've stayed friendly with certain major characters.The game has four major areas you can travel between and freely explore or ignore.  The game finds a sweet point on area size.  Areas are large enough that there're plenty of unique places that you'll want to explore.  However, areas are never so large that you feel like it'll take forever to find/complete all the quests and they can all be completely traversed within a minute or two.On the downside, the game has several bugs even with the ""Unofficial Patch"" installed.  I didn't run into anything game breaking, but there was a time or two where I had to change up my choices so the game wouldn't get stuck.  Stealth isn't the game's strongsuit.  Sometimes enemies won't notice you even if you're right in front of them.  Sometimes if they see you or hear you, they'll get stuck in search mode and just stand staring at a spot you need to walk through to get by.  Sometimes you can get them out of being stuck, other times you can't.  For the most part, combat is alright, but don't expect to be blown away.I went into the game worried that it might be overhyped and not that good.  Was very pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up enjoying it.  If you like deep RPGs, you'll like this game.			"

												Nominated this game for ""Test of Time"" award! Do you want to know what is the greatest hidden gem that was harshly buried due to its rushed release, lack of sales, and bugs in the history of gaming? Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is it. I had this game standing alone in the backlog two years ago. I kept having strange sudden urges saying I need to play this game over and over again. I decided why the heck not. The game kept crashing and crashing. I found out it required community patches. Already had 300 of them... Wow, the community must be sooo dedicated. I wonder why? Hmm... Now it finally ran smooth at the start. Boom, my life changed when I put my foot in the city of Santa Monica and met a memorable character named Smiling Jack. The atmosphere and the characters in the game were something I have never seen or experienced before in any games that blown me away. They were soooo freaking immersing that kept me hooked playing this game nonstop for two weeks. The story became remarkably darker, mind blowing, and emotional all at the same time. It was sooo well written and properly executed that I couldn't believe how good the whole thing is. The characters. The atmosphere and places to explore. The gameplay and RPG elements chosen for this game. The plot. EVERYTHING. So good. I do not want to spoil ANYTHING because you need to play this first.The experience inspired me to complete few playthroughs with different clan and mods. The community and cult following are so dedicated that it's amazing. This game is a textbook example of a cult classic. Excellent cult classic. I am proud to claim this game as my third favorite game of all time. 9.7 out of 10			"

												Reading through the negative reviews here, most of them have the same complaint: they can’t get the game running. It’s true the game won’t run on a modern OS without the unofficial patch, which is shameful on Activision’s part, especially since the creator of the patch offered it to them for free.But despite the annoyance of getting the game running, it has a 94% approval rating here on Steam. Indeed it seems nearly everyone that actually managed to play the game liked it. That speak volumes of the game.Apart from getting the game running is it flawless? Not entirely, the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired. While the combat isn’t quite as clunky as the first Deus Ex, enemies with fully automatic weapons will kill you in about two seconds, though these enemies mostly appear towards the end of the game and thankfully stealth is preposterously easy.So why play this game? Simple: Atmosphere and Characters. This game has such wonderful way of making you feel like a creature of the night. The graphics are obviously dated, but there are nice touches such as animated facial expressions. The original soundtrack is great. The licensed music ranges from pretty good to really awful.What really keeps me coming back to this game is the characters. Though most of them are clinically dead they are more alive the character in any other game I’ve played. The dialogue is brilliantly written and voice acted. It’s just a delight to talk to people in this game. The Vampire Politics at the heart of the game are also really fascinating and how you treat the different factions affects which endings are available to you.Despite the problems with getting it running and the rather poor gameplay this is a must play if you like good writing in games. If, however, you only care about gameplay this game is not for you.			"

												This game has got a lot of flaws, but I forgive almost every single one of them because I am so enamored with its world, and its writing. Seriously, it takes a lot to get me to give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about ♥♥♥♥ing Vampires. Set in the World of Darkness RPG universe, this game had writing and design that was just too ambitious. The developers clearly had a magnificent vision for this game -- a game where the experience is vastly different depending on which clan you picked. A game where playing it through once only shows you a fraction of what it has to offer. A world filled with choices, and so, so many ways to solve your problems. If this game had been allowed to finish, it could have been right up there alongside revered greats such as Deus Ex and Planescape: Torment. Unfortunately, its flaws, and the fact that the game is literally not finished, rob it of such a reward. It's almost tragic, really.If you're gonna buy this game, be prepared to do some homework just to get the damn thing to run. The unofficial patch is basically mandatory. But this game is well worth the effort. If you're a fan of dynamic RPGs with loads of replay value, give this a shot. I put off trying it out for a long time and honestly wish I had played it sooner.			"

												I love this game. Absolutely adore this game. For an older game released in the early 2000's, I expected less. I expected something easy and fun and fluffy. Instead I found myself so enthralled by the story and the plot and the style that I replayed the game over and over again going through as much as I possibly could and making as many changes as I could just so the game would not end. This is a fantastic vampire game. We need more games like this nowadays. It reminded me of the style of American McGee's Alice and reminded me of the world of Rice's vampires, such as Lestat and Louis. It took me a little bit to figure out how to run the old game on a newer computer, but I will never, ever regret making this purchase and I envy all who have yet to discover its brilliance, because I just want to go through and re-descover everything all over again. The graphics were good for the time, a little shaky now, but it hardly takes away from gameplay. I fell in love with so many characters I was ashamed with myself. 10/10 all the way.			"

												One of my all time favourite RPGs. As apposed to most role–playing games, Bloodlines offers a more diverse approach to the platform, creating near unique scenarios for each different Clan, outfitted with bespoke abilities and skills. One of the more enjoyable qualities of Bloodlines is that – and unlike most other games of the same genre – content transcends the battle front, development and progression is key to successs. Having said that, combat is equally as awesome as storyline content, and one of the funnest aspect of the game for me so far has been trying out different Clans, and seeing how they work differently with dialogue and the eventual endgame, there's to say it's a very redoable game as long as you broaden your horizons for each new character and select a different Clan for your playthrough.100% recommendable for RPG fans.

Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines is filled with a dark, seedy, gory and erotic atmosphere that makes the gameplay all the more intense. VTMB is a story-rich, choice-driven experience where your thought process, your beliefs, your moral compass and the way you interpret situations directly affect both gameplay and story. VTMB awards the player with malleable main quests, a variety of secondary quests and comprehensive characters with unique motives and ideologies. Explore inner cities, mansions, beach houses, sewers, underground cities, asylums, haunted hotels and more. VTMB allows the player to explore complex moral and existential questions through the eyes of bloodsucking monsters. Contemplate on the meaning of politics, sex, death and life while simultaneously coming to terms with your own monstrosity.You chose to play one out of seven vampire clans, each with their own bloodline weaknesses and strengths. Once you choose your preferred gender and clan, you preliminary fill your skills and abilities sheet.  The choices are endless and incredibly flexible – you can be a femme fatale with a weaponized sexuality, a passionate brawler who persuades people with intimidation and fist-fights, a stealthy shadow dweller that hacks and lock picks their way through each level or a malformed nosferatu who is forced to travel through the sewers and dark alleys lest he risks breaking the Masquerade. The choices continue, and you can mix and match as you please.The main plot of the game is that you were a mortal who has been recently turned into a vampire, a process known as the embrace. The Camarilla, or the ruling class of vampires in Los Angeles, executes your sire for not following the proper siring protocols and for breaking the Masquerade. The Masquerade is an organized campaign enforced by the Camarilla to convince people that vampires do not exist.The Masquerade is the cornerstone survival strategy for Kindred, without it, the humans would rise up and exterminate all the undead. From there on, you learn your ways as a new vampire under the rule of the Camarilla. However, VTMB is a heavy choice-based game with a story-rich plot that allows your character to make decisions that fundamentally change, derail, progress or otherwise conflict with the overall narrative of the game. For instance, there are different political factions, such as the Anarchs you can join that have their own stories, quests and motivations. Doing so will unlock new endings and will allow you to rebel against the standard narrative of the game which is doing the Camarilla’s main quests. This choice mechanic is prevalent in absolutely every aspect of the game. For instance, the one of the first quests you have to do is meet Mercurio, a Camarilla agent you have been tasked with helping. Once you meet him, he will tell you he was robbed. He will tell you that he was supposed to meet with a local gang at their Beach House and purchase their explosives. Unfortunately for him, he went alone, got beat up and failed to trade for the explosives. A dying, bloody Mercurio then asks you to retrieve that the explosives for him and avenge him. Now, upon receiving this quest you can:Fight your way through the Beach House with clan disciplines and/or good ‘ol fist fights and retrieve the explosives.Sneak your way through by lurking in the shadows, avoiding bodyguards, performing stealth kills, killing the lights and retrieving the explosives.Seduce your way through each bodyguard up to the seller. Then, using masterful subterfuge get the gang boss alone by creating the illusion that you are going to exchange sex for goods, kill him by sucking his blood dry and then simply walk out. Or rob the place and then make a run for it – or kill them anyways. Intimidate them through dialogue and maybe fist-fight one to prove your worth. Persuade them through dialogue to set you up an opportunity to trade with their boss and then properly haggle with them (through dialogue) to get a cheaper price and/or potentially for free in exchange for other goods and/or favors. Use certain clan disciplines to control the mortal fools and make them kill each other, then retrieve the explosives. Use certain clan disciplines to speedily break into the window where thee explosives are located, steal them back and run. Or, my personal favorite in the second run-through of the game. Kill Mercurio for being a demanding ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a screw-up. Get the explosives however you desire and carry on with your quests.VTMB also offers an interesting approach to combat as well – slash your enemies with katanas, sledgehammers, bare fists and more. Use specific clan disciplines to sneak through your enemies, dismember them or enslave them. The game is incredibly well-written, with unique dialogue options allowed and displayed depending on the clan you choose. All in all – buy this game, you will be replaying it over and over again, finding new details, new quests, new dialogue options and new approaches to gameplay.If you enjoy the way I review games, join and follow my curator group! It comes with a fun discord channel for horror fans to chill and game. Malkavian Madness "

												Bloodlines is a great rpg, it has a very awkward tutorial that does a poor job of introducing the game to you and it can be quite a turn off for newcomers but the tutorial does not represent the game well at all. Once you are left to explore the first area of the game after the tutorial you start to see the strengths of the game and you start to understand why this game has such a cult following. It has an interesting story and world, interesting lore and interesting characters with also very surprisingly great voice acting. I absolutely loved exploring the open world hub areas without the burden of objective markers, soaking in the world and atmosphere from just talking to npcs and discovering side missions which by the way are very well done and tell great stories on their own and end up being very memorable. The ideologies of the different vampire factions I found very intriguing in particular. The main missions offer up nice variety with the visuals and locations you are visiting and you can tell the developers tried to make an effort to make each mission feel different from each other so the game doesn’t get repetitive. However you can tell the developers ran out of either time or money because the level design in the later stages become really generic and repetitive especially compared to the early missions like the amazing ocean house hotel. The rpg mechanics are implemented to the game very well, I appreciated the amount of options in the character creation and the leveling up system. I really liked the morality system with the humanity and being faithful to the masquerade, it’s well integrated with the main and side missions in particular. I appreciated all the different ways you can tackle an objective even though I always ended up just going in guns blazing. Speaking of the combat I enjoyed it overall I don’t think it’s horrible like some people claim, it does it’s job perfectly fine in my opinion and it can be pretty fun at times. The end game can be very brutal if you haven’t leveled up your character in a few certain ways which does restrict the freedom you have with your character. I recommend installing the fan made unofficial patch of the game because without it it’s almost unplayable with all the bugs, crashes and lack of high resolution options.8/10 (Great)			"

												Okay, so I started playing this game about two years ago and only made it to the second location because the game is buggy as Hell and wasn't loading something that was an intergral part of one of my missions (so, I quit instead of starting over).I recently replayed the game, all the way through, this time, and let me tell you: this game is fantastic. I's an old game, sure, but it definitely holds up well. And in some ways, is vastly superior to some modern games. The graphics are a bit dated, but not horribly so. Again, I've played some modern games with worse. Voice acting is top-notch. The story and lore that surrounds the game is amazing and deep. You could spend hours just talking to NPCs because the lore is that involved and you may want to absorb it all. I hesitate to say characters are believable (I'm looking at you, Knox), but they're charming. Some are likeable, whereas others are easy to hate. Either way, they're all written well for the world they are in and really help to develop it. I found the Anarchs to be a much more relatable, realistic group than some of the others. That said, the members of the Anarchs are my favorite chraracters, so I could be biased. Combat (especially melee) can be a bit clunky, but not impossible to handle. And, due to the various clans, it makes it very easy to find a playstyle that works best with what you like. This game transitions from a stealth/puzzle game, to a 3rd person hack and slash, to a 1st person shooter seamlessly, and allows the player to change up their playstyle on the fly.  Each clan has a very unique, rich story that surrounds them, which makes it fun to play multiple times in order to get a feel for all seven of them.Some the levels are unsettling, or downright scary to go through. They're very atmospheric, with great audio and visuals. I would be lying if I said that there weren't some missions where I had to take my headphones off, or had to play during daylight hours while other people were around. There's one in particular where you don't even face any enemies, but the hair on the back of my neck still stands up every time I go through it. My one main complaint is that VTMB is a game that hinges on the fact that your character might be a sexual creature, making it possible to sort of romance some of the characters. However, there is only one male NPC throughout the game who can be 'romanced', yet several females. I get that at the time, game companies thought  that female gamers were a rarety, so I don't really fault it too much.			"

												A masterpiece within the genre of RPG, this is up and maybe above even Baldurs gate :) I played this many years ago, and bought it instantly when i found it here a few months ago. It has an amazing storyline, and it is very flexible regarding which clans you choose, skills, abilities, and much more. It has a great replay value, you'll find yourself restarting coming half way through just to see what would happen if you made some different choices, or if you choose another type of vampire to play. It is one of the best games ever made in my world.  The graphics is still ok, although the game is old, the music and atmopshere is amazing, the storyline has many twists in it.  Best buy you can do if you like RPG and FPS, Join the dark side ;)			"

												Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is a simply sublime title by Troika. It was the third and final title they ever made before kicking the bucket.You play as a newly formed vampire in a ""World of Darkness"". You choose between several clans, from the rebellious Brujah to the insane Malkavians. Each clan has their own stat differences and NPCs react to you very differently. Especially if the player plays as a Nosferatu, you are treated like a hideous monster and cannot stay around human NPCs without them running away from you. The gameplay is solid and acts as both a first person shooter and a hack and slash.Most notable is the atmosphere of VtmB. It features very well made map design that is riddled with side quests in it's city hubs. Believe me when I say this game takes a while to complete, and is very rewarding once you do it. It is also replayable due to how much of the game changes depending on what clan you play as.It runs on a beta version of the Source engine. The version it runs on is actually more primitive than Half Life 2. As a result the game is fairly buggy due to it's rushed development. However like all of Troika's games there is a large fan community that has released an unofficial patch that fixes most of the issues.			"

												In a way this game (when you manage to run it with the unofficial patch) reminds me about Bathesda's Elder Scrolls series. It has small, more compact world because of the source engine I presume, but lots of content. I am mentioning Elder Scrolls for the solo purpose of saying that just like TES, VTM:B must be loved with all its flaws, bugs, errors and imperfections.I honestly believe that Troika Games just had horrible luck as if universe screwed them up while they were creating the game.Starting with engine itself, Troika used an unfinished Source Engine and had to work with it, adding their own code. Troika worked on the same engine that Half-Life 2 were even before the engine was shown publicly. In fact they had an agreement that they can't sell the game before the Half-Life 2 release.After the engine came Activision. Even though Troika employers kept on working overtime on the game, Activision still rushed the release and cut off sponsorship of the game. So in the end we got ourselves a rushed, unpolished product that in fact was fixed and updated by fans for more than 11 years now.And you might think thats it? Troika Games sold too little copies of the game to keep up afloat and ended up being closed. How did that happen if the game is so good as I keep on saying?Bad luck.Release date of the game is November 2004. What else happened in 2004 prior the November?Unreal Tournament 2004, Far Cry, Sacred, Painkiller, Hitman: Contracts, Manhunt, Thief: Deadly Shadows,  Doom 3, Silent Hill 4: The Room, Sims 2, Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War, Star Wars: Battlefront, Myst IV: Revelation, Rome: Total War and many other awesome games. Year 2004 was an amazing year in the industry.And you may think that with all that competition on the market VTM:B were safe since they released in November, while other games were earlier? Well, still bad luck Troika Games.What happened in November in the PC game industry? (I am not mentioning games such as MGS3 and other console games since I am talking about PC)CS:Source, Half Life 2, NFS: Underground 2, World Of Warcraft, Prince Of Persia: Warrior Within and so on. With all respect to Troika Games, they had no chance of wining a competition.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is probably one of my favorite games of all time. With all it's imperfections and glitches it delivers an amazing lore, story, humor and experience. Gameplay itself (fighting) is done horribly and sloppy though so don't expect to be blown away with it, dialoges is what makes it so special. Depending on the vampire clan you chose it can take you 3 or more walkthroughs to experience all the game aspects such as different approaches (stealth, fighting with magic or brute force, persuation/intimidation/seduction) and even a special, Malkavian clan walkthorugh. You see, Malkavians are insane vampires. And by insane I mean totally sick. When you play as a Malkavian character literally every dialogue line for you is changed in a mad/insane way. In fact you can have a dialog with a news reporter on your TV if you are playing as a Malkavian.All and all, when playing this game keep in mind that it was released in 2004 and it has lots of flaws that modern games don't, but thats simply because people are always becoming better at what they do and creating videogames is not an exception.

												I have waited a decade and change to play this game. I still have an ancient Bradygames walkthrough guide along with written notes in it to deal with each clan character. But in the end, perhaps it was a blessing in disguise to wait this long, where I can now play the game with all the bugs fixed. Due to that, I can say, without a doubt, that Bloodlines is one of the most underrated, underappreciated RPGs you have never heard of.Your beginning is straightforward enough. In Los Angeles, you are changed into a vampire against your will, which♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the local vampiric powers-that-be enough to kill them outright. You, on the other hand, are spared with the understanding that you will contribute to Kindred (as these vampires call themselves) society or else. From there, it becomes a tangled web of politics, competing agendas and choices that are eventually going to♥♥♥♥♥♥SOMEBODY off enough to take a shot at you.Prior to this intro, you get to create your character from scratch with the aid of a simplified but true-to-the-source White Wolf character sheet. Picking one of seven clans will likely have the biggest effect on your gameplay, as each has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. After that, though, anything goes. Just be careful to note violate the Masquerade (an honor system where you do nothing too stupid too often to tip off the mortal herd that vampires are real) and you can be whatever kind of character you want: brawler, socialite, hacker, thief, assassin, gunfighter. Just always account for the fact that sooner or later, you're going to have to fight and you'll find unique playthroughs each time you pick a different clan.One other important note: getting the latest fan-made patch for this game (9.7 at the time of this writing) is an absolute MUST or you're going to have the dubious joys of running into all those bugs the original game came with. But with that accomplished, have fun!			"

												   Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is very likely my favorite RPG of all times. The game has not aged well, but It still has style and grace if you look past the silly animations and poor graphics. The tone this game sets, the amount of things you can do outside the main storyline, the choices you make as the player and as a vampire. All of these things together lend to not only a great game, but a game with a large amount of replayability. Only advice, Get a mod to play along side it. If not just the standard Unofficial commutiy patch, Clan Quest Mod is quite good.			"

												The atmosphere is dark, seedy, erotic, and exactly what I wanted from a game about vampires.The stroy is excellent, detailing the embrace and subsequent activities and moral quandaries of a fledgling vampire. There are seven vampire Clans that you can choose from, each rich with lore and personality. Speaking of which, the characters are unforgettable, ranging from chillingly inhuman to warmly charismatic. The voice acting is sublime, making this one of the few games where I don't skip through characters' dialogue after having heard it thousands of times through my numerous playthroughs.Of course, this is a 2004 game that is full of bugs and other issues. But, the Unofficial Patch by Wesp takes care of most of these and makes the game the experience it should be.I technically play 4 different versions of this game, hence my relatively low playtime of, at the time of this review, 80 hours (Steam only records the vanilla game's playtime) I've put 80 hours into vanilla game (with the unofficial patch). I also play the Clan Quest Mod version, the Antitribu Mod, and The Final Nights Mod. Each of these versions makes it into a completely different experience, making replayablility not an issue. New Clans, disciplines, characters, enemies, environments, bosses, mechanics, etc. I would complete at least one playthrough of the vanilla game before playing the mods, in order to highlight the differences and make for a more interesting experience.If ever you've been a fan of vampire literature, or really any medium involving vampires, I considers this game a must-play.

												One of the best RPGs I have ever played. If you are a fan of VtM, or simply want an easy introduction into the World of Darknessm this is the game to play. Though I have to point out that it is old, and without the fanmade patches it's nearly unplayable. Yet I find myself playing it again every year trying to capture the essence of what i felt the first time playing it. The games atmosphere and setting is deeply immersive, and the voiceacting is fantastic. The NPCs are fleshed out, which makes the gameworld come alive in a way that no other RPG has managed after it in my opinion.I can't recommend this game enough, dispite the games age, it still will give you an RPG experience that you will not find anywhere else.P.S: Play it with the newest fanpatch for the most optimal experience.

												BEAT! 35 hoursThe elevator pitch for this game:It is Deus Ex, but with vampires in a 90's LA setting.Game is good.There are some cons:- The enemy AI has some superhuman/ olympic level reaction and accurary. It gets so ridiculous that it is almost funny. Almost.  Only it's not.- You can get health by feeding, blood bags, or just waiting. Problem is options a and b are often NOT options and waiting takes FOREVER. I have watched youtube series just waiting for my health to climb back up.  I would even guess 3-5 hours or so of my playtime is just me waiting.Neutral- Not as open in some regards (in level design) as something like thief 2 or something.  It is from 2004, so thats expected.  Just expect segments to be a bit more linear in regards to certain sections of levels.			"

												Hands down, the best game I've ever played. It's dark and gritty without taking itself too seriously, filled with atmopshere and world-detail without playing like a fantasy encyclopedia. and you can roll around town dressed up as a pimp or a stripper. What more could you want from a game?The best testimony of how fantastic this game is is undoubtedly the fans; Even though this game came out in 2004, there are still unofficial patches being developed and released as you read this. Never has a game been more loved, cherished, or enriched by its community. We're just lucky to be able to play it now, when all the bugs have been fixed by dedicated fans, compared to its initial release.The game play is fairly simple and easy to access, though the variety of levels mean it never gets dull. You can shoot, tear, or bite your way through your enemies, and look like something straight out of a bondage fever dream/nightmare whilst doing it. The plot is genuinely gripping, with twists and turns I never saw coming, and the ending? The ending is just... f*** me. Well played, Bloodlines. Well played.Storyline? Basically, you wake up a fledgling after a passionate night with your fanged lover, only to end up becoming a glorified slave of a grumpy french nobleman with a Napoleon complex and a damn nice suit. Be his ♥♥♥♥♥ for what feels like eternity. Blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up. The ranges of choices you're given are actually pretty impressive, and DO make a difference, unlike some franchises I can think of (*cough*Mass Effect*cough). Be sassy. Be crazy. Be sexy as hell. It's one of those games where you can truly be whoever you want. Aside from appropriately dressed. No mod will ever give you that.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is considered one of the classic PC RPGs. I've seen nothing but positive things about it, but to be honest, the cover art and the concept kind of warded me off of it. After all, vampires suck now. Now, after 30 hours and having beaten the game, I can safely say it's one of the best games I've ever played.It has a unique atmosphere, gothic without feeling forced, gritty and stylish. It takes what the modern take on the modern vampire is and makes it well... good. Great. Apparently, this is the norm for VTM (which I haven't played at Tabletop before). I would say its the best depiction of a modern vampire out there. It's not all rosy, of course. This game doesn't pull any punches if you're not being careful and keeping aware. I couldn't even get the game to run on Steam. However, VTM-B has a very active, very devoted fanbase that creates custom content and mods so I was able to get a 'true to game' patch that simply made the game run in no time at all. I only beat the game a few hours ago, but I am already thinking of second play throughs, with new mods and new choices. This game gives the player a ton of opportunities to alter the story, too. I felt like, at most every juncture, that my decisions mattered. That I wasn't just plodding through the developer's story but that I was writing a story of my own.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines manages to hold together a beautifully crafted environment, with some satisfying combat and evocative NPC interaction and story telling. It borders on perfection and a standard that other RPGs should be held to. Pros:+Amazing Atmosphere+Cool and gothic without feeling forced+Likeable/multidimensional NPCs+Lots of choices and approaches to both build and story progression+Satisfying, high-impact combat (at least in melee)+Active fanbase producing extra content+Very addictive once things get goingCons:-The first half hour or so of the game are slow and fail to grab attention-The unmodded/unpatched game was not playable for me (but this is not such a big issue)-Character building and numbers can be unintuitiveOverall, I would say it's completely worth the purchase, even at non-sale price.

												One of the best RPGs and best games ever made, but beware that it absolutely needs an unofficial patch.  Simple to install, so be sure to install it before starting your playthrough.  It fixes up the game breaking bugs and leaves behind potentially buggy AI and animations, which are common in games anyway (unfortunately).Despite being an action game (FPS, third person shooter/brawler, and stealth game), objectively it has more role-playing than the vast majority of video game RPGs.  They don't make such competent, in-depth RPGs anymore; sure, you can find similar complexity in stats/rules (in Wasteland 2 and Divinity: Original Sin for example), but not nearly this level of role-playing.  Not nearly this level of player character agency and development and personalization, not nearly this level of reactivity or ""choice and consequence"" as people love to say. The entirety of the game is rewritten twice, once for Malkavian clan (race) and the other for Nosferatu.  There are a total of seven clans (races) you can choose.  Quests can be approached and completed in more ways, ways unique to your character build, than most other RPGs.  You can better define who your character is in this game than in most other RPGs.Writing quality also besmirches most games, old or new.  World building is extraordinary; I am not typically a fan of this type of fiction, with vampires and werewolves and such, but this game is so well written and presented that it pulled me in, kept me hooked, and made me crave more the entire time (no pun intended).  It calls upon the strength of its pen and paper origins, as PnP RPG worlds are generally much more detailed and much better written than 'original' video game worlds.  This game is no exception.Character development is one of its biggest strengths here, having such a diverse cast of actual characters, well written and not once out of character, and with some of the best voice acting you will ever hear in a video game.  You will meet different authority figures, abused victims, mysterious individuals, unintentionally funny characters, badasses with a unique sense of humor, all kinds of people.  An effectiveness in character writing rarely seen in video gaming.  Every single person you can converse with is an actual character, written with detail and care.  No meaningless quest giving bots here.  Of all games I've played that have a conversation system, only Planescape: Torment is on the same level in this regard.No meaningless dialogue, nothing is wasted.  This game is filled to the brim with thematic material, social commentary, philosophic concepts, and satire.  Such diverse, flavorful writing found in every nook and cranny of the game.  The radio station, televised news, emails and other texts found throughout the game world, the nature of the quests, the dialogue itself, so much world building and cultural exploration, once again on a level that most games just don't attempt.  This game can go from hilarious to creepy to ominous to intriguing and much more at will.  Spellbinding is an accurate description for this game, made better by how much role-playing it has.  Bloodlines has some of the best quest design of any game, involving more than just following objective markers to a location and killing everything there.All of the above applies to the first 4/5 of the game's 40 hour total length.  The last 8 hours or so, when unlocking the last hub area (Chinatown) is a slow downward spiral, clearly rushed since Activision demanded its premature release.  Role-playing takes the biggest hit during the last 8 or so hours, but general quest design and writing take a hit as well.As an action game, it is bolstered by Source Engine physics which outshine most modern games, and it is not as clunky as one might expect.  You can focus on guns, melee weapons, unarmed, stealth, and/or unique vampiric abilities called Disciplines.  Shooting mechanics remind me of Deus Ex, with large crosshairs that shrink as you level up the firearms skill, so shooting sucks early on but gets better.  Stealth is effective, largely because of how simple the AI is.  The Disciplines are awesome.  Since it is an RPG, it also has some non combat gameplay mechanics, such as hacking, lockpicking, trading, and of course heavy emphasis on exploration and most of all dialogue.  It is a hub-based game, meaning you unlock one location at a time in linear sequence, but each location is large and lets you freely roam within it, pursuing quests at will.  This hub based design takes after Deus Ex.But it is far from excellent as an action game, the incomplete AI being the primary reason.  But remember, if you find its combat lackluster, you can always use console commands to just power through it and get on to the best content, which is everything else!There is an interesting selection of mods but nothing massive, this being built on a beta (or alpha?) version of Source engine limits it in that regard (and others, namely the AI).

												When I first played this in 2004, I'd never experienced anything like it.  Over a decade later, I still haven't.  This is some of the best storytelling in gaming, ever.  It was worth playing, even back when bugs abounded and you needed a console command to bypass a glitched sequence.  Now with the Unofficial Patch, which not only fixes bugs but also restores content left on the cutting room floor, you have no excuse.			"

												Absolutely brilliant game in every aspect, this is my favorite horror RPG of all time! There is just so many options to choose from, both in development of your character’s personality and fighting style. You can basically play the game exactly the way you want the game to be played. I’ll recommend this game to everyone who likes a good dark and twisted RPG full of morbid and black humor. As a newly embraced kindred you are given a lot of choices that could alter your overall storyline. If you believe in good or evil then your world might get turned around, as it all depends on point of view - your point of view. Will you seek allies to strengthen your fate or will you simply end up betraying them due to trust or individual differences? An important condition for your new and eternal existence is your beast within and the craving for blood that follows. Going without blood when you’re thirsty will make your beast unsatisfied and release from the chains of you, till it once again will be filled and in slumber. This could break your most important rule - keep your identity hidden, keep your race a secret, respect the masquerade. Mortal curiosity could be your final death, if not by them then by your own, revealing the secrecy of your species is tolerated as betrayal as you will condemn the masquerade.There is a lot of clans to choose from, even the choice of clan can alter the perspective people talk and greet you within the world. Every clan has unique armor and skill sets. All of the clans can choose the same stats depending on which role the player wish to play the game. Your stats affect your social and combat abilities.Do you want to slice and dice or do you want to take your enemies out from a distance? You can choose your fighting style in combination with your clan’s skill set to create your own unique play style. However blood is limited so remember to feed when you can.Your social abilities can help you to dominate, convince or seduce others to have your way. That can help you grant access to locations, free goodies or even a free blood snack!Don’t forget to catch a squishy rattie when passing through the sewer. Why… one might ask…? Well… they’re deliciously tasty and uhm, ratties provide a fine amount of blood! Tasty, tasty ratties.The game has only been improved by time, thanks to a great and active modding community and the unofficial patches, which I highly recommend to everyone who would like to play the game, as it fixes some of the game’s glitches and bug issues.The game offers quality gameplay and storyline plus a huge amount of playtime and replay value.

Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is an action role-playing game, developed by Troika Games and released in 2004. Overshadowed by other landmark releases such as Half-Life 2 and crippled by a rushed development, this criminally underrated Source game is a faithful interpretation of the popular table top classic and an enjoyable - albeit pulpy - romp through the World of Darkness.Presented in both third- and first-person perspective, the gothic reimagining of Los Angeles features a tumultuous social and political landscape between the various factions of vampires vying for control. You assume the role of the unnamed protagonist thrown into this violent underbelly and join the clan of your choice before being literally let loose in to the new (and often strange) world. But what happens next is up to you.The game world is the centrepiece of Bloodlines as it constantly invites the player to really explore the depths of what it has to offer. With the incredible variety of methods and playstyles available within this sandbox-like environment, replay value is immense, as is the sheer enjoyment of exploration. There are plenty of unique abilities to use (and abuse) on the unsuspecting citizen, ranging from the seductive bloodsucking of the Toreador to the animalistic brute strength of the Nosferatu or Gangrels. Each clan has its own particular style and the variety of outfits available to the player reflects this. Despite associating yourself with a particular clan at the beginning of the game, there isn’t content that is locked off to the player due to the constant political in-fighting of the Camarilla that forms the basis of the game’s narrative. Revealing your presence to the human population results in Masquerade point deductions, which can result in failing the game entirely and your activities depend on keeping up this secrecy. Outside of that however, your journey actively encourages as much havoc as possible and those interested in the supernatural will not be disappointed.Pros Great depth to RPG elements and remains true to pen-and-paper origins.  Fascinating and diverse list of characters, backed up by fantastic voice acting. Plenty of gameplay freedom and emphasis on player choice. A tonne of interesting missions and side quests, if a bit repetitive.   Excellent atmosphere, with equally remarkable writing and dialogue options throughout. Phenomenal restoration effort (and ongoing support) by the community. Cons Technical issues abound. Requires a fan-made patch to properly play and actually finish. Frequently poor visuals; a mixed bag generally.   Though varied, combat tends to be clunky and dissatisfying at times. Stealth A.I. is poor. Some abilities/attributes are useless or progressively made redundant. Final Thoughts: Technical issues aside, VtMB is the vampire-themed game that you've been dying to play. A great example of the capabilities of the Source engine in it's prime, embrace this flawed gem with lowered expectations or during a sale and prepare for a bloody good time.Rating: 6.5/10			"

												I absolutely adore this game.  A word of warning right up front: As delivered by Steam this game is unplayable, but there is an unofficial patch that is updated and it makes the game entirely playable.  This game makes me want to find a nice group of pen and pencilers to play that version of VtM.  The Hotel level is the scariest thing I've ever played (made more so by the fact that I did it the first time in the middle of the night with no lights on).  The overall story is a little see-through, but there are enough surprises to keep you entertained.Summary: This would be my favorite RPG ever if it wasn't for that pesky KOTOR.  But to be mentioned positively in the same sentence as KOTOR is a huge honor to me.			"

												This game is amazing. It's just so rich - all of the characters and places are incredibly detailed, memorable, and unique. It's also got this filthy, depraved, gritty atmosphere that's always there, even when you're in a fancy hotel or something. Another awesome thing about this game is how many options it gives you, and how what you say and do actually matters. The npcs really recognize the things that you say to them, your clan, your gender, your attitude, etc. For example, if you're playing as a narcisstic, smooth-talking Toreador and you get into a conversation with a vanity-hating Nosferatu, don't expect the conversation to go easily - they'll probably talk about their desire to burn your pretty little face in acid. To boot, the facial expressions and voice acting is amazing, and probably the best I've ever seen in a game.This game is, however, quite glitchy due to its troubled release. For that reason, the unofficial patch is a necessity. Seriously, don't even start playing the game until you've got it installed.All in all, though, this is definitely one of my favorite games of all time. If you're thinking about getting it, do it. You won't regret it!			"

												I was recommended to play this game so many times. Being the idiot that judged a book by its cover, I often threw it aside and left it hanging there in my library. Sure enough, I sift through many old gems in the RPGs section, only to find it again, and again, and again. There must be a reason for an RPG to be great despite the technical difficulties and the outdated graphics, no? Sure enough I go for it (On my fifth attempt of liking it) and I was immediately pulled into its world and characters. This is the best example I would give to anyone asking for a high quality story experience, never mind the fact that it is a great RPG experience. I never played it at its time, but I sure have good memories of Vampire: The masquerade. I am normally not a pushover when it comes to games, but I would easily be one for anyone who is a big fan of RPGs and hasn't experienced such a masterpiece. I don't think I need to go into detail about it aside from the fact that it might turn away a lot of players due to its outdated presentation and technical limitations. Other than that, you can easily guarantee yourself a great game. Wherever you are LaCroix, thank you for showing me this.			"

There are a few bloodlines from which you can choose that can alter your playstyle and story. Depending on the choices you make there are multiple endings.Combat can be a bit wonky at times but the engaging story more than makes up for it.There is a small but very devoted modding scene for VtMB and I highly recommend getting wesp's unofficial patch if you do get this.

												This is one of the games that simply enchant you with atmospere and world creation. The story is also great. This is no vampire love storry, and any of available characters would make Edward Cullen run home screaming for mommy. In here you are no prophecised demigod of vampires. You are a newcomer who doesn't know the world he/she's entering and everything around is dirty politics. You want to be a decent vampire? Sure, you'll be in control of the beast. You want to be a bloodsucking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ toying with his prey? You'll also be satisfied. You want to break the rules and kill humans on the street? Go on, but you'll be punished. If you can handle it, you're free to go. But I guarantee the most fun aspect of the game is the role playing, the intrigue, the plot, and finding who (if anyone) is your true firnd at the end. This is a game depicting harsh, brutal, and dark world full of aristocrats, sycophants, celebrities, business moguls and simple junkies. What you do with it is your choice. The only must have in case of this title is an extensive external mod bundle which will fix game's technical issues, enable it to run on newer Windows systems (runs great on my W8) and improve some graphics. But this game is worth this little trouble you'll have starting it up. Thanks to great community I'm going to enjoy it many years since now.			"

												This dark, gritty, vulgar vampire game is something most people would expect to just be your typical game. This is something that kind of blew my mind. Just played an hour or so into it i noticed that it is very detailed in the types of vampires they have, the abilities, and the lifestyle. They do a very good job keeping everything shadey and making you play the game to discover more of it. You get to create how you want your character and it gives you a few options. Only thing is i noticed is it didn't have a character customization. What happens is theres a character thats pre-determined for each type of vampire. Suprisingly the graphics aren't that bad either. I figured they would be horrible or very dated due to it's time but for the game it still outshines most indie games these days. I will update this further when i play more of the game, but for now i recommend this game. Also if you purchase this game you might run into some issues running. All you need to do is patch the game and heres the link to it. Just simply place the patch into the steam file folder of the game and patch it up and enjoy!Vampires: The Masquerade-Bloodlines 8.4 Patchhttp://gamewatcher.com/mods/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-mod/patch-8-4-2-unofficial "

												Bloodlines was damned to be a ""flawed gem"" straight out of the box. Despite a loyal, yet small fanbase creating unnoficial patches to fix the bugs found in the game, it still has a lot to be fixed. The game works on the early Source engine, so it uses to base code for Half Life 2, but the development cycle took different paths from the very beggining. The most notable feature of this RPG in particular is the fact that Experience isn't gained for kiling enemies, but for completing quests or finding alternate or special routes to them. That makes it a lot more that a run & gun game. This is - a true Role Playing Game.Don't overlook it on sale and make sure every person who's interested in properly dignified narrative, story, gothic vibes - that they get a copy. It is worth the magnanimousness, the cause is a product scarcely seen, brought to near extinction.			"

												This game is hands down the best rpg I have ever played. The Fable and Dragon Age franchises come close in quality as far as story and ambience are concerned. The one thing that makes this game stand out for me is a preferred aesthetic; gothic vampire fantasy.  As a long time roleplayer within White Wolf's World of Darkness I can tell you not only is this an extremely faithful rendition of that universe, but one which sucks you in with delight at it's wickedness. It is an old game now but has lost none of its charm, indeed there is still a community of modders providing unofficial patches and custom content which can enhance your game. The latest unofficial patch is necessary to make the game play well, it is a notoriously buggy piece of work. All I can say to this is it is worth the effort. Sadly it wasnt worth the effort (to the developers)  to finish making World of Darkness Online, I am still heartbroken.			"

												VTMB is a wonderful RPG with amazing writing. Plenty of unexpected plot twists, even the ending surprised me. Lots of humor, which was always enjoyable too. The RPG elements were good, if a little confusing at first, the character sheet can be overwhelming at first glance, but it's easy to get the hang of eventually. VTMB provided you with plenty choices as well, involving not just the plot, but your style of gameplay, some of your dialogue, even extra areas depended on the clan you chose. The length of the game was also very nice, with loads of side quests in each area to do. The only downsides to this game were it's bugs, a lot of which were fixed in the unofficial patches, and the difficulty of some enemies seemed too hard at times, but with careful spending of experience points, lots of quicksaves, and patience, can be defeated easily enough. Overall, definitely one of my favorite games ever.			"

												A brilliant adaption of White Wolf's pen and paper RPG system ""Vampire: The Masquerade"", very true to the original setting, very well-written and - provided you grab the fan patch - still very much fun to play. The game has aged very well, the music is still slammin' and the many branching paths and different options ensure you'll be replaying this a time or ten.If you're looking for some gameplay footage and perhaps a word on the lore behind the story, pop on over to the Tubes of You for a glimpse at one of the many different ways this story can play out.WARNING: Does contain commentary so if that's not your thing, don't say I didn't warn ya!

												A third-person action/RPG that is true to the old whitewolf roleplay system. Pros:- The game is true to the old pen and paper whitewolf system, you'll feel like you're really playing Vampire: The Masquerade- Fun character generation with all the classic vampire clans complete with most of the old powers- Immersive environments that make you feel like you're really in a vampire run city- Intrigue and political tactics true to the setting complete with clan biases and alliances- Interesting items and weapons that seem appropriate for the setting- Different playstyles depending heavily on clan and powers- Interesting quests that add a lot of color to the world- A real feeling of power at higher level, but also danger as the game never becomes easyCons:- Buggy, lots of crashes and locks can make things annoying at times- Lots of prep work needed to get the game running, you usually have to use one of the fan-created patches to get this to work on steam- Some knowledge needed, building a character poorly can make the game very hard to progress inOverall:  This game is a great experience, even with the work needed to get it running (which is usually an instant fail for me), I have to recommend this game.  It's worth the investment to be able to immerse yourself in a game and a world that pays so much respect to the original Whitewolf source material.  And even if you've never played Vampire before, you can enjoy it for the interesting story and unique world.			"

												As a former VTM pen and paper player I loved this game, it's undoubtedly one of the best action RPG games out there, even if outdated. The campaign is so long I uninstalled the game as soon as I finished it, will try again with another clan in the future (I played as a Malkavian), but for now I just want to let this awesome storyline earn it's spot in my long term memory. If you see this game for sale for anything under $10, buy it, you won't be disappointed.			"

												Use the unofficial patch or this game will be too broken to even touch.Now:Probably the best overall writing ever seen in a video game. Deus Ex, Thief, Morrowind, System Shock and Pathologic were all excellent in their own respects --- but this game beats them all in terms of consistency and believability. Characters actually have personality, conversations actually flow, and every single NPC that can be interacted with has a ton of depth and maybe even a few ulterior motives. This game is easily tied with Deus Ex as the closest we've ever gotten to Warren Spector's ""one city block"" vision. It simply has to be experienced to be believed.Unfortunately, the game is even more broken than Deus Ex. While Deus Ex was marred by half-baked and unsatisfying systems that would make for a terrible games on their own, this game is marred by a ton of systems that are either there for no reason whatsoever or just outright don't work. The Seduction skill makes Deus Ex's Swimming look useful, and there is absolutely no reason to use firearms at any point in the game. Not even the tutorial for firearms requires that you use them --- they are that useless. For the first two areas, the game is a brilliant collage of choices and possibilities, surpassing even, yes, Deus Ex, but that vision becomes more and more distant as the game goes on, to the point where the latter half of the game is a concoction of horribly rushed and bland dungeon crawls and some of the worst boss fights even seen in games and the final area is almost entirely devoid of any complex architecture, sidequests or secrets. The story comes to a similarly rushed, mean-spirited and silly conclusion. If there was ever a game that deserved this kind of fate, this one wasn't it.Overall, this game is Deus Ex taken to the extreme in every aspect --- while the world of Deus Ex occasionally felt real and personal, Bloodlines' world bursts at the seems with life, and for a precious moment, one could be forgiven for seeing the World of Darkness as truly alive and endless. While Deus Ex was somewhat weak in its mechanics and failed to retain its momentum into the latter stages of the game, Bloodlines barely functions at all beyond its first few stages and completely falls apart in the latter half. This game is utterly brilliant for its first half, but the second half will make any player mourn for what it could have been. Considering the fact that Troika closed its doors after Bloodlines' release and nobody has so much as attempted something approaching the first half of the game ever since, it's unlikely that we'll see a happy ending for this kind of game, so we have no choice but to enjoy this precious specimen.

												Simply put, this is the best game I've ever played, and I've played tons of them over the span of 20+ years of gaming.I'm a huge RPG fan. Easily my favorite genre. I've heard a lot about Bloodlines and people saying how great it was but I didn't get a chance to play it until recently. I'm so glad I finally played it because it is superb.It's got an incredible, believable atmosphere of dread that draws you in completely and hooks you from the first minute of the game. It's got a great story with plenty of intrigue, interesting characters, some dark humor and excellent RPG systems under the hood that all come together to provide a fantastic gaming experience.Your choices actually matter and different things will happen based on how you play the game. Unexpected outcomes can happen if you make the ""wrong"" decision. The game always keeps you on your toes.It's also got it's share of creepiness. You'll explore some levels that will scare you, and it also explores some dark and disturbing themes. As I said at the beginning, it's the best game I've ever played. Highly recommended. 10/10			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is an underrated gem and probably the best vampire game ever made. If you're a fan of deep RPG's and have never played this game you're missing out. The world, the unforgettable characters and the incredible in-depth lore taken from the original tabletop game is amazing and deserves to be praised.Although the game looks dated from a graphical standpoint and it's far from bug free, thanks to the fan created Unofficial Patch the game is playable on most modern systems, fixes most of the instability issues and quest bugs and even restores some lost and/or unfinished content. The combat is still clunky though and the stealth AI remains poor but this is luckily easy overshadowed by the fantastic story and atmosphere in this game.Apart from that, the well written dialogue, the great voice acting, the stylish music, the variety in quests that you can undertake and the complete freedom to approach each situation in a number of different ways all make this game standout to this day. You are free to explore and there are countless side quests to stumble upon, each with their own unique story, there is certainly no copy and paste content here.Technical issues aside this is still one hell of a game. If you haven't already, pick this game up and give it a try, it deserves to be played.			"

												This game is phenomenal, I don't usually use big words because it makes my head hurt but this time round I just had to bare with the pain in order to make this review. This game allows you to immerse yourself into a vampire role-playing game which is vast and has numerous twists, you start off as a nobody who is sired (turned) by someone you're sleeping with - male or female. Thus begins your story into the chaotic world of the supernatural, with numerous mods which change the story and add extra clans you'll be capable of sinking many hours into this game and gaining great pleasure from doing so. I don't usually make reviews unless the game is truly deserving of one, so let that bounce around your empty skull for a moment. You NEED to buy this game, you MUST have this game. Sorry, I just tried to dominate you - which is one of the many disciplines you are capable of having in this game. The game itself is known for having bugs, however the community keep making patches for it which fixes them and brings along new content.10/10 - Carl Poppa RatingYou'll definitely need to buy this game if you are a fan of vampires, supernatural or are merely looking for an immersive role-playing game.

												First things first.  To deal with the game's issue with not being able to load properly, disable Steam updates and load the latest non-official patch.  After that, you're golden.  As far as good RPGs are concerned, I find myself returning to this game a lot.  I don't think I've ever had an RPG draw me into its world and characters as much as this one has, and the more I play it, the more I enjoy it.  It has its rough edges, mostly moments where combat is inevitable and odds feel stacked a bit unfairly against you.  Still, I love the ever living heck out of the interactions you have with characters, the dialogue, and the choices you can make thoughout the game.  Don't like the cop stopping you?  Mind control him, persuade him, seduce him.  There are plenty of choices and it's beautiful.  The game plays just long enough not to overstay its welcome.  Take the plunge and enter the World of Darkness.			"

												There is a reason this game still comes in on my Top 10 Favorite Games. At time of writing I have logged over 60 hours into this game. I love the setting, the gameplay, and the experiance that it presents to you.        The creatures and clans remain faithful to their source material which makes for a great mix of horror and RPG. Some of the creepier places really get under your skin. When this game came out, it had top of the line graphics, but has aged a bit. That doesn’t distract from the incredible art direction and level design.         With each clan bringing a unique playstyle, and 5 endings, this game has a lot of replayability. I especially enjoyed the madness inducing Malkavians. The game will often give you a goal and have several ways to accomplishing it. 10 years after the fact, I still love and play this game. Make sure you get the unofficial patch though. It fixes a lot of bugs and adds a lot of extra content (mainly stuff the designers hadn’t finished yet).Overall, if your looking for a great game with horror/RPG elements, give this game a try. It will suck you into its world!Highly Recommended5/5			"

												There is very little I can say about this game that has not been said. I love it. The progression system, level of autonomy of the character and how they interact with the nerative, the writing, and the voice acting are all amazing and they are what make this game. The combat system is kind of crap and it's a bit of a buggy mess (PLAY WITH THE UNOFICIAL COMMUNITY PATCH!! Really, don't even bother trying to play it venilla. Buy the game and then download the patch THEN play it) but once you patch it up what few drawbacks there are to this game are completely forgoten once you get sunk into the deap and rich world that was writen for us in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. Ultimately there is a very good reason this game is a cult classic and why the community still loyally patches and updates the mods for this game fairly regularly. Two thumbs up. 12/10. Play this game.			"

												What to say about this game, man. First don't let the 1.1 hours mislead you, I've put around ten hours so far into this game. The Unofficial patch functions outside of steam so the counters not gonna work. I reccomend the patch by the way it has a list of improvements that make the game more enjoyable.The Pro's:-Lore. There's a lot of it and it is fairly easy to understand most of it.-Graphics. Top notch for it's time, early 2000's, it has aged pretty well to my eyes.-Audio/Voice Acting. The background music is pretty atmospheric and in tense situtions got my heart quickening a bit. The VO is well acted and cast, Each important and even supporting characters feel very distinct.-Gameplay. It's an rpg so you'll have to manage stats and what not but I found keeping track of your ""Humanity"" interesting as well as ""The Masquerade"". Falling to zero in either of those is game over. Also don't die, that's a game over too...-You Are a Vampire Baby! Bloody act like it!!!!!The Cons:-Some small bugs are still present even with the patch but that's to be expected. Nothing is perfect.-Character creation is really limited. You have about a dozen sub species of vampire to choose from but you CAN'T go in and edit facial appearances or anything. Options are limited to race, gender, backstory and predetermined body build. Each has it's own strengths and weakness. My character is a Brujah, strong willed idealist types but low self control when ""The Thirst"" rears its ugly head. (I use The phrase ""The Thirst"" because the Blade movies had the better term.)-Quest details often give you very little clues as to where to find goals. You'll end up wandering about before figuring out that you need to be in a area that hasn't been unlocked to you yet.-Managing your skills seems a bit daunting at the very begining but it gets smoother as you go on.-Quick travel between areas but not to specific locations i.e. clubs, motels and such. So be prepared to walk, a lot...This game is savage (in a good way) and is well worth playing atleast twice I feel. I give it 9 out of 10 bites to the neck. Would bite again and again. Hehehe the Thirst always wins...			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, is Role Playing game released in 2004. You can play in both First or Third-person Mode, as one of several vampire clans each with their own abilities and gameplay style: Playing as Nosferatu, are especially challenging. You start the game as a fledgling vampire who has to find your way through the streets of Los Angeles. Along the way you learn about the Various Vampire clans, as well as investigate a recently discovered relic that is supposed to bring an end to all vampires. The story takes you through Santa Monica, Downtown Los Angeles, Hollywood, Chinatown, as well as the Underground. I don't want to go into the story to much, due to spoilers, but I will say the game has varying levels of difficult depending on what clan you choose to play as. You have the ability to create ghouls, which are humans who are fed Vampire blood, giving them powers, and binding the ghoul to you. I personally like the voice acting in this game and found some of the characters to be memorable such as; Jeanette. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is a fun RPG, worth your time if you are into Occult-themed games. "

												This is probably my favorite game ever created. I like this as much as Rappers like tax evasion(seriously guys do you taxes). I would even go as far as saying greatness and this game go together like Nicole Richie and calorie counters. The game allows you to make a character from 5 different clans. These clans all have thier own special abilities and feel really different. Oh yeah, I should mention that the game is very stat heavy. Now I am going to put down what I liked about the game in cliffnotes because current society's attention span is as short as Gary Coleman doing the crabwalk. Let us get into this,What I liked?-Very stat heavy which makes for some interesting skillchecks-Multiple ways to create a character-Multiple ways to complete a mission-Brilliant Dialogue(If you want movie type of dialogue this is the game if you want book type of dialogue look for Planetscape : Torment)-Voice acting is spot on, probably one of the best voice acting ever recorded in an rpg.-Combat abilities are just marvelous-Clan specific abilities give your character a different feel.-Lots of Side Missions-Interesting story component-Multiple Endings-Mixture of Minor and Major Decisions to be made(Not all rpgs should be based on making decisions of finding a cure for cancer or ending world hunger)What I didn't like?-BUGS. With the amount of bugs that this game has, you would think it was made by an obsidian programmer working through a hangover. The amount of bugs in this game are probably being cast for ANTZ 2(3?). When I think about the bugs i run away in peril because I think they are all over me. (They are amazing patches to fix this though)-The last quarter of the game was more copy paste than that friend of yours that leaves assignments till sunday. Seriously troika fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥Other than that it is probably my most favorite game out there. I would go ahead and give it what it is due. VTMB with patches and everything is a complete 9.7/10. I absolutely wasted and had so much fun in this game. I would recommend it for anyone that wants to have fun. Seriously get it.DISCLAIMER : IDONTWORKFORACTIVISIONANDMYENDORSEMENTOFTHISPROJECTDOESNOTMEANIAMGETTINGPAYEDFORITSOWHYDONTYOUHOPOFFANDLETMEFINISHWRITINGTHISREVIEWBEFOREISETITOFFINTHISPLACECAUSEYOUDONOTKNOWMELIKETHAT...SIR.Good day			"

												Picked this up for the first time in 2014, and it  beats the crap out of the vast majority of modern day Action RPG's when it comes to story, immersion, character creation and sound. The patches have made the graphics acceptable, without being great. The controls are where the game shows its age the most as they can sometimes be annoying and clunky but its the only important flaw in what i would qualify otherwise as a masterpiece. Its also something pretty good to pick up while waiting for games like the Dragon Age: Origins, Fallout or Elder Scrolls games to come out. I'm happy I did.			"

												For those of you who ascribe to the ""TL;DR"" method of reviews, here's basically what you need to know: the storytelling is fantastic, the characters are interesting, the voice-acting is awesome, and while the graphics are a bit dated the game still looks pretty good. It doesn't have the greatest controls, particularly in the area of combat, but it's far from unplayable. 9/10, would highly recommend. It's pure, unadulterated fun.Now, for a more detailed review.This is the greatest game I have ever played. No, I mean no exaggaration, this is not a joke. This is the best game I've ever had the honor to play.Your story is that you're a newly developed vampire whose sire (creator) is executed right at the beginning, leaving you to fend for yourself as you struggle to survive and prove your worth to the head vampire with only your own wits and the help of a few compassionate souls.The characters in particular stand out sharp in this game. They don't feel as if they only spring into existance when you need them there, or like they'll stop moving and living the minute you leave their occupied area. They feel real enough that you can believe they'll keep doing their own thing even after you're gone. They're all interesting and well-developed, with many of them having their own backstories, and some even having arcs throughout the game.The amount of content in this game is ridiculous. It has seven clans to choose from, which makes for a lot of replayability since character interactions, and even certain missions, will vary based on what clan you are. There's tons of sidequests and little things you can do. There's five endings to discover for yourself. Thanks to a vast character sheet, as well as distinct dialogue options, it's easy to slip into whatever kind of character you want to be: a seductive beauty, a cold-hearted killer, a bloodthirsty maniac-- the possibilities are many. This game is good at making you feel like a powerful monster of the night, surrounded by weak, human prey.And all of that is just with the basic patch. If, like me, you choose to go with the Scrolls patch, (I can't recommend it enough) then there's also the option to set it to Plus, which unlocks even more content. I would suggest beginning with the basic for your first playthrough, and then changing it to plus for another playthrough later on. That way you can get a close feel for how the vanilla game works versus how it works when modded slightly.I would also advise that you leave one particular clan, Malkavian, for last. Malkavians are, by far, the most fun clan to play; however, because they are future-seers they will frequently spoil upcoming events in the game, so definitely save them for your final run.Overall, I can't praise this game highly enough, nor recommend it enough. It's well worth full price.			"

												i played this game before it was on steam. beat it once and did several playthroughs that i didnt finish. (or did i ?)so nevermind my 5.3 hours on record.this rpg is very similiar to the deus ex games. a lot of your time will be spend in open ""hub""? areas where there is a lot to explore and find.a lot of places you didnt expect to be there and some disturbing secrets.combat wise you can shoot, sneak, bash and use bloodmagic and the like. all is mostly stat based.there are no levels in the game you just get exp that you can spend on anything you like whenever you like. (except for some clan exclusive abilities)this game is highly NONlinear. there are not only multiple endings but branching storylines and various ways to complete a quest.want to talk your way through the entire game? well you can. but make sure your vampire clan isnt nosferatu or you will be so hideously deformed that most people will run away from you and call the cops. sometimes you might convince someone you had a horrible accident but you should really stick to the shadows and mostly the sewers where you feed on rats.want to be part of the insane malkavian clan so you cant speak one coherent sentence and creep everybody out and convince human beings that they are in fact turtles? you can too but prepare for things to unfold very differently. or do you want to be part of the snobbish ruler clan where the lower classes will treat you with disdain or a pretty boy (or gal) who charmes and seduces his way through the game (to the disdain of certain nosferatus).you can choose to hack computers and talk and find clues to complete quest. or bully, brawl and shoot your way through the questlines. you can be compassionate, insane or cruel all these things shape the story you will experience. not only can you decide the way you approach the game mechanically but you also have a say in how the story unfolds. for better or worse.there is a lot of atmosphere and humour to the game so there are definitely light hearted moments. but for the most part its all about lowlife, decadence, depravity, perversion and supernatural and sometimes even lovecraftian horror.bloodlines is using the source engine (the half life 2 one). im not sure but i think it came out before half life 2 and it certainly shows. but the facial animations in the dialouge are on point. ranging from bored teenage store clerk, doped up pawn shop owner or insane cultist. oh and the mutliple choice dialogue is decently expansive. with great writing.troika went broke while completing the game so it was released in a very buggy state. nonetheless this game was (and still is) considered by many rpg fans as one of the best. i concur. if you like deus ex or just rpgs in general you will find a lot to like. its quite unique and unmatched in many ways. certainly the best vampire game on the market.even 13 years (wow really? time flies!) after release the community is still active in modding and patching the game. you should definitely (yes there is no argument to be had) get the latest unofficial community patch by wesp (i think) from patchesscrolls. the last one is from a few days ago. shows you the dedication of certain fans. a lot of bugfixes and an optional plus patch that restores content cut from the game due to development limitations and such.the voice acting ranges from superp and excellent to ""sufficient"". but the enviromental sounds are quite fitting and the soundtrack gives you a great neonoir (thats a thing right?) feeling.theres a lot more to mention and im sure other steam reviews will help you out or some big game reviewers go into more detail. all in all its a fantastic game and there is no reason not to try it.(btw if you live in germany dont be put off by the ""low violence"" disclaimer)this ""low violence"" version used to be sold as the german uncut version in stores and it basically is.the only confirmed cut is a nanosecond of the intro sequence and if you install the unoffical patch ""plus"" the restoration stuff you dont have to ""worry"" about that either.pro +great writing. (story and dialogue)interesting characters.decent facial animations.classless system.great atmosphere. (with some♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants moments.)highly non linear.lots of replayability. decent hacking mechanic and a cool computer interface where you actually have to type.lots of weapons, magic. stats and talents. (you can make people go insane or puke blood and stuff goood times)different vampire clans that are really different! people will react to you differently. greatly.cool soundtrack and enviromental sounds.voice acting is really good when its good.community patches and mods.gory fun.lovecraftian reverences..twistscon -dated graphics.will be buggy without patches.can be frustrating due to its sometimes harsh difficulty.you can potentially screw up your character build.voice acting is not so good sometimes. (unless its great)overall a great game. just dont expect a first person shooter. it isnt one. its more like the fallout or deus ex games in that respect.i say buy the game and spread the word about how awesome it is.lets hope troika or some developers of it make a comeback.and uh.... ""dont open it"".			"

												This is a no-brainer purchase/must-play for anyone who is familiar with White Wolf's World of Darkness franchise, anyone who has played the first of the legacy Vampire the Masquerade games, anyone who plays LARP or tabletop versions of VtM, or really anyone who is even vaguely interested in an introduction to the rich lore offered by an immersive and addictive tabletop game series. Unlike with Vampire the Masquerade: Redemption, where you are forced to play out the storyline set before you from the perspective of a ""true"" Brujah, this game gives you the choice of what clan you are to be embraced under, and it gives you a taste of the what the game world is really about, allowing your choices to affect the events that play out around you. Ofcourse, there are still linear aspects of the game, and a few glitches here and there, but thankfully there is an entire decade of reliable user-made updates that improve upon those, along with increases in graphics and presentation. All around, this is an excellent game that I would recommend to so many of my friends that are interested in dark fantasy role playing games.			"

												This game is so good that you even forget that this is an old game (with its related limitations). It perfectly represents the punk gothic scenario designed for the Storyteller’s RPG, putting all the environmental, climate, and situations exactly as it should be in such world - a must for those who used to play the RPG. The history is very interesting and the dialogues are well written and very funny several times. Even the advertisement that plays on the radio (which you can ignore if you want) is funny and well elaborated. The haunted house mission is a memorable moment of the game and is a good example of how this game is well made. In overall, any fan of the genre will have a lot of fun playing it and I definitely recommend it.As a con, the necessity of having to use an external patch from a third party in order to get the best performance of the game is something bad as you expect to purchase a perfect version. However, the forum is really helpful to guide the player through this process and it worked fine for me. Sometimes the game got buggy, but nothing that harassed the gameplay.			"

												NOTE: It says I have zero game hours because I used the unofficial patch and it didn't record my Steam hours. Just know that I played this game ALOT.This is my second favorite role-playing game of all time! And it's still extremely close to my first favorite, Mass Effect 2. The voice acting is really, really good. You get a pen and paper-like character customizer where you get to pick your gender, and vampire clan along with a backstory about before you became a vampire. The intro is really interesting and builds the world very well. You really do feel like a vampire that's hiding their true identity in Los Angeles. Each quest is interesting, and are all worth playing. Instead of an open world, you get four hub cities Santa Monica, Hollywood, Downtown, and Chinatown. Depending on your gender, clan, and certain skills, you can select alot of interesting dialogue options, and unlock more too! The lore is very interesting, and I recommend studying it on the White Wolf Wiki if you're gonna buy this game. This game also has great characters who are all very detailed in the world. In fact, my favorite gaming character of all time came from this game, Therese Voerman. If you look past the dated graphics, even some bugs with the unofficial patch still installed, and look at all the great things this game has to offer like detailed role-playing, interesting characters, a well set up world, rich lore, and great quests, you can easily have alot of fun with this game.

												Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is a rare gem. It takes the basic gameplay of the intelligent shooters of old and mixes it with a heavy does of RPG mechanics and open ended storytelling.Bloodlines start you off in a very classic vampire way, you find yourself in a seedy motel room being hot and heavy with someone of the opposite sex when all of the sudden they bite you. Before you get a chance to get your bearings some goons storm the place and take you and your new lover away to a court where your lover is executed for making a new vampire without permission but you are uncharacteristically spared. You are then set loose on the streets where a friendly old geezer explains what it means to be a vampire and after a quick tutorial introducing you the various concepts of the game you are free to explore the city.Bloodlines is a first person shooter in it's most basic form although many of the weapons and abilities are melee in nature. It takes a great deal of inspiration from Deus Ex and System Shock by creating a myriad of different ways to go about each area. Lots of vents and back alleys, locks to pick and people to persuade. There is always another way to go about things depending on your skills and inclination. The RPG system is fairly straight forward, you get skill points as you level up which can then be put into a myriad of different skills and abilities including some special vampire magic that tends to be specific to the vampire clan you select during character creation.The vampire clans are on the big highlights of the game with the most notable mentions being Nosferatu who are hideous and unable to pass for a human unlike the other clans and the the Malkavians who are, quite literally, completely and utterly insane. Both of these change the way you play and experience the game significantly and in particular the Malkavian guarantees you will need a second playthrough.The main storyline isn't anything tremendously exciting however the smaller side-quests and the world itself is exceptionally well written and acted and you will feel heavily immersed throughout the game.Source is the engine upon which this is all created which makes for a decent looking game even though it was released a good while after Half-Life 2 due to licensing issues which unfortunately also had the side-effect of absolutely killing the sales of this game and also Troika, the developers.When originally released Bloodlines was extremely bug ridden despite the delay in release and it was nearly unplayable at that point, now however most of the bugs have been patched out and for those few things left unfinished there is a very high quality fan made patch that I recommend everyone gets before playing the game.All in all Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines is one of the best games of the modern era and one of the few modern games that manages to pull off a first person view without losing sight of what the game is trying to accomplish. You could classify it as an action RPG or as a first person shooter with some RPG elements but either way, it's a great game.			"

Altough i enjoyed almost all aspect of the game the massive amount of bugs just kept me out and i quickly lost insterest and i didn't even finish it.Now.. many many years later i saw this game again on Steam with a overwhelming positive review... that just got me curious and picked it up for just a couple dollar. The unofficial patch fixxed nearlly all the problems I had before with improved graphics, characters and dialogs.. it did took me a bit time to get it work on windows 8.1 but i it's definitly worth it.. gonna do a playthough for at least 5 games  with Brujah Anach, Torey Cami, Nos Cami, Malk Anach and Ventrue Sabbat for sure.I would recommend this game to anyone that has ever played any RPG. It's a diamond in the rough that survied the test of time.			"

If you like vampires ( no not the damn sparkly ones) this is a definite buy. The story is quite gripping and pulls you into the shadow world of the vampire. There are many different vampires to choose from the misshapen nosferatu, to your more seductive Ventrue. The skill tree for each vampire type is different so your can truely have a unique vampire in its own right.Final score: 85/100			"

												This has been my favorite game since it released in '04. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes the supernatural (vampires, werewolves, ghosts, etc.), dark humor, and an RPG more akin to Deus Ex than Oblivion. For additional enjoyment, get the Unofficial Patch, which you can easily find via Google. It is still being updated from time to time by a talented devotee who goes by Wesp5. The patch features a basic version that fixes any bugs that have been brought to light and can be corrected, as well as a plus version which includes actual content that was in the game but had not been implemented at the time of release; even pre-recorded dialog and weaponry. I've beaten the game somewhere between 20 and 30 times, you can play as 7 different types of vampire, each of which you can upgrade differently with experience points, which are gained via completing quests rather than grinding kills.How did I forget to mention the characters in my original review? Almost every character in this game is memorable, with many interesting and likable characters: Nines Rodriguez, Velvet Velour, Jeanette Voerman, Therese Voerman, Knox, Gary Golden, Damsel, Romero, Mercurio, Sebastian LaCroix, Chunk, and many, maaany more. I've probably logged at least one-thousand hours on this game on the disc version before it ever came to Steam. I love this game and wish there had been more games from the developer in this universe, but at least I'll always have Bloodlines. <3			"

VtMB is a really great RPG, it may be dated, buggy and even ""unfinished"" but with the help of a patch or two nothing is stopping you from enjoying the game. I can say now I am most definitely interested in playing a new Vampire: The Masquerade game at some point in the future. I would recommend Bloodlines to pretty much any RPG or classic game fan. I feel the series would be much more popular had more people played Bloodlines, and recommend you do so if you even find it remotely interesting.			"

												Rating: 8.5/10What is it? First Person RPG in a vampire setting. The Good:+ Character creation is excellent. You start off by choosing your vampire clan. Each clan has its own set of abilities. Two clans in particular really change the game up: The Malkavians and the nosferatu really play differently from the other clans offering some nice replay value.+ Lots of stats to further build your character. Play as a melee, stealth, guns, hacking etc.  Build a character that fits your play style+ The plot and characters are interesting, they really flesh out the story and dialogue. + Great main and side missions+ Multiple ways of completing your missions depending on your character build. Go in guns blazing, or sneak in through the back, etc. + A lengthy game that never feels boring or drawn out simply because the developers did a good job of keeping things interesting all the way through. The Bad:- Technical and texture glitches. The game was officially patched however there were still plenty of bugs left over. You must play with some of the unofficial patches. I was playing with a widescreen mod which may have contributed to all the texture anomalies. -The combat feels less polished then the rest of the game. Melee combat goes into third person view which could be off putting to some. Using guns can be very frustrating and probably won't be worth it until you invest some heavy experience points into the firearm skill. Guns probably won't be effective until half way through the game. - Some really annoying parts of the game.  Luckily it was far and few between to really hurt the overall experience.ConclusionA great game, and if you love RPG's this is a great game that you can't go wrong with. Possibly one of the best vampire games out there.  "

												The best rpg I have ever played. You need the unofficial patch to be able to run it but it is worth even the full price they ask. You wont find anything similar in the market. It has deep rpg elements, great soundtrack, lots of different classes /clans/ to select from, great story and atmosphere and u can play it how you want -run and gun, to use meele weapons or to be a sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with your special powers which you will find plenty of them to choose from . The game is just amazing, creepy in a good way and there is  boobs physics too! 11/10, would IGN again.			"

												Well, where to start with this game. It is easy to be swallowed in to the game by it's rich storyline and a fantasticly written dialogue - but it's not just that. I felt immersed in this game that was able to describe and not only give me an idea of - but also allow me to feel like I was suddenly pulled into a vampire society. Which, judging by the popularity of the vampire genre in video gaming, seems to be something that many games involving vampires have great difficulty with. I look forward to the future and hope that the vampire genre can be inspired by this game.I'll list the pros and cons of this briefly, from my experience. Pros:~ Deep and non-linear storyline.~ At the start, you can choose your stats or 'roll' them randomly (let the game decide!), and have a choice of clans with their own personality, background, advantages and disadvantages.~ Creative and well written dialogue, of which can change depending on chosen clan.~ Voice acting that fits well with the characters and enriches their personalities.~ Many hours of play filled with many missions and many choices for you to make.~ Experience various entertaining kinds of insanity.Cons:~ There are bugs. The patch does help with this and is easy to find with a web search. However, it does not eliminate them completely, and this is also to be expected when playing an old game. Personally I wasn't bothered by them, as I was too busy enjoying the storyline.~ Combat is funky. This links with the bugs, but don't get me wrong - there are tough fights.~ Graphics can be improved with the patch I believe, but are still old. It's not disasterous or unplayable however, by any means - on the contrary, very good for an old game in my opinion.~ For some people this will be a con. SAVE OFTEN. Your experience of the game will differ in places depending on the choices you make, and you may want to go back to have a different experience later. And then of course, there's always the possibility of getting shredded up and dying.			"

												One of the greatest FPSRPG games of all time, thwarted by it's own ambitious design, a publisher that refused to allocate funds to finish and polish the game, and valve cockblocking the release until half life 2 was out (which of course stole all the limelight and caused the game to sell poorly)It has since developed a cult following, and numerous unnofficial patches and gameplay updates.It really succeeds in making you feel like an undead badass and in portraying a world that thrives at 3am, features memorable locations like a gothic nightclub, a hollywood porno store and of course a haunted house (and theatre, and cemetary, and derelict hospital, and rundown apartment building, and fish market.... basically there's a lot of hauntings)Features some terrific writing, dialogue and humour. It also has a great levelling system where allocated skills and abilities actually affect the gameplay in a big way.Gamebreaking bugs and glitches can usually be overcome with the unnofficial patches, and are highly recommended.

												I actually really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. True, everything about this game is dated, the graphics though good then seem poor now and the interactions between you and in game NPCS range from linear to non-existent. That being said, I love this game, it is dark, gritty, and really gives you that predatory sense you would expect from being on top of the food chain. The dialogue that you do experience between your character and other characters never feels forced and is almost always engaging. Additionally I want to say,  being Malkavian is so entertaining that even though the general story does not change regardless of what clan you pick, it feels like a completely different experience.  This game gives out multiple endings, with interesting plot twists and a whole ranges of level concepts ranging from frightening to pure combat. My only real complaint about this game are in the in game cut scenes, I don't know exactly what it is, but the models at times look so hunched over and walk like they have too poop sometimes that I get actively annoyed. All that being said, definitely worth exploring the world of darkness if you got the time.  "

												I'm not normally a fan of Vampire games, but I picked up this one upon recommendation by a friend, and holy cow is it good! Important points include:1) There are violent encounters you can turn into diplomatic ones, if you're very diplomatic.2) There are stealth encounters you can turn into shoot 'em up encounters, if you're inclined.3) The game is reasonably faithful to the tabletop, but makes some pretty clear changes to make it a good video game.4) There's a mission where you're supposed to get rid of a ghost. It just might be the scariest mission in the whole game, and you don't fight a single monster or enemy the whole time.5) If you play the game as a Malkavian, your flaw is that you're crazy. So they changed all the dialogue options to reflect this, voiced over responses to your crazy talk, and made a few other changes to make it really work.6) This is the first time since high school that I felt like I really wanted to play a vampire tabletop game.NOTE: The unofficial patch (now in version 9.0) is basically required to play this game on a modern computer. You can get it here: http://www.patches-scrolls.com/vampire_bloodlines.php "

												This is by the far the best single vampire game in existence.There have been countless vampire games through the years.  Some focus on the monster, some focus on the romance,  Most you don't particularly have to think about all the consequences of becoming one.  This game will immerse you in a seductive and dangerous world of vampirism the likes of which has not been replicated to this degree in a game.  And when I say you, I mean you.  It is a deeply personal affair in which you can take a personal journey or a journey of any character you wish, with whatever depth you wish.Do you want to be the outcasts of society?  Do you want to be the Hollywood monster that people avert their gaze from?  Do you want to be the Anne Rice version of a vampire?  Smart, seductive, ruthless.  Do you want to be utterly insane?  So many ways to make yourself your own, so many ways to interact with the myriad of story lines in the dark, urban nightlife of Cali.The music is also phenomenal.  Utterly fantastic.  The soundtrack feels dark and gritty while you're wandering the streets, diving in sewers and popping in night clubs seducing and making your way.Modding is REQUIRED.  I say again, R E Q U I R E D.  Don't think about playing this without extensive research on the must have mods.  The story of this title is infamous, go read if you want to know why it requires so much rework and how passionate this community around it is.  I did the unofficial patch and a few graphic overall mods myself, your mileage may vary.Writing this review makes me want to install it again and play...If you have any interest of vampires whatsoever, pick it up!

												As a huge fan of the VTM tabletop game, I'll admit, I was skeptical when I first bought this.  Sometimes adapting one media into another (be it book to movie, game to movie or, in this case, one type of game to another), it either loses something or gains WAY too much to be enjoyable to longtime fans of whatever the previous media was.  So, yeah, I had my doubts -- but let me tell you, they were entirely unfounded.  This has become one of my favorite (if not absolute favorite) RPGs of all time.  Not only does it stay true to the source, which was a big selling point for me, but it is so incredibly easy to become immersed in the world you're presented.  The atmosphere is wonderful, especially for an older game when creating those elements is a bit more limited than it is now; maybe it's just me, but while wandering around Santa Monica, L.A., and the rest, I definitely do get that feeling of 'city by night'.  Lots of memorable NPCs scattered about, and the combat system is..fair, I think.  A little wonky here and there, but for the most part, it's pretty smooth.  That your decisions/dialogue affect some aspects of gameplay is always a neat element, too,  and as an added bonus:  no sparkly, wussy vampires.  That goes along with 'staying true to the source', yes, but for anyone who can't help but roll their eyes upon seeing 'vampire', it's worth calling attention to this.Really, I can only find two major downfalls for this game:  first and foremost would be the graphics.  While again, it is a beautiful game, especially for its age, it certainly could benefit from some better visuals, especially where player characters and NPCs are concerned.  This isn't super important to me or anything, as it doesn't take...well, anything, away from the game, but it is worth mentioning.  Second would be the fact that there is no fast travel while in a zone.  It DOES help with immersion, I'll admit, and it's not like the zones are HUGE, by any means, but sometimes it does seem tedious to have to run from point A to point B.All in all, thought, this game is absolutely fantastic.  It's hardly perfect, but for anyone who enjoys RPGs, I cannot possibly recommend this one enough.  This is just one of those games where, every time someone mentions it, someone else will just HAVE to reinstall it.  It's just THAT good.			"

Though buggy and unpolished in its original state of release, the unofficial patch allows this title to reach its full potential: an experience that completely draws you into its gloomy, thoroughly immersive settings, with characters so vibrant as to make you almost think - and certainly wish - that you were carrying on conversations with the most intriguing individuals you could ever imagine. The class customization and dialogue options allow you to feel like you're shaping your own destiny, and progression is steady and fairly well paced, so that by the end, you feel like you're ready to step into whatever epic showdown awaits. With atmospheric music, witty personalities, unique game mechanics, and absolutely top-notch voice-acting, this is a  vampire adventure you'd be sorry you missed out on.			"

												This is a great game! If you can get it to work. That's right. Before buying VTMB, you should know what you're getting yourself into. The game was never finished; it was released as an imcomplete, buggy, broken product - and that's what it still is, even today. Teams of modders have been working on it to either fix as many bugs as they could or even to rebalance and redesign it and to install one of the unofficial patches is, after installing the game to your hard drive, the very first thing you should do; but even so, be prepared for a world of bugs, crashes, google searches, .exe replacing, .cfg tweaking and so on.Let me tell you about my experience with this game. I bought it. Then, I installed Tessara's gold patch which, supposedly (and I have no reason to think otherwise) does an amazing job at fixing all the imaginable problems this game was released with. Then I had to find a way to make the screen resolution acceptable (not 1024*768, this isn't 1999 anymore). Then I was on the street and I noticed a loss of framerate, so I tweaked the .cfg file to deactivate meteo effects. After a couple hours I reached a beach and the game started crashing, forcing my computer into sleep mode. I couldn't get past that beach. Later on I found that the sea's texture was making my comps go bananas so I went for more .cfg tweaking. Then I played a couple more hours and the AI, suddenly, disabled itself - meaning, NPCs froze in place, making the game completely unplayable. Then, as I was looking for a solution, my comps started crashing again.That was it. I decided to wait a year or two for the (unbelievably dedicated) teams of modders who were working at fixing this game, and uninstalled Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.Now don't get me wrong - some people (with Tessara's help in any case) are able to play VTMB just fine. I was able to play for like 5 hours and it was great - dark, immersive, great attention to detail, thrilling game system, great infiltration sequences... It feels like Deus Ex all over again. It feels like a pen & paper experience where I'm alone with the game master. It feels great.But it's ♥♥♥♥ing unstable. It's broken. Anyone considering purchasing this game should know that there's a risk that it won't work at all, that you'll spend as much time fixing it as playing it. Buying this game is a gamble - you're risking your money here.But, again, when it works, whoa, guys - what a ride!			"

However, VTMB doesn't limit you to the usual sneak, seduce and feed vampiric stereotype, it allows you to choose between several races of vampire, each with unique abilities called Disciplines which fill a whole range of playstyles and simultaneously increase replayability.I'd definitely recommend it, and I wish I had stumbled upon this game sooner.

												Very good game. Enjoyed every minute of it.PROS- Great atmosphere- Amazing soundtrack- The world/scenery is well developed and adds to the mood- Original story, with some twists you won't see coming- Dialogues are well written and voiced- RPG system is super- Dark humor (and vulgarities)MORE PROS- You get to play as a Malkavian CONS- buggy (you definitely need the unofficial patch to play it)- towards the end it goes down a bit- somewhat difficult 'puzzles' sometimes to figure out (had to look some things up)Highly recommended!

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, is a near perfect gaming experience despite coming across hundreds of flaws in most every aspect of the game, from the visuals, audio, optimization, rushed mechanics, poor save files, and so forth... Bloodlines suffers from a plagued development, and is far from finished, but comes across as a product both greatly entertaining and lengthy in gameplay. Utilizing the HL2 Source engine, Bloodlines is easily modifiable, and as such many fan made community patches are in circulation around the internet. I highly recommend downloading these patches for a more refined and polished gaming experience (although it is optional as the game is still playable all the way through without said patches). Bloodlines delivers exceptional voice acting, a grim and atmospheric setting, a fantastically agreeable soundtrack, a fair amount of character customization, and at times, a fair amount of role-playing choices, all for a low sum of 20 bucks, and believe me folks - with said amount of issues, it's still very much worth it.

												This game is buggy as all hell with horrible combat and glitches to put you in a state of rage, but I still enjoy it. I hate some of the aged mechanics as much as I love them. Vampire Bloodlines has all these faults but also nostalgic charm. It's set in a goth/punk world with great music, atmosphere and just a berserk personality all on its own. There are many quests and 5 endings to explore but I recommened checking out GameBanshee to guide you along the way for the sewers are difficult to navigate. Also helps you save on EPs and hooks you up with more info about the clans. This game sucks sometimes but I believe its worth the adventure.			"

												Most underrated RPG. This game is older than steam so beware you need to install unofficial patches to have it working. However its absolutely worth it! Most negative reviews on steam are only because they couldn't get it to work which is a huge shame.The atmosphere is is dark, the music awesome and the gameplay really fun and engaging. You really feel like a cursed vampire who had to throw away his/her past for this undead life. The whole concept just works. I finished this game multiple times before buying it on steam. I felt that it was well deserved.Still praying to this day it gets a sequel or remake from a good gaming company. Screw you CCP for ♥♥♥♥ing up with world of darkness.			"

												Note: I have previously played a non-steam version therefore playtime hours are not accurate.Judging by its own merit, I cannot recommend this game since its most important aspect, the gameplay, is badly made. There are bugs (unnoficial patches alleviate but do not solve everything), the combat is horrendous and stealth in higher levels is so overpowered it breaks the game. If you have no interest in Vampire the Masquerade, it is better to skip this title unless you are an RPG afficionado and can stomach the problems I cited.But going beyond this, analyzing the rich setting of an anarch controlled Los Angeles where Troika Games completely NAILED to a point of almost perfection, the amount of interesting quests and ways to complete it the game redeems itself. If you are a fan of Vampire the Masquerade, you cannot miss it!			"

												This is a great older RPG with a dark atmosphere and interesting background lore. You don't just deal with vampires. Just a few things you do are investigate a haunted house, rummage through a serial killers' abode, and make your way through an abandoned hospital to discover what has been dragging people to the basement. There are also numerous moral choices in the game and multiple endings. The game offers major replayability due the numerous possibilities through clan selection. Although, I reccommend not doing the Malkavian clan or the Nosferatu until your second playthrough given how much they alter the game.			"

												Have you ever played Deus Ex and thought to yourself, ""This game is great, but it wouldn't it be awesome if instead of a Cyberpunk setting it had Vampires?"" Well that is exactly what this game is like and it has a very complex structure of Vampire that I've frankly, never seen before where there are many different races of Vampire each with their own distinct look, personality traits, and strengths/weaknesses, for example, the Malkavians are absoultely insane and have different personalities talking in their head and see telephone lines swaying constantly in the air and people will be a little off-put by you (if you choose to be this class...this is exactly what you'll see and hear as well along with crazy dialogue options)The gameplay is more or less exactly like Deus Ex with more modern day weaponry and the fact that in order to use your special ablities you need blood which you can either drink a blood pack or find a victim and follow them into a back alley and have a buffet delight.The story is also very intriguing and is inline with the lore from the tabletop games where its essentially about this ancient vampire coming back to life and eating Vampires and causing the end of the world.I'd recommend this game to anybody really and especially those who are a fan of Deus Ex, Vampires, or fans of RPG/Action games. This is another really underrated game that definitely should get more sequels (comeon Activision, I know you have it in your black heart somewhere!) If you see it during a sale for about $10, which is rare, think about picking it up because you shouldn't be disappointed.			"

												This game is amazing.  I actually stood around a radio in this game just to listen to each radio program loop in each game chapter because it was so damn entertaining.  This game is loaded with so much awesome stuff, and the humor in it is great.  It's a shame these guys when out of business, they had the potential to make games as good as anything Bethesda has put out.   A note about all the people complaining about this game needing a patch to run: Of course it does, morons, stop your whining.  This game was made to run on an operating system that's been obsolete for over a decade (and people could argue that Windows ME/2000/XP/etc were garbage when they came out), and the company that made the game was crushed and is long gone, of course you will need to DL a patch to run it.  The good news is that these patches also fix bugs that were originally issues in the game.  So look up and follow the easy to install patches, it's totally worth it (and they are free, so ... yeah).    This game is also worth multiple play-throughs, which can be hard to find with linear story/plot games.  As each clan (and gender) has some different perks, playing through more than once can be rewarding.  And if you haven't played as a Malkavian (the crazy ones), that is always good for a last play-through for the whole game.   Great for any fan of Vampire the Masquerade, great for any vampire genre fan, great for any FP/RPG game lover.  I played this a LONG time ago, and playing again now is just as fun, and it is still an impressive game.  I highly recommend this game. "

												“Remember, wherever we go, it is the blood of Caine which makes our fate.”Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is a great role-playing game with an immersive dark atmosphere, authentic characters and a solid storyline, that does the game justice. The bloodline (clan) you choose will affect your relationship with other characters, the available quests and the choices presented to you throughout the game, offering plenty of variation and replayability. While the A.I. is simple and pretty straight forward, the game often gives you several ways to solve a situation, including combat, stealth and rhetorical possibilities. The unbalanced combat mechanics are the weakest link of the game, which can create partially frustrating combat situations. The official support for this game was stopped in 2005, leaving it behind with numerous bugs. The fan community has released an unofficial patch, which addresses most of the issues and can be found on the link below (thanks to Voxel).http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647To fix the runtime error, try the following link (thanks to Zzero).http://steamcommunity.com/app/2400/discussions/3/846959521009517711/Fun Fact: The several different vampire clans and their various strengths and weaknesses are based on the tabletop role-playing franchise Vampire: The Masquerade. --My rating system consists of six categories in descending order of importance:-	Atmosphere-	Characters-	Details-	Tactical gameplay-	Story-	Combat & ControlsBased on the performance each category will receive one of the following grading: -	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorIf the S-Rank is awarded, a quote from the game or personal comment will be added as a token of my respect (in brackets).--Atmosphere: S-Rank(Ah, your’re gonna love this!

												Know that if you get this game, there is a decent chance that it will need some tweaking to even run.  The instructions to do this can be found here.http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=229Talking to people, I cannot pinpoint the reason that some new computers will run it without the fix and some will not.This game is old and the people that made it are out of business.  Steam has posted it up here basically ""As-Is"", without warning us.  While I have the assurance of many Steam users that this game is excellent, I have yet to play it as I haven't felt like jumping through the hoops.Granted that patching or modding older games to work has been a staple of PC gaming for years, shouldn't we be past that in the age of digital distribution? I am appealing to Steam here, you are the future(some would argue the present) of PC gaming distribution, putting a game for sale that has issues with so many modern computers is step backwards.This is the edited version of the review based on input from other users.(you can find my original dissapointment filled review below)----This game crashes as soon as you run it.  If you want, you can follow guides like some kind of treasure map to get it to run but that kind of misses the point of steam.Knowing the bad press that would come from this, Steam requires a 5 minute play-time minimum before posting a review, so I ran the game and let it crash over and over until i got to 5 minutes.  Hopefully I can reach a few people to spread the message that, instead of buying a fun vampire game, you are being the target of an insidious cash grab.Shame on the game's makers for it not being fixed and shame on Steam for selling it.----			"

The characters are all expressive, with interesting dialogue options. I really enjoyed the voice acting.+ Very high replay value:There are many different clans to play in this game, all with their own unique abilities and dialogue options. You'll find something new in this game every time you play it.The only drawback are the bugs, but the worst and most game-breaking of them have been fixed in a fan-made unofficial patch. That said, some bugs still exist, but they're all easily overlooked and in no way stop the progression of the game.			"

The dialogues are amazing, and after you've played through as whatever non-Malkavian clan you chose, you need to play it again as Malkavian for more hilarious dialogue.Oh and don't let my recorded play time fool you, as I own this game retail, and played it a lot before I re-bought on Steam for convenience. It's seriously one of my favorite games of all time, and as far as WRPG goes it up there with Deus Ex and other classics you just get that occasional hankering for.Just, just play it, and then despair as you realize lesser games aren't as fun anymore.

												This is an excellent RPG that has meaningful choices (and consequences), a great story and a very well realized gameworld. Combat is okay, but it can be quite underwhelming until the character invests several skill ponts on combat skills. Different character 'classes' play very differently, enhancing the replayability.Be sure to download and install the unofficial patch before playing, as it fixes most bugs and makes the game playable on modern systems.

												One of the most underrated games in gaming history. It's a flawed gem of a game, but the unofficial patches clean the game up really nicely. It has an incredibly interesting story, amazing atmosphere, and some really memorable quests and dialogs. The combat and stealth systems are clunky, but a great effort has been made via the unofficial patches to improve these aspects, and it now works a lot better than before the patches.In summary, if you're up for an RPG with a dark setting, memorable characters, and an amazing world filled with tons of interesting lore, then look no further than this game.

												Everytime you mention Bloodlines, someone installs it, or so it's said.Anyway, onto the review!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines has a ridiculous title but that's alright. It's based off a tabletop RPG called Vampire: The Masquerade by White Wolf Publishing.It's set in Los Angeles by night where the player controls their own vampire. There are seven clans to choose from and each has their own ""thing"". There's a clan which focuses on art, one that speaks in riddles, one that lurks in the shadows etc (Also adds replayability!). The PC is sadly not customisable, but it's possible to play as female or male. Gender doesn't have a very big impact on the game, but it affects NPC interaction a couple of times.There's also some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥going down in game. I won't be going into too much details but it can be kinda scary sometimes. Also there will be gore, sex and even a snuff movie. And maybe about two jump scares.BUT WAIT. Luckily there's a console in case you really don't want to/can't do something. Hooray!There's no such game as levels in the game. Like a real RPG, there's a character sheet and you can upgrade your abilities by spending experience, which you get from completing quests.Questing is fairly fun in this game. There's no such thing as mindless farming! The first challenge is getting the quest, through picking the right dialogue. In some cases, if you pick the wrong dialogue you're missing out on quests and thus, experience.Quests can be completed in different manners. You can either kill everything, stealth and in some cases just with dialogue, which is nice for the lazy people among us. Sometimes it affects the experience gain though. (For example, getting 3 XP instead of 2 if you aren't seen).Combat is decent-ish, but at least you can switch between first- and third-person perspective.The game isn't sandbox, but there are a few hubs you can go to as you progress through the game. You can travel as much as you want, as you have your personal vampire cabdriver! Awesome!NPCs are all voiced and depending on the clan, even the whispers in your PCs head too! Isn't that fun, you'll never be lonely again! Anyway, it kinda adds to the already dark atmosphere of the game.And unlike a lot of games, choices DO matter, throughout the whole game. If you aren't nice to someone, you might miss out on a quest/experience/ending.The downside is that combat becomes more important as you get closer to the ending. This is probably because the developers were in a rush to finish the game. The vanilla game has some game-breaking bugs even, but if you use a patch by Wesp the game is definitely play-able.There are also a lot of loading screens. Fortunately, loading times aren't long.True, it's not a game for everyone. But what game is? BUT. IN THIS GAME...You'll meet fellow vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies and humans!You can be nice, sarcastic, or really mean!Your vampire can dance just as good as you can!Also you can make people explode so their blood is everywhere. Did I mention that? 'Cause that's cool you know.For a rushed game from 2004, it has a lot of mods and some even revamp whole game mechanics. So I guess it's kinda hard to get bored of it.Ten years and going strong!			"

												There isn't much I can say about this game that hasn't already been said, but since this has become one of my top five favorite games of all time, I have to leave a review.There are very few RPGs that have this level of depth. Fantastic atmosphere with fleshed out NPCs. Excellent writing is complimented by voice acting. The clan you choose and the choices you make have a direct effect on how the world responds to you and on how the story unfolds, which has become increasingly rare in modern games. Your choices have consequences that open and close doors. There's a lot of replay value just in exploring the ""what ifs"". That being said, it is an unfinished game, and the gameplay leaves something to be desired. You /have/ to install a fanmade patch in order to be able to even complete the game, which is why I have so few hours logged since I forgot to have it launch via Steam. Even with it intalled there are some bugs that I needed to fix with the console. Combat is clunky and the unavoidable camera change in melee is annoying. Some skills become very unviable in late game. However, I do like the perk system and how there is a real feel of progression. Obviously the graphics are going to be dated since it's a thirteen year old game, but I think they hold up pretty well and it's not a deal breaker for me, especially since I don't own a powerful gaming PC.Overall, Bloodline's succesions highly outweight its shortcomings. If Troika hadn't been rushed and had time to fully develop and complete this game, I have no doubt it would be considered one of the greatest RPGs of all time.			"

												This game is a classic. While you don't see much else that is involved in the World of Darkness, it really emphasizes on the vampires and their societies. Taking a table-top game and turning it into a video game has been done before but I believe that they did really well with this. The modding community also keep this game a live and find ways to add onto the original game and make it more enjoyable.			"

												There is no reason not to own this game, it is amazing. With active modders and people still in the community working together to preserve this diamond in the rough, or just do you. All you have to do really is a reformat for windows 7/vista. You can do anything from sex to fortune tellers, from BREAST INCREASING CHEATS to flamethrowers. From jumping on dinosaurs to zombies... are you still not buying this game? Ok how about you can be werewolf, like in skyrim, but have to slowly work towards it, not get ploped out likea naked baby in the woods. What? More? Ok... If you want to play Nosferatu(which i do recomend) play it AFTER you have beat the game the first time. It is SO much more different because you can't show your face. If you are Malkavian, you talk very philosophical-like, are you still not throwing money at this game?! Ok... I'm don- FEED HER YOUR BLOOD. If you want advice or need more convicing, add me I'll help you thourgh it... I beat it when I had it on disc too			"

												Excellent and atmospheric action RPG - various choices in the way you play & complete missions and the way you fight, an engrossing story with brilliant voice acting to back it up (Joe DiMaggio as a biker vampire, nuff said), rounded off with a mix of great audio ambience and music (Bloodlines by Ministry and Swamped by Luna Coil are the two stand outs).One cavet: you really must install the unoficial patch (currently available via http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patchalphabet/v failing this link search 'vampire bloodlines unofficial patch' should find you a link), it not only fixes outstanding issues, but really puts the polish on.Now if we could've just had that Werewolf - The Forsaken game as well...

												I would like to note that before anyone buys this, it will NOT RUN on modern machines unless you install fanmade patches. ( http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035 ) In this day and age vampires are often a mockery in pop culture, thanks in large part to sensations like Twilight. But let me tell you, this game has no glittering pretty boys. It's a true painting of what the modern vampire should be- they walk among us in society because they look like us, often using their intelligence and sex appeal to feed and maintain their powers. The game largely focuses on the politics within vampire society known as The Masquerade- it's this web of politics that sends you off on several quests where, depending on how you've chosen to level your character and converse in dialogue with NPCs can play out very differently. The side quests are also very compelling. And I'm usually incredibly disinterested in these- the lore and the characters are all just so well written it made me want to explore the game more.If you're looking for an obscure gem, excellent writing, unique atmosphere, or just tired of seeing Vampires suck♥♥♥♥♥like they have been in recent years this game is up your alley.

												This is what I call a good electronic RPG.Not only because you can build and evolve your character, but more importantly:- story is good and makes sense,- nice atmosphere,- your choices do make difference (without the usual need to play the good boy to get more rewards)- your character's clan and stats define which options you have on dialogues (Malkavian dialogues are awesome! Specially if you have Dementia power...)If you like the pen-and-paper Vampire: The Masquerade you'll probably enjoy this game. It is a very nice implementation of the World of Darkness, and you know, vampires aren't the only supernatural creatures in the night...Only three issues bothered me (but were not enough to make me quit playing):1- streets sometimes feel too empty, but than you remember you're a vampire and it's probably late at night! Also you'll probably be thankful for that, after all, you don't really want people discovering you're a vampire all the time ;-)2- you need to install an unofficial patch (at least on my Win7 64 bits, the game was broken without the patch)3- for those used to the pen-and-paper Vampire, some of the disciplines were replaced by new ones due to limitations of a PC game, but they are still nice;I really recommend this one!

												If you are even remotely interested in RPGs and vampire games,buy this forgotten gem,it has tons of weapons,enemies,races to play and to encounter,many interesting side quests and main quests,a nice system of skills that make your character either a gunslinger,a brawler or a guy/girl that don't need to fight due to high speech and seduction.If you complete 100% of the game you will probably get 30 hours like me.just remember,with a great game comes many bugs,so be sure to install the newer unofficial patch to get the game working properly,and you have,before Oblivion, Planescape Torment and Fallout 2,the best RPG to date.

												Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines was originally released November 16, 2004 It was developed by the ill-fated Troika games and published by Activision. Unfortunately, this was also the release date of Valve Softwares magnum opus, Half-Life 2. Vampire, like Half-Life 2, made excellent use of the Source Engine developed by Valve. However, since this game was using the brand new Source Engine, it was not allowed to release before Half-Life 2. This alone made Activison decide to ""crack the whip"" at Troika and push the release date to that of Half-Life 2. Ultimately, this lead to the game being riddled with bugs at release.  Troika, unable to find funding, laid off all of it's employees in several waves over time. Despite this, several employees developed a patch for the game without pay. Three weeks after the games release patch 1.2 released and official support of the game was shuttered. Despite this, even nearly ten years later, this game is still supported by fan patches developed by Wesp5. This review is written based on experiences with fan patch 9.0Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a video game translation of White Wolf Publishings table top rpg, Vampire: The Masquerade. By translation, I mean this in an almost litteral sense. The game mimics the table top rpgs systems exceedingly well, right down to the way the character sheet works. You are actively encouraged through out the game to actually play your role in the twisted tale that is woven for you. Humanity, or the lack thereof, is one of the key features in the game. Can you (your character) pretend to still be human, integrating yourself into society, while being a Vampire. Killing an innocent on the streets will make you lose a humanity point, further driving home the fact that you are a supernatural beast. Lose too many humanity points and you may frenzy if you run out of the games main resource, blood. Going into a frenzy unleashes the savage beast within you, temporarily causing you to lose all control of your character. One of the other key elements of the game, The Masquerade, challanges you to act human. If anyone sees you doing anything that a Vampire normally would do (using magick, feeding on an npc, etc,) you lose a Masquerade point. Losing these is an astoundingly bad thing. Did that Npc see you feeding on a bum? Yep, and they ran to the cops, you my friend are now being hunted. Sure, losing one point only gets the police on your tail, they are nothing compared to you, you're a damn vampire. But, begin losing more (up to six) and you will have Hunters (one of the games antagonists) or even other vampires after you. The systems from the table top RPG are translated so well into the game it is astounding. So, I just explained some of the systems in the game, while that is all well and good, an rpg would be nothing without a good story and good mechanics to tell it to you. You begin the game with a questionaire of all things. This decides which Vampire clan you will play as. Will you be a melee powerhouse Bruhaj, or will you be a magick centric Tremere? Maybe a stealthy Nosferatu, or the absolutely (literally) insane Malkavian. After a thorough quizzing and assigning points to your character sheet the game begins. Your character is in the throws of passion with a vampire from which ever clan you picked (or were assigned) from the questionaire. You are turned, and are essentially born anew as a vampire.I will be absolutely honest here, this game, it has some of the finest writing, and voice acting, I have ever encountered. I really have to commend Troika for the stellar cast they gathered. A few examples of the voice actors in the game are, Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop), John DiMaggio (Futurama, Adventure Time), Phil LaMarr (Pulp Fiction, Samurai Jack) and Kathryn Cressida (Tarzan, Dexters Laboratory). All of the voice actors do a phenomenal job of playing the characters they were assigned, you actually believe these characters are apart of a living, breathing, world. The entire game feels as if it is alive. Bums wander the streets of LA, hookers propisition you, cops make your life hell and get in the way. Even politics play a roll in this game. So, the story, is not just a story about your character, it's about the world of Vampire: The Masquerade. From the charismatic leader of the Camarilla, to the ""all too happy to be a vampire"" Smiling Jack, Troika crafted a story that not only grabs you, but makes you care about what is going on. I don't want to spoil anything of the story, even giving cliff notes of it would be doing a disservice to the reader. This story is one you must truly experience for yourself. The gameplay of Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines may seem familiar at times, after all, this is a story driven RPG. You can play in first or third person, but I recommend a healthy mix of two. While first person mode takes away a good bit of perephrial vision, it makes the experience all the more personal. Speaking to npcs, you are given fully voiced and written dialog, with (for current times) pretty standard RPG choices. Depending on how your character is developed, you can get special dialog in the form of persuasion, intimidation, and even mind control. While it doesn't seem like anything really special now-a-days, back in 2004, this was pretty damn spectacular. The combat, to be honest, is the weakest part of this game. I am by no means, putting the combat down, it is a fully functional, working combat system, that, at sometimes, is a little bit wonky. Transitioning from first person gameplay to third person, at first, is a little jarring, especially if you're fighting with a melee weapon and casting certain spells. Doing this, the game keeps jumping back and forth between third and first person view, and can make combat a little more difficult than it should be. The only black mark that I can find that makes the game even slightly frustrating is the slight bit of downtime you have when casting spells during combat while using a gun. If you're trying to fight enemies while using a firearm and casting spells, the game delays you being able to shoot, reload, or even cast a different spell. This kinda breaks the immersion of the game at times, because it makes fighting certain enemies incredibly frustrating, more than once I had to take a break from playing because fighting the same foe for twenty minutes was grating on my nerves. (Though, this is a slight disclaimer, I was playing a Tremere, the heavy magick using class.) There is still so much I can say about this game, but, I don't want the review to be exceedingly long. Yes I wanted to be thorough, but, all I really want to say is that Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines, with the fan patch 9.0, is an absolutely astounding game. The patch, in addition to making it work on Windows 7 and 8, actually adds back in some content that was missing from the base game. I really have to give it to Wesp5, he really has brought this game back out of the shadows and gotten it the attention it deserves. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is truly, one of the finest games I have played in ages. I give Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines a 9.5 out of 10. The wonderful story, voice acting, and general gameplay make this an absolute treat.			"

												This game actually made me like vampires, something that I'd never thought would happen. The world and lore are really interesting, and you find yourself reading the loading screen splashes and milking every dialogue tree for all their worth. Sadly, it seems unlikely we'll ever see a similar game in this universe, which is a shame after seeing, reading of hearing about the various supernatural beings inhabiting it. I would've wanted to learn more about the werewolves, the Giovanni, the Society of Leopold any many other things, damnit!It is also a fairly complex RPG, and both creating your character and levelling up will probably require some contemplative chin-stroking and sipping a beverage of your choice. I especially loved the game's multiple social skills, which put Bioware's simplified NICE GUY/BAD GUY systems to shame.Unfortunately, both stealth and combat kind of suck, but they aren't bad enough to be a real annoyance until the game's later quests, when the amount of fighting goes up as the plot intrigue and character interaction goes down.Yes, unfortunately the quality does suffer a bit towards the end, but the journey there will still be memorable enough to heartily recommend this game.NOTE: I played the game with Unofficial Patch v9.2, which fixes bugs and restores cut content			"

												This game is an amazing adventure through the old World of Darkness, suitable for anyone regardless of experience with the tabletop roleplaying game. For those interested in that, I'd like to note the world in which this game takes place has been rebooted in a new game, and the current analogue to Vampire: The Masquerade is called Vampire: The Requiem. Some terms and ideas still exist, but the very feel of the world and the themes of the game are wholly different. They've switched from the advertised ""gothic-punk"" atmosphere (a term the company itself uses to describe the old setting) to a more supernatural mystery/thriller feel. Even if you don't intend to play the tabletop game, this is still one of my favorite RPGs, period. Just make sure you go out and download the unofficial patch collection from a mod website. It's still buggy as hell.			"

												This game is such a delight to anyone a fan of horror and vampires, the attention to detail of gameplay and storyline for a game of the day and age for once it came out is of a unique high quality.The ability to turn from first person shooter to 3rd person at a moments notice for play style makes it versatile and keeps it fresh, full spoken dialog from characters in the world and questlines, the ability to choose and customize yourself/character from a variety of talents to apply to the game to finish objectives, play styles have a wide variety (be a sneaky lockpicking/hacker, a monster of a vampire with a brutish thirsts for blood and chaos, or a socialite with a sharp tongue for manipulation etc etc!). This aspect makes this game very re-playable, if one would like to explore all aspects that the game can offer.The character creation also gives you a variety of vampire clans to choose from, each with their own personal look and place within the world; special attacks and specializations are given for each clan presented depending on which one you choose from, some clans provide abilities that will help cater to the play style that you would wish to use.The beauty of this game is that they're more than one solution to finish a job and it purely depends on how you want to play the game and how you spread out your talent system. I don't want to give too much away but I highly recommend this game! I also recommend that before you play the game that you download the unofficial patch for the game as it removes some of the ingame bugs. http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patchThe link also has a few cool mods to add onto the game like the Final Nights mod that changes the selection of clans in the character creation menu with all new special abilities and all that good stuff (do this after you play the origianls clans/clan if you are looking for more fun!)It's probably a very short review compared to the grand scale of this game has to offer but I hope I helped someone in convincing them to play this great game :D			"

												Everytime you mention Bloodlines, someone installs it, or so it's said.Anyway, onto the review!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines has a ridiculous title but that's alright. It's based off a tabletop RPG called Vampire: The Masquerade by White Wolf Publishing.It's set in Los Angeles by night where the player controls their own vampire. There are seven clans to choose from and each has their own ""thing"". There's a clan which focuses on art, one that speaks in riddles, one that lurks in the shadows etc (Also adds replayability!). The PC is sadly not customisable, but it's possible to play as female or male. Gender doesn't have a very big impact on the game, but it affects NPC interaction a couple of times.There's also some crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥going down in game. I won't be going into too much details but it can be kinda scary sometimes. Also there will be gore, sex and even a snuff movie. And maybe about two jump scares.BUT WAIT. Luckily there's a console in case you really don't want to/can't do something. Hooray!There's no such game as levels in the game. Like a real RPG, there's a character sheet and you can upgrade your abilities by spending experience, which you get from completing quests.Questing is fairly fun in this game. There's no such thing as mindless farming! The first challenge is getting the quest, through picking the right dialogue. In some cases, if you pick the wrong dialogue you're missing out on quests and thus, experience.Quests can be completed in different manners. You can either kill everything, stealth and in some cases just with dialogue, which is nice for the lazy people among us. Sometimes it affects the experience gain though. (For example, getting 3 XP instead of 2 if you aren't seen).Combat is decent-ish, but at least you can switch between first- and third-person perspective.The game isn't sandbox, but there are a few hubs you can go to as you progress through the game. You can travel as much as you want, as you have your personal vampire cabdriver! Awesome!NPCs are all voiced and depending on the clan, even the whispers in your PCs head too! Isn't that fun, you'll never be lonely again! Anyway, it kinda adds to the already dark atmosphere of the game.And unlike a lot of games, choices DO matter, throughout the whole game. If you aren't nice to someone, you might miss out on a quest/experience/ending.The downside is that combat becomes more important as you get closer to the ending. This is probably because the developers were in a rush to finish the game. The vanilla game has some game-breaking bugs even, but if you use a patch by Wesp the game is definitely play-able.There are also a lot of loading screens. Fortunately, loading times aren't long.True, it's not a game for everyone. But what game is? BUT. IN THIS GAME...You'll meet fellow vampires, werewolves, ghosts, zombies and humans!You can be nice, sarcastic, or really mean!Your vampire can dance just as good as you can!Also you can make people explode so their blood is everywhere. Did I mention that? 'Cause that's cool you know.For a rushed game from 2004, it has a lot of mods and some even revamp whole game mechanics. So I guess it's kinda hard to get bored of it.Ten years and going strong!			"

												Honestly. The greatest game I have ever played on PC. I remember when I was only 8 yrs old. My uncle started a game of the paperback edition, and I fell in love after 20 minutes once my character was created. I was a friggin Tremere then. I will always remember it. This game I actually liked more than Redemption, but only because of how it was played. Redemption and Bloodlines are both good for the musical scores, and the storylines. Though Bloodlines trumps Redemption with Gameplay.			"

												One of my all time favorite games. Has a great story and has a lot of unique RPG elements to it. I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of these types of games. REMEMBER: You'll need to look up on google the unofficial patch for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. There's a 9.4 patch out now. You simply download it and run the exe and choose the VTMB file wherever your steam games are. After it runs, all the textures and audio bugs ought to be fixed. It also works for Windows 10! It's a shame this wasn't optimized well for steam, but the patch works like a dream, so no worries.			"

												One of the best ARPG games ever made. It's a ""flawed gem,"" as somebody once said. This game gets my highest recommendation, and is one of my all-time favorites.+ Extremely atmospheric:Each location in this game leaves a lasting impression. From the music to the aesthetics, this game will draw you into it's dark world and have you enthralled.+ Interesting, memorable characters:I can remember the names of many of the minor characters in this game. The characters are all expressive, with interesting dialogue options. I really enjoyed the voice acting.+ Very high replay value:There are many different clans to play in this game, all with their own unique abilities and dialogue options. You'll find something new in this game every time you play it.The only drawback are the bugs, but the worst and most game-breaking of them have been fixed in a fan-made unofficial patch. That said, some bugs still exist, but they're all easily overlooked and in no way stop the progression of the game.			"

												Probably the best PnP-to-Vidya adaptation ever. The game's superior writing, good voice-acting, and open-ended takes on morality, decisions and character advancement haven't really been seen again. The Steam version requires a lengthy process to patch it and fix it, as the game was rushed to release and lots of elements ( stories, items, quests ) were left out. Some of the patches restore these. A great, atmospheric RPG placed in the thought-out WoD setting. Nice.			"

												Seriously, the writing in this game is among the best in the world of video games so far. Not only is the gameplay fantastic and the story excellent, but the writing, God, the WRITING. The dialogues are amazing, and after you've played through as whatever non-Malkavian clan you chose, you need to play it again as Malkavian for more hilarious dialogue.Oh and don't let my recorded play time fool you, as I own this game retail, and played it a lot before I re-bought on Steam for convenience. It's seriously one of my favorite games of all time, and as far as WRPG goes it up there with Deus Ex and other classics you just get that occasional hankering for.Just, just play it, and then despair as you realize lesser games aren't as fun anymore.

												Excellent and atmospheric action RPG - various choices in the way you play & complete missions and the way you fight, an engrossing story with brilliant voice acting to back it up (Joe DiMaggio as a biker vampire, nuff said), rounded off with a mix of great audio ambience and music (Bloodlines by Ministry and Swamped by Luna Coil are the two stand outs).One cavet: you really must install the unoficial patch (currently available via http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patchalphabet/v failing this link search 'vampire bloodlines unofficial patch' should find you a link), it not only fixes outstanding issues, but really puts the polish on.Now if we could've just had that Werewolf - The Forsaken game as well...

												If you are even remotely interested in RPGs and vampire games,buy this forgotten gem,it has tons of weapons,enemies,races to play and to encounter,many interesting side quests and main quests,a nice system of skills that make your character either a gunslinger,a brawler or a guy/girl that don't need to fight due to high speech and seduction.If you complete 100% of the game you will probably get 30 hours like me.just remember,with a great game comes many bugs,so be sure to install the newer unofficial patch to get the game working properly,and you have,before Oblivion, Planescape Torment and Fallout 2,the best RPG to date.

												This is what I call a good electronic RPG.Not only because you can build and evolve your character, but more importantly:- story is good and makes sense,- nice atmosphere,- your choices do make difference (without the usual need to play the good boy to get more rewards)- your character's clan and stats define which options you have on dialogues (Malkavian dialogues are awesome! Specially if you have Dementia power...)If you like the pen-and-paper Vampire: The Masquerade you'll probably enjoy this game. It is a very nice implementation of the World of Darkness, and you know, vampires aren't the only supernatural creatures in the night...Only three issues bothered me (but were not enough to make me quit playing):1- streets sometimes feel too empty, but than you remember you're a vampire and it's probably late at night! Also you'll probably be thankful for that, after all, you don't really want people discovering you're a vampire all the time ;-)2- you need to install an unofficial patch (at least on my Win7 64 bits, the game was broken without the patch)3- for those used to the pen-and-paper Vampire, some of the disciplines were replaced by new ones due to limitations of a PC game, but they are still nice;I really recommend this one!

												There is no reason not to own this game, it is amazing. With active modders and people still in the community working together to preserve this diamond in the rough, or just do you. All you have to do really is a reformat for windows 7/vista. You can do anything from sex to fortune tellers, from BREAST INCREASING CHEATS to flamethrowers. From jumping on dinosaurs to zombies... are you still not buying this game? Ok how about you can be werewolf, like in skyrim, but have to slowly work towards it, not get ploped out likea naked baby in the woods. What? More? Ok... If you want to play Nosferatu(which i do recomend) play it AFTER you have beat the game the first time. It is SO much more different because you can't show your face. If you are Malkavian, you talk very philosophical-like, are you still not throwing money at this game?! Ok... I'm don- FEED HER YOUR BLOOD. If you want advice or need more convicing, add me I'll help you thourgh it... I beat it when I had it on disc too			"

												I seriously can not believe I still enjoy this game as much as I did when it first came out (2004). There's definitely something special about this game. The quests in this game are lots of fun, and the characters are likeable. I really enjoy the overall gaming experience.There has been some annoying bugs, and still are a few. Also this game does not originally work on newer PC's running Windows Vista or newer. Thankfully there has been a lot of unofficial patch releases for this game, making it possible to play.If I would ever get the chance to choose a sequel to be made for any game in the world, it would be this one!

Posted: April 27, 2014
												Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines was originally released November 16, 2004 It was developed by the ill-fated Troika games and published by Activision. Unfortunately, this was also the release date of Valve Softwares magnum opus, Half-Life 2. Vampire, like Half-Life 2, made excellent use of the Source Engine developed by Valve. However, since this game was using the brand new Source Engine, it was not allowed to release before Half-Life 2. This alone made Activison decide to ""crack the whip"" at Troika and push the release date to that of Half-Life 2. Ultimately, this lead to the game being riddled with bugs at release.  Troika, unable to find funding, laid off all of it's employees in several waves over time. Despite this, several employees developed a patch for the game without pay. Three weeks after the games release patch 1.2 released and official support of the game was shuttered. Despite this, even nearly ten years later, this game is still supported by fan patches developed by Wesp5. This review is written based on experiences with fan patch 9.0Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines is a video game translation of White Wolf Publishings table top rpg, Vampire: The Masquerade. By translation, I mean this in an almost litteral sense. The game mimics the table top rpgs systems exceedingly well, right down to the way the character sheet works. You are actively encouraged through out the game to actually play your role in the twisted tale that is woven for you. Humanity, or the lack thereof, is one of the key features in the game. Can you (your character) pretend to still be human, integrating yourself into society, while being a Vampire. Killing an innocent on the streets will make you lose a humanity point, further driving home the fact that you are a supernatural beast. Lose too many humanity points and you may frenzy if you run out of the games main resource, blood. Going into a frenzy unleashes the savage beast within you, temporarily causing you to lose all control of your character. One of the other key elements of the game, The Masquerade, challanges you to act human. If anyone sees you doing anything that a Vampire normally would do (using magick, feeding on an npc, etc,) you lose a Masquerade point. Losing these is an astoundingly bad thing. Did that Npc see you feeding on a bum? Yep, and they ran to the cops, you my friend are now being hunted. Sure, losing one point only gets the police on your tail, they are nothing compared to you, you're a damn vampire. But, begin losing more (up to six) and you will have Hunters (one of the games antagonists) or even other vampires after you. The systems from the table top RPG are translated so well into the game it is astounding. So, I just explained some of the systems in the game, while that is all well and good, an rpg would be nothing without a good story and good mechanics to tell it to you. You begin the game with a questionaire of all things. This decides which Vampire clan you will play as. Will you be a melee powerhouse Bruhaj, or will you be a magick centric Tremere? Maybe a stealthy Nosferatu, or the absolutely (literally) insane Malkavian. After a thorough quizzing and assigning points to your character sheet the game begins. Your character is in the throws of passion with a vampire from which ever clan you picked (or were assigned) from the questionaire. You are turned, and are essentially born anew as a vampire.I will be absolutely honest here, this game, it has some of the finest writing, and voice acting, I have ever encountered. I really have to commend Troika for the stellar cast they gathered. A few examples of the voice actors in the game are, Steve Blum (Cowboy Bebop), John DiMaggio (Futurama, Adventure Time), Phil LaMarr (Pulp Fiction, Samurai Jack) and Kathryn Cressida (Tarzan, Dexters Laboratory). All of the voice actors do a phenomenal job of playing the characters they were assigned, you actually believe these characters are apart of a living, breathing, world. The entire game feels as if it is alive. Bums wander the streets of LA, hookers propisition you, cops make your life hell and get in the way. Even politics play a roll in this game. So, the story, is not just a story about your character, it's about the world of Vampire: The Masquerade. From the charismatic leader of the Camarilla, to the ""all too happy to be a vampire"" Smiling Jack, Troika crafted a story that not only grabs you, but makes you care about what is going on. I don't want to spoil anything of the story, even giving cliff notes of it would be doing a disservice to the reader. This story is one you must truly experience for yourself. The gameplay of Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines may seem familiar at times, after all, this is a story driven RPG. You can play in first or third person, but I recommend a healthy mix of two. While first person mode takes away a good bit of perephrial vision, it makes the experience all the more personal. Speaking to npcs, you are given fully voiced and written dialog, with (for current times) pretty standard RPG choices. Depending on how your character is developed, you can get special dialog in the form of persuasion, intimidation, and even mind control. While it doesn't seem like anything really special now-a-days, back in 2004, this was pretty damn spectacular. The combat, to be honest, is the weakest part of this game. I am by no means, putting the combat down, it is a fully functional, working combat system, that, at sometimes, is a little bit wonky. Transitioning from first person gameplay to third person, at first, is a little jarring, especially if you're fighting with a melee weapon and casting certain spells. Doing this, the game keeps jumping back and forth between third and first person view, and can make combat a little more difficult than it should be. The only black mark that I can find that makes the game even slightly frustrating is the slight bit of downtime you have when casting spells during combat while using a gun. If you're trying to fight enemies while using a firearm and casting spells, the game delays you being able to shoot, reload, or even cast a different spell. This kinda breaks the immersion of the game at times, because it makes fighting certain enemies incredibly frustrating, more than once I had to take a break from playing because fighting the same foe for twenty minutes was grating on my nerves. (Though, this is a slight disclaimer, I was playing a Tremere, the heavy magick using class.) There is still so much I can say about this game, but, I don't want the review to be exceedingly long. Yes I wanted to be thorough, but, all I really want to say is that Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines, with the fan patch 9.0, is an absolutely astounding game. The patch, in addition to making it work on Windows 7 and 8, actually adds back in some content that was missing from the base game. I really have to give it to Wesp5, he really has brought this game back out of the shadows and gotten it the attention it deserves. I cannot recommend this game enough, it is truly, one of the finest games I have played in ages. I give Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines a 9.5 out of 10. The wonderful story, voice acting, and general gameplay make this an absolute treat.			"

												A game every RPG fan should play.It takes place in LA, putting you in the shoes – or heels – of a freshly made vampire. They have a secret society and live among us with a certain set of rules to maintain order and ensure that their existence won't become widespread knowledge. This is the Masquerade. You become the new pawn for the local leader in his political wars. Not all is well in vampire community, and some factions are eager to change things.It's a comfortable entry – just as you're in the dark, so is your character, letting the two of you learn together who's who and what's what in vampire life. It's a pretty crazy one, too. Violence and sex are plentiful and the game doesn't shy from either. You'll find it hard, and not too rewarding, to play your regular Good Hero sort. It's also a very humorous game with plenty of moments that made me chuckle. The voice acting is terrific and there are many great characters. I found myself often just standing still and listening to the in-game news report on the TV, or the late-night radio show for the laughs. The story develops in unexpected ways and the ending managed to surprise me. Maybe I haven't found them out yet, but I didn't feel as if my choices bore significant consequences. It didn't really bother me, though, because the ride was a good one. The game is divided into city hubs that open one at a time after plot checkpoints, and you can jump from one to the other freely once they're available. You won't find the trademark ""collect 10 donkey tails"" side-quests that pollute fantasy RPGs, but instead many fun investigative missions outside the main plot. Backtracking can be annoying, though.While the story isn't too divergent, the gameplay is. It shares similarities with Deus Ex – many missions (though not all) don't offer just one way to the solution. Usually you can take a stealthy approach as well as the loud and bloody one. If your hacking skill is low, often your lockpicking will let you do the job instead – or vice versa. And while, like many other RPGs, it has its skills which aren't as useful as the others, I was happy to find out that many non-combat ones are still well utilized in the game. I won't write down a guide to power-building, though. One, because you can easily google it. Two, because it's hard to suck at the game.You can focus either on guns or melee. I did one playthrough of each, and while I felt that later on my gun-focused character was stronger, the melee was more satisfying, despite how simple it was. I really liked playing an immortal psychopath who charges into a room while people shoot at her and she just jumps around slashing everything. However, just like the graphics, keep in mind the year of the game and don't expect anything advanced in terms of combat mechanics.The game also has serious replay value. I'm already during my 3rd playthrough, and I'm not crossing out the possibility of a 4th sometime in the future. It's not due to different choices, because – as I said – they're not too significant here. It's partly due to reviewing the story with the insight of the twist at the end and partly due to different approach in mechanics – like many RPGs. You don't choose a specific class, but instead a clan. They're set apart by their own few unique abilities (some even have different dialogue options, which is pretty amazing if you ask me), while the bulk of the simple ones are shared between them all. Before you start, two things. First, the game is buggy as hell and you shouldn't play it without the unofficial patch. Google it, it'll come up. Second, don't play the Malkavian clan in your first run – they're lunatics who hear voices, and their dialogue is completely overhauled and special, partly due to their weird insights into matters. So without understanding the plot after a complete playthrough, and knowing what happens in each interaction, playing a Malkavian can be really confusing. But after your first playthrough? Highly recommended. They're very entertaining.			"

												If this game had more time for polishing (*cough* thanks a lot Activision *cough*), it would have easily been the best RPG. The combat is mediocre at best, but on the other hand, the dialogue, characters and story are great. The class system also adds a lot of replayability too, thanks to how different each gameplay can be depending on what kind of vampire you picked. Don't expect to play the game without any issues though. Even with the community's unofficial patches, I still encountered multiple major bugs (bosses went through the level, quests couldn't be completed, characters not appearing when they are supposed to and so on). But still, it's definitely worth playing.			"

												Do not betray the Masquerade, Kindred, for the penalties of alerting humanity to our presence is dire indeed. Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines is an RPG powerhouse. In this game, you are embraced by a vampire clan of your choice and go through late night Los Angeles preying on humans and exploring the grim city that vampires call their home. The story is to die for, the mechanics are phenomenal and the world is incredibly immersive. It's pretty much a perfect 10/10 with memorable characters, distinctive settings and replay value as each clan of vampire plays differently from the others. Two minor things put this game back: The combat system is similar to that of Borderlands and that enough should tell you that it isn't the best way of doing things (it still executes this system better than Borderlands) and in order to even run the game, you must find the latest version of the Unofficial Patch and install it. Other than that, get this game. You'll be wishing you were a Child of Caine in no time.			"

												A classic from 2004; Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines can be rough around the edges, but with patience and the user patch (google it, Agnes) it quickly transcends its rushed initial release.It's Troika's last hurrah, give it a try. if nothing else the unpatched cut scenes are worth a chuckle. Also: it has the voice of Bender as an ex-pirate Vampire. What's there not to like about that?Bonus points if you catch the giant reference to John Carpenter's 'The Fog' after the end of act 1.			"

												A game every RPG fan should play.It takes place in LA, putting you in the shoes – or heels – of a freshly made vampire. They have a secret society and live among us with a certain set of rules to maintain order and ensure that their existence won't become widespread knowledge. This is the Masquerade. You become the new pawn for the local leader in his political wars. Not all is well in vampire community, and some factions are eager to change things.It's a comfortable entry – just as you're in the dark, so is your character, letting the two of you learn together who's who and what's what in vampire life. It's a pretty crazy one, too. Violence and sex are plentiful and the game doesn't shy from either. You'll find it hard, and not too rewarding, to play your regular Good Hero sort. It's also a very humorous game with plenty of moments that made me chuckle. The voice acting is terrific and there are many great characters. I found myself often just standing still and listening to the in-game news report on the TV, or the late-night radio show for the laughs. The story develops in unexpected ways and the ending managed to surprise me. Maybe I haven't found them out yet, but I didn't feel as if my choices bore significant consequences. It didn't really bother me, though, because the ride was a good one. The game is divided into city hubs that open one at a time after plot checkpoints, and you can jump from one to the other freely once they're available. You won't find the trademark ""collect 10 donkey tails"" side-quests that pollute fantasy RPGs, but instead many fun investigative missions outside the main plot. Backtracking can be annoying, though.While the story isn't too divergent, the gameplay is. It shares similarities with Deus Ex – many missions (though not all) don't offer just one way to the solution. Usually you can take a stealthy approach as well as the loud and bloody one. If your hacking skill is low, often your lockpicking will let you do the job instead – or vice versa. And while, like many other RPGs, it has its skills which aren't as useful as the others, I was happy to find out that many non-combat ones are still well utilized in the game. I won't write down a guide to power-building, though. One, because you can easily google it. Two, because it's hard to suck at the game.You can focus either on guns or melee. I did one playthrough of each, and while I felt that later on my gun-focused character was stronger, the melee was more satisfying, despite how simple it was. I really liked playing an immortal psychopath who charges into a room while people shoot at her and she just jumps around slashing everything. However, just like the graphics, keep in mind the year of the game and don't expect anything advanced in terms of combat mechanics.The game also has serious replay value. I'm already during my 3rd playthrough, and I'm not crossing out the possibility of a 4th sometime in the future. It's not due to different choices, because – as I said – they're not too significant here. It's partly due to reviewing the story with the insight of the twist at the end and partly due to different approach in mechanics – like many RPGs. You don't choose a specific class, but instead a clan. They're set apart by their own few unique abilities (some even have different dialogue options, which is pretty amazing if you ask me), while the bulk of the simple ones are shared between them all. Before you start, two things. First, the game is buggy as hell and you shouldn't play it without the unofficial patch. Google it, it'll come up. Second, don't play the Malkavian clan in your first run – they're lunatics who hear voices, and their dialogue is completely overhauled and special, partly due to their weird insights into matters. So without understanding the plot after a complete playthrough, and knowing what happens in each interaction, playing a Malkavian can be really confusing. But after your first playthrough? Highly recommended. They're very entertaining.			"

												Pros: Fantastic Storytelling, perhaps the game's strongest element. Plenty of options for characters: Strong, Charismatic, Deadly; however you'd like to play, there's a way to do it. A plethora of memorable characters, backed with Excellent voice acting. An engaging plot, with plenty of sidequests: At least 30 hours of content. Unique character development that adheres to White Wolf's game system. Cons: Combat is sketchy. Those looking for a beat-em-up or a FPS will be dissapointed.  The endgame involves a lot of combat, and may be dissapointing for relatively pacifist players. Also, see above. The out of box product is rather buggy, and even the official patched and plus patched versions can have memory leak issues. Save early, and save often.If you get this game (and you should, believe me) Be sure to install either the unofficial patch, which fixes a lot of inherent issues with the game, or the plus patch, which restores deleted content and improves existing content for smoother gameplay. As is, the game includes the 1.2 official patch Patch 9.2 [forums.planetvampire.com]Being one of the finest RPGs out there in the sense that it adheres to Role-Playing,  Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines  Is a must for anyone who considers themselves a fan of RPGs. It has its flaws, yes, but it's a shining example of what interactive roleplaying can and should look like. TL;DR I give it 9/10. Install the unofficial patch. "

												Do not betray the Masquerade, Kindred, for the penalties of alerting humanity to our presence is dire indeed. Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines is an RPG powerhouse. In this game, you are embraced by a vampire clan of your choice and go through late night Los Angeles preying on humans and exploring the grim city that vampires call their home. The story is to die for, the mechanics are phenomenal and the world is incredibly immersive. It's pretty much a perfect 10/10 with memorable characters, distinctive settings and replay value as each clan of vampire plays differently from the others. Two minor things put this game back: The combat system is similar to that of Borderlands and that enough should tell you that it isn't the best way of doing things (it still executes this system better than Borderlands) and in order to even run the game, you must find the latest version of the Unofficial Patch and install it. Other than that, get this game. You'll be wishing you were a Child of Caine in no time.			"

You can choose whether to play as male or female (something i LOVE) and you get to choose what 'Clan' you're in which is a super cool concept. This game also has great replay value as it has multiple endings and new things you'll discover everytime. I definitely think this game is worth purchasing.			"

												While suffering somewhat from some bugs and glitches, the game itself is a good challenge, to keep the simple review. You will need to find the patch.Moving to the more detailed review...The intial attempts you may make to load the game could end in heartbreak, as the game possesses a bug which prevents you, or at least prevented me, from playing the game without downloading a key patch. The good news is that this patch is available for free online, in fact there is an extended unofficial patch, also available, which does not prevent the game being played on steam. Not that you would be missing much, the game doesn't have 100% steam compatiable 'chieves all over the place, or much else. It's single player, after all.Once you get into the game you find that there is both a tutorial section - skippable, if you don't mind loosing some work towards stat increases and having to pay for a set of lockpicks - and a guided character creation, which is perfectly good if a little impersonal. You also have the option to set everything yourself, if the guided version did not set things to your pleasure.And then you get to the story, and that... Well, it's hardly my place to spoil it, especially with it's numbers of little twists and hidden reprocussions.You should play it if you really want to find out.			"

												Do you enjoy a good story from tales that take you to the lady by the sea?In short, buy this game.However, if you need a longer answer, let me tell you that this game is a masterpiece and display of great writing that everyone should give a try. Whether you prefer the rebellious tongue of a Brujah, the witty arsenal of a Toreador, or the black hole of knowledge that inhabits the speech patterns of a Malkavian, there's some satisfaction to be found for anyone who likes their character to be a certain way. This is the kind of game you wish you could play over blind again, or the kind of game that you just cant give details about, so all I can say is play it, and make sure to install the unofficial patch which actually adds a lot(currently at version 8.9!)One last thing:Don't open it.

												Highly recommended.  One of the best games I have ever played.  Fair warning, It is buggy, the graphics are dated, and it fizzles at the very end because the devs were rushed to release.  However, moving beyond that, this is a cult gem.  It is the only game that gets the RPG elements and first person perspective nearly perfect.  It is NOT a dumbed down game, it is an actual MATURE game that actually earns the M title.  There is sex, violence, addiction, slavery, and many other adult themes.  It is the closest I have ever seen of an RPG pen and paper game brought to life.  This should be the standard that all modern RPG/'first person games' should astrive too.			"

												This game is amazing... buggy as hell, but amazing nonethelessa fine example of FPS and RPG mixture done right in a non-Borderlands way (I do love Borderlands, by the way)the story develops really well, as it should in an RPG, and it gives you a play-style totally unique to your senses, You like to play sneaky and talk your way through things? Good, have funYou like bashing skulls and punching down your way through the game? Good as well, have funYou are just a madman wanting to shout a little nonsense into a nonsensical world? Awesome, good for you, have fun!that said, boy, this game was rushed... with a plethora of game-crashing bugs that will leave you quite♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥..the game saves automatically quite often, so it should not be much of a problem anyway... depending on your play-style, that extra drop of rage might even make you an unstopable killing machineother than that, well worth the promotional price given every halloween, and, for completionists, there is a hell of a lot of content in this baby, with various side-quests triggered in ways quite funny to discover...also, if you buy it, go after the unnoficial patches... high-res did not favor this game over time... but the fan community tackled this issue quite beautifully (actually fixing some bugs in the process)even with the bugs, double thumbs up for this game			"

												While suffering somewhat from some bugs and glitches, the game itself is a good challenge, to keep the simple review. You will need to find the patch.Moving to the more detailed review...The intial attempts you may make to load the game could end in heartbreak, as the game possesses a bug which prevents you, or at least prevented me, from playing the game without downloading a key patch. The good news is that this patch is available for free online, in fact there is an extended unofficial patch, also available, which does not prevent the game being played on steam. Not that you would be missing much, the game doesn't have 100% steam compatiable 'chieves all over the place, or much else. It's single player, after all.Once you get into the game you find that there is both a tutorial section - skippable, if you don't mind loosing some work towards stat increases and having to pay for a set of lockpicks - and a guided character creation, which is perfectly good if a little impersonal. You also have the option to set everything yourself, if the guided version did not set things to your pleasure.And then you get to the story, and that... Well, it's hardly my place to spoil it, especially with it's numbers of little twists and hidden reprocussions.You should play it if you really want to find out.			"

												Clunky, ugly, and outdated as hell, this is one of my favorite games of all time. Dont let the whole vampire thing turn you away (this game was out years before the whole twilight thing) Much like [OG] Deus Ex, this game has aged quite well dispite exclusivly using older shooter mechanics. There is so much to see and do and a hundred ways to go about doing it.Dont let this classic game go under your radar, once you allow the suspension of disbelief to set in you have a 15-30 hour rock solid RPG experience.

												This game is a buried gem. Activision, as per their hitleristic standards, rushed this game into release about halfway through the development. The result is somewhat painful as far as bugs and glitches go. For me, the game wouldn't even start on its own, and when I initially tried to play it, I uninstalled and felt regret for buying it on my boyfriend's recommendation.A few months afterwards, I installed it again while I had a craving for RPGs. Here's the single key to enjoying this game: go and download the unofficial patch, and make sure to select the patch plus during the installation process. A large amount of the game's content is in unactivated code. The patch is regularly updated - the most recent update was this year, last I checked - which fixes all of the game breaking bugs and readds content that wasn't quite finished or activated.The game? Great. The lore is excellent, which most of anyone who has experience with the Old World of Darkness universe would know. Even if you're not, the game is a great introduction. I wasn't a huge expert before I started playing, but a few hours in, I pulled up the wiki and simply started reading. The writing is quality. The characters are memorable, and it's hard not to feel about them; usually, if they're not Beckett or Jack, that feeling is indescribable loathing. The quests are so interesting, you feel a need to go out and find all of the ones avaliable. The environment offers many areas to explore and makes you want to explore them.The only two things I would say aren't perfect about the game are the graphics and the combat. The graphics, naturally, are as dated as the game, and they haven't aged well. I honestly enjoy them because sometimes they're literally laughable. The combat is charmingly schizophrenic, in that you're never quite sure what you're doing, nor what you should be doing, but gosh dang if the results aren't fun. The combat difficulty jerks up and down with little in game conceivable reason, and initially I was confused, but then I realized that the difficulty wasn't based on game mechanics. It's based on lore. If the game makes you fight vampire hunters, no matter at what point you're at in the game, the fight's going to be very hard because vampire hunters in the Old World of Darkness are damned near impossible to kill. It's a great game, and I think that if lore, missions, writing, and plots are your thing, you should play it. However, don't buy it. Pirate it. A larger company - I think it was Bioware - bought the company that made it and fired everyone who worked on it. Your money would be spent paying the people who ruined the chance of a second game.

												So long as you install the unofficial patch before you try it, this is an awesome game, and surprisingly engaging considering its age. Sure the graphics are pretty bad, and the voice acting is somewhat static-y, but the characters feel real, and there's tons to explore. Even once the game's been completed, there's more to do, from extremely in-depth mods, to entirely different playstyle choices. I've just finished playing Vampire: The Masquerade for almost 4 days straight; personally, I haven't begun to get tired of it yet, and not one ounce of that is nostagia.			"

												This game with the addition of the unofficial patch is hands down one of the absolute best RPG's I have ever played. Here are a few bulletpoints of awesome traits this game has in no particular order.* A unique and sophisticated universe/worldspace that really makes you feel like your in a vampiric underworld beneath society.* A very wide variety of different skills/abilities your character can use and develop that truly fleshes out the character building part of this RPG.* An intriguing storyline and dialogue system that keeps the player deeply involved in what's happening.I genuinely love this game and absolutely recommend that you at the very least consider purchasing it.

												I firstly played this game affected by the RPG pen & paper Vampire the Masquarade, which I adored in younger ages, so I was very engaged. I bought it again now in 2016, when the graphics seem poor, but the gothic atmosphere is captivating. I like the way the makers ""handle"" vampire passions and insticts, I like the mechanics as I did in pen-and-paper but mostly I enjoy the dark feeling mix of vagrancy, survival, fetichisism, brutality and underworld sickness.

												While this may not be the greatest RPG I have ever played, nor the most well-executed or polished by any means...VTM: Bloodlines is hands-down my favorite RPG to this date. The setting and characters absolutely ooze flavor with great writing, voice acting, and character animations that while often obviously canned manage to be more emotive, expressive and entertaining than anything you'll see in a modern WRPG.While the gameplay systems aren't stellar at all points of the game, when they work they really shine in a brilliant light, and it's admirable to see a small developer take this many risks in order to push the envelope of what you can do in an RPG.This game has a heart and soul and passion that's incomperable to any modern RPG, because you can just about taste the effort and passion that the developers poured into this project.It's just a damn shame those beautiful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Troika will never see a dime of the profits that this game makes on steam.

												Alright, for real though, this is a game that has aged very well. It was a golden RPG for 2004, and today is still Golden. With Troika dead, and before Paradox bought out the rights to White Wolf and WOD, CCP didn't do crap with this series including updates, letting other people remaster it, etc. Luckily this game still has a somewhat active, but small, community, and came out with amazing patches even after a decade of death and silence. There was a project to remake/remaster the game called Project Vaulderie, but unfortunately it got shut down by CCP even though CCP had been doing nothing besides working on Eve Online. The best:-The music is A1. Introduced me to some good gothic metal bands, and the soundtracks for a lot of the hubs are very pleasing. -The dialogue is hilarious most of the time, and it changes depending on what clan you are. -While there was some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting, there was also a lot of good voice acting from well known voice actors.-Clans: There are several you get to choose from, each one has its own special abilities, appearance, and ways you run through the game. -There is no leveling up, you gain experience points and then assign those earned experience points to certain skills you want to increase, which is a simple and nice. -Kind of has it's own karma system to put it basically, you kill innocents, you lose humanity, you lose all your humanity, you go into a frenzy which isn't always the prettiest. So most of the time you have to be conscious of your actions.-The atmosphere was greatly crafted; to be a dark gothic setting. Everything is eerie, not especially scary, but eerie and dark really no matter where you are. -You get to dance like a maniac.-You get paid good for a lot of quests.-A ♥♥♥♥♥ON of lore.The Bad: A lot of this can be excused because of the time it was released, but still mentioning,-The map is absolutely tiny. There are only 4 hubs you can go to, which all are pretty damn small and will take you like 10 minutes to run through all the buildings. -The bugs. Of course, this has to do with the state it was released in, problems with the devs and Valve, etc. But if you don't install the patch that was wonderfully made by fans, then you're going to have a hard time playing because this game is bug heaven.-A lot of the NPCs are the same, there's probably like 5-7 differen't types of NPCS in one city, with 3-4 repeats. -The AI is awful. You can have a decent sneak level and be crouching in front of a group of cops that are on a hunt for you and they wouldn't see you. -The game is fairly short. I think the first time I played this I completed the main and side quests within at least 14 hours. -You don't really get a choice in who you side with. Throughout the game, you are working for LaCroix no matter if you don't like him, but at the end you do indeed get a decision. -You can't really replay this game much differently than a last playthrough mainly because in terms of storyline, there isn't too much you can choose differently, besides minor decisions.-It really doesn't show too much or hint at the enormous amount of lore the WOD and VtM series has. The first time I played this I had no idea that there was a crap ton of books belonging to this series. But luckily, once I found out, I bought all of them. -Because the environment is small and all the work went into the quests, you really can't do much in terms of just exploring. There's not much to interact with. -LOOT. There is rarely any loot throughout the entire game. Which any loot you find is sold for dirt cheap and you get barely any $$$. Overall, a lot of the flaws of this game I can look past because of the age. Lets all hope Paradox does a good job dealing with this series, because it can either go absolutely horribly or incredibly wonderful. And lets hope they don't make a MMO.			"

												The game is nearly ten years old so the graphics are obviously dated but this game is still really solid. It's similar to Deus Ex in that a few months after you complete it, someone somewhere will mention it in passing and you'll curse their name while you reinstall it and play through it one more time. Some parts are really atmospheric while some are extremely frustrating (hollywood sewers, if you used noclip, I don't blame you). The way you can customize your character is really nice too, there are a lot of different combinations you can mess around with. I put 32 hours into it over one playthrough so you can judge for yourself whether it's worth the money, but I certainly enjoyed it. Also, USE THE LATEST VERSION OF THE UNOFFICIAL FAN PATCH, this game is buggy and the patch fixes it.			"

												One of the most immersive and unique RPGs you will ever find. Imagine if you take the action, skills, moral choises and decisions from games like Deus Ex and Fallout 3, and combine that aspect with a modern world secret vampire society set in the midst of Hollywood - Los Angeles. Then you have the recipe that is Vamire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.As a newly turned vampire you are off to a rocky start. You begin to unravel ancient mysteries and conspiracies within the society itself. Many clans are at war with eachother, and it's up to you to decide which sides to take. You can either try to resolve things through diplomatic efforts to stay in touch with your human side as much as possible, or go the more animalistic way of violence and murder. But beware, everything you do may have serious consequences!			"

												Pros:-one of the few fully fledged RPGs to feature vampires (and I'm not even a vampire fan)-interesting twist on the vampires - 7 playable clans, each with their own strengths and weaknesses-nonlinear gameplay - sneak around without being seen or slaughter everyone with a gun-diverse 'disciplines' (basically supernatural powers) - invisibility, charm, induce insanity and more-decent dialogue system-good plot with ingenious quests-strong cast of characters-can be witty at times, playing with stereotypes and such-length - it probably took me around 30+ hours to finish, including most of the subquests (don't mind the hours on record, I often play in offline mode)Cons:-the graphics (that is to be expected from a game released in 2004) - clipping issues are unfortunately quite common-difficulty spikes - very easy at first, can be frustrating at the end depending on what weapons you're using-lackluster and unbalanced combat system - upgrading your melee comabt skills will only increase the damage you deal, the movesets and attack speed remain the same (or improve just slightly); there is also no good reason to choose unarmed combat over melee weapons-hubs offer relatively little to do once the sidequests are finished (justified in that you only ever walk the streets at night)-buggy (be sure to install unoffical patches)-the inventory can be messy-price - about 20 bucks for a ten-year-old game that isn't even a cult classic (albeit, for what it is - a very decent RPG, perhaps it should be)My rating: 7.5/10			"

												Notice: the reason the play time is low is because of the unofficial patch mod to actually play it. Details are in the review.(spoken in a dark macho manly voice)""The time is 12:30am or something, i dunno i can't read the time, everyone is trying to mind their own buisness and telling me to♥♥♥♥♥♥off because i keep getting way too close to them. I'm given another bazillionth task to retrieve some♥♥♥♥♥♥that will 'definetly' not backfire by some girl i obviously can tell that has dual personalities, but for some strange fate i'm the only one that notices but can't say so because the writers, uhhh i mean God thought i have a perception of a seven year old and gave me a speech impared stroke."" ""I'm still not able to date that girl at the bar without being shuned so hard that i slam through a brick wall, why must i be given the curse of being able to defend myself against an entire army of thugs, and generally being badass at everything else, EXCEPT TALKIING LIKE A NORMAL PERSON TO A GIRL! Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ dating women who think socially awkward men are 'cute', this is how i became a vampire in the first place.""This is a generalization on my thoughts in ""Vampire: the masquerade-Bloodlines"". I played through the game as a  combat hardened vampire with the dating capability of a five year old, and ended the game as a combat hardened Vampire with the dating capability of an eight year old. So thats 1,000 bodies piled up in one night, and 0 women shaged blood sucked through what was supposed to be shagging in a lifetime. But  everything else was A ok, the story was fantastic, the characters were likeable, and the combat was riged but interesting enough to be worthy of a Bethesda RPG. But beating a dead horse five or eight times is not enough, noooo you want to eviserate it and smear the entestines all over yourself. You deffinetly don't want to be affiliated with something like that, so im gona help you look like you do by framing you and calling the cops on you. For now why don't you read the rest of this review while i make sure that your into snuff films.gameplayIf your eyes were too lazy to read the description of the game, you play as a vampire in the modern world. But the game dosn't want to be that kind of game, like the recent fallout game, it want's to be unique and engaging like a hetrosexual. You have your penalties, your overbearing number of skills to track, your journal, blood because your a vampire obviously and your soon to be overburdened inventory. if thats hard to keep track of, pray to God that the police won't arrest you, if not continue reading.Then we got the combat, what about it, like a bethesda RPG, clunky, unpolished but original enough to keep you interested. wacking people sends them flying and slaming against a wall if there is one, and shooting people is as interesting as the new call of duty, the same as every call of duty game. Then theres your supernatural skills, because vampire, and that the affect is what race of vampire you are, like a hetrosexual. Theres a dozen different races, but on my first run i played as a carniverous hippy with Bob Marly enthusiast hair.But where it really shines like a flash bang going off in your eyes is the dialouge. Almost everyone in the game has profesional voice acting (except for the same looking security guards) and have facial animations of melted chocolate being forcefully poured down your throat. The protagonist (yourself dumbass) even has great dialouge that made me actually feel about the scenarios the game passes to me on a silver platter, which looks to me was  suppost to be a golden platter.atmosphereThe world is dark, scary and sleazy like Detroit, probably is inspired by real world Detroit. The game almost looks believable enough to be a real city with bumbs walking around in the dozens and the looks of what was suppost to be a city with imbition is strife with poverty. Hope and kindness is a rare comodity, and even if its not impossible to be nice, conflicting consequences force youto chose between human, or monster. Even the game has a moral meter but instead of getting to look bad, the more evil you are the likelier you are to have no control over you character while they go on a rampage, im serious.But underneath that exterior lies a society of, you already know what it is. The world of the dead always changes the tone of being in a normal place, to being in somewhere where you are powerless. you'll be one minute fighting thugs in the dozens while some will try to flee in terror, then you'll be in a haunted mansion or a house of a crazed vampire, making you sick and spooked at the same time, it actually works very well.Everything from lighting to texture work makes this a believable place, almost at the same levels as 'Deus ex'.negativesBUGS, bugs everyhere even if you start it throws at you a '15 gb of space required' prompt that throws you out like a bouncer at a strip club. Fortunatly i have a solution here[www.patches-scrolls.com]. even if you get that to work your still going to run into problems, like asanine enemy locations and game braking bugs. a noticable one is the CARGO SHIP LEVEL. I see cops everywhere, i sneak past them to investigate something, i try to escape but i don't know how to without killing the guards blocking my escape route and i can't kill anyone. You know what the solution was,  NO CLIP. I had to use it to pass through that level because i tried every solution to get out without getting spotted by the 'highly trained officers' who shoot on site, because making advance ai is hard.conclusionThis game has fantasticly told story with slightly dogy but engaging combat with loads of bugs, but you know what it is. An unfinished masterpeace because the developers were on a tight schedual and tried to cram everything in a reasonably long game. It works for the most part and optimization is great, its a shame that it has so many bugs that would scare alot of players away. I recommend this if you like decent RPG's and don't mind cheating a little.The police are probably there already and your thinking of ways to kill me, well i get alot of death threats so im a popular guy .Ill be in hiding while you plan your escape route, even though i am most likely to get assasinated by the many secret agencies and lives of people worthy enough for a protagonist of a John Woo film.

												Ok yeah so the game is old. And it shows. And it's pretty janky and buggy and needs a bit of patching to run smoothly (crash to desktop on boot, anyone?) BUT...Seriously, if you enjoy RPG action games, PLEASE give this one a try. The story is brilliant, and it features one of the best spooky levels/missions I've ever experienced in a videogame. It's pretty authentic to the hard-copy pen and paper (and LARP) RPG system which it is based on, so if you're a fan of the tabletop/larp, you should get a kick out of this!It's a little treasure of a game, beloved by its fans, and honestly if you can look past the dated appearance (I personally find it rather charming) and deal with the occasional bugs (seriously, PLEASE check the forums for this game if you pick it up and download the unofficial patch) you should have a pretty good time.Also vampires. :)			"

												LOVE this game.It look old and it's a bit janky (particularly combat using firearms, melee is must more rewarding) but the world is amazingly well constructed and highly immersive.This is a world you can get lost in with multiple play style options and great ways to have a completely different experience. If you've already played through and want something different picking a different clan can give open up options and pathways that you previously couldn't have found. Great examples of this are the Nosfertu which prevent you from being seen by human without incurring penalty making you spend the game learning the under paths of the hub areas and the Malkvians who, being insane, replace all of your dialogue options with entertaining non-sequiturs and giving different dialogue from NPC (usually remarking that you're insane).Just make sure you get the unofficial patch which fixes a range of issues and greatly improves the game.

												Pros: 1. This game has tons of options for character cutomization. Different vampire clans, each with their own advantages/disadvantages make each playthrough unique.2. Many different dialogue options. Conversations with characters can go different ways depending on what you choose.3. Interesting and engaging storyline.Cons:1. Know that this game has MANY bugs. It took me multiple tries to get it to work. First, there was an issue with space, then its display settings had to be changed, then it couldn't connect to steam etc etc. It's a pain and takes a while to work them all out, but so many people experience it that you can find the solution easily.2. The character outfits are sort of glitchy. I doubt this will bother some but I noticed it with certain clothing options.3. I didn't really care for the more action-oriented aspects of the game. I ended up just trying to get through combat areas quickly so I could get back to the story.This game is a lot of fun and I would definitely recommend it. However, you have to be willing to go through the process of weeding out the bugs. Like I said, there are a lot of them, but the game is worth it.			"

												This game definitely deserves the title of ""Oldie but a Goodie""! Its gameplay is very appealing to those familiar with a setting that faintly reminds one of Fallout 3, in both character interaction and gameplay. The game is dripping with all kinds of lore that will have you reading up on it through character dialogue, not to mention the different play styles the different clans enable. This kind of clan dynamic gives the game good replay value as the game can change greatly depending on which vampire clan your character is sired from. Highly recommended to play and should definitely be acquired during a sale!			"

The side quests, characters, open world - all of it is superb. I know that the development got cut short, so the game that got released initially was buggy and incomplete.

												I once read a comment that said ""Whenever someone mentions Vampire Bloodlines you just know that someone, somewhere, is installing it again."", and I must agree wholeheartedly. I read that a few years ago, mind you, and I have since found other RPGs to add to my ""best RPGs of all time"" list. But Bloodlines, despite its age, its sort of mediocre gameplay that can confuse you for being based on a set of rules that are not always apparent, despite its dated visual and lack of character customization... Despite all that, the world, characters and tone still keep me coming back. Pretty much every quest is interesting, the dialogs are well writen, the urban fantasy setting is something I wish I could see more often in gaming (especially in RPGs) and it has what simply must be my favourite haunted house level in gaming. Ever.So yes, after almost ten years I still recommend Vampire, if nothing else because it will show you a world like which you won't find in any other videogame.Man, now I feel like starting another playthrough.

												The game is quite old, so the graphics are not all that. You will also need to download a fan-made patch to make it work properly, but once that's sorted the game works just fine.You get to choose one out of seven clans, your gender, and if you want - a backstory. All of these will have an impact on your playthrough, and gives you a lot of diversity to play with. Each clan has different abilities and traits. Sadly, you don't get to customise your appearance though, it's set by your sex and clan.The dialogue options allows you to voice your opinion, often in a rude way. The game gives you the options you need to go around and be an a-hole to everyone, and you can of course lick butt if that's more of your style. There will also be unique dialogue options based off your clan, stats and abilities.As you play through the game you will eventually be part of a story of politics, intrigue, and the fight for power and gain in the city. You will get to choose through your actions the outcome of this struggle, which I found very satisfying as you can make the ending of the game directly reflect your opinion on the conflicting factions of LA. There is no black and white answer here, as all these factions could be considered bad in different ways.All in all it's a good experience, and I highly recommend it.Oh, and one last bit of advice: Do not open the sarcophagus.

Released in a woefully buggy state back in 2004, nowadays with 3rd party mods and a bit of tinkering a very enjoyable experience. Sadly the last 3rd of the game is riddled with combat which certainly is not the game's strong suite. Interesting world, strong IMMERSHUN and well-written characters more than make up for the outdated visuals and the slight clunkiness of the gameplay.			"

A far cry from its predecessor Redemption (which if you can get it going on newer systems, i also recommend highly).The game stays very true to the aspects of the PnP game. Rich dialogue with interesting characters. Unfortunately it was developed prior to character skin customisation which ould have been nice, but not the be all and end all. Also can be a bit buggy with 64 bit systems and will require some tweaking, but all in all, one that should be in everyones collection			"

												Easily within my top 3 games of ALL time! A really fantastic RPG! You can play it many different ways unlike some RPG's, you can choose what kind of character you play both roleplay and combat wise. It was a little buggy when it first came out but with the official patch AND the unofficial community patch (which is essential imo) it works like a charm. It's very much a mature RPG that isn't all about elves and dwarves so it's a great change of pace from other games in the genre. Very much recommend if you like RPG's and you can handle a mature game.			"

												So much love for this game. It's a classic in the world of RPGs and has pretty brilliant story execution, but give the game some slack in the graphics and mechanics department, it's still an oldie. The unofficial patch is an absolute must to get around some of the problems for lack of development support post release. Either way, I'd highly recommend playing this - having replayed it after several years made me realize that we are missing so much in the modern age of RPG games... I want some of this old storytelling luster back!			"

												One of the classic RPGs that every fan of the genre should play. Released in a woefully buggy state back in 2004, nowadays with 3rd party mods and a bit of tinkering a very enjoyable experience. Sadly the last 3rd of the game is riddled with combat which certainly is not the game's strong suite. Interesting world, strong IMMERSHUN and well-written characters more than make up for the outdated visuals and the slight clunkiness of the gameplay.			"

												The game is quite old, so the graphics are not all that. You will also need to download a fan-made patch to make it work properly, but once that's sorted the game works just fine.You get to choose one out of seven clans, your gender, and if you want - a backstory. All of these will have an impact on your playthrough, and gives you a lot of diversity to play with. Each clan has different abilities and traits. Sadly, you don't get to customise your appearance though, it's set by your sex and clan.The dialogue options allows you to voice your opinion, often in a rude way. The game gives you the options you need to go around and be an a-hole to everyone, and you can of course lick butt if that's more of your style. There will also be unique dialogue options based off your clan, stats and abilities.As you play through the game you will eventually be part of a story of politics, intrigue, and the fight for power and gain in the city. You will get to choose through your actions the outcome of this struggle, which I found very satisfying as you can make the ending of the game directly reflect your opinion on the conflicting factions of LA. There is no black and white answer here, as all these factions could be considered bad in different ways.All in all it's a good experience, and I highly recommend it.Oh, and one last bit of advice: Do not open the sarcophagus.

												Can't beleive I haven't rated this game yet . It's one of my all time favorites.  It has vampire's, it's an RPG ,based off a pnp game, it's got action, guns and swords. What's not to love?  I'd give it a solid 96% rating.  now the bad The graphics while being competitive for today's games (it used source engine)  is looking dated also having switched to a wide screen monitor reccently I noted it has no wide screen resolution support. A bit disapointing considering many games  even older ones from 2002-3 had wide screen support. The game was released in 2004 about 4 months before half life 2 was even out, making it the first comercial game using valve's source engine (though they licensed the engine so this game was not developed by valve) This game is really worth a go for vampire and rpg fans alike.

												A staggeringly brilliant game. The story is the darkest and most sophisticated you'll come across in a game, the dialogue is the best I've ever come across in a game, and the Role-Playing elements are brilliantly strong, the amount of options open to you is matched only by Deus Ex. You can clearly see the influence Deus had on Vamp's development, with every mission having several possible methods of completion. While this game is buggy, the fans are still making patches since Trokia sadly went bankrupt after completing this game. You will still experience bugs, and that is the only bad thing about this game, but if you can get past this (and you should) you will find, in my opinion one of the best games ever made. It has a dark sense of humour, and a sophisticated world. Play this game if it's the last thing you do			"

												Well, where do I begin, telling you about this gem? I suppose I'll start with what it is.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is an action-RPG based on the tabletop game of the same name. Gamplay-wise, it plays similarly to the original Deus Ex, leaving multiple options to accomplish your objectives. You could go for the good-old fashioned direct assault, use stealth, or alternatively talk your way out of situations. It's really up to you.There are numerous vampire clans to choose from, all with their own unique focus. Brujahs and Gangrels focus more on combat, whereas the Tremere make use of powerful blood magic, and the Toreador and Ventrue manipulate their way towards their objectives. There are, however, two more, special clans. The Nosferatu are mutated horribly by their vampiric curse, and must skulk around the sewers and alleys lest they be seen. Needless to say, they're good at stealth. And last, but certainly not least, are the Malkavians. These guys are completely insane, which is reflected in game by your bizarre dialogue choices, hallucinations and voices in your head. They do have some nice powers, though, such as invisibilty and Dementation, which is useful for both dialogue and enemies. You'll also be treated quite differently based on your clan, leaving a lot of replay value.Really, though, it's the story and atmosphere which make this game truly special. Walking through the streets of a depiction of LA apparently going through it's Goth phase. The hubworlds are small in size but full of detail, and you always feel like you're doing something different. From tracking down and killing a cabal of blood disease-spreading vampires, to exploring a haunted house, to getting your own ghoul (basically someone who has recieved vampire blood and gets some basic vampire abilities from it, but not the whole set), it always feels like you're doing something unique. It feels good to drink blood, and the political intrigue of the secret vampire society you're involved in is extremely engrossing, and all the characters have different personalities, and a good few are quite memorable. The story moves at a good pace, although the story path to a seemingly simple objective often becomes quite convoluted.Sadly. this game is not without its flaws. First off the bat, there's the bugs and poor optimisation. This game was Christmas rushed (which, as we all know, always ends well), and the game was in an extremely buggy state upon launch, and Troika were unable to fix it on account of going bust shortly after. The game will ouright refuse to work on some modern systems without an unofficial patch, and may be almost unplayable. Even with the patch installed, you will see bugs often. Most won't affect gameplay, but will pull you out of that fantastic atmosphere Troika worked so hard to make. After a certain point close to the end of the game, due to it being rushed out the door, the game forces you into a repetetive series of combat arenas, with no alternative paths. So, if you've not been putting points into combat skills, you're screwed. The final boss (oh, and the boss fights aren't very good throughout the game) is impossible to kill without a gun, when guns are next to useless for a good part of the game. Oh, and even if you have gone the combat route, the game still has a massive unfair difficulty spike near the end. The combat itself is bearable, but very repetetive, and essentially consists of wailing on attack and spamming your most powerful clan Disciplines.Still, overall, VtM-B is easily one of the best RPGs ever made, and you owe to yourself to get it. Accept the Embrace and find your place in the world of the Kindred...			"

												If you haven't already, playing as a Malkavian is a must at least once.

Lotta great dialogue options for Malks-Creepy♥♥♥♥♥whispers in the background. Scares the crap out of me on a regular basis-The TV newscaster breaks the in-game fourth wall and addresses your character directly quite a few times. Scared the crap out of me the first time-Beatles references when you speak with one of the NPCs, Skelter.-You can argue with a ♥♥♥♥ing stop signAlso, one of the endings (for all clans, not just the Malks)you can literally tell everyone to ♥♥♥♥ off because they've all been using you. I can't even say how much I loved this because it's like seriously. I'm not your errand dog.Be warned though, it's 12 years old and super buggy. Bless the lovely, wonderful community for the mods and patches or otherwise this game would probably be unplayable as Troika went out of business about a year after this came out.

												This game pretty much makes up for every one of its shortcomings, and there are plenty, through pure style. There are some fantastic fan mods that even out the rough edges, but even unmodded this is one of the most immersive games out there, one that throws you into its world and lets you explore its darkest reaches. Rather than excessive exposition, it lets you discover the ins and outs of the underground vampire society yourself, much as an outsider like the player character would have to do. It has a fantastic amount of player choice, and a genuinely good storyline to follow, however you choose to play. Many of the core mechanics are pretty sloppy, and the various skills are terribly balanced. Not to mention an excess of bugs can impede your progress. But if you can ignore, or mod out these issues, you'll find it's the perfect vampire game. Just as the Arkham games make you feel like you really are Batman, this makes you really feel like a vampire. And makes vampires cool again in the process.(As usual, ignore my low recorded playtime, as I've already played my non-steam version multiple times.)			"

												Resurrected as a vampire after your death, you are recruited to assist in an ongoing war of attrition between several vampire clans who vie for control of Los Angeles. Using a combination of stealth, cunning and brute force, only you can ultimately shape the result of the conflict.Famously released in an unfinished state (though several patches and mods have been released that largely fix this), Bloodlines is a flawed yet absolutely captivating gem of a game that takes the stealth-action RPG hybrid gameplay of series such as Deus Ex and Thief, drapes it in a veneer of equal parts Anne Rice sensual horror and goth club sleaze, and ties it all together with an excellent script dripping with lore, mystery, sexuality, and violence. There's plenty of replay value to be had as well thanks to the diverse array of vampire clans one can play as; from the seductive Toreador or traditionalist Ventrue, to the monstrous Nosferatu or gibbering and insane Malkavian. Just be ready to do some patching after you've installed the game.			"

												An old classic that I feel still holds up really well. Plenty of quality content, come see what all the fuss is about.My one piece o advice would be to avoid a Malkavian playthrough to begin with; they're really fun and really great for role-playing, but it can be difficult to understand what is actually going on if you haven't already played the game before.

												This game is amazing. For it being a product of the times, it has memorable music and fun gameplay. The glitches can be a mixed bag sometimes and can either be really funny or really annoying, but when they're funny, you might need a minute to recover. Is the plot complicated? A little. Does it make sense? Hell no, but it's vampires in Los Angeles, which isn't supposed to make sense. All in all, give it a playthrough. You won't be disappointed.			"

												Good RPG. Play for the dialogue and try to ignore the combat mechanics. The controls are pretty meh by today's standards but they are alright for when the game was made. The good news is that this game regularly goes on sale and if you can overlook some control issues as well as occasional AI mishaps; you end up with a pretty good game for the money.			"

												No idea why I was so disappointed with this game back when I first played it.  Must-play game, IMO.  Especially for that brilliant dialogue missing from just about every other game ever in the whole history of video games in the world ever bar none absolutely, characters and decisions feeling impactful (even if they're not so much).  The dirty, disgusting, depraved setting is a nice change, too.Only major downside is the last quarter of the game starts feeling rushed--Chinatown, the last quest hub, is almost devoid of activities--and pushes you headlong into a series of unavoidable battles using a messy, unsatisfying combat system. Playing as a sneaky-sneaky, bat-crazy Malkavian, however, must be experienced.  Same with the haunted hotel level. x_x Spooky spooky spooky.			"

Considering there are few vampire games to play, this really is one of the best in the genre, and has good replay value.Okay Antitribu mod was great until towards the end where it seemed broken or unfinished so now I am trying the Clan Quest Mod.

												This game is still great. Bought the physical copy when it first came out and played the game through every clan. It is just a solid game.  If you want to play it on a widescreen at higher res. a few unofficial patches are available to choose from to bring it up to date. One changes a few game-play features to balance out old issues and the other (I believe) stays vanilla. Personally use Wesp5's unofficial patch 9.0, it fixes most of the bugs and balances some of the super powers that were in the game from launch.  If you haven't played Bloodlines buy it, patch it, you will love it. Worth more but you can catch it on sale for about $5.00.			"

												This is a great game with a ton of replay value. Even once you play through 1-3 using the vanilla version, the thriving mod community will keep you playing. The variations you can have between clans (classes) range from the literal insanity of the Malkavians to puking your guts up if you feed on bums as a Ventru.That being said, this game is a little broken. I've been stuck in doors, air vents, and sewers more than I'd like to admit. Also, stealth is a joke. Each stat can go up to a value of 10. With a value of 3, I was able to bump into guards without being detected. All in all, worth buying. Maybe not for full price... but still worth buying.			"

It's such a great blend of 1st person with RPG, and takes you so many places in the deep, seedy underbelly of L.A., as you massacre your way through levels filled with ghosts, mutants, werewolves, and cultists. It's too bad the game hasn't been updated for a long, long time. It's worth a lot more than one or two playthroughs, and is full of several paths, interesting characters, and amazing level design.

												One of the funnest games in my library. There's loads of options to choose from, featuring rebels and insane prophets to play as. You can also make things harder on yourself and play a Nosferatu, who can't even walk topside without terrifying the citizens. The game also has loads of dialogue options that effect how people interact with you and what quests are available. Plus both stealth lovers and gun fanatics can have fun, with both being great choices for getting most jobs done. Either way, action and stealth lovers alike are sure to have fun with this game.My only problems with it are that it can be really glitchy, so it would be best if you went and downloaded the unofficial patch, which fixes problems for newer systems while also adding new quests and weapons.

												Vampire: The Masquerade is a tabletop RPG game that was brought into the video gaming world with its first endeavor, ""Redemption"". After that, the creative and much more free roaming sequel, ""Bloodlines"" came out and basically shut down Troika games because of its bugs and glitches. However, the game itself, with its plot, choices, characters and overall lay out were good enough that fans have been releasing unofficial patches for the game in the decade since it was released. What does THAT tell you about the game? ;)    In Bloodlines, unlike Redemption, you get to choose your character by picking which gender you are and which vampire class. The vampire classes are an interesting assortment and essentially choose what your main skills and penalties turn out to be. If you're a Nosferatu, you're hideous and can roam about in public, but you're very intelligent and technical, if you're a Toreador, you're gorgeous and persuade/seduce almost anyone in the game, but you aren't very strong or intelligent and so on. Once you pick your class, you are thrust into a world of vampiric politics, gothic nightclubs and other fun stuff.    The fight mechanics are decent enough and the overall choices that you get make the game extremely enjoyable. The game has multiple endings and you essentially choose what kind of vampire you want to be (nice to people, recklessly homicidal to people, break all the rules, etc.) and what kind of vampire politics you want L.A. to turn into (ruled by the manipulative Vampire prince, ruled by the manipulative asian sorceress, ruled by you, or kill everyone and embrace vampiric anarchy). While the glitches are noticeable, even with any of the numerous fanmade uber-patches, the game is worth playing.			"

I hated every combat section because it was uncomfortable, clunky, with insane difficulty spikes. This game is also really glitchy. But they never broke my game and only broke immersion twice. The Physics (Source game, of course) were all over the place. Very unnecesary. Hair and clothes bounce without restraint and makes walking around in third person look really silly.TL:DR versionPROS:+Atmosphere+Story+Lore+Characters(All uniwue and well written+Voice Acting (no voice actors are recycled)+Graphics (aged a bit, but still holds up)+MusicCONS:-Combat-very glitchy10/10 I cry every night I remember there's no sequel			"

												If you play RPGs not only for incredible loot and skill tree leveling, but also for the sake of role-playing a character and taking in the atmosphere, this is the game for you. While you do gain experience, and unlock new abilities, the skill tree will be unfamiliar to those not already versed in White Wolf's pen and paper games. Also, there is very little gear, whether dropped or bought and it almost feels scripted. You get to a new place, and get a new weapon or armor, at the same time on every character you make. The only other bad point i'll touch on is the combat system. While it's fun hacking away in melee, and the vampire powers you get to back your fighting skills are top-notch visually and mechanically, if you specialize in guns, expect to have a REALLY hard time until about halfway through the game, even if your ranged skill is high. On top of that, even when your wielding a trusty baseball bat knocking some punk to the floor, you literally have to wait for them to get up to strike again as the hit-boxes don't register when they are prone. But those a few minor annoyances, and really aren't the spirit of the game. You can get through many missions without physical confrontation if you are socially inclined, or can make people magically go insane. The characters you meet all have a story and each one's personality might clash with another or even yourself. It's a great opportunity to really role-play a vampire and a must have for anyone looking for more than a run-through guns blazing type of game.			"

Combining elements of first person shooters with third person fighters and a unique level system, this is one of the best rpgs I've played.  Also, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GRINDING NECESSARY!!!  If you know exactly what to do from minute 1 and speedrun it, there is probably about 40 straight hours of content.  That's without the tons of dialogue (which is actually really good) and the great amount of sideqeusting you can do (which is also really good).The only issue would be that the game is a tad buggy so you need to run the unofficial patcher to get it playable on most machines as well as making sure it's running in compatibility mode for xp sp3 and as administrator.http://www.patches-scrolls.de/vampire_bloodlines.php#842 "

												An old classic that I feel still holds up really well. Plenty of quality content, come see what all the fuss is about.My one piece o advice would be to avoid a Malkavian playthrough to begin with; they're really fun and really great for role-playing, but it can be difficult to understand what is actually going on if you haven't already played the game before.

												This game is amazing. For it being a product of the times, it has memorable music and fun gameplay. The glitches can be a mixed bag sometimes and can either be really funny or really annoying, but when they're funny, you might need a minute to recover. Is the plot complicated? A little. Does it make sense? Hell no, but it's vampires in Los Angeles, which isn't supposed to make sense. All in all, give it a playthrough. You won't be disappointed.			"

The good news is that this game regularly goes on sale and if you can overlook some control issues as well as occasional AI mishaps; you end up with a pretty good game for the money.			"

That's dedication! • Nov 25, 2012 :  Someone on /tg/ recently (as in just moments ago) called to my attention (by way of lamentation) that the files aren't accessable anymore through the above link. So, here's another one that should work:http://www.patches-scrolls.de/vampire_bloodlines.php#84 • Apr 25, 2014 :  Heads up, there's a (fan) update to v9.0!  For those who aren't aware, there's a pretty dedicated community of fans who apparently keep updating/fixing this game. These patches I'm linking are not official but they improve this game quite a bit.Anyway, the link to the patch is in the first post here.

												What can i say about this game...Imperfect beauty.Even with all the glitches, bugs, and any other annoyence within the game, it is one of the best RPGs i have ever had the pleasure to play. This game straight up toppled Fallout from my list of RPGs i love, and took the spot of number 1.The game itself is low detail, with many bugs (at one point random furniture spawned throughtout certain areas, and if i looked into the sky i would see what looked like the shadows of furniture and people in the sky xD) but the bugs would rarely effect gameplay and since the game saves after ohmost every time you leave a Building you can take a few steps back, if you ever come across a bad bug that really stops you in your tracks. I only ever had one bug that was like this but i didnt even need to load to a previous point cause it was done for me when i was killed by a couch xD(invisible wall kinda deal).Now if you have been reading up on this game you know that it was never really polished off cause of the developers departure from gaming, luckily a rouge developer by the name of wesp5 took it upon himself to create an unofficial patch that rounds off quite a bit and adds in a few things previously unavailable. Now a lot of people can play the game without the patch but i see no reason not to get it since it adds more to the game(just a little bit). Some people are afraid of going outside of steam to fix their games but its not that hard to find a reputable site. I got my patch from http://patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647 and remember to download 9.0 and install it into steam (itll try to install it into a file that dosent exist i.e if you actually had this game on a CD)			"

With facial emotions and graphics that still hold extreamly well all these years later. A huge RPG story and charatcer creation system, nothing feels half-done. You will need the 8.8 un-official patch to run, that will fix the game up and make it a lot smoother, as the Steam Version will crash, once that's all fixed, with a lot of boobs, great combat, and state-of-the-art animations, what are you waiting for?!.

It lacks a proper character creation tool for customizing facial details and hairstyles and what not, but that isn't really an issue as most of the pre made characters are mostly spot on. The story is rich, the mini games like computer hacking feel fantastic, not frustrating, and the characters are interesting enough that once your into the world you never want to leave.

												Bloodlines takes some getting used to the first time around, but once you have the gameplay down, it's not hard AND it's wicked fun! +'s *Story! The story is a lot of fun, and based on what you do, you can have different endings.*Class variety! There are 7 clans which is the perfect number of classes for a game. Each vampire clan is treated different by NPCs and has a different set of abilites (although some abilites are shared between classes.)* Immersive! You really feel like you're in the World of Darkness.*CHARACERS, CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS!*REPLAY VALUE! Because your character gets treated different, you get new lines of dialogue each time and have to try new strategies for the same quests.-'s*Slight glitches can get annoying, but they happened very infrequently and had mostly to do with getting stuck on doors in my case.*That's pretty much it.

												Hands down one of the best games I have ever played.  Enough story to bring in anybody who needs it and overall an incredibly rich experience.  Combining elements of first person shooters with third person fighters and a unique level system, this is one of the best rpgs I've played.  Also, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO GRINDING NECESSARY!!!  If you know exactly what to do from minute 1 and speedrun it, there is probably about 40 straight hours of content.  That's without the tons of dialogue (which is actually really good) and the great amount of sideqeusting you can do (which is also really good).The only issue would be that the game is a tad buggy so you need to run the unofficial patcher to get it playable on most machines as well as making sure it's running in compatibility mode for xp sp3 and as administrator.http://www.patches-scrolls.de/vampire_bloodlines.php#842 "

												No idea why I was so disappointed with this game back when I first played it.  Must-play game, IMO.  Especially for that brilliant dialogue missing from just about every other game ever in the whole history of video games in the world ever bar none absolutely, characters and decisions feeling impactful (even if they're not so much).  The dirty, disgusting, depraved setting is a nice change, too.Only major downside is the last quarter of the game starts feeling rushed--Chinatown, the last quest hub, is almost devoid of activities--and pushes you headlong into a series of unavoidable battles using a messy, unsatisfying combat system. Playing as a sneaky-sneaky, bat-crazy Malkavian, however, must be experienced.  Same with the haunted hotel level. x_x Spooky spooky spooky.			"

												This game is something that is very unfortunate. It has a seriously interesting world, that will imerse you regardless of whether you're a fan of gothic culture or not. It spins a vampire tale that is both interesting and enjoyable at the same time. The plot remains solid and tense up until the 75% mark and then it feels unfortunatly rushed. I ended this story, feeling satisified of the journey but the overal end just left me feeling like alot of choices I made didn't matter. This is of course, due to the game developer being rushed to finish the game on time and highlights of game gems such as this one, are unfortunatly not given the extra attention they deserved.Gameplay is very similar to that of games like Deus Ex. You are allowed to tackle objectives in any way you wish, in fact the game presents you with a series of classes which almost define your playstyle from then on. And this isn't just a minor state boost ethier. Playing as a particular class for example, renders you unable to travel on the streets due to your inability to blend in. The consequence of this is that you spend most of the game in sewers eating rats, but have a massive advantage when it comes to any stealth encounter. This is one of the fantastic game design choices the games makes! Certain vampire classes have advanatges in certain areas. Some are good at meddling with humans, others are better at combat and violence. One class is considered insane, and has an entire dialouge choice to back it up in conversations. Combat can be a little worse for ware, but it isn't unplayable. The broken AI, doesn't tend to put up much of a fight - especially in stealth sections. When you pick your class, you will find it difficult to progress down any other path. Stealth classes, tend to be killed quite easily if you try full frontal combat. Stealth isn't just a one off thing ethier, it is supported by stealth kills, shadow blending etc. Overall, when you play this game - it is very difficult not to appreciate it, for what it could be and for what it is. I find it difficult to discredit the game up to the 75% mark. After that, things are obviously rushed, everything becomes more combat focused and you will find yourself struggling if you didn't pick a combat class. Before that though, is a game that definatly rewards player choice in both story and gameplay. It provide an interesting, immersive gothic world that will delight both those who enjoy vampire culture and those who don't, alike.			"

												Best vampire RPG, really long (40h+ if you don't rush). I played using unofficial patch (recommended) which adds new content and fixes bugs. Gothic atmosphere, music and quests are great, plot not so much. There are 7 playable clans and because of this you can finish the game at least 3 times completely different. You can be a Nosferatu which has to hide from every human because is so hideous that his looks violate the Masquarade (important part of gameplay) you can as well play as Malkavian whose clan is insane and because of it dialogues are different and NPCs treat you like some kind of lunatic moreover you can hear people talking in your head and talk to road signs and TV, game changes from serious to funny. Rest of the clans I would recommend for the first playthrough because you enjoy the game as it was mainly designed.If you like vampires, neogothic or Deus Ex (very similar in gameplay) you will love this game.

												A flawed masterpiece.The game has its problems, that's undeniable.  It seems the development team ended up being punished by time constraints and ended up sorely neglecting the last quarter of the game; neglecting the truly excellent role-playing elements for more and more uninspired combat.  Fortunately, thanks to numerous community patches, the rest of the game has aged pretty well.If you overlook the minor annoyance that combat represents, and the fact that the end of the game feels too brief and rushed, even with the significant amount of ""lost content"" added to it by the aforementioned  patches, then you're in for a real treat.The atmosphere is outstanding; the game does an excellent job of creating an almost film-noir bleakness that typifies the World of Darkness setting.  At least two relatively early missions ratchet up the creepy into moments of true horror, and there is a constant air of menace that you'd expect from a game where you build a custom vampire and embark on the life of a creature-of-the-night.The roleplaying elements are truly first-rate.  Some of the best I have ever seen, with characters that are unique, memorable, and fully formed.  The degree with which you can interact them is solid, and just a whisker shy of being superlative.The skill-sets you can pick from strike a great balance between utility (being able to hack computer terminals for info, or lock-pick), social (seduction, intmidation), and combat.The stealth system is solid, but not amazing – the obfuscate ability makes it pretty redundant for a couple of ""clans"" (classes) but stealth-kills are an effective tool in most situations.The plot is gripping, although as I mentioned above the conclusion feels a little rushed; as if they ran out of time in the third act and just cut-to-the-chase.  The numerous side-quests are insinuated into the game subtlely, and in a way that makes completing them fun, rather than just busy-work you have to go through to get 100% completion or some extra XP and loot.This game is truly a diamond in the rough.

												Fantastic game with absolutely wonderful dialogue. Playing as a Malkavian is great and the thought that has gone into the NPCs is stunning. If you haven't played this, you can't call yourself a true PC gamer! The lack of a sequel (spiritual or otherwise) to this game is one of the biggest tragedies in gaming.			"

												One of the funnest games in my library. There's loads of options to choose from, featuring rebels and insane prophets to play as. You can also make things harder on yourself and play a Nosferatu, who can't even walk topside without terrifying the citizens. The game also has loads of dialogue options that effect how people interact with you and what quests are available. Plus both stealth lovers and gun fanatics can have fun, with both being great choices for getting most jobs done. Either way, action and stealth lovers alike are sure to have fun with this game.My only problems with it are that it can be really glitchy, so it would be best if you went and downloaded the unofficial patch, which fixes problems for newer systems while also adding new quests and weapons.

												This is a great game with a ton of replay value. Even once you play through 1-3 using the vanilla version, the thriving mod community will keep you playing. The variations you can have between clans (classes) range from the literal insanity of the Malkavians to puking your guts up if you feed on bums as a Ventru.That being said, this game is a little broken. I've been stuck in doors, air vents, and sewers more than I'd like to admit. Also, stealth is a joke. Each stat can go up to a value of 10. With a value of 3, I was able to bump into guards without being detected. All in all, worth buying. Maybe not for full price... but still worth buying.			"

												I only briefly played the tabletop RPG of White Wolf's V:TM, and never really got into vampire stuff in general. This game, in particular, is outstanding on its own merits. The side quests, characters, open world - all of it is superb. I know that the development got cut short, so the game that got released initially was buggy and incomplete. I can't imagine what this game could have been, but it has been patched by the community as well as the developer itself before they went out of business, but this game is incredible. Easily one of the best, most realized game worlds I've ever played in.			"

												This is a great game with amazing role playing opportunities but unless you're willing to use unofficial patches and the console to get past issues, choose a different game. On a modern system, this game won't run without an unofficial patch and even then you run into hiccups. Still interested? Well, sit down because I'm going to tell you why this game is the vampire RPG you've been looking for and more.Ever craved more after Skyrim's tiny vampire section? Well, here it is, with fangs and bloodlust to match.This game puts you in the middle of an urban city environment based in 2004. You've been sired by a vampire against the Masquerade and if not for Kindred (vampires) political machinations, you'd be ash alongside your sire.Now, you are thrust into a world of politics, monsters and blood, all whilst hiding your true nature. The clan you pick has a decent factor in on this and some more than others. There are different ways to handle situations throughout most of the game and it's really just near the end where the rewarded path becomes the least successful which is quite discordant.Each situation is very different, leaving very little of that normal copy and paste side quest/main quest situation, giving you a fulfilling storyline to warm your undead heart. Mechanics have you thinking like a vampire- a game where you are the predator and sometimes, the prey don't know how close they were to their death, spared because it was too much effort. Your judgement, skills and so on will determine how you approach things.The penalties for violating the Masquerade by exposing vampiric activities to the Kine (humans) can be severe if you're not careful. Feed on anyone out in the open, use certain powers openly, amusement, even the wrong speech choice can get you in trouble. Five strikes and it's an automatic final death/game over. Humanity Loss, unfortunately with the XP you can spend to undo is a little less dire but be careless and not fix a severe deficit and suddenly you're looking at a frenzy where you literally lose control for a bit. Injury and thirst for blood can bring out the vampiric beast within. Mostly, a savvy player will sidestep these pitfalls but occasionally, you’ll find yourself desperate for blood and a crowd of unwitting humans after a hellish quest so stock up on those spare blood bags.Gameplay can get frustrating and there's no difficulty bar. My best advice to new players is don't get intimidated, and you'll make it through, even if you need to add self-advantage.I won't spoil the main game but the World of Darkness universe is an amazing playground for your vampire RPG-ing wants. You have to play it for yourself and carve out your potential eternal life, although be careful. The wrong side at the end can leave your legacy as a fate worse than death. It’s a game of consequences with logic behind decisions and outcomes based on your choices. Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines is a great vampire RPG, arguably one of the only chances you'll have to play a vampire as they were made to be and it leaves you wondering why more entries couldn't have been made. It is 'the' vampire RPG everyone wishing to sink their fangs into the night must have and the price is worth the gamble to get it running on newer computers.My final score for this game is 9.5/10 and the half point loss is for the bug that required no-clip and the fifteen reloads it took to get through to the next section for an otherwise game breaking bug. Any older game made for XP and earlier you pick up at this point will come with all kinds of issues but this game was released as an unstable beta, requiring years of caring work by Wesp5, who deserves an eternity of gratitude for getting this game to run as well as it does.

												I'll give you the TL;DR right away to save you some time: BUY THIS GAME. NOW. (or wait until it's $5, either way, it's worth it)Cons:Buggy. Download the unofficial patch (link in Steam forums), it fixes most of the bugs. I recommend the basic patch on your first playthrough. There's still some bugs after the patch, but just make sure you save a lot. Fixing most bugs is as simple as restarting the game and reloading your save. I only had to do this maybe two-three times with the patch. It's probably more without it. I encountered no game-breaking bugs. I do hear of some people having a hard time getting it running as well. I've never had issues, but the solutions are out there, and the effort is worth it.Clunky Combat. This game tricks you into thinking it's going to be more like an FPS, at first. Disregard. It's fairly straightforward RPG combat via mashing the left-click (with a little more to it as you'll learn). Guns are very weird at first, and melee is a bit hard to grasp right away. I actually quit and uninstalled the game on my first character because of this. I'm very glad I gave it a second chance. Once you get used to it, it's not bad at all. You'll be a ninja in no time, I promise.Character models. This is more of a personal preference, but I think the chracters have a bit too much charicature. They're a bit cartoony as you can see by the screenshots. In spite of that, the game is actually pretty dark, gritty, and sometimes, downright scary. I often forgot all about them while playing.Animations. The animations, especially during cutscenes, are a bit funky. It's bearable, though. And that's just the body animations. The facial animations are pretty good. Great for 2004. The cloth physics are a bit wack.Map size. A pro and a con at the same time, almost. The map is split into fairly small loading zones focused around city hubs and various quest locations. If you're used to more open worlds, it might take a bit to get used to. It doesn't bother me, personally. They do a decent job at filling them with content, even if the content does get a bit thinner in the later maps (a lot of games do this).Pros:Atmosphere. The biggest seller for me in this game. Bloodlines nails it's gothic atmoshere so well, it's almost uncanny. It's horror elements are also very well executed. Not too many games can get my heart racing like this one has. One part in particular, if you don't know what you're doing, is nightmare inducing (Hint: The last screenshot might have something to do with the part I'm referring to).Story. The story is gripping and packed with intrigue. Some of the gameplay elements might get a bit repetitive (as with just about any game), but I was always driven to continue just to see events unfold. Lots of twists and turns. Everything you would want from a VtM story. Some things were a bit obvious, but everything works. There's also multiple endings depending on where you choose to put your loyalty. They ultimately lead to the same place and overall outcome, but this didn't bother me. I found that siding with myself got some of the most epic dialogue and immersion. Every step of the way, you really feel like you're being dragged deeper down into a dark underworld. And don't worry if you're not familiar with the PnP, this game does a great job introducing fledglings to the VtM universe.Characters. Memorable and well voice-acted. They drive the story along flawlessly. Not much else to say about that.Choice. Wanna skulk in the shadows, Gordon Freeman through ventilation systems, picking locks and hack computers to get through? Or do you wanna kick the door in and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything with your fists? You got it. Unfortunately, the amount of choice peters off around the halfway mark. Due to Troika having their budget and their deadlines cut by Activision, much of the latter half of the game is very combat heavy. The story and characters don't falter, though. I found stealth and social-focused characters fairly difficult to play later on. In some cases, I even cheated and/or just stopped advancing with those characters. It's a bit disheartening, but it is what it is. You can still enjoy the first half thoroughly, with social or stealth. Just make your first character combat-focused to get the whole story without much of a hitch, then play around with the other stuff in subsequent playthroughs.Music. The music selection is small, but well-produced. They are also in non-propietary formats in the game files, so if you really enjoy them, you can copy them to your preferred device.Replayability. Although the game isn't terribly long, there's plenty of oppurtunity for replay. Playing different clans alters your experience, sometimes dramatically. I recommend a Brujah specializing in Celerity for an easy-mode play through. The Matrix-esque effects of a high Celerity level is pretty neat. The wacky Malkavian makes a great second character (might be hard to follow along with the dialogue for a first-timer). Nosferatu is expert mode. Along with that, the modding community is still undead and well. You can find everything from the basic bug-fixing patches like suggested above, all the way to major game alterations. I state again, I recommend only the basic unofficial patch for a fledgling to minimize bugs/incompatibility frustration.Conclusion:Although both lists have a similar number of entries, I assure you, the Pros FAR outweigh the cons. This is the perfect game to play during the Halloween season (in which it usually goes on sale as well). I can play it any time of day, myself. With CCP plopping their fat asses on the IP with no apparent interest in using it, this is the best VtM game you're going to get for a long time. In extension, I would argue that it's the best vampire game ever made, and sadly, will probably remain so.			"

												I love love -love- this game! I can't stop playing Malkavins.

I wish there was more to this game- a /lot/ more. I've never played a game set in WOD but if another VTm games come sup? I'd buy it in a heartbeat.What do I like more about this game? The Malkavian deiniftly. It's written very well and their dialogue gives you hints of what happens- and sometimes it's just twisted insanity. I should play the other bloodlines, I really should.

												This is one of the greatest games of all time.  It also is a twitchy pile of bugs by default, so it's a misunderstood cult classic that's basically unplayable by default.  Don't let that scare you, Bloodlines spins an amazing world with great characters, disturbing ideas, and an amazing amount of choice that is rarely seen in games (it puts Mass Effect to shame, at least). The combat is decent, but it's definitely not the important part of this game and can make you game a bit annoying if you built a poorly-planned character.Don't let the negatives dissuade you though, this game has hundreds of hours of gameplay if you look for it and tremendous replayability.  Just make sure you grab the unofficial patch by Wesp, which just make everything better.			"

												I had to go back and re-review this.It's dated, it's bugged and it's a bit short... but none of that matters, because this game is down right awesome, even with it's quirks and flaws. The game focuses mainly around Vampire societies, clans and other assorted things most people don't actually touch on that go beyond the ""I'm a vampire. I'm a monster. Blurgh!"" stereotype as surprise surprise, you've just recently become a vampire yourself.Picking a clan you get sired into also affects how people react and talk to you or how the game plays itself. Picking Malkavian makes everyone want to smash their faces in trying to understand your cryptic methaphors, Tremere makes people wary about you because you can use your own blood as a magic weapon and Nospheratu means getting in the shadows because you're so god damn ugly and no one wants to see your face. Just a few examples. While not the longest game ever, it's still pretty good for all it's worth.VtM:B is the game to get if you're into the vampire thing and going beyond blood sucking children of the night, minus Stephenie Meyer's sparkling turd dust.

												Probably one of my favorite games ever. It was released in an unfinished state but that can be fixed with a patch since the game has had lots of attention from fans for over a decade.So what is it all about? Well, you are basically a random person turned into a vampire. After this you get introduced to the vampire society and the game starts. Amazing game overall, it has aged really well. The voice acting is amazing and all the side quests are fun in their own way. There are seven different vampires you can choose to play as. All with different pros and cons. I'd recommend playing through as any clan but the malkavian and then replaying the game as a Malkavian, as it is almost impossible to understand without finishing it once first.So... Yeah, I recommend this game			"

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.Long name, incredible game. Quite possibly the best game I have ever played. I have reached the final boss several times, but only finally got around to giving him his Final Death today. Taking around thirty hours, this is a game complete with an amazing story, interesting characters, cool powers, and the most legit vampire's I know of. The basic story begins with your 'embrace' - where you become a vampire - and continues as your rise in power and prestige, until you are causing the events, rather than reacting to them.Each of the nine clans you can choose from have different abilities. They could be considered classes, similar to other games, but they aren't usually wildly different. Most of the change is in the player models, and the powers - each clan getting two powers from a pool, and a third unique to their clan. But there are enough differences to make replaying a possibility. For example, the Nosferatu are hideous, and as such cannot seduce people for blood, and instead have to suck on rats in the sewers below the streets, while the Ventrue clan is the opposite - they cannot drink from rats due to their nobility. Another is clan Malkavian; each and every one of them is insane. Incredibly, they have 100% unique dialogue, opposed to other clans having a few lines or opportunities each, and can engage in some interesting tangents - such as having a conversation with the news reporter on TV.While the vanilla version is very buggy - due to the developers being rushed in their final stages - most of these issues can be resolves with the fan made Unofficial Patch, which is a must-get if you plan on playing. It's not the prettiest game either, with some pretty terrible animations at times, but all this is forgiveable in the face of such a wonderful experience. The game uses Valve's source engine (an earlier version of the engine Titanfall is built on), and was released on the same day as Half-Life 2; and though the models in the game are by no means of equal quality, they are attractive in their own way, and help nail the bleak, horror/noir atmosphere.If Firefly was a game, it would be this one. While the themes are not at all similar, it is the kind of game that when someone brings it up in conversation, or you read about it on the net, you pretty much have no choice but to reinstall and have another crack at it.10/10. I honestly cannot think of any way to improve it, other than give the devs more time to improve a couple of the cutscenes.tl;dr - V:TM-B is one of the best games ever. It is often on sale on Steam. buy it. Install the most recent Unofficial Patch. Enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ the haunted hotel. The game isn't all that scary, the hotel always gets me.			"

												I bought this game just cause it was on sale for $5, didn't think much of it, but when I played it I absolutely fell in love with the game! Not gonna lie, this game is GREAT but it has many flaws. From what I heard the game was rushed, which really shows. Buggy graphics and animations, broken stealth system, broken damage system. Besides that it's still a solid game with rich dialogue and an interesting storyline. The games' lore is very detailed, and there are even books you can buy that tell you about the clans! Even after the game ends there's still so much to learn about the world it takes place in, the playable clans the unplayable clans, and the other supernatural beings. I've played the game 3 times just with the patch, and now I'm currently playing with a mod called 'The Final Nights' which adds all new clans and game mechanics. So after you get bored of the regular game you can download one of the many mods available. I highly recommend this game, even though it's old and rushed it's still an amazing rpg. (This game can be hard at times especially near the end, just a heads up.)			"

												This game is something that is very unfortunate. It has a seriously interesting world, that will imerse you regardless of whether you're a fan of gothic culture or not. It spins a vampire tale that is both interesting and enjoyable at the same time. The plot remains solid and tense up until the 75% mark and then it feels unfortunatly rushed. I ended this story, feeling satisified of the journey but the overal end just left me feeling like alot of choices I made didn't matter. This is of course, due to the game developer being rushed to finish the game on time and highlights of game gems such as this one, are unfortunatly not given the extra attention they deserved.Gameplay is very similar to that of games like Deus Ex. You are allowed to tackle objectives in any way you wish, in fact the game presents you with a series of classes which almost define your playstyle from then on. And this isn't just a minor state boost ethier. Playing as a particular class for example, renders you unable to travel on the streets due to your inability to blend in. The consequence of this is that you spend most of the game in sewers eating rats, but have a massive advantage when it comes to any stealth encounter. This is one of the fantastic game design choices the games makes! Certain vampire classes have advanatges in certain areas. Some are good at meddling with humans, others are better at combat and violence. One class is considered insane, and has an entire dialouge choice to back it up in conversations. Combat can be a little worse for ware, but it isn't unplayable. The broken AI, doesn't tend to put up much of a fight - especially in stealth sections. When you pick your class, you will find it difficult to progress down any other path. Stealth classes, tend to be killed quite easily if you try full frontal combat. Stealth isn't just a one off thing ethier, it is supported by stealth kills, shadow blending etc. Overall, when you play this game - it is very difficult not to appreciate it, for what it could be and for what it is. I find it difficult to discredit the game up to the 75% mark. After that, things are obviously rushed, everything becomes more combat focused and you will find yourself struggling if you didn't pick a combat class. Before that though, is a game that definatly rewards player choice in both story and gameplay. It provide an interesting, immersive gothic world that will delight both those who enjoy vampire culture and those who don't, alike.			"

Gothic atmosphere, music and quests are great, plot not so much. There are 7 playable clans and because of this you can finish the game at least 3 times completely different. You can be a Nosferatu which has to hide from every human because is so hideous that his looks violate the Masquarade (important part of gameplay) you can as well play as Malkavian whose clan is insane and because of it dialogues are different and NPCs treat you like some kind of lunatic moreover you can hear people talking in your head and talk to road signs and TV, game changes from serious to funny. Rest of the clans I would recommend for the first playthrough because you enjoy the game as it was mainly designed.If you like vampires, neogothic or Deus Ex (very similar in gameplay) you will love this game.

												A very underrated RPG that was released at a bad time. This game has a great story and allows you to solve most problems through various means be it via talking, stealth, or fighting.  Combat isn't really the games strength but it has some interesting abilities that will keep you entertained. I would recommend installing the fan plus patch to fix a lot of bugs and I would advise not rolling Nosferatu or Malkavian in your first playthrough.			"

												One of the best RPG's I have sunk time into, if you enjoy Deus Ex it is definitely worth a shot as the overal gameplay is similar. Frankly there isn't a better Vampire game out there, be warned though you should look into the unofficial patch as it adds a lot to the game and fixes some of the problems it suffers from on modern machines. Regardless of some technical issues due to it's age you would be doing yourself a disservice not playing through this game.			"

												A flawed masterpiece.The game has its problems, that's undeniable.  It seems the development team ended up being punished by time constraints and ended up sorely neglecting the last quarter of the game; neglecting the truly excellent role-playing elements for more and more uninspired combat.  Fortunately, thanks to numerous community patches, the rest of the game has aged pretty well.If you overlook the minor annoyance that combat represents, and the fact that the end of the game feels too brief and rushed, even with the significant amount of ""lost content"" added to it by the aforementioned  patches, then you're in for a real treat.The atmosphere is outstanding; the game does an excellent job of creating an almost film-noir bleakness that typifies the World of Darkness setting.  At least two relatively early missions ratchet up the creepy into moments of true horror, and there is a constant air of menace that you'd expect from a game where you build a custom vampire and embark on the life of a creature-of-the-night.The roleplaying elements are truly first-rate.  Some of the best I have ever seen, with characters that are unique, memorable, and fully formed.  The degree with which you can interact them is solid, and just a whisker shy of being superlative.The skill-sets you can pick from strike a great balance between utility (being able to hack computer terminals for info, or lock-pick), social (seduction, intmidation), and combat.The stealth system is solid, but not amazing – the obfuscate ability makes it pretty redundant for a couple of ""clans"" (classes) but stealth-kills are an effective tool in most situations.The plot is gripping, although as I mentioned above the conclusion feels a little rushed; as if they ran out of time in the third act and just cut-to-the-chase.  The numerous side-quests are insinuated into the game subtlely, and in a way that makes completing them fun, rather than just busy-work you have to go through to get 100% completion or some extra XP and loot.This game is truly a diamond in the rough.

												The story and dialogs are very good but what really set apart this cRPG from other games is implementation of Vampire: The Masquerade universe itself. The world is dark, brutal and without mercy. Because Bloodlines is using Source Engine (HL2) the graphics didn't get ugly old and facial expression still look great even for today standards. Worth mentioning is also soundtrack which is building atmosphere of this dark world.			"

												I love this game and had to buy it again just to have it on Steam. It's a somewhat old game in new clothes, but it still has one heck of a story and lots and lots of brilliant characters, not to mention a lot of twisted, sick quests :) I really love the whole night time atmosphere with its whacked out radio shows playing and so on. And it just has so much replay value due to the different clans you can play as (not to mention the gender option - female vampires have a kinda sexy way of taking their night snacks). The music is great too, varying between atmospheric to industrial.I think the devs should perhaps clean up a bitmap or two on this new release, because the various maps - especially useful as Nosferatu as you'll be hitting the sewers a lot due to their unsightly appearance - are not clear. If you can find the maps online do print a copy if you're playing as Nosferatu. Even with these cosmetic issues it's still a wonderful game.			"

												The game is quite old, so the graphics are not all that. You will also need to download a fan-made patch to make it work properly, but once that's sorted the game works just fine.You get to choose one out of seven clans, your gender, and if you want - a backstory. All of these will have an impact on your playthrough, and gives you a lot of diversity to play with. Each clan has different abilities and traits. Sadly, you don't get to customise your appearance though, it's set by your sex and clan.The dialogue options allows you to voice your opinion, often in a rude way. The game gives you the options you need to go around and be an a-hole to everyone, and you can of course lick butt if that's more of your style. There will also be unique dialogue options based off your clan, stats and abilities.As you play through the game you will eventually be part of a story of politics, intrigue, and the fight for power and gain in the city. You will get to choose through your actions the outcome of this struggle, which I found very satisfying as you can make the ending of the game directly reflect your opinion on the conflicting factions of LA. There is no black and white answer here, as all these factions could be considered bad in different ways.All in all it's a good experience, and I highly recommend it.Oh, and one last bit of advice: Do not open the sarcophagus.

												With the latest unoficial patch and a few compatability tweaks, the game is stable, plays at 1920x1200, is quite nice to gaze upon, and is one of the deepest RPG experiences out there. Each character class really does mean a different experience. The game is dark, funny, has a rich story, and some great voice work. It was marred by a flawed launch and lost under Half-Life 2. Just look for it on sale, do the little bit of work needed to run in Windows 7 64 bit, and then revel in some vampire RPG goodness. Oh, play the game one as any character other than a Malkavian or a Nosferatu. Then try it as both. See, it really is different. One can't be seen by mortals (Nosferatu) and hides in shadows and hte sewers and the other is bat-crap crazy.			"

Rich dialogue with interesting characters. Unfortunately it was developed prior to character skin customisation which ould have been nice, but not the be all and end all.

												Easily within my top 3 games of ALL time! A really fantastic RPG! You can play it many different ways unlike some RPG's, you can choose what kind of character you play both roleplay and combat wise. It was a little buggy when it first came out but with the official patch AND the unofficial community patch (which is essential imo) it works like a charm. It's very much a mature RPG that isn't all about elves and dwarves so it's a great change of pace from other games in the genre. Very much recommend if you like RPG's and you can handle a mature game.			"

												Vampire Bloodlines is an awesome game! Hardly anyone has heard of it because it came out the same day as Half Life 2 (so it's pretty obvious why it hasn't had much limelight) You start out by either choosing your own clan and gender, or answering a few questions and letting the game assign you a clan. After assigning stats and giving yourself a name, the game opens with a cinematic of you doing the dirty with some ♥♥♥♥♥ (or man♥♥♥♥♥) and suddenly some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s break in and stake her (or him) and you! It then cuts to you both knelt infront of a large audience of various vampire clans and groups (apparently in this, staking only paralyzes) and then your lover (♥♥♥♥♥) gets put to death for changing you into a vampire without permission, but you get set free as it wasn't your fault! Then the fun begins in a dark grissley world full of sex, violence and a wide variety of enemies. Although this IS an RPG, don't go into it expecting a world the size of Skyrim! Just expect a good game.			"

												This game is still great. Bought the physical copy when it first came out and played the game through every clan. It is just a solid game.  If you want to play it on a widescreen at higher res. a few unofficial patches are available to choose from to bring it up to date. One changes a few game-play features to balance out old issues and the other (I believe) stays vanilla. Personally use Wesp5's unofficial patch 9.0, it fixes most of the bugs and balances some of the super powers that were in the game from launch.  If you haven't played Bloodlines buy it, patch it, you will love it. Worth more but you can catch it on sale for about $5.00.			"

												One of the funnest games in my library. There's loads of options to choose from, featuring rebels and insane prophets to play as. You can also make things harder on yourself and play a Nosferatu, who can't even walk topside without terrifying the citizens. The game also has loads of dialogue options that effect how people interact with you and what quests are available. Plus both stealth lovers and gun fanatics can have fun, with both being great choices for getting most jobs done. Either way, action and stealth lovers alike are sure to have fun with this game.My only problems with it are that it can be really glitchy, so it would be best if you went and downloaded the unofficial patch, which fixes problems for newer systems while also adding new quests and weapons.

												Every time someone mentions it, someone will reinstall it.This is one of the most enjoyable games you'll ever play. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines is first person and third person action RPG based of the pen and paper RPG of the same title(Vampire the Masquerade). You play as a fledgling vampire who was spared after your sire was executed, now you have to fight the beast inside you by keeping your humanity and obey the laws of the masquerade.Story 10/10This game has amazing writing. From the get go you got yourself into some vampire politics and have a whole new world around you that you have to discover. There's not only kine and kindred (humans and human like vampires) there are also things like the sabbat, werewolves, vampire hunters, etc. The main vampire government are the Camarilla, but their are also vampire rebels known as the Anarchs. As the story progresses you'll have to pick a side. Beyond the main story there are countless side missions that often have mini stories or side stories to them.Gameplay 9/10It's got a lot of buggy issues to the game but there are several 'unofficial' patches to the game that can help. I can't compare the vanilla game with the patched version because I installed the patch before playing it. But mainly there are various mechanics to the game, from simple combat like shooting and melee attacks, disciplines which are basically spells, you have a blood bar you regenerate from drinking blood, you have a humanity bar you need to keep balanced, and finally the masquerade bar. Knowing the names of the mechanics is one thing, figuring and mastering them is another.The game is very immersive, depending on what clan you are and what you do and say to people effects how you are treated by various characters throughout the game. The game allows you to have your own play style, from sneaking around vents to going guns a blazing, and seducing or threatening people you talk to to get information. There are also the little things that make this game so amusing as well, for example I mercilessly murdered a fat guy at a diner and I heard the sounds of sirens and the police were waiting outside, I also broke into an art gallery and a mission later watched a news reporter talk about that very thing. Great stuff!Music 10/10The music is top notch! Composed by Rik Schaffer & various others, the game has many tracks to fit the mood. From ambient tracks for the streets of LA and haunted hotels to Club tracks by actual bands and slow tracks to strip clubs. I absolutely love it!Over all: 9/10VtMB is an amazing game to have. I personally found it hard to stop playing, and within two and a half days already had 25 hours of play time. Even though I make this sound like a masterpiece it does have it's negatives like the need for a patch to properly work, it gets a bit hard/confusing at times to find stuff or complete objectives, or the fact there's not enough Jeanette(play the game and you'll know what I mean ;P)! ::I almost forgot to mention this game has lots of sexual content, it almost surprised me. So if you're not into that kind of thing or just don't like it in general I would highly consider that a factor before thinking about buying this game::  But this is still something to have, especially if you're into vampires or just Action RPG's in general. So I urge you to check it out!			"

												This game is in my top 5 list of all time. I would even give this one the 1st spot. It doesn't matter what kind of genre you're into; if you want to get totaly immersed by a game then get this. The atmosphere in this one is unmatched in my opinion. The soundtrack is one of the best i've ever heard in a game and the characters and the script make the whole thing an unforgettable experience. It can be replayed many times and there are many ways that one can approach things. I actually have this one on disc but i rebought it on steam just to avoid the trouble with the CDs. Another indicator of this game's significance is the fact that, even today, 6+ years after the game's release, it is still receiving unofficial patches. Seriously,in the gaming world there are games and there are experiences. This one belongs to the latter category no doubt about it.			"

												A staggeringly brilliant game. The story is the darkest and most sophisticated you'll come across in a game, the dialogue is the best I've ever come across in a game, and the Role-Playing elements are brilliantly strong, the amount of options open to you is matched only by Deus Ex. You can clearly see the influence Deus had on Vamp's development, with every mission having several possible methods of completion. While this game is buggy, the fans are still making patches since Trokia sadly went bankrupt after completing this game. You will still experience bugs, and that is the only bad thing about this game, but if you can get past this (and you should) you will find, in my opinion one of the best games ever made. It has a dark sense of humour, and a sophisticated world. Play this game if it's the last thing you do			"

												This game, while on the glitchy side, Is likely the deepest vampire experience your going to find in a video game. It has a deep class system with 2 of said classes being very unique experiences. Highly recommend this game, but bewarned, it requires patching to work on modern systems. Luckly there is a devoted modding community to this game, that still provides excellent mods for it. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys a action rpg.			"

												One of the hardest parts of writing any good review comes from writing the review itself. Every person has their own appeal, games they like and dislike, and reasons for those likes and dislikes. Not every game a reviewer will play will conform to those likes or dislikes, and a review must still compose himself and present a fair and balanced review in spite of his personal thoughts. I bring this up because it is very difficult to talk about Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines (hereafter referred to simply as ‘Vampire') without delving into the subjective elements it presents without sucking all the emotion and personality from the review and transforming it into a technical overview of the game itself. As such, I have divided this game up into two sections, an objective and a subjective one. But first an overview of the game itself;In Vampire you play as a young person living in L.A. who has recently been transformed into one of the undead. Upon your indoctrination you quickly come to discover that the vampire society needs to be very secretive about how they act so as to keep the public unaware of their actions. Before long, though a sarcophagus which may or may not house the remains of a very ancient and very powerful vampire is uncovered and the various vampire clans in the city all begin a secret war of cloak and dagger tactics, each trying to recover the sarcophagus and its contents or deny them to others for themselves, all while trying to keep their very existence secretive from humans.Firstly, for the objective. The game is VERY well designed and it shows in its game mechanics. Serving as a action RPG with elements of The Elder Scrolls (except less open, confining the player to four primary districts that are fairly small and multiple dungeons) it is solid right from the get-go. From the beginning you are forced to select one of a series of vampire clans, each offering its own unique set of bonuses, abilities, and disadvantages that will end up shaping how you play. I, personally, ended up going with Clan Ventrue which focuses a lot on persuasion, but can't feed off of animals and can only feed reliably on upper-class humans. Someone else may end up with Nosferatu which can't raise their appearance at all and has to avoid being seen at all by humans for example.The gameplay itself is fairly solid with most of the controls being very tight and having almost no real problems beyond a few glitches (which I will cover later) which I can't blame on the controls. One of the interesting things is that, instead of leveling up stats like strength and such, the player instead levels up various skills and abilities which, in turn, affect stats. This can cause for some very interesting outcomes where a character may choose to level up a skill they don't intend to use at all to bolster another skill which they do, in fact, use and results both in a large amount of flexibility and interesting builds as well as a drive to experiment around and see what else can be done.Another interesting thing is that players do not gain experience from killing enemies in the slightest, but rather from quest completion. This puts an added drive to complete even simple sidequests as the added experience is the only way to make your character stronger.Lastly, there are two special meters that will need proper attention. The Humanity meter and the Masquerade meter. A large focus of the game is the focus on struggling against the vampire urges and keeping ones self ‘human' despite needing to drink human blood in order to survive. Certain actions can cause players to lose some of their humanity and, as the gauge lowers to 0, it can result in them becoming utterly feral. Meanwhile, keeping the humanity high can result in a weaker vampire who struggles with their new nature. Additionally, keeping ones actions as a vampire secretive is very key and, every time a player is caught being a vampire in public, it costs them on the Masquerade meter. They start with a set amount of chances and, if those chances ever all disappear, game over (going feral wastes a chance). This puts an added focus on keeping ones nature as a vampire truly secret and staying human as going feral at the wrong time on a player who didn't try to keep hidden can cause an outright loss.Visually the game is fairly solid as well. While, sadly, you won't be able to delve too deep into the many complexities of polygon count, it very successfully manages to convey the feeling of the World of Darkness (the world as a vampire sees it). Vampire does its best to drive this home too, but manages to back it up with some solid displays. While they may look a bit dated today, there is a HUGE difference between ‘dated' and ‘bad' and this is most certainly not the latter.There are some problems with the game though. First off it seems to revel in giving vague directions and not giving you anything resembling a quest-marker. While this wouldn't normally be too bad of a thing it is very easy to end up lost and unsure of where to go or who to talk too, especially if you stop playing the game for a week or more and don't remember the location of an important NPC with the lack of a map (aside from some bus-stop signs) driving the annoyance home. But, more overbearingly, is the glitches. There are a LOT in this game, and they are NOT of the minor kind. These are the kind that can destroy a game and leave it unplayable. Hunting down a patch and/or activating the command console may very well be a requirement for this game.And now for the subjective. This is a dark game. A VERY dark game to say the least. The game makes sure to reinforce this with such locations like abandoned hospitals, scummy apartment buildings, sleazy motels, brothels and night clubs galore, and death around every corner. The streets are almost never clean and are littered with trash, bums and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s seem to be the most common ‘professions', and so forth. People looking for a game about sparkling vampires, or even just ‘normal' vampires may find themselves off-put easily. This is a very dark and pessimistic game, and it ended up causing me to rethink about how to score this.To say that this is a bad game simply because it's world is so scummy and grim is shortselling what the game does right. In any other setting where you can count the number of people who are ‘good' on more than one hand this probably would have been an amazing title. However, this game does not hide for even a moment that this is a grim and depressing world. People not looking for this sort of thing specifically can very easily end up becoming disguised and/or offended by it. Even the ending of the game seems to love rubbing in just how dark this world is.As a result, I feel it is VERY important to look into the game before buying it and deciding if you wish to play a game like this. While it can be enthralling for people who revel in its darkness, for those people looking for even the tiniest ray of light and hope, they would be better off searching elsewhere.In summery: while a solid game that is mired by some technical problems, its subjective aspects and story may simply be so off-putting to a player who does not enjoy its dark and grim world as to not make this game recommendable on a whim. If you buy this game, you should know what you're getting into, because this game is in no way shy about tossing you into the shadows.My pricing: For someone looking for a dark game: 15-20 bucks. It's very solid, if a bit dated and dealing with bugs.For someone not: Avoid at all costs. Remember, this is a game where it is possible to lose because you couldn't pretend to be a human being instead of a blood-sucking monster well enough.			"

												Favourite game, and has been for a few years. Fun, quirky, clever, and the graphics really aren't that bad at all for its time. It can be extremely buggy, even game-breaking at times, but the fanmade patch usually fixes those problems. Combat is relatively simple. It's important to remember you can't be a jack of all trades. There's very limited EXP in the game (which is why I suggest playing all of the side-quests) so it's best to spec into things. The characters are cool. There's several factions you can join. Playing as different clans can prove to be a new experience (especially Malkavians, Nosferatus and Tremere, but my favourite is Gangrel as bland as it is.) I find characters like Jack and Gary to be hilarious. There's a great voice acting crew, too. Most of the voice actors sound like they put some real heart into it. Though the generic NPCs that roam around sometimes sound like they used a less-than-moderate quality microphone and didn't care. All in all, I think this game is 10/10. Just make sure you patch it before you play it or you're going to have a bad time.			"

This game is just not up to nowadays standard in gaming. Feels unfinished.The final game was a lot different from a very famous trailer.Combat feels wrong, poorly done.There are no kids, cats, dogs, birds.Character models look kinda the same.MISC:Be sure to install the Unofficial Patch (plus is optional) by Wesp5, it is a must!My score: 8/10			"

												A lightening pearl in a World of Darkness, which I had forgotten eventually for ten long years. In December 2004, I installed this game for the first time, but at that early point in time, this game was released unfinished. At the same day, i happily uninstalled it to never play it again because of the heavy load of bugs and crashes. 10 Years and a lot of unofficial patches later, in December 2014, I bought this game on Steam for 5€, installed the 9.2 patch and completed it with much joy in 43 hours, with no frustrations at all and even without having to use a single cheat. Even installed on a Windows 8.1 x64, the game did only crash twice, both times in the very beginning while configuring my character.I enjoyed every minute of it, and I will certainly play it again in the future. Who could have ever imagined this game would become such a Cult Classic? A must-have for fans of RPG, vampires or just all good PC games.			"

												Hands down the BEST ROLE playing game made to date (2013). And it was made in 2004. Also the best RPG mechanic I've ever played. Makes the systems used in various MMO's and other rpg seem massively inferior and sometimes pitiful. Highlights are: Every character (except yours) is voice acted, and done by professionals. Your dialogue choices are numerous and varied, and based off how you increase your social skills. Every character is really interesting, and all side quests are excellent. All dialogue is very well written.The main story is really good. And the choice of endings is more ""branched"" then even current rivals, although thats not saying much (Except for Witcher II which holds the crown for choices that  change the entire game and political landscape, and truly stands out in the RPG marketplace). There is plenty of music made by professionals. There are details like news reports and radio shows that progress as you progress thru the game and make mention of things you do. An if you play Malkav you are in for a bonus surprise with regard to that. The whole atmosphere is so darn immersive and well constructed.Multiple clans to play, so the game has at least a couple of repeat play thru's. By my count, minimum of three, since the Nosferatu (stealthy) are quite different, and certainly the Malkavs (totally crazy), and then there is everyone else (they follow more conventional social interaction).Make sure you check out/read up on the community mods for the latest patch (Activision does not bother to fix their own property), and also resolution fixes.

												A Classic RPG with a mature rating, a bunch of bugs, and patchs. Be sure and read the forums for this game BEFORE purchasing. I had to apply some patches before I could run the game on a Windows 7 SP 1 machine. Once the game was patched it is a joy to play. There are multiple paths through the game and a pseudo open world environment to explore. There are multiple endings based upon the players choices. Decent replayability as well.I did experience a few bugs in the game that required switching to a developers console to work around. No show stoppers, just a few nuisances.The game may not run on Windows 8 | 10 and above based upon a report from Microsoft's Upgrade Assistant. The good news is that the game will run in the WINE emulator.If you enjoy classic RPG games with multiple story lines and are not put off by the need to apply patches and work around a few bugs, then grab this game and enjoy.

This has been fix by hunderds of fan patches at the time of this review the current patch is 9.3. This is a very well written game and there are lot of different ways to play through it. The characters are all very well devolped and almost all of them are interesting. The combat is clunky and unpolished and one of the worst parts of the game. This is unfortanate as the last third of the game forces you into alot combat situations this because Troika ran out of time to give it the finish it's worthy of. As long you keep this in mind you should have alot of fun playing this game.			"

												No idea why I was so disappointed with this game back when I first played it.  Must-play game, IMO.  Especially for that brilliant dialogue missing from just about every other game ever in the whole history of video games in the world ever bar none absolutely, characters and decisions feeling impactful (even if they're not so much).  The dirty, disgusting, depraved setting is a nice change, too.Only major downside is the last quarter of the game starts feeling rushed--Chinatown, the last quest hub, is almost devoid of activities--and pushes you headlong into a series of unavoidable battles using a messy, unsatisfying combat system. Playing as a sneaky-sneaky, bat-crazy Malkavian, however, must be experienced.  Same with the haunted hotel level. x_x Spooky spooky spooky.			"

												If you haven't already, playing as a Malkavian is a must at least once. Though maybe not the first playthrough :P-You speak pretty much entirely in riddles and it's interesting that some of those subtly foreshadow what's going to happen. Lotta great dialogue options for Malks-Creepy♥♥♥♥♥whispers in the background. Scares the crap out of me on a regular basis-The TV newscaster breaks the in-game fourth wall and addresses your character directly quite a few times. Scared the crap out of me the first time-Beatles references when you speak with one of the NPCs, Skelter.-You can argue with a ♥♥♥♥ing stop signAlso, one of the endings (for all clans, not just the Malks)you can literally tell everyone to ♥♥♥♥ off because they've all been using you. I can't even say how much I loved this because it's like seriously. I'm not your errand dog.Be warned though, it's 12 years old and super buggy. Bless the lovely, wonderful community for the mods and patches or otherwise this game would probably be unplayable as Troika went out of business about a year after this came out. Actually, I believe there's even a patch you need to have to play at all.It has its issues but, damn, I love this game.9/10			"

												Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is a heavily story driven Action-RPG where there's several town hubs with whacky characters who want YOU to do their bidding. Everyone has their own ulterior motive and the deep lore that goes into the ""World of Darkness"" that this game is based on just enhances the feel and depth of this story.The combat mechanics are pretty simple, there's 2 types of weapons, melee and ranged. If you want to be a crazy monster vampire who uses his fists to beat people into dust.. You can do that. If you want to use ranged weapons by running around and shooting people up.. You can do that.  If you want to go around with a katana and slash people up.. You can do that as well. The skill and ""clan"" system helps you build your character the way you want to. There's many different clans, all of them have different skill sets, pros and cons - There's the nosferatu that need to go through sewers because of their hideous deformed bodies would alert humans of the supernatural. There's the Malkavian who keeps on hearing different voices in their heads (Although most of it seems gibberish, a lot of it is actually true and the voice can also tell you the future or hidden intends behind the people.), malkavians have completely different dialogue options and their lines can also be seen as insane and convoluted with hidden intents. The lore is just so deep in this that you can't help but get invested.This games second strong point is choice. You will have different choices on how to complete your quests, you will have choices on what you would like to do with the item, would you be OK with giving the item to the person who wants it, or can you find a third party who will offer more for it? Do you care for your own humanity and help people out just to keep your connection to the mortal life that you had. Or will you only look out for yourself, discarding the other peoples needs just to further your own agenda. There are multiple choices for everything you do, but what's great is that there's choices that aren't apparent and if you manage to find them they will usually pay off sweetly. This is a masterpiece in gamedesign. You WILL find interesting quests and items if you look around enough and you are not rewarded for going around and killing everything, but are rather ENCOURAGED to do things the way you want to.Even though this game was released in an extremely buggy state because the game developer didn't have enough money to keep working on this. The game has been fixed with several patches (Some of the game devs worked for free after getting laid off, just to fix this. Goes to show how much they actually loved this game.).. Now thanks to the huge community there's several mods, unofficial expansions, etc that completely change up this game.Before buying this game on steam I had already spent more then 100 hours in this, so I've played this for around 200 hours or so..

												I mostly love this game for the world created for it, and the stories contained within that world. Besides that, it's got memorable characters, a good soundtrack and can be funny at times, both on purpose and accidentally (keep in mind this was released in '04). Combat gets repetitive pretty quickly, so I suggest trying to kill enemies without being detected to make things a bit more intense. I also suggest to not bother with guns and stick to melee (always collect any dropped weapons though, so you can sell them later). Plenty of sidequests to keep the main narrative from getting boring, great character sheet. I recommend the hell out of this game.			"

												OK, first off, you will most likely need a patch just to run this game. Unfortunately when this game was originally released it was full of bugs & I guess Steam doesn't provide any fixes but don't worry there is a solution. Go to the forum or the website patches-scrolls and install Wesp5's patch version 8.9. This person has done amazing work to not only get this game running but provided many fixes for any in-game bugs. And it's worth the extra bit of time it takes but first off the bad stuff. The first thing you will notice are the outdated graphics but they really are not that bad and you get used to it pretty quick. The worst thing is combat. It's a bit clunky.....actually, it just plain sucks but not so bad that it's unplayable. The thing is VTMB is billed as an RPG & it not only delivers but it may be the best game ever in this aspect if you like getting immersed in an excellent story. There are rules you have to (un)live by & consequences if you don't. Decisions you make early on reflect what happens later. Basically, in a nutshell, it's an RPG that truly allows you to roleplay who you create & that's what makes this game shine.			"

Posted: March 15, 2015
												I'll give you the TL;DR right away to save you some time: BUY THIS GAME. NOW. (or wait until it's $5, either way, it's worth it)Cons:Buggy. Download the unofficial patch (link in Steam forums), it fixes most of the bugs. I recommend the basic patch on your first playthrough. There's still some bugs after the patch, but just make sure you save a lot. Fixing most bugs is as simple as restarting the game and reloading your save. I only had to do this maybe two-three times with the patch. It's probably more without it. I encountered no game-breaking bugs. I do hear of some people having a hard time getting it running as well. I've never had issues, but the solutions are out there, and the effort is worth it.Clunky Combat. This game tricks you into thinking it's going to be more like an FPS, at first. Disregard. It's fairly straightforward RPG combat via mashing the left-click (with a little more to it as you'll learn). Guns are very weird at first, and melee is a bit hard to grasp right away. I actually quit and uninstalled the game on my first character because of this. I'm very glad I gave it a second chance. Once you get used to it, it's not bad at all. You'll be a ninja in no time, I promise.Character models. This is more of a personal preference, but I think the chracters have a bit too much charicature. They're a bit cartoony as you can see by the screenshots. In spite of that, the game is actually pretty dark, gritty, and sometimes, downright scary. I often forgot all about them while playing.Animations. The animations, especially during cutscenes, are a bit funky. It's bearable, though. And that's just the body animations. The facial animations are pretty good. Great for 2004. The cloth physics are a bit wack.Map size. A pro and a con at the same time, almost. The map is split into fairly small loading zones focused around city hubs and various quest locations. If you're used to more open worlds, it might take a bit to get used to. It doesn't bother me, personally. They do a decent job at filling them with content, even if the content does get a bit thinner in the later maps (a lot of games do this).Pros:Atmosphere. The biggest seller for me in this game. Bloodlines nails it's gothic atmoshere so well, it's almost uncanny. It's horror elements are also very well executed. Not too many games can get my heart racing like this one has. One part in particular, if you don't know what you're doing, is nightmare inducing (Hint: The last screenshot might have something to do with the part I'm referring to).Story. The story is gripping and packed with intrigue. Some of the gameplay elements might get a bit repetitive (as with just about any game), but I was always driven to continue just to see events unfold. Lots of twists and turns. Everything you would want from a VtM story. Some things were a bit obvious, but everything works. There's also multiple endings depending on where you choose to put your loyalty. They ultimately lead to the same place and overall outcome, but this didn't bother me. I found that siding with myself got some of the most epic dialogue and immersion. Every step of the way, you really feel like you're being dragged deeper down into a dark underworld. And don't worry if you're not familiar with the PnP, this game does a great job introducing fledglings to the VtM universe.Characters. Memorable and well voice-acted. They drive the story along flawlessly. Not much else to say about that.Choice. Wanna skulk in the shadows, Gordon Freeman through ventilation systems, picking locks and hack computers to get through? Or do you wanna kick the door in and beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of everything with your fists? You got it. Unfortunately, the amount of choice peters off around the halfway mark. Due to Troika having their budget and their deadlines cut by Activision, much of the latter half of the game is very combat heavy. The story and characters don't falter, though. I found stealth and social-focused characters fairly difficult to play later on. In some cases, I even cheated and/or just stopped advancing with those characters. It's a bit disheartening, but it is what it is. You can still enjoy the first half thoroughly, with social or stealth. Just make your first character combat-focused to get the whole story without much of a hitch, then play around with the other stuff in subsequent playthroughs.Music. The music selection is small, but well-produced. They are also in non-propietary formats in the game files, so if you really enjoy them, you can copy them to your preferred device.Replayability. Although the game isn't terribly long, there's plenty of oppurtunity for replay. Playing different clans alters your experience, sometimes dramatically. I recommend a Brujah specializing in Celerity for an easy-mode play through. The Matrix-esque effects of a high Celerity level is pretty neat. The wacky Malkavian makes a great second character (might be hard to follow along with the dialogue for a first-timer). Nosferatu is expert mode. Along with that, the modding community is still undead and well. You can find everything from the basic bug-fixing patches like suggested above, all the way to major game alterations. I state again, I recommend only the basic unofficial patch for a fledgling to minimize bugs/incompatibility frustration.Conclusion:Although both lists have a similar number of entries, I assure you, the Pros FAR outweigh the cons. This is the perfect game to play during the Halloween season (in which it usually goes on sale as well). I can play it any time of day, myself. With CCP plopping their fat asses on the IP with no apparent interest in using it, this is the best VtM game you're going to get for a long time. In extension, I would argue that it's the best vampire game ever made, and sadly, will probably remain so.			"

												This is a great game with amazing role playing opportunities but unless you're willing to use unofficial patches and the console to get past issues, choose a different game. On a modern system, this game won't run without an unofficial patch and even then you run into hiccups. Still interested? Well, sit down because I'm going to tell you why this game is the vampire RPG you've been looking for and more.Ever craved more after Skyrim's tiny vampire section? Well, here it is, with fangs and bloodlust to match.This game puts you in the middle of an urban city environment based in 2004. You've been sired by a vampire against the Masquerade and if not for Kindred (vampires) political machinations, you'd be ash alongside your sire.Now, you are thrust into a world of politics, monsters and blood, all whilst hiding your true nature. The clan you pick has a decent factor in on this and some more than others. There are different ways to handle situations throughout most of the game and it's really just near the end where the rewarded path becomes the least successful which is quite discordant.Each situation is very different, leaving very little of that normal copy and paste side quest/main quest situation, giving you a fulfilling storyline to warm your undead heart. Mechanics have you thinking like a vampire- a game where you are the predator and sometimes, the prey don't know how close they were to their death, spared because it was too much effort. Your judgement, skills and so on will determine how you approach things.The penalties for violating the Masquerade by exposing vampiric activities to the Kine (humans) can be severe if you're not careful. Feed on anyone out in the open, use certain powers openly, amusement, even the wrong speech choice can get you in trouble. Five strikes and it's an automatic final death/game over. Humanity Loss, unfortunately with the XP you can spend to undo is a little less dire but be careless and not fix a severe deficit and suddenly you're looking at a frenzy where you literally lose control for a bit. Injury and thirst for blood can bring out the vampiric beast within. Mostly, a savvy player will sidestep these pitfalls but occasionally, you’ll find yourself desperate for blood and a crowd of unwitting humans after a hellish quest so stock up on those spare blood bags.Gameplay can get frustrating and there's no difficulty bar. My best advice to new players is don't get intimidated, and you'll make it through, even if you need to add self-advantage.I won't spoil the main game but the World of Darkness universe is an amazing playground for your vampire RPG-ing wants. You have to play it for yourself and carve out your potential eternal life, although be careful. The wrong side at the end can leave your legacy as a fate worse than death. It’s a game of consequences with logic behind decisions and outcomes based on your choices. Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines is a great vampire RPG, arguably one of the only chances you'll have to play a vampire as they were made to be and it leaves you wondering why more entries couldn't have been made. It is 'the' vampire RPG everyone wishing to sink their fangs into the night must have and the price is worth the gamble to get it running on newer computers.My final score for this game is 9.5/10 and the half point loss is for the bug that required no-clip and the fifteen reloads it took to get through to the next section for an otherwise game breaking bug. Any older game made for XP and earlier you pick up at this point will come with all kinds of issues but this game was released as an unstable beta, requiring years of caring work by Wesp5, who deserves an eternity of gratitude for getting this game to run as well as it does.

												Now this is one enjoyable RPG. I liked the gameplay, the story, the music, everything.  Sure, the graphics are really outdated, but if like me you can look past it, you'll definitely enjoy this game. An epic Lacuna Coil song plays when the credits roll, as a perfectly fitting little treat in the end :DUpdate: It's 2014 and I'm playing this game again. What can I say, I love it, with all its little flaws, which are mostly graphics related, for example characters displaying weird at times like feeding etc... trifles, trifles. To run the game I'm using the unofficial patch for Win7 64-bit along with high resolution display patch.Here's a link to get everything up and running, I had no problems whatsoever: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035To sum up, I still recommend this game for its story and atmosphere.

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.Long name, incredible game. Quite possibly the best game I have ever played. I have reached the final boss several times, but only finally got around to giving him his Final Death today. Taking around thirty hours, this is a game complete with an amazing story, interesting characters, cool powers, and the most legit vampire's I know of. The basic story begins with your 'embrace' - where you become a vampire - and continues as your rise in power and prestige, until you are causing the events, rather than reacting to them.Each of the nine clans you can choose from have different abilities. They could be considered classes, similar to other games, but they aren't usually wildly different. Most of the change is in the player models, and the powers - each clan getting two powers from a pool, and a third unique to their clan. But there are enough differences to make replaying a possibility. For example, the Nosferatu are hideous, and as such cannot seduce people for blood, and instead have to suck on rats in the sewers below the streets, while the Ventrue clan is the opposite - they cannot drink from rats due to their nobility. Another is clan Malkavian; each and every one of them is insane. Incredibly, they have 100% unique dialogue, opposed to other clans having a few lines or opportunities each, and can engage in some interesting tangents - such as having a conversation with the news reporter on TV.While the vanilla version is very buggy - due to the developers being rushed in their final stages - most of these issues can be resolves with the fan made Unofficial Patch, which is a must-get if you plan on playing. It's not the prettiest game either, with some pretty terrible animations at times, but all this is forgiveable in the face of such a wonderful experience. The game uses Valve's source engine (an earlier version of the engine Titanfall is built on), and was released on the same day as Half-Life 2; and though the models in the game are by no means of equal quality, they are attractive in their own way, and help nail the bleak, horror/noir atmosphere.If Firefly was a game, it would be this one. While the themes are not at all similar, it is the kind of game that when someone brings it up in conversation, or you read about it on the net, you pretty much have no choice but to reinstall and have another crack at it.10/10. I honestly cannot think of any way to improve it, other than give the devs more time to improve a couple of the cutscenes.tl;dr - V:TM-B is one of the best games ever. It is often on sale on Steam. buy it. Install the most recent Unofficial Patch. Enjoy the ♥♥♥♥ out of it.P.S. ♥♥♥♥ the haunted hotel. The game isn't all that scary, the hotel always gets me.			"

												Oh boy, where to begin?Vampires : The Masquarade : Bloodlines is one of those games that become classics the moment you turn them on. The closest thing I could relate it to, both in terms of gameplay and overall feeling is the first Deus Ex, as in both games you are some kind of superhuman who gets to master disciplines and powers in an RPG fashion in a game that gives you complete freedom in how to tackle the problems it throws at you (The third Deus Ex could qualify as well, but it tends to make the various intended paths obvious to you right off the bat, rather than letting you think of creative approaches yourself), and each clan (read : Character class) helps complement those playstyles.I'm not really going to say much more, because at this point, you should know whether the game interests you or not, but know this :- Steam only provides the retail version of the game, which is notoriously buggy (not just minor stuff, I'm talking about the game being outright unbeatable or just crashing all the time) because Activision insisted that the game be released the same day as Half Life 2. This version only includes the most critical fixes, like getting the game to start on computers with more than 1GB of video RAM. You definitely should download the unofficial patch (which actually includes ""official"" fixes) at this adress : http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647- As enjoyable as I found the experience, the game really begins to lose itself in the last few missions, where levels become longer, much more linear, and where non-combat builds start becoming a lot less viable. The last bosses (which one you get depends on your choices) are especially bad about this, as you probably won't leave a scratch on them unless your combat skills are at least level 8 or 9, but they go down in seconds once they are. Just keep that in mind if you're planning to go down a more non-combat route.- If you go for stealth, prepare for some set pieces to look weird., like enemies busting in through a window or blowing up a wall and then stand there doing nothing.This said, if you're a fan of RPGs, and especially if you liked the first Deus Ex, you owe yourself to play that game.

												This is quite frankly one of the best done RPG's out there. If you're a fan of the world of darkness universe I really strongly suggest getting this. My only complaint is that the game seems to prefer combat to either stealth or social manipulation, something that is a valid route in the pen and paper game. Also grab some mods for the game, it really opens it up. Finally, even when you beat it, I strongly suggest playing again as a Malkavian. It's a totally different experience.			"

												Can't beleive I haven't rated this game yet . It's one of my all time favorites.  It has vampire's, it's an RPG ,based off a pnp game, it's got action, guns and swords. What's not to love?  I'd give it a solid 96% rating.  now the bad The graphics while being competitive for today's games (it used source engine)  is looking dated also having switched to a wide screen monitor reccently I noted it has no wide screen resolution support. A bit disapointing considering many games  even older ones from 2002-3 had wide screen support. The game was released in 2004 about 4 months before half life 2 was even out, making it the first comercial game using valve's source engine (though they licensed the engine so this game was not developed by valve) This game is really worth a go for vampire and rpg fans alike.

												Fair warning: this game is incredibly buggy and you will need to install unofficial patches to get it running stably under Windows 7.The piece of advice I see given to new players most often is that you should not play as a Nosferatu or Malkavian during your first playthrough. In the former's case, you are not allowed to be seen by (let alone interact with) human NPCs, turning the game into one of stealth, and in the latter's case, you are literally insane. There is literally an entire game's worth of dialog written exclusively for Malkavian players.This speaks volumes about the game, I feel. The game can play COMPLETELY different depending on your character and the style of play you choose. Because exp is awarded for completing missions, so it doesn't matter whether you progress through persuasion, stealth, or bashing someone's head in. Nobody plays this game just once.tl;dr it's deus ex with vampires			"

												This is one of the best RPGs ever developed. Seriously just buy it, it's worth the full price. The quality of writing is above and beyond the vast majority of RPGs out there. Most quests are open-ended and have multiple ways to finish them and each of the 7 vampire clans change the way the game is played, giving it a lot of replay value. This game is as good and possibly even better than games like Morrowind and Fallout 2. It was the first game to be developed using the source engine and because of that it holds up well graphically although there are many mods out there that both add content and tweak up the the visuals. This game went unnoticed when it was released, despite recieving a lot of praise and it does deserve all of that praise. This is seriously one of the best RPGs and games ever developed. Stop reading this and just buy it now.Note: It does not work out of the box with Windows 7 or Vista, read my comment below to get it to work.			"

												Nice RPG. Set in a very gothic/punk atmoshpere, so if you're not into that, you may get bored. But the progression and multiple ways one can do things are always cool additions.  Please note that, while this game is listed as a first person RPG (which it is for the most part), it is NOT first person for melee combat. It is first person for shooting, conversation, exploration, but not melee combat. This does not take away from the experience in my opinion, though.			"

It also has some fantastic level design, especially at the Oceanside Hotel. It's slightly buggy, so make sure Google around and make sure you get the latest unofficial patch before playing.			"

												You can have an arguement with a stop sign, make peoples blood boil, wear sexy outfits, and dance in clubs this game has almost everything!. Being almost 10 years old (I think), this game really shows its age with outdated graphics, and very buggy gameplay but with a installation of the Unnoficial patcher and some High res mods this game is very enjoyable. You choose one of six Vampire types and then are plunged into the nightlife of a Vampire, however this does not mean that you can go around draining each human like a certain celebrity that i won't name names with free will, you are monitored by the Masquerade. If you reveal your true nature to humans you will be hunted down by vampire hunters and killed, so you have to make sure to only use your powers on enemies in the combat zones or to be careful using your powers in public.

												This is one of those underated games. Even if you don't like fantasy stuff or vampires, this is one game you're going to love especially if you're into First Person Shooters with RPG featutes. Anyone who is into games like Fallout or Skyrim will like this unknown gem. You play as a vampire who was recently turned and a result must learn the ways of the vampire. This isn't your regular vampire game. You must blend in as a human and learn skills that benefit you throughout the game. You gotta learn to hack computers and break into locks along with supernatural abilities like blowing up people by boiling up their blood. Not only is the gameplay fun as hell, but the storyline is actually pretty interesting. Learn about different sects of vampires and choose who to side with. Be wise, as some choices are harder to keep than others.			"

												It took me years to finally get this game, and when I finally did, I ended up playing it 5x trhough. I've never had so much fun from an outdated game as I had with Bloodlines. I was a huge fan of the game, and with all of the stats that were available, I doubted that they would be able to pull off any balance of abilities that would make the at all interesting, but they pull it off here. Not only are the stats well balanced, but the creators even went so far as to make each clan unique. If you ever do decide to play this game, just know that the Malkavians are unbelievably fun to play. They're the insane clan and their storyline is by far the most interesting. My recommendation is to at least play the game twice. Once with any clan, the second with the Malkavians. Or you can be like me, and just play all the clans. The game, and storyline is just that much fun to go through. "

												A fantstic RPG dragged down by a few flaws which are completely fixed by the unofficial patch. This is what RPGs should be. Never mind my play time as I have owned it before my Steam copy and the unofficial patch stops counting your game time. I have gottens hundreds of hours out of this game and still plan on getting hundreds more. Pros:+Beautiful dark modern fantasy world with vampires, werewolves, rock golems, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s+You would be suprised at just how much freedom this game gave players for its time+The Voice acting is nothing short of phenominal+Controls very well+Hours upon Hours of game timeCons:-Combat is lackluster, nothing like, say Morrowind Combat but it could have been better-The second half of the game does get a bit more combat focused- Can't get Jeanette to repeat her introduction speech :( - Never ever getting a sequel :(All in all, if you're not familiar with this game you're in for a treat.If you are well then you know exactly what you're in for so try the newest unofficial patch, it's a great one.

Positive:Great atmosphere via detailed environments, soundtrack and characters.Plenty of fun quests and like all great RPGs, no busywork padding. The focus is on characters and the storyline.Characters can be built around several different playstyles, including sneaking, charisma, melee/ranged combat, etc. The quests incorporate these different choices nicelyGreat voice acting for the most partNegative:No cosmetic character customization like hairstyles or facial features, you only chose gender and clan.The game is a buggy mess out of the box, luckily there's an actively maintained unofficial patch.Combat is a bit clunky, nevertheless fun though.

												It's like skyrim but with vampiresIn all seriousness however this game's greatest strength is it's dialouge and sense of a hidden vampire society. I love the side quests which at times feel more thoguht out than the main quests, the ocean house hotel might be a great feat in game design that not many have noticed. however with all the praise I must however point out the lackiluster melee combat, and late game story missions. I'd recomend this game if you want a game in which you feel like you are part of something massive, and with great story, characters, and dialouge. but I'd skip this one if you are in it for the combat.

												Before anything, know that you will need an unofficial patch to run this game. I cannot tell you how much of a headache it was not knowing this. After you get past that issue, this game is a must-have.It is a gem of an RPG with tons of replay-ability because almost everything has multiple options you can take in different playthroughs. Most quests have this open ended sort of nature. There is no super protective hand holding here. You are given a goal and that is pretty much it. You can solve every problem in whatever way that you fit. Every type of person is welcome, from the sneaky sneaks to the testosterone fueled run & gunner. Sometimes quests may come with some parameters the quest giver wants. These are mostly optional but you will be penalized (EX: being told to go sneaky but going guns blazing = a scolding)The gameplay is also solid and gives you options as well. Are you a fan of 3rd person melee combat? We got you covered! You a fan of FPS shooting mechanics? We also got you covered too.One of the oddest things that I really enjoyed and respect the most from this game is in character creation. When you start, you get to pick a vampire clan to belong to. Certain clans have certain quirks to being them. For most, it is just minor changes in dialog where people would reference it. The 2 clans that are exceptions to this are the Malkavians and the Nosferatus. Malkavians are usually pretty insightful but it is lodged in crazy while the Nosferatus are so deformed that they should never be seen by humans. So what did the devs do? Malkavian players hear whispers in their ear and are given really insane dialog options for everything that can range from gibberish to cryptic hints for both. Nosferatu characters have negative affects to being seen and must get around using the sewers. This really gives character creation some weight even if it is really these 2 classes that are really affected.There is a bit of a learning curve because not much is explained about your stats for you so you may make a few mistakes early on and, at least for me, there was some issues with direction and finding quests. And if you’re one of those people who prefer graphics over gameplay for some reason, this game isn’t for you. All and all, great game and worth playing through at least once if you don’t get hooked.

												Such a good game! True its dated, true it needs a patch ( which can be gotten here http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647/61625/61626/download ) and yes even then some people still have issues running the game on newer systems. But is it worth it. White Wolf has always been one of my favorites when it comes to table top games, and when they made the first Vampire video game ( Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption released in 2000 for PC ) I played it for ages. Also played the 2 games they released for the xbox for Hunter : The Reckoning. What im trying to say here is I'm a big White Wolf fan so my opinion my be slightly biased. Ether away, the game is great in my opinion. Great story telling, awesome dark atmosphere, and great RPG elements. The combat system is a little clunky but they maybe just due to the fact that in game im still a flegling (new vampire) and still working on my skills. In the end if you are a vampire fan at all, or just a fan of dark evil worlds this game is well worth the money.			"

Great music, interesting plot with actual choices, the game has about 6 endings plus the combat is challenging but doesn't make you want to punch a wall in frustration.  I find trueblood etc. really corny, but this game is so good it might change your mind about vampire sterotypes.			"

												After playing this game once as a kid, then trying for the life of me to remember it, I finally found it on Steam and was able to revel in it's glory. The ability to play as so many different types of vampire gives the game an entire different feel with every playthrough. The Malkavian sillyness for a comedic playthrough, the Nosferatu stealthy subterfuge playthrough, or the high-end Toreador ritsy playthrough. You get to see the nuances of each end of the vampire clans. I honestly think this is one of the most underrated games I have ever played, and if you enjoy the FPS RPG type games like any Elder Scrolls game or Fallout game, you would enjoy this game. And if you pick it up and play through it with more than one clan of vampire, and still don't like it, I'll send you a personal apology message.			"

												Before anything, know that you will need an unofficial patch to run this game. I cannot tell you how much of a headache it was not knowing this. After you get past that issue, this game is a must-have.It is a gem of an RPG with tons of replay-ability because almost everything has multiple options you can take in different playthroughs. Most quests have this open ended sort of nature. There is no super protective hand holding here. You are given a goal and that is pretty much it. You can solve every problem in whatever way that you fit. Every type of person is welcome, from the sneaky sneaks to the testosterone fueled run & gunner. Sometimes quests may come with some parameters the quest giver wants. These are mostly optional but you will be penalized (EX: being told to go sneaky but going guns blazing = a scolding)The gameplay is also solid and gives you options as well. Are you a fan of 3rd person melee combat? We got you covered! You a fan of FPS shooting mechanics? We also got you covered too.One of the oddest things that I really enjoyed and respect the most from this game is in character creation. When you start, you get to pick a vampire clan to belong to. Certain clans have certain quirks to being them. For most, it is just minor changes in dialog where people would reference it. The 2 clans that are exceptions to this are the Malkavians and the Nosferatus. Malkavians are usually pretty insightful but it is lodged in crazy while the Nosferatus are so deformed that they should never be seen by humans. So what did the devs do? Malkavian players hear whispers in their ear and are given really insane dialog options for everything that can range from gibberish to cryptic hints for both. Nosferatu characters have negative affects to being seen and must get around using the sewers. This really gives character creation some weight even if it is really these 2 classes that are really affected.There is a bit of a learning curve because not much is explained about your stats for you so you may make a few mistakes early on and, at least for me, there was some issues with direction and finding quests. And if you’re one of those people who prefer graphics over gameplay for some reason, this game isn’t for you. All and all, great game and worth playing through at least once if you don’t get hooked.

												Remember when vampires weren't some glittering fairies? VtM:B remember!But seriously, the game is one of the most brilliant RPGs I ever played. So what makes VtM:B so great? Foremost, the gripping plot with twist and turns; secondly, a very balanced (IMHO) grinding-free RPG system; thirdly, the fact that every vampire clan has its unique features and abilities, which means replayability (and lots of it) and last, but not least, the gothic/noirish atmosphere of the setting.

												First/third person perspective of the early unlife of a Vampire in the World of White Wolf (mostly).Despite the need for a patch (yes, you want to do that), and the game being so old, the game is still an amazing simulator for making your way as a Neonate (newborn) Vamp.If you have the time to spend, you can immerse yourself -- even lose yourself -- for hours at a time in a world of moral grays and blood-feasting ways.

												A true classic VtM Bloodlines is amazing as both an adaptaion of its source material and as a game in its own right. An rpg with so much choice, which lends itself to replaying, you'll easily be sucked into it's mysterious plot. Well worth the buy.			"

												Really, I don't see the need even to review: the game speaks for itself even all these years later. As I write this VTMB is 13 years old and yet it has stood the test of time as being one of the greatest games ever, the sort of a game whose mere mention on a forum can convince *someone* to reinstall it. It's a damn shame Troika went under, CCP cancelled the MMO, and that it was overshadowed by HL2 as they both used the same engine and wanted Half Life out earlier (frankly idgaf about GabeN releasing HL3 or not but if only a new World of Darkness game...) But, then again, Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines could just be fated to be one of those games where no studio is ever going to own up to the original. To me, it is like the StarCraft of modern RPGs, where no matter how hard they try all the new material would just be crappy DLCs and an underwhelming experience lacking the true love that went into the first.The good:Painstakingly recreated the original gothic-punk noir atmosphere with the right balance of humor and in-jokes (much akin to the original Fallout games and why Fallout 3 is ridiculed by old fans) and perfect atmosphere. For anyone who's ever been a fan of what White Wolf made with PnP and their novels/source materials, this is great, and serves as an excellent primer and introduction for those that haven't. The soundtrack is awesome. Also very well done for helping set the tone of the whole game.Mood in general is very grimdark in the tragic sense--you get less the feel of ""whoa superpowers"" and more the grinding tragedy where existentialism may well be the less angsty and horrid option than the ancient being(s) being very plausibly real, with you as ultimately a set piece no matter how bad you think you are (often literally).The storytelling and character interactions. Just superb writing.Replayability: almost every single person to play this game has gone through at least twice, three times being the average. The replay value is possibly the best I've ever seen for a game that actually follows a semi-linear story. Different clans, dialogue options, and playstyles, with the option of multiple endings means you're likely to only see at most 2/3 of the game on your first play through no matter what you do--and that's just the storyline(s). In terms of disciplines (abilities and spells) and various playstyles, one playthrough is probably 1/4 the content. Make sure Malkavians are one of your runs.The Bad:Certain stats are all but useless and things don't translate as well from the PnP. Most common example is loss of humanity, which doesn't affect a whole lot in the game and is fairly easy to replenish which is not like the original content at all. Still, what is lost in translation is probably unnoticeable to anyone not familiar with the setting. The only noticeable parts are things like Seduction which is an almost entirely useless stat.The combat system. It's not actually as horrible as I thought at first especially compared to KoTOR, but it's still pretty bad, although use of firearms is decent enough and for its time isn't really that bad. Besides, if you're looking for a hack and slash this game isn't for you. The main reason is due toBugs. The game wasn't polished at release so needs a patch. My very first run through had a Kuei Jin stuck in mid air as I slashed him helplessly. Most bugs have been fixed otherwise.Lastly it has had a fairly dedicated community including people from the actual project still working on it after release just out of dedication and love for the game, which in its own right should tell you something.10/10 will probably play again after 3 solid runs			"

												The game itself is dated, from the older style rpg/action style gameplay and advancement.  However I was drawn to it over the years through numerous praise from word of mouth of people I had known who played it.  Once I had the chance to play it for myself I was drawn in.  Literally lost myself in the game and what I could do in the world, when I finally realised it was all connected to some of my favorite P&P worlds of darkness I simply fell in love.  Truly, I recomment this game.  I only ask that once you are done find a nice place to hide because there is no sequel to date or plans that I could find.  Have fun!			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines consumed my life for about a week, I was so infatuated with nearly everything about this game that I could easily play for six or more hours, day after day, until I reached the end. Perhaps the most amazing thing about it is that it managed to portray Vampires as cool and powerful, but also genuinely interesting. The characters are wonderfully intriguing and unique and the story managed to draw me in big time while at the same time leaving me guessing as to what's going to happen next, right until the very end. Even though this is undeniably a very rough game with lots of technical problems, at its core it's an extremely engaging RPG that leaves you a lot of room to experience the story any way you like. I'd even go as far as saying this is the RPG companies like Bioware wish they could make and in a way it still is a, for the most part, unsurpassed genre-classic.A must-play for anyone interested in RPGs. (By the way: Playing with an unofficial fan patch (like wesp5's patch) is STRONGLY recommended as it fixes a ton of technical problems.)			"

												You can have an arguement with a stop sign, make peoples blood boil, wear sexy outfits, and dance in clubs this game has almost everything!. Being almost 10 years old (I think), this game really shows its age with outdated graphics, and very buggy gameplay but with a installation of the Unnoficial patcher and some High res mods this game is very enjoyable. You choose one of six Vampire types and then are plunged into the nightlife of a Vampire, however this does not mean that you can go around draining each human like a certain celebrity that i won't name names with free will, you are monitored by the Masquerade. If you reveal your true nature to humans you will be hunted down by vampire hunters and killed, so you have to make sure to only use your powers on enemies in the combat zones or to be careful using your powers in public.

												I'd like to preface by saying this is the review of the game with the latest unofficial patch by wesp. My applause to wesp.I'm about to be honest and give this great game a hard review. No doubt that this game is quite unique in what it offers, a traditional RPG experience in a dark themed vampire world. The best part of it hands down is the story and the immersive atmosphere of the game. The story and the text is so deep and extensive that you lose yourself just talking to so many characters and getting insight into their stories and background information of the latest happenings.I have a few issues with it so here comes the tough love;1. It is unplayable without the patch2. Even with the patch it has its share of buggy moments3. Combat :(Oh dear. This is what stopped this game from being the my top 5 RPG games of all time; RPG being my favourite genre of games. It really kills the immersion and knocks down a potentially near perfect game (for its time). The combat is just so wonky and I wouldn't take issue with this if the game was a lot more focused on interaction in the world, solving mysteries and story driven. However a decent chunk of the mission design is combat based and its painfully bad to the point where I just took every shortcut and option possible to avoid it, including console commands later in the game because I hated the combat so much. I could go into more detail, but I'll leave it at that.4. Furthermore the game is a little clunky in places as you go through it and I've had a few times where the game just freezes.5. I also had to do additional tweaking of the game just to prevent motion sickness by adjusting FOV, resolution and playing 3rd person often when I felt a little sick (despite FOV fix)6.

												The strongest points of this RPG are without any doubt it's fantastically dark atmosphere and the charm of the NPC's. By using the Source facial animation the developers have surpassed themselves by providing lively expressions for each meaningful characters, an extra surplus being the great voice acting. What characters say is impressive too, you're gonna laugh with guys like Jack or Fat Larry or you just feel that a person is trying to win you over (what doesn't necessarily needs to be done with speech, Jeanette's and VV's 'attributes' on their own may be enough ... for some of you). Rest assured that these dialogues will keep you busy for a long time without getting boring. The people on the streets and in buildings aren't worked extensively and usually don't do much more than just walking around, you can't even talk with them. They're just dumb, moving bags of blood.

												37 hours. 37 hours that I played this game without much sleep at all. Am I becoming a vampire?Damn, I didn't even do all of the sidequests. I have to go back.This is one of the best RPG's I ever played, and I hate RPG's. Vampires without bling-bling, why is this not a thing anymore? The soundtrack is just amazing. There are glitches here and there, but they are fun. Nothing about being in the midst of a boss battle, very close to dying and having the boss being stuck on the floor. Come and get it!I saw the dancing werewolf. Got rid of that annoying turnstyle. Who's that taxi driver? Am I holding the phone or am I not?The unofficial community patch is highly recommended. It adds the library mission, which is fun. And much more content the original dev's didn't have time to add - for example, whole new characters and voiceovers.I will play this again and try to do all the sidequests. There are easily 50 hours of gameplay in here, totally worth the price.			"

												There are no words for this RPG, mostly because it's so awe-inspiring even in its imperfection that I can't imagine how it would have been had Troika had ample time, resources and manhours to develop their vision fully. This is one of the adaptations truest to the World of Darkness lore, and all around one of the greatest PC RPGs to ever come out pretty much. Everything, from the visual design, music, quest lines, story, to the fantastically deep character trait customization, disciplines, mission variety, presence of genuinely great NPCs and some stellar voice acting comes together to form a shining star, shrouded by a layer of fog in some parts. Get the latest Unofficial patch and play this, because there is still no game like it to this day.			"

												One of the best games ever made.Good/neutral/evil, stealth, magic (""disiplines""), guns, melee, hand to hand, exploration, different endings and lots and lots of multiple choice, very well-voiced conversations (Fallout 4's female PC for example) make this a true gem of a shooter RPG.The game still holds up today easily. Use the patch (not plus, at least not on first (few) playthroughs) and enjoy 1920x1080, where the only slight minus are the 10 year old graphics (see screens on store page). Choose FPS or third, or alternate instantly as you like. It It has truly incredible replay value, as there are multiple ways of building a character AND seven different ""classes"" (different types of vampire). XP are not given for kills, but for resolving situations (killing everything that moves is one way of resolving pretty much any situation though, but frequently not the only way). Get it! You won't regret it for a second!(BTW I own the original CDs and have finished the game as every character, most more than once, except the Nosferatu. I bought the Steam version recently simply for convienience, so I have many many many more hours in the game than shown here.)			"

												This is one of those underated games. Even if you don't like fantasy stuff or vampires, this is one game you're going to love especially if you're into First Person Shooters with RPG featutes. Anyone who is into games like Fallout or Skyrim will like this unknown gem. You play as a vampire who was recently turned and a result must learn the ways of the vampire. This isn't your regular vampire game. You must blend in as a human and learn skills that benefit you throughout the game. You gotta learn to hack computers and break into locks along with supernatural abilities like blowing up people by boiling up their blood. Not only is the gameplay fun as hell, but the storyline is actually pretty interesting. Learn about different sects of vampires and choose who to side with. Be wise, as some choices are harder to keep than others.			"

												It took me years to finally get this game, and when I finally did, I ended up playing it 5x trhough. I've never had so much fun from an outdated game as I had with Bloodlines. I was a huge fan of the game, and with all of the stats that were available, I doubted that they would be able to pull off any balance of abilities that would make the at all interesting, but they pull it off here. Not only are the stats well balanced, but the creators even went so far as to make each clan unique. If you ever do decide to play this game, just know that the Malkavians are unbelievably fun to play. They're the insane clan and their storyline is by far the most interesting. My recommendation is to at least play the game twice. Once with any clan, the second with the Malkavians. Or you can be like me, and just play all the clans. The game, and storyline is just that much fun to go through. "

Im pretty critical when it comes to games so if your looking for a game that will keep you busy for days and still keep you entertained this is one you should check out.			"

												Vampire the Masquerade, though an old game, is a pretty good game for its time. The story is gripping and exciting, causing me to have some sleeplees nights trying to complete the many missions in the game. It also involves a world filled with werewolves, humans and demons living together in a delicate balance of survival and peace.The story goes like this. When you were bitten by a vampire. you became one. A clan leader took you under his arm and ordered you to perform many missions. Without giving away too much of the story, you will eventually come across three main factions, each with its own ideals and belief. Your decisions in the game will eventually lead to an outcome favourable to one of the faction.The controls are average. The first 10 hours was great. However, at the later stages, the game becomes repetitive as you travel to and fro from your apartment just because of the 'emails'. You will also encounter some bugs but these can be solved by reloading the game. The graphics are really dated but viewable.Game satisfaction is 76%.			"

												If you like Deus Ex and Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR), you're gonna love Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines (VtM:B). The thing it shares with those games are great dialogue and voice acting (VtM:B has the best I've ever heard), great and long story as well as several ways of completing a quest. Like KotOR you have different classes, called clans here, but VtM:B offers seven clans, some more different than others. Each clan have three Disciplines (supernatural powers) and there are also a variety of melee and ranged weapons. Like Deus Ex, you can sneak your way through a lot of the game and hack computers and pick locks.  It was a diamond in the rough when it came, but thanks to years of unofficial patches, it's finally what it was meant to be. I'd recommend the latest unofficial patch, currently  v. 8.4, but mods that run on earlier versions of the patch are great as well.Apart from the lengthy singleplayer story (no multiplayer), it has strong mod support and there are even new mods in the making after all this time. I can't express enough how much I love this game and everything about it.There is another VtM game called Redemption, from 2000, which is set in the same world, but it is more of a Diablo-like RPG. It's cheap at GoG and I highly recommend it, but it's quite different from Bloodlines.			"

												An underrated FPS/Third Person Hybrid Action RPG game like this are not to be missed. Sure, it's not for everyone, but if you love vampires and the Old World of Darkness universe from White Wolf. Get the game today and you'll learn about this wonderful underrated gem for it's unique depth and setting. This game is and still does supress most modern games out there for it's immersive storyline, plot, voice acting, and believable unforgettable characters. In fact, VtMB is one example that voice acting is very important for games as well as design. It's well worth it! Just make sure you download the latest Unofficial Patch and try out some mods to alter the gameplay and mechanics if you played game so many times. This game never gets old like a great classic attraction from Disneyland. Even though it is not for Disneyland! I've been playing since early 2007! I bought this underrated game on Amazon when it was pretty cheap in phyiscal form. The boxed retail version includeds a manual, 3 PC-CD discs, and a free soundtrack from a Best Buy preorder. I still have my physical copy!			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. I have played it so many times as every possible character with every possible ending. It is critical that you use the patches that can be found online. I have not had any issues with it after patching. I have also played a lot of the fan add ons and didn't like most of them. I have yet to play another game that made me feel the way this one does. And, if you come from any goth or industrial subculture backgrounds of the 90s and early 2000s, you will appreciate some of the music and references.			"

												The world Troika built is fantastic, and absolutely oozing with the kind of atmosphere you want in a Vampire RPG. At one point in the game, you'll appear in a room in Santa Monica. I personally sat there for like an hour just listening to the news on the tv, and then listening to Deb of Night on the radio. it's the kind of thing that really brings the game to life. I tuned in every so often to check if there were any new stories. There's also a lot of really memorable characters in Vampire: The Masquerade. All of whom are wonderful to meet, good, evil, or in between. I really liked the setting as well, the game world you get to explore has a really interesting aesthetic that channels gothic horror. From Santa Monica to Chinatown, all the locations have a wonderful look to them. Some with a run-down 80s aesthetic to them that reminds me of The Terminator (1984) and Escape From New York. The asian locations feel like something out of a John Woo movie. They're all great. A lot of the businesses and buildings have really interesting or funny names too, that I just love. The OST is mainly different genres of rock, and is pretty cool, I definetly enjoyed it as well. That's not to say that it is without problems though. While the characters are all mostly well written, and well voiced, a lot of the voices seem to suffer from some audio issues, like some characters randomly talking way too quietly, or sometimes seeming to be talking into a tin can. The character progression isn't stellar either. You only gain experience from completing quests and objectives, and instead of levels, you directly use experience to purchase points in various skills and abilities. Which doesn't sound all that bad, but you don't get to use a skill point that often, and most the changes are negligible. Another thing annoyed me was doors. Walking through doors is a pain. You have to wait for the door to open completely, and it opens very slowly. If you try to go through while it's opening, you'll get stuck in the door way. The combat in this game is action based, and isn't that good either. In fact you'll probably try to avoid it in your playthrough using stealth and the social mechanics. This game is very bittersweet, on one hand the setting is really amazing, and the characters and places in this game are lovely. On the other, Troika being forced to publish the game before it was finished makes it suffer from bugs that make it unplayable (Unless you have Wesp5's Unofficial Patch), and lack of content. It seems like the city zones could have potentially been bigger and better, if Troika had enough time. As they are, they're still great, but in the back of your mind you won't be able to help thinking what could have been, with more npcs wandering about, more places to visit, and more to do. Do I recommend this game? Yes. Even with all its problems, I'd still say that it is an absolute classic and there isn't really another game like it.			"

												Easily the finest RPG ever made.You will hardly find a game with such a marvelous blend of atmosphere and strong storytelling. Every character all have a spark to them even the annoying ones and the vampire politic going on that fuel the plot is quite intense and really interesting. Also the good voice acting really help to further bonify Bloodlines' strong qualities.Also, Bloodlines is a time caspsule. By this I mean that it was made in the mid 2000 and it feels mid 2000. All thanks to the music and the tone. You know when video game had to be dark and edgy to be taken seriously. Also remenber those Evanescence-like metal band that played everywhere? Yup, mid 2000.Really just go for it if ""amazing CRPG"" is what you are in the mood for.			"

												VTMB is by far one of the greatest rpg's ever made. I have replayed it so many times and I still am not tired of it yet. Santa Monica through Hollywood are my favorite parts of the game. I think that it was such a terrible trajedy that this game was so rushed and they weren't able to fully finish it and give it the full potential. With the unnoficial patch, this fixes many of the bugs and restores cut or rushed content. I would also reccomend the clan quest mod, which is phenominal in of itself. I am a huge rpg fan, but I despise what games have turned into. ""Rpg's"" today have become nothing more than dull writing, ""go here, kill, come back"" with no depth, choices, moral dilemas, different routes of doing something, etc. These are what make an rpg good in my opinion. VTMB shines in these areas. The writing is superb and at many times hilarious. The atmosphere is dark and gothic, and makes me quite nostalgic. There are actual moral dilemas, choices, and depth. This very may well be the last of it's kind, and I will play this game possibly to my final days. This masterpiece is the last remenent of what true rpgs and good games are. I recommend this to anyone that enjoys games that I have described. Just make sure to get the latest version of the unnoficial patch for bug fixes and restored content. I think it's so amazing that people are still keeping this game alive even to this day.			"

												It took me years to finally get this game, and when I finally did, I ended up playing it 5x trhough. I've never had so much fun from an outdated game as I had with Bloodlines. I was a huge fan of the game, and with all of the stats that were available, I doubted that they would be able to pull off any balance of abilities that would make the at all interesting, but they pull it off here. Not only are the stats well balanced, but the creators even went so far as to make each clan unique. If you ever do decide to play this game, just know that the Malkavians are unbelievably fun to play. They're the insane clan and their storyline is by far the most interesting. My recommendation is to at least play the game twice. Once with any clan, the second with the Malkavians. Or you can be like me, and just play all the clans. The game, and storyline is just that much fun to go through. "

												A true cult classic. This game, though doubtlessly flawed, manages to accomplish creating an atmosphere of such high quality that few other games come close to equalling it. The immersion is top notch, as the game builds a believable and haunting environment. L.A. serves as a thin curtain veiling some of the most disturbing and macabre locations and mysteries that I've ever seen in a video game; sub-plots contain anything from plague-spreading cults to cursed snuff tapes, and all of the stories the player partakes in are memorable and unique. Players have a plethora of choices on how they will accomplish their goals (for the most part; some of the end-game content is poorly designed in this regard, likely due to the numerous development issues that Troika underwent), and player input is respected greatly. This game, like the original Deus Ex, involves its players in its world in meaningful ways (as proper RPGs are meant to, in my opinion).If you are looking for a game with a deep narrative and an intriguing world, then look no further. For all its flaws (combat and bugs, primarily), Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines accomplishes things that are rarely realized this well in the gaming industry. Troika created a masterpiece, and despite some hickups, it is absolutely worth playing.			"

Click the Advanced Options button.Click the Maximum Memory box so that you can input a number, then type in 2000.Keep in mind, this may make other games and applications more difficult to run. It'll also require a system restart, so save anything you're working on before you do it.Have fun, feed well.			"

												This is one of my all time favorite games.  To me, it is one of the best action RPG's made.  The setting and music are great.  It's worth it just for the sound track.  The mechanics for advancing your character are simple, but require thought.  I love that you can play this game almost any way you want: as a shooter, a melee hack and slash, as a dialog adventure, as a stealth assassin...  As vampire lores go, White Wolf's lore is one of the best along with all the other World of Darkness lore hinted at in the game.  Somebody should license the IP from CCP to make a huge, big budget single player sequel to this game.  If you like vampires and ARPG's, this is it.			"

												A true cult classic. This game, though doubtlessly flawed, manages to accomplish creating an atmosphere of such high quality that few other games come close to equalling it. The immersion is top notch, as the game builds a believable and haunting environment. L.A. serves as a thin curtain veiling some of the most disturbing and macabre locations and mysteries that I've ever seen in a video game; sub-plots contain anything from plague-spreading cults to cursed snuff tapes, and all of the stories the player partakes in are memorable and unique. Players have a plethora of choices on how they will accomplish their goals (for the most part; some of the end-game content is poorly designed in this regard, likely due to the numerous development issues that Troika underwent), and player input is respected greatly. This game, like the original Deus Ex, involves its players in its world in meaningful ways (as proper RPGs are meant to, in my opinion).If you are looking for a game with a deep narrative and an intriguing world, then look no further. For all its flaws (combat and bugs, primarily), Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines accomplishes things that are rarely realized this well in the gaming industry. Troika created a masterpiece, and despite some hickups, it is absolutely worth playing.			"

												Awesome dark RPG about vampire society but almost unplayable in vanilla. If you want to fully enjoy this game I recommend using unofficial patch (latest at this time is 9.0(!) ) Has good skill-based combat (even though its firearm and melee aspects are clunky as hell), deep dialogues, distinct classes, fleshed out characters and good story. Also, good replay value.			"

												Bloodlines did a great job of capturing the dark, off-putting atmosphere inherent to the World of Darkness. It goes from humorous, but unstable characters to supernaturally unnerving very well and is a generally enjoyable experience. Unsurprising since its based off a pen-and-paper RPG, but the roleplaying experience is very fulfilling and your characters will develop as you see fit.However, there are a couple noticeable problems with the game. The melee combat is a little wonky and a little difficult to control to the degree one desires. There are a couple of ""filler"" points in the game where a level extends further than necessary for atmosphere and story-telling purposes. And without patches, the game is unstable.But despite these flaws, the game is definitely worth picking up and playing if you like the World of Darkness, pen-and-paper RPG games, or just like an appropriately dark take on vampire legend.

												""Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines"" is easily one of the best RPGs I have ever played. I bought it originally in 2004 when it came out, but bought it now on Steam just to have another copy. It's that good. I seriously cannot do enough to recommend it to anybody who has even the most microscopic interest in RPGs. If you like vampires and White Wolf franchises in the World of Darkness, it's an absolute must-buy.If you do buy it, however, you should be prepared to download the official 1.2 patch, or the famous Unofficial Patch by Wesp5. The game does have a few bugs, but either of those patches will solve them. Combat is also a little repetitive, but challenging for all the Clans; it's a mix of point-and-shoot and slice-and-dice melee. However, the game truly shines in its application of the setting and characters, all of which are representative of the World of Darkness, the larger world setting in which vampires, ghosts, werewolves, and all the nightmares of humankind are made real.

												This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I've played it a year ago for the first time so you can believe me when I say it's not nostalgia talking. I am a huge vampire fan and for my entire life I've waited for a game like this, not knowing it was right under my nose the entire time. It is totally worth the full price, and it gets %75 on every sale so there's literally no reason not to buy this.Pros:A great story, accompanied by characters you'll love or love to hatePretty dark  world that feels gothic, even though it's just Santa Monica at nightAged well, graphics would not bother you at all if you're not obsessd with next gen stuff etcGameplay is pretty nice and gives you lots of different options about how to play. You can even finish lots of quests with speechcraft. Adds replayability to the gameIt is pretty realistic, you can't go around butchering people like there's no tomorrow since you'll lose humanity and succumb into the beast, if you try to play like not drinking any blood you'll die. You can even role play and drink the blood of animals/blood packs.Cons:With some builds you can't go too far in the game. Like if you only skilled bloodmagic as your combat choice you can't get passed the sewer episode since creatures there won't give you any blood.Even though the story was great, the ending kinda felt rushed.Game needs to be patched manually before it can be played(not exactly a con, just wanted to point it out)So long story short, BUY THE ♥♥♥♥ING GAME YOU WON'T REGRET IT			"

												Where to even begin...First off, this game is incredibly unique. This is the ultimate role-playing experience. I am 100% serious! There are SO many ways you can play this game and you could even ignore half the quests people offer you and still finish the game. It's never really finished though. I gaurantee you will be back, creating a new character, going through again and again. Long story short: It's addicting.And for a damn good reason too. Your choice actually shapes and affects the game. A lot. There aren't many games that give you any where near as much freedom and options as this game does. And if you sell your soul to the devil in real life in order to gain the ability to actually be bored by this game, you're in luck. The community for this game is incredibly strong and there are tons of mods and additions that you can install for this game. So even if you manage to get bored with what you buy (doubt it, you liar), you can tap on more content for freeeee. THIS GAME IS WORTH IT. Did I mention you should buy it? Because you should buy it. ok thx bye			"

												Purchased originally at about $20One of my all time favorite games, and it's still getting patched by the fans. You absolutely need to download the unofficial patch floating around although it will still have bugs I doubt they will ever fix. Check the forum. That doesn't matter though because the world and dialog and branching paths will keep you coming back. I loved this game so much I got in touch with the composer and we worked together to distribute a proper soundtrack for the game via torrent channels years ago.			"

												Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines is a game filled with action and intrigue, whether you're a fledgeling or a methuselah to the world of darkness and the world of vampire the masquerade, i believe you'll find that this game still holds it's own against current games, and is still fun, and worth more than a single playthrough to check out all the small details, and how the different character builds and clans fare.I highly recommend it!

												Personal rating: 9/10 - 10/10 with unoffical patches. Replayability: HighBudget: Worth it. Lenght: A few days to a week. This game is probably more interesting to people who've played the old Vampire the Masquerade Pen & paper roleplaying games, but takes a lot of liberties with the setting to create a good FPS and RP game. Fps combined with RP isn't the most common setup, typically seen mostly with Elder Scrolls, Might and Magic and this particular title. The game of course also features third person view. I'd say they pull it off rather well in this game. Initially, the game was severely bugged and in some cases the game would break in a way that prevented the player from advancing in the game, having to start over from scratch due to having done something at some point... But the unofficial patches fix the game up to the point where this isn't an issue any more. Story wise, and gameplay wise, the game is almost unmatched by other roleplaying titles. I've rarely seen a game that hit the nail on the head this well for setting. The actual game also feels very good. Despite having deviated from the original vampire setting in many ways to provide a smoother game experience (also a simpler one), in ways that might be unforgivealbe to hardcore fans, I find that the this compromise is acceptable. Having played through this game several times, I can honestly say that it's one of the best games I've played. The way quests work, and especially the ""horror"" elements in the game are worthy of praise.			"

												This is officialy the best Vampire game ever created. It belongs to a good RPG, horor (creepy kind of horor, no jumpscares) and belive me or not, even the comedy genre. It haves a huge replay value since you have multiple kind of Vampires (clans) you can play as, and they are all different. The biggest spotlight get the caln Malcavian and Nosferatu.Malcavians because their dialoge options are completly different,  they are all completly insane not to mention speaking to the STOP sign and news reporter over TV, xD.Nosferatu because of their ugliness you will get a lot of hilarious reactions from NPCs but the penalty for it is you wont be able to do some quests. Technicly, Nosferatu are like the HARD mode for this game.It haves a many endings so watch the story and try to make good desicions!And just to mention this is NOT the Twilight teen Vampire♥♥♥♥♥♥ this is some serious Vampire♥♥♥♥♥♥ Now that's done here's the Pros and Cons:Pros:-Replay value-Very fun combat mecanics-Mucis makes the creepy dark atmosphere even more better.-Very interesting and special side quests-Main story is greeat-RPG part is very well made-Vampiric powers are awesome and very helpfull and different for every Clan-Characters are interesting-I never saw better dialoge options in any video game i ever played in my life and i played them a lot. The cool thing is that every character makes deep facial exsprecions for every sentance they say.-Cool easter eggs-and other....Cons:-Otdated graphics (2003)-Random NPC are same in every place ( i once saw 5 women looking exacly the same o-o)-Combat music is very repetitive (but you can get used to it)-Bugs, since game was rushed.-You'll find your self going on internet so see some solutions for quests, since some quests get you more exsperience if you beat them on different way, hidden treasures ect.-Needs the unoficial patch, but it's a quick job not problem at all.Overall it's a must play game, shame it never got a sequel :) And watch youre♥♥♥♥♥when you get to the Seeside Hotel in Santa Monica...

												Great game...but in desperate need of a modern update. The game and world has so much potential. A remastery with lastest graphics and the addition of more modern attributes (the option to have male escorts for food as a male player instead of female and the like for those of us who aren't hetero) would be a great addition. Not to mention more options, real character customization, perhaps more quests and content and a wider area to explore. There is so much to love with this fandom and it is well represented with this game...but it is in desperate need of a remastery to fully bring its true beauty into the light of a modern generation.

												One of the best Action-RPG's I've ever seen.  Doesn't age at all.Awesome soundtrack, great plot, including side-quests, non-linear gameplay, a variety of classes and skills.Each clan has its own style, they are typically divided into classic groups: warrior, mage, marksman, thief, the-one-who-talks etc. I recommend to play with Malkavian or Nosferatu on your SECOND try, as the difficulty with these clans is higher due to their appearance and manner of speech. Totally different game.Bugs and dated graphics are the only things that can bother: sometimes scripts don't work, sometimes the game crashes, you can encounter some glitches, but let's face the truth: Fallout 3 & 4 have the same problems, but you still play 'em. That's why it is important to save all the time and two have at least 2-3 active saves.			"

												+Good Story+Good Voice Acting+Good Atmosphere+Great RPG Elements (Race, Skills, Items)+Varied Gameplay (stealth, lockpicking, hacking, combat, conversation)+Good Conversation Choice system-Weak Combat-Uneven PacingI have a love / hate relationship game.  From my perspective, you have a game that is very much like the original Deus Ex in terms of choice by in-game actions or conversations mixed with a compelling atmosphere perfect for the location and time period of the story.  Being able to make various choices or alternate routes of completing goals is awesome.  The 90s pop / gothic vampire cults imbued in Southern California culture is convincing and enjoyable.Unfortunately, there are some design decisions that prevent it from being the same great addicting experience that is Deus Ex.  The combat is lousy.  While Deus Ex has aged in terms of gunplay, there are at least mechanics to perform instanteous lethal kills or knockouts.  While stealth holds up with human foes, it is somewhat hindered in my point of view by the third person perspective that is forced when equipped with a melee weapon.  When firing at an aware NPC, the combat feels similar to a bullet sponge FPS with no ADS.  Think Halo.  This would not be a problem if you did not get forced into critical situations requiring combat, however, there are boss fights that must be completed throughout the main quest.Combat aside, the game has trouble with pacing.  Some times you can become stuck trying to find an item or clue that will set you off on the next thread of the main quest.  While tinkering around the world is enjoyable, being lost in 90s computer records is not great.Anyways, I think this game should definitely be played.  Buy it when on sale and dedicate 6 hours of game time before calling quits.  Also, spending time with a character creation guide to make the most of your skills and vampire powers is advised.[GET AT SALE]			"

												10/10 with the True Patch. The best ARPG I've played. Seven distinctive classes (read: bloodlines, get it?) and a complex network of attributes, talents and disciplines send players through unique story archs, creating genuinely exciting replay potential. Impactful decision-making, above average dialogue and tough, ultraviolent combat combine to create a level of immersion rarely attained in all video gaming. The GTA-style open world is packed with fun, story-driven quests that span a broad spectrum of level designs, some of which are among my favorite to date (many are truly terrifying), all of them teeming with World of Darkness's inspired takes on classic horror creatures. The ""feeding"" logic is immensely satifying. Add the inventive weapons and gear and the result is an unprecedented completeness of world building. Easily one of my favorite games, period.The game is sexist and racist, which sucks because it really is among of the greatest of all time. The sole black NPC wears a basketball jersey, sports an afro, refers to women as ""baby girl"" and, in conversation, when he invites the player to eat with him, there is a dialogue option that reads: ""Couldn't I just watch the monkeys feed down at the zoo?""...Not funny! This and the gleefully violent sexual rhetoric in many of the in-game emails (and general objectification of women characters) suggest a troubling level of depravity on the part of the staff at Troika and Activision.

												A classic.I always find myself coming back to this one theres nothing else quite like this vampire RPG. However getting this thing to run was difficult; as in this game won't run without the necesarry patches downloaded and installed. This is due to it being rushed out the door near the end of it's production to be released at the same time as half life therfore allowing this game to slip under the radar. However due to its dedicated fanbase this game can be put back together and become something truely unique.Despite these drawbacks the tons of replayability, and awesome RPG gameplay make this game a definite recomendation from me.

												     Greetings, First off I want to say that this game is old and like many old games in this new touch screen world getting them to play nice with Win 10 can be easier said than done. With that out of the way lets dig in.     This game had so much long term potiential and its sad that after Troika finished it they closed their doors. I was really looking forward to the expansion that would have came. Compared to Vampire: The Masquerade-Redemption, Bloodlines was From dusk till dawn the movie not the seires.      The story line was very intricate with alot of nice twists. The characters were lively also some of them took me back to the pen and paper days. I really digged the musical score. It really vibed well with the mood and settings of the game. Aside from the technical difficulties this game is a steal at its current pricing. If your looking for a laid back rpg and dont mind the graphics throwback you should give it a try. "

												....But seriously, play this game is all I'll say as the bottom line. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines has one of the best voice acting I've heard in video games from the sheer amount of life breathed into each character. This game has something for everybody and may try way too hard in some places but makes up for it with variety, fun, and creative level designs that become familiar rather quickly. After installing the unofficial patch to fix this game, it becomes one of the best games you'll play from the 2000's. Take it as an RPG/Dialogue sim or make it a FPS, there's no wrong way to play this game and it'll give you enough option to try as many routes as you want without much repetition outside of the main storyline. Buy it, play it, then play it again in a completely different way and as a completely different class - this game will let very few players down. Pros:+High replayability including multiple endings and a GOOD variety of classes/clans. +Excellent Voice Acting+Decent Combat System+Great Environments+Memorable Characters+Great Writing and an interesting plot+Informative menus and inventories with a quest logCons:-Bugged as hell (fixed with the unofficial patches)-Music is pretentious and laughable and sounds like somebody compressed three entire Hot Topics into a soundtrack-Backtracking becomes tedious "

												- Game Review Below -First let me give you a few background I had with the game: Finished the game (during windows xp glorious days) years before I bought it again on steam, and got most of the vampire types / class stories done.Over all I'd say I got hundreds of gameplay hours.Now if youwant to play a vampire character, since there are not many good ones that really captured the essence like this game did. But if you are a vampire fan this game will simply click for you.Having said all that, here's my Ratings--------------- Pro's & Con's---------------Graphics: 7/10 - I know this is a 2004 game, so my rating is a 2004 rating.Story: 6/10 - still have room for improvement tho its not going to affect the game muchMusic / Sound: 8/10 - Voice have some few high low moments. Over all sound is good but the music tracks are great!Gameplay: 6/10 - It's missing a first person melee combat mode, but its too minor of an issue.Finally I'd rate the game 7/10----------------------  Game Notes:----------------------Game could be betterWould have rated it 8/10 if it had corrected most minor animation bugs.Did not have the opportunity to encounter a low performance hit bug (this line is just a note for my self).If the game doesn't work for you don't cry it out try this steam link >>>

												The haunted house part made this game for me.  I'm so tired of games and movies billing themselves as horror when they all they do is show gorey.  That's not scary.  The haunted house part of this game was the best I've ever seen.  The sounds, the slight movement out of the corner of your eye, it's fantastic. The gameplay is pretty decent, and depending on the bloodline you play depends on how hard this game will really be (playing Noforatu for me is nightmare mode).  But, they do so many things right in this game, I just love it.			"

												The game is one of the most immersive RPGs' I have ever played, I connected with it's dark atmosphere, gritty settings, well developed characters and the White Wolf License. This game faced disaster when it first came out on the same day as Half-Life 2 back in 2004. Firstly releasing it against one of the most influential games was obviously going to side-line it, but, secondly the game wasn't finished by the time Activision decided to push it out; as a result it went into the wind, unheard of. I must state that I play games for their stories' and immersion, while some people may find other mediums of entertainment such as TV and Film to indulge in better stories; this game did not disappoint. The story of the Vampire clans vying for control in L.A and the underlying plot about a certain object is well thought out and crafted, supported by top-notch voice acting; all thanks to the Source engine. Graphically this game may look dated now that we are in 2013, but don't be fooled it still captures the gritty setting perfectly. The gameplay may also be dated, however as stated I mainly play games for their stories' and as a result tend not to focus on 'high' graphics and 'great' game-play. (I'm not saying it isn't integral of course). Speaking of the gameplay, the amount of variations that are found in the different vampire clans is fresh. For example if you play as a mad-stricken Malkavian, this may open up specific dialogue options and immersive events; and that's not even including the different powers and abilities. The game design isn't open-world, but boy it is fun to explore! The side-quests may not be as numerous as the ones' found in Skyrim or other top RPGs'. However the quests in VTMB are rich, immersive and are genuinely fun to play. Overall I find this game to be in my top 30, and would recommend this game to anyone who likes fresh, original, and immersive stories coupled with vampire fiction and good but not revolutionary game-play.

												If someone were to ask me for an incredibly non-linear RPG I could name a few.  There's Deus Ex (The original), Mass Effect, and then there's the cult classic that is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.  A heavily overlooked title to be sure, Bloodlines is a one-of-a-kind game.  It's rare to find a non-adventure game where pretty much everything you say and the type of person you turn out to be changes how the game is played drastically.  In that sense, this game is what I would consider the true successor to Deus Ex.Much like Deus Ex, the game revolves around making choices.  For instance, there can be a story chain revolving around some character, and just because you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥him off earlier you've drastically changed the course of the chain.  This might sound shallow by the way I'm explaining it, but some of the consequences behind ones choices aren't immediately noticeable, which adds to the game's unpredictability.  Skills also play into the choices, much like they can in Knights of the Old Republic, and not only offer more choices, but they also offer more ways to play the game.Also like Deus Ex, the game almost always offers several ways to go about missions, though not with the versatility of Deus Ex (and understandably so).  There's usually a direct approach, a rather intuitive sneaking approach, and a charismatic approach, though each of these approaches can branch off into other approaches as well, which gives the game quite a bit of replay value.  Similarly, because your a vampire, you are also given skills that, depending on which race you are, can give you even more ways of going about the game.The only real downside to the game is its combat system.  Well, specifically, it's hand-to-hand combat system.  It's kinda...bad.  It's somewhat clunky and inaccurate, but it isn't terrible and can certainly be enjoyable, and if you don't like it you can always employ your skills and/or grab a gun.If you're looking for an incredibly non-linear title, this game is definitely for you.  Despite its age, the game hits many strides in its storytelling and non-linearity, and it hearkens back to the days of Deus Ex on more than one occasion.  The side-quests can also be shockingly impressionable, such as one mission where you go to an abandoned hotel and...well, it'd better that you just play it.  Pick up this game, it's a very good title.  If you're looking for a deal, it almost always goes on sale during the Halloween Sale.			"

												Once you play this game, you'll realize why it is a cult classic. It is definitely not for everyone, but if you like RPGs or vampire games, you'll enjoy it. The game is very dark and atmospheric, with a lot of replayability. It is very similar to deus ex. However, it definitely falls off towards the end, as it was rushed. It also has some bugs, so make sure to nstall the unoffical patch.8.5/10			"

												Don't let its appearance deceive you; underneath an early Source Engine exterior lies a truly magnificent game that takes the World of Darkness Role-Playing system and brings it to the  moderately-sized screen. Taking the role of a newly-turned vampire, the player navigates the strange new world of the supernatural as the Vampire Society faces a threat that could change the world as we know it. Choose supernatural powers such as transmogrification and invisibility and master skills such as lockpicking, firearms and hacking and face off with a host of foes that would do anything to see you die your last death. You're about to find out that the World of Darkness isn't much better than our own...			"

												Vampire and RPG, what could you ask more? The graphics may be dated but this game is seriously awesome, if you got textures problems then deactivate/activate '' bump mapping '' in the options In game, it works great for me.If your game won't launch/crash then launch the game in administrator mode and Windows XP (Service Pack 2) it works for me, you can also download the custom patches but I'm not using them and the game is working pretty fine.Now, you'll probably say '' vampires are gay and it's gay to watch/play them ''. Well I've never seen a vampire that was gay and I actually love girls and only girls.Vampires are awesome, supernatural stuff always been awesome and the vampires are In my opinion, the greatest, now of course Twilight is another story, Twilight is giving a bad name to the vampires but do not trust Twilight, it's stupid.Vampire: The Masquerade, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Castlevania, Legacy of Kain, BloodRayne, Blood Omen, Darkstalkers, Soul Reaver, Nosferatu, Dracula: Undead Awakening and The Elder Scrolls just to name some, there are some others that are really great, that's about it for the video games.The Vampire Diaries, True Blood, The Originals, Buffy the Vampire Slayer are some great vampire TV series. The Vampire Diaries and The Originals are my favorites, you'll love them if you love history and supernatural even if they're not really horror, drama and suspense, True Blood is really great too.Let Me In, Near Dark, Blade are some great vampire movies.Hellsing, Vampire Knight, Blood + are some great vampire animes.There are also books like The Vampire Diaries (the original serie and the new one) and probably many more but I am not much of a reader.If you've watched, played, read all of them and didn't like any of them then you're just not to Vampire/Supernatural stuff.Look at the vampire lord in The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, It is amazing, not like Twilight.Vampires can be pretty badass actually, just stop looking at Twilight.I seriously wish that there would be another Vampire The Masquerade but It probably won't happen.Anyway great game, I recommend 9.5/10 and don't forget, Twilight is simply stupid, vampires aren't about beauty, In the Vampire Diaries they manage to make it awesome but normally vampires are supposed to be scary so do not believe Twilight.No hate, just facts, If you like Twilight then it's good for you, I don't really care but it's not a true vampire movie, it's just some random movie for 8 years old and mainstream girls.9.5/10			"

												This is the buggiest, practically unplayable game I've come across in my many moons on this planet.The animation is a joke, the control is horrible, you will have to patch the game before you start... Even then you will most likely need use the console and the noclip command to get through at least one part of the game.So why the positive review then?If you can somehow get the game to play through to the end, you will experience one of the most immersive RPGs of the last 20 years. The writing and voice acting are top notch. The character models are also pretty cool. Despite the fact that the sun never comes up, you will kinda feel like a Vampire. Bloodlines is a sexy and enthralling piece of work, even if it is hopelessly buggy.Oh and last point.... There is a character in the game called Jeanette Voerman. Jeanette's design was created in 2003 but her likeness was ""borrowed"" by DC comics for the Harley Quinn redesign in 2011. As far as I know, nobody at Troika was compensated. The Harley redesign has the same body type, same hair, same makeup, and even a choker... just like Jeanette. Yeah it's probably just a coincidence.			"

												I tried to play this game years ago and abandoned it after a short time due to the amount of bugs rendering it unplayable. After rediscovering the game a far corner of my steam library, I decided to give it another go.Io and behold! By now, a very active community of enthusiasts has fixed 99% of these problems with their unofficial patches. And the game is an absolute gem. Brilliant writing, memorable characters, dialogues and settings. I Recommend it wholeheartedly. Where else can you play a batshit crazy vampire who ventures to have a conversation with a stop sign?While the story is quite linear, it provides reason to replay it because the different clans of vampires provide very unique game experiences: Some, like Toreador and Ventrue, will be able to talk themselves out of most situations. The Nosferatu look like the monsters they are and will cause a panic the moment a mortal sees them, which leads to a focus on sneaking and exploring the sewers of the city. The Brujah are combat experts, inviting a hack'n'slash melee-fest. Others, like the Tremere, focus on magic.And then there's the Malkavians, a strand of vampires who's very blood causes insanity, leading to some of the craziest dialogues in video game history. They can (temporarily?) cause insanity in others - who wouldn't want to make their annoying ex think you're their long lost pet turtle? It also allows them a near prophetic insight into their conversation partners' thoughts and motives - That is, if you listen to the right voices n your head and ignore the others...			"

												Story is intriguing, gameplay is not so bad for a game this old, and not quite as buggy as most people say with the unofficial patch(I have had no crashes or broken missions yet).  It does have limited mod support however finding a good selection of mods can be difficult (mostly higher rez textures/reskins).  It's probably one of the best $10 I've spent on steam.  I wish most other single player RPG's were this good.			"

												It shows that I only have 9 hours but I've played much more due to the patch not being supported by steam do you have to download the patch. It takes like a minute, there are so many guides on steam to help and guide you through it. Now for the actual review. HOLY ♥♥♥♥ this game is really good. One reason being this game has some pretty messed up humor. With a pick your own ending as well as pick your own class each playing differently as well as having like 8 pretty big areas this game is a cult classic for a reason. Seriously you would being doing a misdeed if you didn't play this game. My only qualm is that this game gets pretty damn hard towards the end. Please please please pick up this game its ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic.			"

												....But seriously, play this game is all I'll say as the bottom line. Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines has one of the best voice acting I've heard in video games from the sheer amount of life breathed into each character. This game has something for everybody and may try way too hard in some places but makes up for it with variety, fun, and creative level designs that become familiar rather quickly. After installing the unofficial patch to fix this game, it becomes one of the best games you'll play from the 2000's. Take it as an RPG/Dialogue sim or make it a FPS, there's no wrong way to play this game and it'll give you enough option to try as many routes as you want without much repetition outside of the main storyline. Buy it, play it, then play it again in a completely different way and as a completely different class - this game will let very few players down. Pros:+High replayability including multiple endings and a GOOD variety of classes/clans. +Excellent Voice Acting+Decent Combat System+Great Environments+Memorable Characters+Great Writing and an interesting plot+Informative menus and inventories with a quest logCons:-Bugged as hell (fixed with the unofficial patches)-Music is pretentious and laughable and sounds like somebody compressed three entire Hot Topics into a soundtrack-Backtracking becomes tedious "

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is quite a mess. There are parts missing, game-breaking bugs and more mistakes than any other game I've played. I won't lie; it's very dated and probably not for everyone. It was one of the first Source engine games to become available, but sadly the companies involved were financially doomed. Thus, the game never really got the attention it deserved.However, if you fancy yourself as a Source Engine Vampire, you'll be rewarded with this one. There's an unofficial patch, which adds more content and fixes hundreds of bugs - but it still remains quite broken. Putting all of this aside, I'm happy to recommend this title. It may even have replay value to you.Pros+ The story is perhaps one of my favourite in a game. It's dark and tries to be adult orientated. Max Payne-like?+ Reasonable variation between Vampire Clans.+ Plenty of levels spread across a wide assortment of environments. The explorable areas and buildings are quite varied.+ Vampire skills, knives, baseball bat or gun - kill at will, however you please.+ Great character progression.+ Moderate customisation.+ Dark humour.+ In-game actions decide your character's path, skills, items and fate. Play Mr Nice, or Miss Nasty.+ Faithful to the original ""Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption"" and the whole White Wolf thing.+ Fairly good skill set for the different Vampire Clans.+ Captivating story of your making.+ Atmospheric cinematics using the engine instead of full motion video.+ Graphics aren't terrible for it's age. At the game's release most of us went ""Wow!""Cons- The dialogue scenes and their ""1 - Yes, 2 - No."" interaction becomes tedious after the first mission.- Major flaws in AI. Missing dialogue, broken responses and overall beta quality [at best].- Dodgy controls, FOV and camera angles.- My Vampire feels like I'm driving a bus. It's a very clumsy affair when you encounter stairs or obstacles.- Enemies usually aren't very clever or tough. There isn't much variation. Sometimes they bug too.- Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption was a much more enjoyable story, game and overall experience.Overall, if you give this game some perseverance - you will probably enjoy it. It's not that easy to become fluent - but stick with it. The endings are quite rewarding. It's also very slow to begin with - but picks up pace to be quite an enjoyable challenge. It's not unlike Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption in that respect.If you have already played Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines and enjoyed it, you probably want to check out Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption.

Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is known as a cult classic, and it’s certainly earned its fanbase! With 7 clans and more than one solution for most quests, there is a lot for RPG fans to sink their fangs into. The dialogue is clever and the plot is intriguing even for players who aren’t familiar with the tabletop RPG it's based off of. It also has a bunch of my favorite voice actors in its cast. (I knew I was going to have a good time when the first NPC I talked to was voiced by Bender.)Unfortunately, as other reviews have pointed out, it’s buggy as hell unpatched. Story missions near the end of the game don’t have as many solutions as earlier ones and are mostly solved by fighting, which can screw over characters that are better at sneaking or talking their way out of confrontations. Also one level in particular, the Warrens, just plain sucks; the plus version of the unofficial patch adds a shortcut that lets you skip it, thankfully.If you can look past its flaws, VtMB is a solid roleplaying experience that has more depth than even most newer RPGs. It’s just a shame that it wasn’t as polished as it could have been.Pros: Has 7 character classes that offer a unique play style, especially Nosferatu and Malkavian Many missions have multiple solutions, especially early on Great writing and complex plot Excellent voice acting Atmospheric, dark without being edgy Fans have made several patches and mods that improve the gameCons: Buggy without fan patches Can be hard to run on newer computers Late game story missions are almost entirely focused on combat Warrens level is long and godawfully boring "

Interlocking/Interweaving stories that unfold new layeres of depth with repeated playthroughs.  The maps might be small by today's standards, but they are richy packed with (un)life.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines was rushed and pushed out the door by Activision. As a result, the game is rather buggy, featuring shoddy AI, missing content, broken stealth mechanics, and other annoyances. In spite of that, this is perhaps one of my favorite games I've ever played. This is an absolutely charming and underrated game.It's a closed sandbox RPG: think Deus Ex (a masterpiece) but set in the modern world... and with vampires and other creatures of the night.There are seven different vampire clans you can choose to be part of. Can't decide which one? Then take the quiz the game offers, I got the Tremere: the spellcasting mages that use blood as their mana. Allowing you to steal an opponent's blood from a distance or internally ""boil"" their blood until they explode into a visceral masterpiece. It's rather adorable, honestly.The gameplay is similar to Deus Ex, an RPG first person action game with multiple choices affecting the story, thus each playthrough is different from the other.There are multiple weapons to use: firearms, melee weapons, and your own clan skills are all fun to use. There is also a skill tree allowing you to customize and enchance your proficiency in certain categories, although many of the skills are rather useless save for a few circumstances.The graphics aren't too shabby to be honest. This is the first game to use the Source engine (even before Half Life 2) and while dated by today's standards, is still a fairly nice game to look at. The facial animations in particular look great.The atmosphere though is simply wonderful: the characters all feel real, the voice acting is well done, and this game's world just feels alive in its own undead way. The writing is top notch too, this is one of the funniest games I've ever played, and I still haven't started my second playthrough as a Malkavian!The bugs I mentioned before? There are fanmade fixes for them (I recommend the unofficial patch), in fact there are a lot of mods available for this game. Proof of its quality.Overall, despite its flaws, this is an awesome game that I recommend for anyone who enjoyed Deus Ex, or you really like vampires.			"

												Ok, so I'm gonna preface this with the fact that I have never played this game before yesterday. My friends and I do RPs when we hang out and they've always said, ""Hey let's do a VTM game!"". I didn't know much about it but threw myself in with a human character (because when in doubt play the ignorant race and learn with your character). Those games were fun, and then they said that I should play this and Redemption. Since Redemption isn't on Steam, I'm just gonna play Bloodlines for now.So far, I love it.I've gotten lost 4 times already, and I tricked some guy into an alley, but it's fun.I'm just enjoying the more engaging quest journal (in comparison to Skyrim, another game I love)The simple graphics (since my laptop is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥and has trouble running stuff. No problems so far so that's a big plus)And the fun little touches that explain a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥that I missed in RPs with my friends.I'm not sure if I'm an idiot, but I can't find an ingame map, and that's honestly my only complaint. I get lost very easily, and it's always been a bit of a turnoff to not know where I am in relation to my goal.Definately gonna update as I progress, but so far, 9/10 would play the hell out of.			"

												A timeless classic, even in it's flawed Vanilla form. One of the more unique and interesting games i've played, especially the sotry and world. Supported by unofficial patches and mods for years now, which only made the game closer to what it's initial glory could have been had the company not met it's fate like it did.Infinitely replayable due to a large number of outcomes, dialogue, player characters and interactions with NPC's, and even your choices in character build dictate how the gameplay will be. Talk your way through the game? Use melee or ranged weapons? Fists? Rely on your powers? The choice is yours, and the gameplay differs pretty radically, especially for the Nosferatu and Malkavian clans. If you buy this game, you owe it to yourself to play as a Malkavian character in one of the playthroughs. Yes there will be more playthroughs, guaranteed!A must play for all RPG lovers, and lovers of great games.			"

IMPORTANT:I feel it should be known that the steam version has some compatability issues. Many people probably won't be able to run the game as is.

In fact, it's structured in a very similar way to that game. It's a quality title that didn't get enough attention at release, and if you love RPGs then this game is certainly one of the best.			"

												I absolutely adore this game. It's interesting and fun, and with the vampire aspect quite unique. I'd say you should replay it once simply to experience both with and without Malkavian dialect if you enjoy the first run through. Therese and Jeanette are my favourite characters for sure, and make the game that much more wow. My only complaint at all, is that you usually have to get a patch to play the game due to its age, but don't let that deterre you from buying it, as there are plenty of unofficial patches available free on the interwebs. Graphics aren't too bad at all, just a little chunky, akin to GTA Vice City on the PS2. All in all, amazing game, and definitely in my top 5 for RPG.			"

												This game has soooooooooo many problems. It's glitchy, unpolished, and seems ready and willing to snap at any given moment, crashing and exploding like some glorious, terrifying reenactment of the fall of the Hindenburg.Yet despite that, it's worth every crash, and every glitch. It's worth those frustrating, teeth-pulling moments when the game seems to have broken into a thousand pieces. This is a game that has a soul. It's not a pretty soul, but that's probably part of the point. It's a game about monsters doing their best not to be monsters. It's a game where the developers, rather than investing time to test it properly which they probably should have, they elected to instead rewrite all of the dialogue around a single type of character, a Malkavian, that you can play. Most developers would only write in a token two or three choices that you'd get sporadically during a game. And this isn't text-based, either. They had all of the actors record additional lines so their characters would react accordingly.And it's all of these little things that keep showing up during the game. Having a tutorial that feels good to play through, even if you've gone through it before, just because they took the time to make it feel good. Designing a vibrant world full of wonderful characters that feel like they belong and have stories to tell. A story that hits so many of the right notes. I suppose it'd be of no surprise to mention that the people who worked on this worked on the original Fallout, and eventually went to Obsidian.This game isn't without problems, though. Don't get me wrong. Combat can feel weird and clunky, and sometimes unfinished. Glitches can be infuriating when they happen. And, sometimes, it feels like a game that should've spent another four months in development, because it feels like playing a barebones beta at times. But it's worth it all, just to experience everything else. It's worth the glitches.			"

												This game is AMAZING.  Think Fallout 3 meets the Table Top White Wolf Masquerade Vampire games.  Why there isn't another one already is beyond me.I had fun wandering around like a little fiend of the night and biting hapless b!tches before I even delved into the main story line of this game.  And if you appreciate games that have good writing, suprising humor, and take more than a walnut sized brain to plan skills and character dev - then give it a shot.  The detail in this game is OUTSTANDING.  I found myself staring at the interior of certain locations and wondering how I could build a house the same way.  Or I got lost staring up into the city sky as I walked around with my head pivoted directly upward.  IT LOOKS SO GOOD.  Ex: You go up into a super high penthouse loft and can look all the way down at the streets you just prowled. Oh, one note:  This game is excellent as is - but it ends early ie: they stopped dev on it.  Not to fear....  just download the ""UNOFFICIAL PATCH.""  Its a safe, free fix.  The game is SO DAMNED GOOD that someone created an unofficial patch to pull the storyline out to its full length and hyper-polish the graphics.  It is BEAUTIFULLLLLLLLLLLL.  Just google Vampire Bloodlines Unofficial Patch.  SO WORTH IT!Also try out the other Vampire the Masquerade game, ""Redemption.""  Its older than this one, but a masterpiece.  You can get it on Amazon.com or Gog.com for like 6 bucks and its got FANTASTIC original music, a solid storyline, and its straight from White Wolf.  The Vampire Masquerade games are REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING FANTASTIC ROLEPLAYING HORROR GAMES!			"

												It was at about 1pm on my birthday this year that I realised I had been playing this game for 12 hours straight and had forgone sleep simply because I needed to complete every single side-quest the game had to offer.I unrepentently love this game - I bought it on sale as a joke because I remembered seeing it in a Yu-Gi-Oh! Abridged let's play series when I was an embarassing tween. I thought it would just be a fun early 2000s RPG, but it's that and much more - humorous and extremely well written, simple enough for a filthy casual like me to play but immersive enough that the relative lack of difficulty was never boring or tedious.While the price is a little higher than it needs to be (in my stingy opinion), if this game is on sale, BUY IT. You won't regret it, I promise.If you do buy this game I also highly recommend downloading the Unnoficial Plus Patch. The (Non-Plus) Unnoficial Patch is generally required to run the game on newer computers, but the Plus Patch takes this game from great to amazing - upgrading the character creation, tying together storylines, giving better quest rewards and fixing all the little annoying glitches the unmodded version has - just check the Bloodlines wiki to see what I'm talking about.And a little advice from experience - don't play as Nosferatu on your first run. It's tempting, I know, but while invisibility is awesome, constantly blowing your cover due to severe butterface is a bit of a bummer.EDIT: I nominated this game for the ""I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award"" award in the Steam Awards 2016, if that tells you anything about how much I like it!

												Everytime I buy a game I want two things. A well made story, and fun gameplay that makes me have to think. This game delivered on both fronts fantastically. I would even go so far as to say that this is my second favorite game of all time (the first being DA:O) The game not only has branching dialog options, but multiple factions and endings. It also has a level up system similar to shadowrun, with you being able to improve both combat and non combat skills. This makes balancing your character hard, because while you may be able to talk your way out of some fights, not all of them will be easy or even possible. The game made for a fun experience where I felt like a bloodsucker stalking the streets of hollywood, caught up in a battle with multiple choices and vital decisions that could change the world. Overall, the great story wrapped me up in a web and I thought about the moral and fatal conse qunces of every action, from decisions that could shake the world, to where to spend my experience so that i could spend another night breathing, VTMB had me thinking about every action, and their consequences. 10/10P.S.

												     Greetings, First off I want to say that this game is old and like many old games in this new touch screen world getting them to play nice with Win 10 can be easier said than done. With that out of the way lets dig in.     This game had so much long term potiential and its sad that after Troika finished it they closed their doors. I was really looking forward to the expansion that would have came. Compared to Vampire: The Masquerade-Redemption, Bloodlines was From dusk till dawn the movie not the seires.      The story line was very intricate with alot of nice twists. The characters were lively also some of them took me back to the pen and paper days. I really digged the musical score. It really vibed well with the mood and settings of the game. Aside from the technical difficulties this game is a steal at its current pricing. If your looking for a laid back rpg and dont mind the graphics throwback you should give it a try. "

												If someone were to ask me for an incredibly non-linear RPG I could name a few.  There's Deus Ex (The original), Mass Effect, and then there's the cult classic that is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.  A heavily overlooked title to be sure, Bloodlines is a one-of-a-kind game.  It's rare to find a non-adventure game where pretty much everything you say and the type of person you turn out to be changes how the game is played drastically.  In that sense, this game is what I would consider the true successor to Deus Ex.Much like Deus Ex, the game revolves around making choices.  For instance, there can be a story chain revolving around some character, and just because you♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥him off earlier you've drastically changed the course of the chain.  This might sound shallow by the way I'm explaining it, but some of the consequences behind ones choices aren't immediately noticeable, which adds to the game's unpredictability.  Skills also play into the choices, much like they can in Knights of the Old Republic, and not only offer more choices, but they also offer more ways to play the game.Also like Deus Ex, the game almost always offers several ways to go about missions, though not with the versatility of Deus Ex (and understandably so).  There's usually a direct approach, a rather intuitive sneaking approach, and a charismatic approach, though each of these approaches can branch off into other approaches as well, which gives the game quite a bit of replay value.  Similarly, because your a vampire, you are also given skills that, depending on which race you are, can give you even more ways of going about the game.The only real downside to the game is its combat system.  Well, specifically, it's hand-to-hand combat system.  It's kinda...bad.  It's somewhat clunky and inaccurate, but it isn't terrible and can certainly be enjoyable, and if you don't like it you can always employ your skills and/or grab a gun.If you're looking for an incredibly non-linear title, this game is definitely for you.  Despite its age, the game hits many strides in its storytelling and non-linearity, and it hearkens back to the days of Deus Ex on more than one occasion.  The side-quests can also be shockingly impressionable, such as one mission where you go to an abandoned hotel and...well, it'd better that you just play it.  Pick up this game, it's a very good title.  If you're looking for a deal, it almost always goes on sale during the Halloween Sale.			"

												This game is nearly ten years old and it's still one of the best RPGs I've ever played.  The community is amazing, still pushing out updates to mods and the unofficial patch is still updated regularly.  This is one of the few games on Steam that I'd say if you're on the fence about buying it not to even bother waiting for a sale, because it is easily worth the full price.It absolutely deserves to win the Steam ""Test of Time"" award as, over ten years after release it's *still* got community support making the game better and better.

												A fun (but flawed) blast from the past. Released just as White Wolf was killing the original World of Darkness line and beginning a new, less-successful one, this game is a tribute to the original Vampire: The Masquerade game and the looming spectre of the Final Nights. Good fun, but completely unplayable without an unofficial patch you'll have to download and install from some other site. *sigh*			"

												One of my favorite games of not just the RPG genre but of any genre. Be warned right now though you will want a unoffical patch as Troika Games is no longer around and it does have some bugs. Also when it says mature 17+ it means it. You play the role of a fledgling vampire from the world of whitewolf. Its a dark and gritty world where their are no good guys, just different degrees of evil ones. You will choose from one of seven differnt clans (clans are differnt bloodlines of vampires each with their own quirks and perks) that lead to a very differnt type of game on multiple play threws.Combat is not the smoothest and the graphics are a bit dated. However the voice acting is superb the atmosphere is a increadible 11/10 as well. Depending on how you spend your EXP points on various skill and what type of vampire clan you are the base game can play very differntly from one play threw to another. Also features a 5 ending setup (although some endings arnt as varied as what you would think) leaving the game open to some replayability even at the ending.Overall i would give this game a 10/10 even with its problems and age.

												Absloute genuis. This game is absolute genuis. The story is VERY well writen, the graphics hold up incredibly well considering when this game was made (however mods are recomended), the characters feel real, and the combat is very satisfying. That being said make sure you download the unofficial patch because this game is broken without it. You only gain experience by completing quests and there are ALOT of them. The side quests can distract you from the story for awhile but they aren't needed to complete the game but its recomended that you do them in order to level-up your stats. At the begining of the game you really only need melee skill, but once you get farther in you really need some ranged skill or your gonna have a hard time. You can pick from 7 diferent vampire clans each one VERY different from the others, even more so if you pick a background for your character, but thats not required. There are some pretty dark moments, but its a game about modern day vampires so there kinda has to be. I HIGHLY recommend this game to any RPG fan, you will not regret buying this game. This game is very underrated and deserves much more attention and recognition.			"

It's both an older title and on a game engine that was almost entirely untested at the time, and it shows.

												Finally got around to playing this game and quite enjoyed it. I don't normally play horror games and while the game was fine for the most part, when the more freaky bits of horror intruded I didn't enjoy the game quite so much. My Steam playing time won't be accurrate as I copied the game files out of the Steam directory so I could install the unofficial patch. I don't know how the game played without the patch, but it certainly played fine with it. In fact, I couldn't play the game unpatched as it instantly crashes on startup (hence it sitting unused in my library for so long). The only way I could write this review was by starting the game, watching it crash, then leave the ""vampire.exe has stopped working"" message open for 5 mins to trick Stream into thinking I'd played :)Lots of quests, interesting characters, and a fairly interesting story with a unexpected ending. Graphics are a mixed bag, but I did find that some of the expression animations to do a pretty accurate job. Levels are fairly linear but they do.Of course, during the questions as the start of the game I answered in the sneaky vein where I could and so ended up as a Nosferatu which possibly isn't the best choice of character for a first playthrough - pretty much everyone runs screaming from you, and you have to sneak pretty much all the time, unless you use the sewers, which I did find tedious and just stuck with flittering around the surface.But if I play through this game again, I think I'll try a melee heavy class that looks human. At least I'll won't have to hide all the time and assumbly will get different dialog trees and be able to speak to characters I couldn't before.			"

Taking the role of a newly-turned vampire, the player navigates the strange new world of the supernatural as the Vampire Society faces a threat that could change the world as we know it. Choose supernatural powers such as transmogrification and invisibility and master skills such as lockpicking, firearms and hacking and face off with a host of foes that would do anything to see you die your last death. You're about to find out that the World of Darkness isn't much better than our own...			"

												This is probably one of the games that has the most bugs, the most glitches, and the most crashes I've played in the past ten years. It is also one of the best games I have ever played. The theme and mood are perfectly put together. Most of the quests are both exciting and interesting, without any filler whatsoever. It is incredibly fun to experience the growth and development of your vampire. The only aspect that will bore you and aggravate you will be the bugs, glitches, crashes, and sometimes sub par AI. Even the voice acting is well done. Easily, one of my current top five favorite games of all time on the PC. Even with all the glitches, bugs, and crashes. Do not miss out on this one!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is great.			"

It's both an older title and on a game engine that was almost entirely untested at the time, and it shows. But there are few games available that encapsulate the World of Darkness setting quite so well, and it thankfully has acceptable writing and voice acting to back up the narrative.Worth it for the pleasantly surprising ending(s).

												Finally got around to playing this game and quite enjoyed it. I don't normally play horror games and while the game was fine for the most part, when the more freaky bits of horror intruded I didn't enjoy the game quite so much. My Steam playing time won't be accurrate as I copied the game files out of the Steam directory so I could install the unofficial patch. I don't know how the game played without the patch, but it certainly played fine with it. In fact, I couldn't play the game unpatched as it instantly crashes on startup (hence it sitting unused in my library for so long). The only way I could write this review was by starting the game, watching it crash, then leave the ""vampire.exe has stopped working"" message open for 5 mins to trick Stream into thinking I'd played :)Lots of quests, interesting characters, and a fairly interesting story with a unexpected ending. Graphics are a mixed bag, but I did find that some of the expression animations to do a pretty accurate job. Levels are fairly linear but they do.Of course, during the questions as the start of the game I answered in the sneaky vein where I could and so ended up as a Nosferatu which possibly isn't the best choice of character for a first playthrough - pretty much everyone runs screaming from you, and you have to sneak pretty much all the time, unless you use the sewers, which I did find tedious and just stuck with flittering around the surface.But if I play through this game again, I think I'll try a melee heavy class that looks human. At least I'll won't have to hide all the time and assumbly will get different dialog trees and be able to speak to characters I couldn't before.			"

												This is probably one of the games that has the most bugs, the most glitches, and the most crashes I've played in the past ten years. It is also one of the best games I have ever played. The theme and mood are perfectly put together. Most of the quests are both exciting and interesting, without any filler whatsoever. It is incredibly fun to experience the growth and development of your vampire. The only aspect that will bore you and aggravate you will be the bugs, glitches, crashes, and sometimes sub par AI. Even the voice acting is well done. Easily, one of my current top five favorite games of all time on the PC. Even with all the glitches, bugs, and crashes. Do not miss out on this one!Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is great.			"

												Bloodlines was damned to be a ""flawed gem"" straight out of the box. Despite a loyal, yet small fanbase creating unnoficial patches to fix the bugs found in the game, it still has a lot to be fixed. The game works on the early Source engine, so it uses to base code for Half Life 2, but the development cycle took different paths from the very beggining. The most notable feature of this RPG in particular is the fact that Experience isn't gained for kiling enemies, but for completing quests or finding alternate or special routes to them. That makes it a lot more that a run & gun game. This is - a true Role Playing Game.Even though this game came out in 2001 it i still by far my favorite RPG and no matter how many times I play it I always want to go back for more. I definitely reccomend this game.			"

												Despite its age, glitchy adaptation of source engine (after all, I believe this is the first game to feature it) it still is probably one of the greatest RPGs out there. A little bit depressing, but much more diverse than any Bethesda game in terms of gameplay and missions. The storyline is intense and engaging, but the game is more streamlined than Bethesda's ""sandbox"" design like Oblivion or Skyrim. However, I think is kind of a good thing, because the characters and the quests really do leave a greater impact on your entertainment experience than, say, nearly identical NPCs in abeforementioned titles.

												This game is so incredibly corny and has so many cliches that you will audibly groan at parts of it. Plus, it is absolutely chock-full of unimaginative stock characters and sexist tropes. But I still really, really like it. It is hard not to like this game. The controls are easy to get used to. The quests aren't that challenging, but are still rewarding and fun. The conversational structure is reminiscent of old-school point-and-clicks where you have the option to be a turd, or be polite and persuasive for extra information. Also, you're a vampire and need to survive by feasting on humans (including police, doomsayers and stuffy businessmen) using your stealth and charm, which should really be all the reason you need.

The bugs back then were annoying, but it was playable (mostly). The unofficial patch really makes it shine, though, I started playing it again and then installed it and the difference before and after was really noticable (apparently Windows 10 doesn't agree with it unpatched, I couldn't see the little skill tabs on the character screen for example, and a lot of things seems sort of distorted graphically). Really can't recommend this game enough, it's one of my all time faves, even today it's enjoyable, the storytelling and characters are just so good. Definately worth the 5$ on sale, give it a shot!

												If you have not played this 12 year old game it ROCKS if you like a Vampire RPG where your character is turned against his/her will (girls are more fun to play ;)) and she is introduced into the Los Angeles vampire scene. I first played it  on Windows 7 and now on Windows 10, neither of which are mentioned as compatible on the game page. IMO Steam or someone dropped the ball on this. You need to install a patch to get proper functionality. There are threads about this in the Community pages.Find the 9.5  patch here: http://www.patches-scrolls.de/patch/4647/7/73349.Runs fine on Windows 10. You may have to use an earlier version of the patch for Windows 7, but I've not looked at which patch.Some tips: Make sure the patch has the right path to the game (Steam or SteamLibrary to SteamApps>Common>Vampire The Masquerade - Bloodlines)  especially if you have multiple Steam libraries. If it goes to the wrong place, no warnings, ti will happily install it at the path it shows.After it's installed and you launch the game, the first sign the game is running from the patch, you'll see the game intro splash screens. If it's a black screem, just hit enter several times to get to the game menu and be advised you are not running the patched version of the game.  My understanding it's still possible to run the vanilla game after the patch is installed.Select Options>Gamepay and if the patch is not listed, that's verified it's running the vanilla game. The vanilla game may seem to run ok, but when you run through the tutorial, you may run into issues, like not being able to select your fists using the default key (F1).It has been suggested to find the game in in your Steam library list, right click it, select properties, and under the General tab, click ""Set Launch Options"" and in the blank space type in ""-game Unofficial_Patch"" without quotes, so the patched version of the game launches. I did this and really don't know if it made a difference, but the  patched version of the game launches. :) Also read the readme with the patch. If you add the ""+"" plus  content, it says you'll have to start over with a new game. No problem, this is my 4th run through. :):) Good luck, enjoy!			"

												A word of warning for Windows 7 users, this game isn't immediately compatible, however, this *very* useful thread exists, which should clear up any issues: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035The story is fairly contemporary as far as vampire fiction goes; vampires have to keep their existence among humans a secret otherwise the 'normals' will catch on and exterminate them. This effectively means you are given a number of 'strikes' before it's game over, making gameplay more about sneaking and persuading than going on a Blade-style romp through Los Angeles.There are multiple different types of vampire you can become, although all feel somewhat impotent when it comes to combat, which is an inelegant third-person ordeal.After you get bitten and find yourself in a power struggle between the elite and the renegades, the game is essentially a linear (although enjoyable) path with multiple variations of what may feel like a joke ending.The voices sound a tad echoey, but the soundtrack is more than atmospheric enough to overlook this.Overall, it doesn't suck.

												Just finished for the first time. Great game. Story goes forward without boring. Balanced mix of action and adventure, interesting quests and RPG elements. Possibility of variable play styles (sneak, magic, melee, ranged) and different clans to enjoy. Definitely will play again.			"

Work and love put into it by Troika team shines in every detail. While exploring LA (Santa Monica, Downtown, Hollywood and Chinatown), I got to know all of the clans and factions and felt like I was really a part of it all.

												The haunted house in act 1 of this game was amazing.  I played it fully immersed, in the dark, with very good headphones on.  I hear the developer put special care into that particular area and it really shows.The rest of the game is great.  Lots of intrigue, double-crosses, and awesome vampire powers.  And since the game dev dispresed after this game was made, this is truly a one-of-the-kind game.Great stuff.  Hope you enjoy it.			"

												Is the game a bit buggy? Well yes, but the unofficial patch fixes most of the bugs and restores tons of content. And sure the graphics are starting to be a tad dated (but still I think pretty nice).But as any VtM fan will tell you, you don't play the game for that. You play it for the amosphere that is second to none and for the story that is just brilliant, and then you replay it and see all those hints about the ending that you missed. Then again to play as a Malkavian and realize how brilliant the writers where. Personally I have lost count of the number of times I have played this game, and I STILL find new little things I never noticed before. A single line here and there that make me go.. wait.. did he say? But that is a very clever hint about what is to happen. Or simply to replay as a Malk, lets face it arguing with stop signs, having your character blurt out lines that make you go.. wait what did she just say? Eh.. I have no clue but it is awesome!Seriously if you love non sparkly vampires that prefers to solve their problems by shoving a cross up someone's♥♥♥♥♥ bash in their skull and skin them.. then what are you waiting for??

												I have always loved this game. I played it sometime ago and got really inspired with the idea of vampires having different bloodlines and so on. The story to it is really good, but you need to download a mod to fix many of the issues it has when trying to work on newer systems.Best advice is to avoid Nosferatu as you don't look human the slightest and you will break the masquarade many times due to being a big ugly beast walking around the city.

I nominated it for the ""Test Of Time"" Award, and while I had to fight with myself for a while over that due to the mountain of bugs that plague this game, it really has stood the test for me. I wholeheartedly say this is my favouite game, and its story, characters and world haven't been matched by almost any games I've played. So download the unofficial patch and play the damn thing.			"

												This game is such a mixed bag; I can't bring myself to dislike it, but in order to actually get it in a decent working order I had to download a mod. Then the mod didn't work and I had to download another one. Then the game crashed. Then it crashed again. Then I was at the tutorial and an npc did not spawn. The steam playtime is a complete lie, as said mod creates a different shortcut on your computer.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines, holy crap; that title is so long (enchanced edition) is the one game that I completely and totally forgive for making me jump through so many hoops in order to get started, and I'm including the original Witcher game when I say this.Gameplay is nothing special, but it's functional. You can stealth, speech, shoot and melee your way through any situation. It's pretty varied. I'm not going to say you can use any of these in any situation, but the flexibility reminded me of DeusEx, and that's always a good thing.The writing, however, is what makes this game into something really special. Dialogue options that only like 5% of the playerbase would ever get to see on one playthrough are actually the norm here - yes, the writers were actually that dedicated.Every character is incredibly interesting, there's a lot of funny, bizarre and unique situations in every hub and overall it's just been a while since i've found a game that made me forgive it's general mediocrity because it nailed a few aspects so well. You need patience if you're going to buy this game. It's worth it. I'm really hoping they revisit the Vampire: The Masquerade universe at some point; maybe with the new world of darkness?			"

												""The blood of Cain controls your fate""What a game, what an absolutely amazing cult classic, a gem. Originally an unfinished mess with lots of bugs, the community patch has improved this to a point where you can enjoy it to its full potential. Not to mention you get cut content as well.Dialogue 10/10The dialogue in this game is very well thought out. Each vampire clan has its own dialogue and intricacies in gameplay that a playthrough is never the same. Malkavians are the crazy ones, talking in riddles whereas the Nosferatu are the monster Vampires that have to hide from society or be shot on sight. There are lots of dialogue options here and the skills you can get for your characters heavily influence the direction of each conversation. Graphics 7/10To me graphics in such a game are not very important. It's a game from 2004 running on the source engine, it's expected to look quite aged but make no mistake here, the art direction is beautiful as well as the environments are designed in such a way that almost every quest can be completed in a different way. There are some lightning and texture bugs but that could be an isolated case on my end.Gameplay 9/10The gameplay immediately pulls you in from the start. Each vampire clan has its own powers and it's up to your choice on how to play and approach each situation, unlike a certain very popular ""RPG"". Will you try the diplomatic route and talk your enemies to death/surrender, try to make the enemies fight each other, maybe sneak past them because you decided to take a hidden path or will you make them explode in a gory mess of blood and guts as soon as you see them? It's up to you! However, your vampirice powers aren't unlimited, you are expected to feed from humans(or other things...) and drink their blood to sustain yourself, as a proper vampire would!My only complaint here is that towards the end of the game, you don't get much choice in the matter and you HAVE to resort to combat but that's clearly an indication of the financial problems that Troika Games faced back then. I still have to put it out there though.What is more, you can't go around town and destroy people with your awesome vampiric powers without consequences. You have to uphold the Masquerade, a set of rules in the vampire community. Betray the Masquerade and face what's to come.Keep in mind that there's no hand holding in this game. You have to solve the quests yourself, the puzzles yourself, read the quest text and use your brain. Oh that security door is locked huh? What if there's a password around here somewhere or maybe I can bypass it by returning to the apartment and find a clue on my email. The possibilities are endless in this game, I can't stress enough how good the questing is. There is no minimap either, you'll have to remember the layouts of each area. Personally I love this, it's been quite a while since I played an RPG that wasn't a mindless follow the objective arrow simulator and it's been a breath of fresh air. Audio 9/10The music is excellent in this game. It really gives you chills when you hear Cain by Tiamat for the first time, the music immediately immerses you into the depraved, corrupted world of Vampire the Masquerade. Each piece of music and sound is specifically crafted and chosen in such a way as to make you think about what's really going on, if what you're doing is right or wrong. It really fits the vampiric theme and I can't stop listening to the soundtrack of this game. My complaints here are that the gun sounds are not very good. Conclusion: I can't recommend this enough to RPG lovers. If you can put up with older graphics and gameplay quirks(no map or magical arrow that points to the quest, you have to do the reading and thinking yourself here), you will absolutely love this. Remember to download the latest community patch!P.S A certain main quest in the game will remain in your memory forever. It didn't get an award for one of the best levels in gaming for nothing. "

The voice acting superb. The hunted house level is a gem. The game is totally worth playing even when you have to put up with the multiple bugs. Save often.

It's easy to see why so many consider this to be a cult classic, though you should be prepared for the occasional bug.Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines delivers the creepy feel of Vampiric nightlife, without relying on gimmicky jump scares and disgusting faces, instead focusing on offering an atmosphere of darkness and mystery, accompanied by a soundtrack that supports it.This is definitely a game that deserves an HD rerelease.If you are put off by the occasional bug, such as doors not unlocking properly, you may get frustrated by this game.Looking past that, however, this game makes you feel like you actually gain something from most of the quests given to you. Like most games of this type, however, your choices don't seem to impact the quest-to-quest style, however you do get a few choices of ending based on what you do throughout, which is pretty cool.There are definitely characters that feel under-utilised, but for the most part, characters within were fun and interesting, and most left you wanting to help them (and sometimes hinder). The dialogue options for the vast majority of the game were varied and intriguing, though your options are different depending on your clan, and your skills.Another thing to note is that each clan makes your playthrough different in some significant ways, such as ""racial tension"" each clan has their own reputation and may be viewed with disdain or awe depending on who you deal with, and the choice of clan you make can change your entire experience in the game.Further, this game doesn't fall into the usual pitfall of simple race and class mechanics. Sure, some clans excel at certain things that others don't, but for the most part you are able to customise yourself to be able to fill the roles you want, though there are extreme classes that restrict specific aspects of your character. It actually feels like your choice of clan doesn't dictate entirely who you are, merely your initial strengths and weaknesses.The absolute best part of this game though, is that it doesn't make Vampires boring. Not all vampires are the same, they're given personality. It actually feels like the undead have lives.(It's recommended to get the Unofficial Patch, to support your gaming experience)			"

												""The blood of Cain controls your fate""What a game, what an absolutely amazing cult classic, a gem. Originally an unfinished mess with lots of bugs, the community patch has improved this to a point where you can enjoy it to its full potential. Not to mention you get cut content as well.Dialogue 10/10The dialogue in this game is very well thought out. Each vampire clan has its own dialogue and intricacies in gameplay that a playthrough is never the same. Malkavians are the crazy ones, talking in riddles whereas the Nosferatu are the monster Vampires that have to hide from society or be shot on sight. There are lots of dialogue options here and the skills you can get for your characters heavily influence the direction of each conversation. Graphics 7/10To me graphics in such a game are not very important. It's a game from 2004 running on the source engine, it's expected to look quite aged but make no mistake here, the art direction is beautiful as well as the environments are designed in such a way that almost every quest can be completed in a different way. There are some lightning and texture bugs but that could be an isolated case on my end.Gameplay 9/10The gameplay immediately pulls you in from the start. Each vampire clan has its own powers and it's up to your choice on how to play and approach each situation, unlike a certain very popular ""RPG"". Will you try the diplomatic route and talk your enemies to death/surrender, try to make the enemies fight each other, maybe sneak past them because you decided to take a hidden path or will you make them explode in a gory mess of blood and guts as soon as you see them? It's up to you! However, your vampirice powers aren't unlimited, you are expected to feed from humans(or other things...) and drink their blood to sustain yourself, as a proper vampire would!My only complaint here is that towards the end of the game, you don't get much choice in the matter and you HAVE to resort to combat but that's clearly an indication of the financial problems that Troika Games faced back then. I still have to put it out there though.What is more, you can't go around town and destroy people with your awesome vampiric powers without consequences. You have to uphold the Masquerade, a set of rules in the vampire community. Betray the Masquerade and face what's to come.Keep in mind that there's no hand holding in this game. You have to solve the quests yourself, the puzzles yourself, read the quest text and use your brain. Oh that security door is locked huh? What if there's a password around here somewhere or maybe I can bypass it by returning to the apartment and find a clue on my email. The possibilities are endless in this game, I can't stress enough how good the questing is. There is no minimap either, you'll have to remember the layouts of each area. Personally I love this, it's been quite a while since I played an RPG that wasn't a mindless follow the objective arrow simulator and it's been a breath of fresh air. Audio 9/10The music is excellent in this game. It really gives you chills when you hear Cain by Tiamat for the first time, the music immediately immerses you into the depraved, corrupted world of Vampire the Masquerade. Each piece of music and sound is specifically crafted and chosen in such a way as to make you think about what's really going on, if what you're doing is right or wrong. It really fits the vampiric theme and I can't stop listening to the soundtrack of this game. My complaints here are that the gun sounds are not very good. Conclusion: I can't recommend this enough to RPG lovers. If you can put up with older graphics and gameplay quirks(no map or magical arrow that points to the quest, you have to do the reading and thinking yourself here), you will absolutely love this. Remember to download the latest community patch!P.S A certain main quest in the game will remain in your memory forever. It didn't get an award for one of the best levels in gaming for nothing. "

												So, apparently I have to review a game I nominated to level up my badge, and I can't really think of a better one than this. I nominated it for the ""Test Of Time"" Award, and while I had to fight with myself for a while over that due to the mountain of bugs that plague this game, it really has stood the test for me. I wholeheartedly say this is my favouite game, and its story, characters and world haven't been matched by almost any games I've played. So download the unofficial patch and play the damn thing.			"

												Time hasn't been kind to the graphics, but this remains one of the best CRPGs to ever grace a hard drive. Amazing, interesting characters fill a dark and compelling setting brought to life by an incredible soundtrack. The story is brilliant and well-written: both the main story arc and sidequests are far beyond what most studios put out these days.The game does suffer in the third act -- it was rushed out of production and it shows, painfully -- but the last levels are a small price to pay for the first three-quarters of the game. Be sure to look for the unofficial patch, as it remedies a number of bugs and salvages content cut from the final release.			"

I've personally put many playthroughs into it with the different clans (the malkavian and nosferatu completely changing the game) providing new stratergies and tactics avalible, the mods certainly help to further on the game. One of the best RPGs going.			"

												A word of warning for Windows 7 users, this game isn't immediately compatible, however, this *very* useful thread exists, which should clear up any issues: http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035The story is fairly contemporary as far as vampire fiction goes; vampires have to keep their existence among humans a secret otherwise the 'normals' will catch on and exterminate them. This effectively means you are given a number of 'strikes' before it's game over, making gameplay more about sneaking and persuading than going on a Blade-style romp through Los Angeles.There are multiple different types of vampire you can become, although all feel somewhat impotent when it comes to combat, which is an inelegant third-person ordeal.After you get bitten and find yourself in a power struggle between the elite and the renegades, the game is essentially a linear (although enjoyable) path with multiple variations of what may feel like a joke ending.The voices sound a tad echoey, but the soundtrack is more than atmospheric enough to overlook this.Overall, it doesn't suck.

												While not a perfect RPG, it does do its job well by providing interesting story and characters to the player. It is the cRPG that really bolstered my interest in the Tabletop RPG and even my interest in the original Vampire the Masquerade pen and paper roleplay.The game has terrific characters, dialogue, and atmosphere. It really does feel like I am a Vampire, being made a pawn in a big game of Chess. And I happen to be one of many gray pieces. While the combat is very lacking, and the overall story could have used some polish, this game is still nonetheless a must play for any die hard RPG fan.One of my favorite games to play from time to time and a classic.

												I played this game almost ten years ago... ten years is a long time to still think about a game, and I do. Why? The story does a good job of making you feel like it's YOU in the game, that your fate has been forced on you, that you're the one gett screwed over when your character is. The storyline is very strong and your choices MATTER. They matter the way they do in the Original Dragon Age, depending on your choices NPCs will treat you differently, you get different outcomes/endings, you can actually have repercurssions to your character if you're an a-hole all game long.  These guys were way ahead of their time, even still in the games released 10 years later it's hard to find a game engine with facial expressions that don't look like ""the sims"", Vampire Bloodines was one of those games where the devs put a LOT of work into the facial expressions. The only negative about this game are the graphics, but then again, 10 years was a long time ago.			"

The story to it is really good, but you need to download a mod to fix many of the issues it has when trying to work on newer systems.Best advice is to avoid Nosferatu as you don't look human the slightest and you will break the masquarade many times due to being a big ugly beast walking around the city.

												Steam version works well. Game is still very glitchy. You will likely need to do a few things to get the game to run on a newer machine, which includes disabling Auto-Updates and installing the unofficial patch.Win7 users will need to periodically modify their save file to allow for indexing (turn it off, then turn it back on, wheeee) or the game will not be able to find your latest saves. If you hit ""Load"" and you hear the load sound effect glitch over and over, you have run into this problem and will see outdated saves magically appear in the queue. Good luck!That said, the game is still very fun when it wasn't busy crashing. Or the random number generator wasn't deciding that combat just wasn't going to work for me that day.  I gladly wasted a lot of hours on it.If I had a complaint, really, it would be that the writing downright horrible. Normally I would let that sort of thing go without saying, but there is literally a section in which the radio host makes fun of freelance writers saying that they should leave it to the professionals with degrees. Which would be all good and well if these professionals hadn't written a low-grade ""Matrix"" plot I would have possibly found cool at the ripe age of 15 and no later. I mean, they literally pull the ""it doesn't work like in the movies"" line half a dozen times to excuse changes to vampires made for convenience sake and naught else. Crosses don't work, but faith does? Magic exists, but everything is scientific? Five minutes into the game I have a hairy hobo fellating me while giving me the basics and pretending he's the cool one of the group. The motivations of each ""faction"" leader boil down to ""be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" with almost no pretext as to why. There is literally one character who is supposed to be a Japanese tearaway speaking in broken English. But her accent is firmly American, most of the dialogue is written with English grammar in mind, and there are literally no words that can be confused for others given the context. Not to mention that all the endings are anticlimactic AND melodramatic, somehow at the same time. I just...if you're gonna kick sand in someone's face, just make sure to back it up with something that isn't just a turd sandwich, okay?Anyway, great game overall. Game play is great, balance is iffy, writing is awful, and it is so unstable you will need to mod it, patch it, tweak it, and pray over it to get it to run.Or as I like to call it, PC gaming. And I wouldn't have it any other way.			"

												Probably the best RPG game I've ever played. Despite restrictive and shallow combat, and too many instances in which such combat is forced, the story telling, atmosphere and characacters manage to make up for flawed design (due to it's rushed/troubled production).9.5/10 would play  Malkavian and slowly go insane while talking to a television again "

												Hello LA, you're up way past your bed time, aren't you? Hope you've slipped into something comfortable, I know I have. If you're new to town or just new to this whole radio thing, you're listening to The Deb of Night, the only girl who will spend the night with you and leave first thing in the morning, guaranteed. Well, looks like the boards are lighting up! Aren't I the popular one? Lets see, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, who will be the lucky... caller, you've got the first shot at Deb tonight! So who do I have the pleasure of speaking to? Hi Deb, this is... uh, Vigo. Vigo. So... Vigo, why are you up so late? Uhm, I'm working the night shift here at the... uh, yacht club. Aha. How many boats do you own, Vigo? >Two, actually three. Uhm, one is... in the shop. I used to do a little yachting myself, what kind of yacht do you have? Uhm... you probably wouldn't know the brand, I... uh, bought them in Italy. Ah, l'Italia bella. Parlate Italiano? Uhm... yes. Arrivederci, Vigo. Caller two, you're on The Deb of Night. Be gentle. Hi Deb. Hello caller. Hi Deb. Is tonight a re-run? Deb?Money troubles? Need cash quick? Why not try mugging someone? These are exactly the kind of questions that criminals are asking themselves right now. Did you know that the government requires you to wait ten days for a gun? Why, in that time a criminal could kill your family fifty times over. So how does a law-abiding citizen like yourself get a theft-deterrent system in their hands in the next hour? Come to Loophole Lenny's! We've got antique military weaponry from blunderbusses to World War One grenades. Modern muggers may be stronger and faster than they used to be, but that doesn't mean they can take a slug fired by a Civil War era pistol any better. And if you're the kind of person that can't sleep at night knowing serial rapists might be in your front yard, we've got German sniper rifles approved by the Kaiser himself that'll make picking them off one by one from the safety of your roof no problem.

												Ibuki accidentaly killed a hooker by sucking too much. I thought hookers were supposed to do that? Also everyone's boobs are huuuuuge like basketball sized (jealous). When I first entered the Oceanview hotel and realized I could be killed by all the flying objects plus the constant jump scare Ibuki quickly alt tabbed out of it to breathe as I was holding my breathe for a long time trying not to laugh at the animations. Once I was out of that haunted house ride I then was presented with options on how to progress the quest. Jeanette wanted to play with the object I received, but so did Ibuki, but she stole it from me and then later Theresa got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at Ibuki for allowing her to steal Ibuki's new toy. Then I fell asleep and woke up and danced like I was imitating the gorilla mating call out on the floor. The rest of the time I was running around killing random people and talking through words that had not occured to me until the voices told me to say those things. Overall, it was nice trip.			"

												Bloodlines was a game ahead of its time with a fairly complex & in-depth storyline full of both drama & dark humor oriented to a more mature-audience. It contained a plethora of (sometimes hidden) content & alternatives dependant upon your chosen character's build/evolution (skills & abilities) as well as roleplaying actions & dialogue choices, revealing possibilities for more diverse interactions with non-player characters, finding items (Magical Swords to Flaemthrowers), unlocking additional story/quest options & finaly determining which alternate ending you experience. Even selecting a different clan offered unique additional alternatives & possibilities for added replay value (admittedly some clans offered much more additional content and a far more unique experience: Clan Malkavian). Unfortunately, when Bloodlines was released, it masqueraded as a rushed & bug-ridden mess, often frustrating at best & unplayable (literally) at worst. It took years of hard work by devoted fans who looked beneath the original facade to discover an actual treasure and reveal it to the rest of the world, carefully removing the bugs & even unlocking lost content the original programers created but left unfinished, yet hidden within. Years later it emerged in an updated version, cleansed, even improved, with lost/unfinished content restored & to this date, numerous player-made mods still being created by an active community fanbase.  The original advertising along with some of the more overt tragically (pseudo) hip stereotypes & soap-opera cliche's, often straight from the origianl pen & papper/live-action roleplaying books, didn't do anything to help entice the more mature audience the game was originally aiming for; however, the machiavellian plotlines, diverse characters from both ancient times to the modern nights, & the dark but fascinating merging of real-world history with the supernatural entities, timeless conspiracies & endless Jihad of the World of Darkness made this into the lasting classic it has become.

												Easily one of my three favourite games of all time. Forget all you think you know about vampires, this is the White Wolf universe, a beast on it's own class. This is one extremely well written, engrossing, seductive and replayable game; it does and tells just the right things to keep you coming back. I won't lie though, it's buggy as hell due to a rushed release, but there are fan-made patches for that problem.  Having said this, the fact  people are playing this game extensively decades after it's release even despite the bugs should at least make you curious (The patches are being updated even now). I don't wish to spoil, so if you want to see what I mean, look at my screenshots.If you do get it, say hi to Beckett for me.			"

												VTMB is a hidden gem in the RPG genre. Not a lot of people know about it, partially because it has some flaws which are off putting to some. It runs on an early version of the Source engine, which is just so sucky and glitchy. Another flaw is combat. It can be a bit boring and way to difficult, especially melee because it is clunky and awkward. There is supposed to be a system of pushing directional keys to vary your swings, but it doesn't work well. I high recommend playing a gun-wielding character. However, in the long run, combat is mostly avoidable (more on that later), so it doesn't matter too much.Other than that, this game is perfect. You get to play as a vampire for one thing, which is awsome. I know of no RPG like this except Oblivion, but those aren't real vampires in that game. The world's lore about secret vampire societies and laws is really well thought out and interesting. The sheer amount of it shows you how much work the developers put into the game. Another great feature is the story. I just felt that it was really cool and interesting. It's very subtle and mature without being too long-winded. The dialouge is really awesome as well. In fact, both the voice acting AND the writting of the characters made me feel like I was watching a movie or reading a novel. The gameplay and rules system is also extremely well done. You're assigned experience for completeing goals. Thats it. No XP from killing things. A lot of RPG's award too much XP for killing, and as a result you're actually punished for finding alternate soloutions because you'll be under leveled. In VTMB, there are always multiple ways to finish a quest. You could be a cowboy and fight your way through it, or you could look around for a way to sneak in. Or maybe you can hack a computer? Don't forget charming, persuading, or intimidating people to get your way. You're allowed to play any way you want and have tons of freedom. More RPG's need to be this way. All things considered, VTMB is an awesome game that compensates for it's flaws with a legendary story and backdrop. It's a must have for RPG fans who like vampires.			"

												To be clear, I ONLY reccomend this game if you're willing to go through a bunch of technical crap to even get it functioning. And even then, you're not completely safe. I had to restart my first playthrough because of a gamebreaking bug.Aside from that, this is an excellent RPG that really immerses you despite being 12 years old. It's definately worth a buy if you're willing to go through the hassle to make it not broken.			"

Now, many years later I picked it up, installed some high res mods and booted it up to see what it was like.I played through it 4 times on the trot to see the different character developments, endings, different clan powers and whatnot. It is absolutely brilliant.You'll have to accept dated graphics, but the voice acting and everything else is superb.			"

												The GoodIt's like Deus Ex but instead of an augmented govt agent who can't aim for♥♥♥♥♥♥you're a vampire, who also can't aim for♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's a whole slew of politics, lore, and tons of dialouge options and methods for going about your objectives. Sneaking or coercing people with seduction, intimidation, hacking, melee and firearm combat, sprawling open area levels, this game has a lot of paralells with that old doos sex. The BadHoly ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥these ♥♥♥♥ing bugs. Imagine clicking a door to open it and walking through. The door opens slowly so you burst through it when it's finally fully open. only problem is if you touch the ♥♥♥♥ing door before it's open all the way it stops ♥♥♥♥ing dead and goes in reverse against you. Stuck in enemy territory? You better crouch all the time because if you stand up everyone will see you THROUGH THE ♥♥♥♥ING WALLS and fire at you with pinpoint accuracy THROUGH THE ♥♥♥♥ING WALLS. I didn't relaize I was playing MLG counter strike, give me a ♥♥♥♥ing break. Sneaking in general isn't very well implimented. As long as I'm crouching an enemy can look directly at me but since I'm maybe twenty feet away they don't see my pale vampire skin, but you better not ♥♥♥♥ing stand for even a second. I can really appreciate all the effort Deus Ex HR did in giving me tons of options to circumvent combat.The biggest problem of all is this though: As soon as an object touches the periphery of the screen the texture for it dissapears. This includes ceiling, wall, and floor titles. Every twenty seconds my immersion is shattered as suddenly the ceiling dissapears revealing the night sky (from indoors) or a huge ground tile goes completely black but the grass tendrils remain in tact on top. You see this lamp? Watch it dissapear completely as soon as just a pixel of it hits the side of my monitor. This is Sonic Boom levels of grafix. Go ahead and tell me I just need to git gud. Then compare my 4000+ achievements to your piddly dip total--and tell your mom to stop calling me.			"

												I love this game, loved the storyline, loved the mechanics. It's an old game but I don't mind how outdated the graphics and stuff is. The characters are great, the quests are fun, and it's enjoyable. Wasn't a huge fan of the endings, because all of them feel rushed and sorta anti-climatic-- I was really hoping for a boss fight with whatever was in the coffin, or at least hoping to become the next Prince. But it was  fun anyways.The one uncomfortable thing is all the weird racism in this. It's from a decade ago, and what was acceptable in the media was different I guess, but I still can't imagine how the creators thought this stuff was okay. The storyline does centrally feature a lot of anti-asian xenophobia and a couple black stereotypes. I think it's supposed to be funny, but it's just really awkward and gross. It's too bad that such a fun game is packed with so many harmful stereotypes. Just something to be aware of.			"

												Came into this game with high hopes and was not dissapointed. Recently finished a first Toreador playthrough without the unofficial patch and have downloaded the patch for current and subsequent playthroughs. Even without the patch to 'finish' the game there isn't anything quite like it that I have played. Half-way through the game I would have put this in my top 10 RPGs, now having finished it has grown infinitely in my eyes and earns a spot in the top 5. With 30 hrs put into the game, I don't doubt that number is going to grow and grow. My advice to anyone having doubts about this amazing game is... Buy it!			"

												Pixelated garbage from the past. The story is OK, but no one ain't playing this just because of it, as if it were be a text-based game as the graphics are obviously cringy. The fact is that it was done in that early 3D era when the transition from 2D to 3D games looked a bit funny, out of proportions and messed up in physics. Aside from the historic mark of setting the famous storytelling RPG into the videogames world, it's just a really poor game praised by nostalgic hipsters.			"

Its got a great story, good amount of consequence for choices made to give you different endings and such.  Not the best at anything it does but it does everything well enough to get you emersed in the game and doing your vampire thing.  Also I must say this might be the only video game thats ever scared/creeped me out durring the haunted hotel missions lol.  Play at night with all the lights off! Edit: While this is on sale I just have to say how worth it this game is, despite minor sound issues this is one of the best RPG around.			"

												I'm not really sure if I recommend this game or not, honestly. Gameplay is fantasic, a great RPG that I could really get lost in and very captivating. A masterpeice of it's time and by far, one of my favorites.On the otherhand, I bought this off Steam and figured out that it didn't already work when I did. I forked out the money I probably didn't have, just to play this game. But after the long wait for the download, I encountered an error. Apperently I had to install an unoffical patch, which I did. It didn't end there though, I still had the error so I went on many forms and such doing everything I could to try and fix this game just so it'd work. I uninstalled and reinstalled so many things before finally giving up at the realization that no matter how many friends I had trying to help me, it just refused to work.I've spent hours frusteratingly, trying to just play this game that I bought, and still it did not work.So if you can get it to work, I definately say go for it. But know there's the risk that it wont. I say you'd have better luck just pirating it, unfortunately. :/			"

												Masquerade is not a bad game. It's about being a vampire and the feuds between the various races of the night. Only problem is that the story runs a bit slow and you may quickly become tired of playing the game because of missions being very alike. Another thing is that it is always night and therefore and the night life is very quiet, not alot going on unless you enter a club which is also the same in every club.The vampire races and their abillities though are very cool and fun to experience.

												Genre : 1PRPG - 1st Person RPGThis would deserve to be in my favorite game of all times - if only for one thing - the original game was released with a slightly rushed ending - some of the questing and branching options as well as half working vampire classes but it was still a very unique and awesome game. I thought that with games like system shock 2 getting heavily patched since their entry into steam, that this game would be receiving a similar treatment, but strangely enough it did not, thankfully the steam forums are full of links to download unnfocial patches and mods, but with competition offering drm free executables pre patched and hassle-free, I feel rather cheated - what is going on here - why is this version not being kept up to snuff...That i my only gripe - this is a very - very memorable game other reviews will attest to this.Hope this game gets the patching attention it deserves.

												STEAM IS SELLING THIS GAME UNPATCHED....that is, it will not load, and you will not be able to play.As incredible as this statement might seem to us, I feel it must be said again!THIS GAME, AS IT IS CURRENTLY BEING SOLD, WILL NOT LAUNCH, FOR ANYONE.Now, there are loads of guides that tell you how easy it is to patch and fix and get running on a modern rig....but my question is, why should I have to do that?Shouldn't the devs patch their own game if they want to sell it?Shouldn't Steam check that the game at least launches before they take their cut of the proceeds?At the moment, this is just a Steam Refund Simulator...and a good one at that.P.S. Steam won't allow reviews if you've played less than 5 minutes...but a failure to launch is surely worthy of a bad review right?....""Luckily"", Steam counts a failed attempt to play the game as about a minute of playtime, even though the failed launch only takes a few seconds. So I had to try to launch about 8 times to accumulate the 5 mins ""playtime"" you can see, so that Icould post this.			"

												Bloodlines is another one of those games I have where it is really difficult to decide whether to say yes or no to a recommendation. Sure it's quite dated by now but even when it was released it wasn't a marvel of first person role-playing games by any means (in fact it barely worked back then). Since its release many, MANY patches have been released by the fan community which almost make it a good game but it falls short because, at its core, it is flawed. You can't fix a games core mechanics.Combat is awful. It wouldn't be as big of a deal if you could talk your way or sneak your way through all of the game but you can't. There are some missions which force you to fight and if you didn't put enough stats into combat for your Ventrue super-persuadertron sex machine, you will have to start the game over. The ranged weapons don't have any punch to them and melee combat basically involves exchanging blows and hoping your enemy runs out of health before you do. Make sure you put enough points into soak and dodge or you won't make it very far.Like a lot of the action rpg's of the era, the world is lifeless and hollow which is surprising considering this is the company that made Arcanum. That is more of a technological limitation I suppose but if you look at, say, Deus Ex... they managed to make the world in that game feel alive and active with even less hardware power. Part of it could be that they built the game in the old Half-Life 2 Source Engine which really wasn't made for role playing games... but then you look at Dark Messiah which by no means is a real RPG but they nailed melee combat so much better than Vampire does.Visually it's not bad for when it was made and there are new texture packs that update it a bit. The hub cities kind of look like 20 different people designed a different part of it and then they sewed it together at the end. Interior areas aren't bad. Sparsely furnished and not very immersive (you're telling me 4 people go to the only club on town on the weekend?) but, again, that's just a sign of the times.The different dialog choices are where this game shines and you can tell they put a lot of time into mapping out different paths you could take with every major NPC. The script and voice acting are garbagebag, unfortunately, but video games didn't start hiring Keifer Sutherland and Patrick Stewart until later. Listening to a low-talent white actor try to portray a black hoodlum is epic cringe so I guess there's some merit there.The inventory system is atrocious but like I said, Source wasn't really built for RPG's. Switching weapons mid-combat is dangerous and time consuming. The weapon choices are pretty uninspiring and don't really have much of a variety in what they do. You have guns which all do pretty much the same thing and melee weapons with which if you have the strength for the better one, it's always the one you're going to use.The variety in dialogue based on which clan you are, your humanity rating, and your skills as well as the variety in quests are really what make this game shine for me. It is fun to play at times... experimenting with what different dialogue choices or actions will do... but it just doesn't have much of a payoff gameplay-wise.When it's difficult for me to say yes or no to a game it comes down to am I going to have the patience to finish the game. I really doubt it with this one. I've owned it for almost a decade and I've never gotten past the second hub because it's so boring and broken. I know there are a ton of fanboys out there who will disagree and probably give this review tons of ""unhelpful"" ratings (if anyone even sees it, this game is old AF) but, you know... fanboys are always wrong.

Either buy the original on amazon if you have an old enough computer or it it from gog or any where else and do the unofficial update, but do not buy it from steam. Pure garbage.

												Quite possibly the most under-rated RPG ever in the history of PC gaming. Sure, this game IS unfinished and broken in several places, BUT there are now unofficial patches that fix 99 per cent of the bugs. The story is truly awesome, the amount of work that went into this game is staggering, this is a great example of a game YEARS ahead of its time, and still holds up today. One of the few games that can actually ""give me the willies"", the atmosphere is astonishing for a game this old, the voice cast are in incredible form here too, every character is believeable. This is a game that will linger long in the memory, and you WILL want to play it again, just to be back in that world, where the ""creatures of the night"" rule. Without the patches 7/10, with the patches 9/10.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines is a wonderful game to play- and a terrible pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to get running on Steam. Normally I would talk about the strengths of the game itself (which are considerable), only in this case to actually get to the game you'll have to go through a considerable amount of aggravation to make it function properly. It does not play nice with newer operating systems, and patching and tweaking the thing to work is aggravating. You'll find plenty to like if you have the patience to make it work; I do not. Activision dumped this thing on Steam, not knowing or caring that it wasn't going to be compatible with most of its purchasers' hardware. Don't reward them for treating their customers with contempt.			"

												I would love to reccommend this game to everyone. You have no idea how much joy it would bring me to tell every PC gamer I know that there was another great Action RPG they never played. I want to like this game. I realllllllllly do. But I just can't ignore the fact that this game has problems, and I mean ALOT of problems. I'm not even going to touch on the fact that the game is basically unfinished and even modded out the bum, still glitchy as all hell. This game is HORRIBLY unbalanced in terms of RPG stats. Good luck finding any ammo if you built a gunfighter, cause a word of advice, in the first 3rd or so of the game, there isn't any. Good luck earning money to buy armor so you don't die from so much as a gnat brushing past your shoulder, because there isn't any. Money, I mean not gnats. Combat feels extremely clunky and unsatisfying. You can be an all powerful Vampire decked out with powers and holding a shotgun and easily takes down by a thug with a knife. While there are multiple solutions to problems, there arent enough given the large amount of skills present in the game. And don't be surprised when your silver-tounged computer whiz gets locked in a room with a giant blob monster you have to defeat. A blob monster only weak to edged weapons. As far as Action RPGs go, I would much more highly recommend Deus Ex, Fallout 3, or System Shock 2. Those games feel all around more complete and you aren't gritting your teeth the whole way through. However, I can definately see why it's considered a cult classic and beloved by a section of PC gamers. The RPG elements, while unbalanced, are incredibly deep and allow you to build a multitude of characters (even if most of them end up completely useless). The way the game immerses you into the rich setting and intresting story is really something to behold. Character Interactions in paticular are well done and allow you to complete conversations with completely diffrent outcomes, adding to replayability. It's just a shame the game was rushed out or it could've been one of the greatest of all time. But execution counts for everything, and unfourtanetly, this Vampire stepped out into daylight.			"

												I wish I could recommend this game. I really,  really  wish I could. I love the World of Darkness setting from playing the pen-and-paper games as a kid, and some parts of this game are really great. It's just the bad parts really spoil those good parts, and tainted my enjoyment of what preceeded them too much.You'll likely already know that this game was shipped in a terrible state. It's one of the first things you hear when it's recommended to you; ""You should totally play it! ...But install this huge fan-made patch first, because otherwise it's borderline unplayable."" That I could live with - it's not as heavy duty as the Morrowind overhaul, for example - but I'd argue that it still doesn't turn VTM from an unfinished game into a ""finished"" one, it just turns it into a ""completeable"" one. Yes you can get to the end of the game (even if it takes a console command or two), but at about the 3/4 mark the game just collapses in a way that the fan patch cannot fix.Up until that point the game is structured very much like  Deus Ex  or  Dishonored  - a lot of ways to complete the quests, and using means other than brute force is actively encouraged. But past a certain point (  for those of you who've played the game, yes I'm talking about the Hallowbrook Hotel, but the Blood Plague and Tzimisce monsters aren't exactly a barrel of laughs either  ) it becomes nothing but straightforward combat and boss fights. I was playing as a Nosferatu, the stealth-oriented clan, and investing a ton of XP into getting my invisibility powers to maximum only for the enemies to suddenly all have the ability to see through it, and all the levels become corridors so you can't sneak past them either was infuriating. I usually frown upon people who insist upon playing games with ""optimal builds"" but having the game allow you to paint yourself into a corner like this just makes you feel like a chump for having played creatively until that point. Thank goodness I wasn't playing as a social character, otherwise I'd have really been screwed!In the end there really is a lot to like about VTM, and some moments you won't see in a lot of other games, but with the game itself having done its level best to invalidate that enjoyment, I find that what I was really enjoying was the game it could have been, the game it ended up being.

												To be clear, I played this game with the update 96 patch. I like this setting and I like what they were attempting to do; essentially, Deus Ex meets World of Darkness. However, despite releasing after DE, it really only seems to do atmosphere, story, and characters right. The combat feels awful regardless of going melee or ranged. Stealth feels clunky and ineffective, as far as I've used it with Nosferatu. The story, having played to chapter 3 at a different time, feels incredibly railroaded. I took a different route this most recent playthrough, threatened Therese, ""NO ONE THREATENS ME AND GETS AWAY WITH IT!""; I was then handed my next stock mission like nothing happened, as with every other playthrough. COME ON - GIVE ME A BOSS FIGHT OR SOMETHING. Dragon Age: Origins did this type of 'A-hole' playthrough better when you talked♥♥♥♥♥♥to people.I can't imagine what people see in this game other than the setting. All it makes me want to do is play Deus Ex again, which came first and somehow did all of the gameplay mechanics better.			"

												From what I'd heard about this game I was expecting a diamond in the rough, a cult classic from yesteryear.....Hmnn, not quite....People talk about this game like it's Deus Ex with vampires - a world where you can pick and match gameplay styles, be stealthy or be brutal, or influence things through conversation. And maybe it is those things, but if you look at my playtime it will be obvious I don't care to find out!First of all: it looks incredibly ropey. Graphics aren't everything, but beyond the ugly looks it's also hard to take the stealth seriously when your character's stealthy walk animation seems like they're desperately holding in a poo....Second problem: the combat is pretty woeful, and consists of you either (a) directly fighting the enemy, which basically involves flailing about until the enemy drops dead, or (b) doing sneak attacks where the enemy gives you all the time in the world as they gaze at their shoes, or at an interesting speck of dirt on the floor, or are mentally distracted as they  wonder if they left home without turning the oven off. For whatever reason they spend a huge amount of time not paying any attention to their surroundings - most stealth games choreograph their AI behaviour in this manner upto a point, but it's pretty simply implemented here.Though this may improve over time it still leaves a bad impression. Having said that...at least that helps with stealth, except it doesn't because the stealth is crap.I only managed to get through that part of the  tutorial (!!) thanks to the AI doing something stupid. It took about twenty attempts just to sneak past some vampire who absolutely refused to look at anywhere but the spot I had to go past (which was the only possible route!)....until for some inexpicable reason he didn't notice me, despite doing exactly the same thing on the previous nineteen attempts....If stealth is a gameplay choice, then I choose not to, thanks! Because it totally sucks here! And that was just the tutorial...Third problem: To hear about this game it sounds brilliantly told, with amazing dialogue and an intriguing take on vampires. I certainly didn't experience anything like that - it was passable stuff, but nothing particularly special or gripping. To be fair though, the voice acting is pretty decent.Overall I got the impression that to love it in this day and age you have to have nostalgia from playing it before - as someone who only just played it I found it to be somewhat overrated. Yes it's old and is therefore understandably not as slick as modern games, but that's not a problem so much as the fact it just doesn't seem very good. I played System Shock 2 fairly recently and that's old, and not much of a looker, yet it still deserves it's status as a classic. I know Bloodlines was an ambitious title released by a developer that maybe lacked the talent and / or budget to do it justice, but knowing that doesn't change the fact I don't want to play it anymore after an hour and a half.....

												I gave this game a second chance after leaving a bad review about a year ago. I thought maybe I did something wrong during my first play through but this is still not a fun game.The first problems started before I even launched the game, you have to download the unofficial patch just to get the game to launch on modern systems. The game runs smoothly as you'd expect from the Source Engine. It has a fitting atmosphere to it with some unique characters and dialogue options that allows you to do what you want for the most part. This seems to be the selling point of the game; it fits the RPG genre well.The combat is not enjoyable. Spellcaster and ranged builds seem very underpowered while melee is the opposite. Blood runs out very fast leaving spellcasters vulnerable and the only viable guns I've seen are shotguns. The melee seems to be the most effective, allowing you to take out almost all enemies with a few swings. If you want to buy this game for any sort of combat or action, look elsewhere.Sneaking is broken. You can sneak right in front of enemies in bright rooms and they won't be able to find you. This was with a non stealth character. It really breaks any sort of immersion since a decent amount of missions involve stealth.The worst part of this game is doors. Doors will get you killed, stuck, or leave you sitting at a black screen just by touching them as they open or close. Many times through my last playthrough I've had to noclip out of doors or reload.I would not be so critical of this game if it was priced fairly. The game is almost 12 years old and costs $20 while being buggy and just not that great overall. The game is overrated.			"

												While the concept is intruiging, and I've heard great things about this game, it has some outright game-breaking bugs that even the available patches don't fix.

												I'll go out on a limb here and base my vote on what is actually being offered, which is a decade-old technical nightmare at a full 20 bucks. Oh, and on any version of Windows still supported by Microsoft, it won't even work until you star fiddling with compatability settings and UAC.(Also, the storytelling may rank among the most overrated in gaming history, because while it certainly is good, it is not the flawless masterpiece of writing brilliance too many make it out to be.)If you absolutely want to give it a try:1. Wait for a sale (75% off or so seems fair).2. Be prepared to use - and put up with - community patches. (Yes, there's two competing ones. No, I'm not going to recommend one. Damn straight I'm going to say if you didn't expect the kind of bickering that goes on between the two sects, surely you've never dealt with anything resembling a WoD/Vampire community before.) 3. Be prepared to be disappointed. It's just good, but not what it is cracked up to be.As the more bone-headed cheerleaders for this technical atrocity like to point out so little Steam play time on record means I don't know what I'm talking about:This game works a lot better with a community patch [on ANY operating system, even the officially supported ones!] and without Steam overlays. Which, as it were, is even more proof it being 20 bucks on Steam is questionable at best.EDIT: I would actually recommend trying the game at a fair price. But $20 ain't it.			"

												While there are many, many people who say this is an utterly brilliant game, I sadly cannot verify that. Why ? Because whoever coded this made such a complete and utter hash of it, it takes hours and hours to get it to work.There is an Unofficial Patch available, which is still being made 10 years after the original was released. This is done completely by fans of the game and is supposed to fix many many bugs. However, because of the sheer crapness of the original coding by the original developers, there are still some bugs that you have to manually fix. They include bombing out when you select New Game and crashing on game load if you have more then 4GB of RAM (these days who doesn't!). It also seems to hate Windows 8, though I've come across some people who can run it fine, and others where it just refuses to start. Unless you have hours to kill trying to get the game to run, don't bother. For me, this will have to be a game I come back to at a time when I actually have time to to get it to run. Very disappointing.			"

												Does not run on any modern setup. The only way to run the game is to download an unnoficial patch made by the modding community, which is fortunately kept hidden away on websites with the worst possible ♥♥♥♥ing connection possible. The files ranges from 300-500mb depending upon the version and how much malware the uploader decided to sneak in. Small file size shouldnt take too long to download right? Nope. Takes hours. Ive found multiple sources, all ♥♥♥♥♥ier than the last. I do live in the US, a place where good internet is a non existant thing, but I have a somewhat decent connection so it should not be taking me this long. I should not have to research games to make sure they run on my PC not because my PC is too weak for the game, but because it is too good(?) that is beyond stupid. The fact that there is no warning of this KNOWN OCCURANCE makes me seriously want my ♥♥♥♥ing money back. The consumer should not have to research the games they want to buy to make sure they actually ♥♥♥♥ing run on any system.			"

												Great game overall but it was rushed out the door because of money issues but the game is still a masterpiece even as is. There are unofficial mods that will make the game play better and also change it as well. Play it through once with the official patches and then MOD it. Be sure to investigate the world and do the side quests to open up more side quests. Have fun. It is made with the Source 2 engine I believe.Forget about all the negatives people have said about this game. It is well worth 5, 10 or 20 dollars even with it's age. The only reason this game was released before it was polished up is BIG F'ing GAME COMPANIES who want dev teams to rush out their content. When this game was bought out that company could have spend a few thousand dollars finishing it up and made multi-millions off it but short sighted money hungry attitudes killed that idea. The game as is is a Vampire Masterpiece and I am not a fanatic of vampire stuff.Even if you don't like RPGs this game is still appealing. Yes the graphics are not as they should be, nor is the controls on PC but the overall atmosphere, storyline, quests, items you can use, characters, dialog, areas to travel, humor, horror, music, etc. are very original and immersive and enjoyable. About patches: There is no real company to work on this game anymore so there are no fixes from those who created the game. But there are many mods out there that do fix a lot of broken things in the game and even some mods that overhaul the game extensively. There are model and skin patches as well. Nude and otherwise. The mods are NOT hard to install. If you can read it is very simple. The only thing that I had an issue with is the game not running on install from Steam and in 64bit mode. There is a patch to fix this. Sorry I do not have the links at the moment. Google them or look on the community page.  I have the boxed version and the Steam version and have played it lots of times in many ways. All have been pleasurable experiences. I recommend playing through without modding it first if you can or at least not using the overhaul mods that change too much of the game. Then play again with the conversion MODS.The game gets a 10/10 for me even with the quirks and work I have to do to get it to work efficiently.			"

												I wanted to like this--it has some RPG elements I usually enjoy plus vampires--but it just wasn't happening. The ratings and fan ravings drew me in. As someone completely new to this game, I could not get beyond the dated graphics, the poor audio quality, and the general silliness of the game. (The preview photos for this game actually make it look far superior in quality, maybe there is a high res texture pack out there somewhere.) I found the way the characters walk and move to be bizarre and distractiing. The game kept sticking/freezing between scenes as well.I don't fault original fans for liking this game. I may have liked it a decade ago too. But if you're new to the game, there may be some insurmountable obstacles.			"

												I'm about mid-ways through this game, maybe past that point. My enthusiasm in the beginning has waned. The combat is bland and forces you to play ranged also, not just melee. For me, firearms are not what vampires are about but the boss battles force the player to put points into guns. Otherwise I don't see if some encounters could be completed on melee, or not atleast without considerable difficulty. There are still some glitches which don't prevent completing the game but harm stealth for an example. The writing is good and I enjoy the politics and some of the kooky characters (Jeanette), but there hasn't been that much roleplaying yet for me. For an example, I can't choose sides even though the opportunity is coming. It just isn't doable at this point of the plot, and I presume I'm already past half-way point. So that is also disappointing, I'm having to have to do missions to someone I prefer not doing them to, with no possibility to change things.If you can get this game cheap it's worth a shot, like I did. But for the asking price of almost 20 EUR, it's way too much. Not recommended at the asking price.			"

For those paying 20 $ they might want to know before buying that its not ready to play or at least Steam fixing it with th epatch already in!I will change my rating if they mention the patch problem of even fix it!

I spent alot of time to actually enter the game and try to play, but I still can't because the graphics are not as it should be...

												V:TM:B puts you in the shoes of a freshly sired vampire roaming a murky, big city environment. The game is based on the pen and paper system World of Darkness by White Wolf, and remains largely true to the system's setting and style. As exciting as a gritty, mature world where the vampires never sparkle sounds, there are a few glaring problems with this game. The foremost being that it doesn't actually work. There are literally moments in the game that can break so fantastically that it will render the rest of the game unplayable. And they aren't optional events or sidequests that were glossed over, I'm talking certain main questline events can end your game if they decide not to work. Reloading isn't a sure fix in several cases. Don't let those 30 some hours fool you, the most gamebreaking glitches are fixed by several wonderful fan mods- some of them even restore cut content- but your money isn't going to the modders, it's going to the creators of a shoddy game. V:TN:B is a blast with the patience to find the right mods, which honestly isn't too difficult, a google search will yield the best ones, but I can't shake the misgivings of paying for a game that the fans were charged with completing.Pros:Great environmentInteresting StoryDifferent classes add some replay valueCons:Modding is an absolute necessityEven with mods, some bugs exist1/5 standalone4/5 modded "

												So this game is in bad need of a patch.  The default steam version does not support 64-bit OS's -- specifically, if you are running Windows 8 it won't work.  If you are running Windows 7 64-bit, it won't work.You can get one of two 3rd party patches to fix the problem, but they are a bit sketchy.  Any patch whose site to download from comes with a warning of NSFW or requires the game to be run as administrator from then on is pretty suspect.  Furthermore, installing either patch will apparently cause steam to complain that the game has been patched any time you launch it.I never got to play the game because I don't think either patch is safe or reasonable to install.  I'd like to see Steam actually put a patched version of the game up if they are going to list it as supported for Windows 8.			"

												I wish i could get this game to play on my NEW computer that far surpasses the required specs. I have done everthing recommended to get it to work and really really, want to play it but alas no luck. Dont get this game if you have a newer computer with a touchscreen and windows 8(current) on it. I will be happy to update this review if i can get the game to work. Just so you know i have like over 90 games on this laptop and only 2 have given me trouble and since the other one was updated it works fine.			"

												This is purely a gamer's review, someone who's enjoyed horror, survival horror, action, and rpg games.  I am not a fan of the series, or of pencil and paper rpgs.  I have played unmodded, with only the unofficial patch.  EDIT: you fanboys can downvote me all you want, this is still an objective and accurate review.  Interesting story, that.  As it turns out, even though this game was released 10 years ago, with the developers apparently and immediately dropping support for it, people are STILL churning out both patches and mods for this game.  That should pique your curiosity at least.  Let's get something obvious out of the way.  Even with the patches, the graphics are pretty rustic.  Bugs are STILL legion.  You'll be able to ignore that with the atmosphere, but there's no denying this was a small budget enterprise in 2004.  With the unofficial patches boosting things up to higher resolutions, you may have terrible omnipresent screen distortion along the top edge, amongst various other snags.You pick your vampiric clan and one of several back-histories, which determines your beginning stats and primary 3 vampiric abilities.  You can have the game distribute the points for you via questionnaire, or do it all yourself (which I did).  The game takes place in several small (and I do mean small) areas packed with buildings and npcs.  At first you'll wander around lost (the only maps are on bus stops and in sewers), but exploring is part of the fun in a game like this.  Several missions will have you venturing outside the city via cab to special areas that you cannot access afterwards.  Being a vampire, of course you have to feed on blood, and you can't let humans see you do this.  You have a system of 5 strikes which can be violated any number of ways, such as feeding with witnesses, allowing evidence of vampires to become known (sometimes objects, or dialogue choices), to random butchering of the cattle.  In the same way, being discreet can sometimes earn you these marks back.  The concept is neat, but fundamentally flawed, and in any case completely avoidable by simply not being a terrible player.  The story isn't overly predictable, and the game has a strong cast.  There's an undeniable atmosphere here, and I believe it's that undercurrent and plausible mythology that keeps the fanbase going.  There are certain people who have latched onto this game and will not let go, for various reasons.  The dialogues are lengthy and varied, and occasionally influenced by your specific clan type and certain vampiric traits (seduction, intimidation, etc).  However, there's no getting around the fact that you are basically an errand boy the entire game.  It's a little more plausible being the new vamp on the block and everyone you meet being centuries older than you, but the game never steps outside of this formula, not even once from what I've seen.  The combat is clunky, at best.  You could call it challenging, or cheap, depending on your viewpoint.  For my run, although I made sure I was fully stocked on firearms, I stuck with melee weapons, which may have altered the difficulty.  There's also a stealth system, with stealth kills if you're directly behind enemies, but don't expect too much.  AI is functional at best, even with the occasional wallhacking.  During one boss battle my enemies implanted themselves into walls and I had to start over.  The combat camera (3rd person view) is surprisingly fair, if a little squirrely.    Doing sidequests helps combat (and everything else) in the form of acquiring skill points, but the truth is you will never feel like a badass.  I played through spamming two primary abilities, superhuman speed and some form of intimidation to lower enemy's combat stats.  I know the Gangrel clan can transform (but I've heard it's underwhelming), another one can make enemies commit suicide, still another can turn invisible entirely.  The vampiric clan differences are pretty broad, and are wasted on the combat here.  Using your abilities consumes blood, and if you don't feed often enough or have enough blood to start with you run the risk of frenzying.  You'll get massive stat boosts, but be unable to control your character for the time being.  Obviously if it happens in public, this is bad.  Some clans are more prone to this than others, but it never happened to me.  Even with everything I just said, I'd still recommend the game - if it weren't for the endings.  Several glaring plot holes are present regardless of which of the five endings you get - which really aren't five endings, more like three and two variations.  All of them are at least vaguely unsatisfactory.  The game does a terrific job of building up, and you're always interested to see which fictional creature turns out to be real next, but the endings just flop out.  As engaging (if slightly predictable) as the game's atmosphere and events are, there's no feeling of reward for actually reaching the various mediocre endings.  If they were all different from each other, or at least interesting, I could recommend this game in spite of its flaws.  But they aren't, so I can't.			"

												I can't believe I missed this title before a Steam sale brought it to my attention. Heck, I didn't even know much about it. Why? This game is great! It might be about 10 years old, but it has most everything an RPG gamer could want: Unique setting, a great branching story filled side quest and political intrigue, brilliant voice acting, and customizable character sheets and moves. It has some bugs, but nothing big so far, so...why was this game such a cult classic? With vampires so main stream you'd think it'd not only be common knowledge, but something so big that it would be on it's forth or fifth sequel with console ports right up there with Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Deus Ex and Mass Effect. Why hasn't this IP been promoted and progressed more? Are all the vampire books, movies, and comics out right now not enough of a sign to point out  that this IP is a potential gold mine worth promoting and expanding on? That's what I want to know.Oh...yeah...this version is messed up. It's broken. This game is so buggy that the whole thing just falls apart hours in. Save data corrupted. Storyline and mission data corrupted. Gameplay corrupted. It's so sad, because it was so good. Makes me want to cry, if I had the ability to do so.Still, this thing a had so much that makes it worth bringing back. Seriously, some big game company that knows how make games that work from start to finish, buy this IP and make another title.			"

												I can't recommmand this one.  It definately shows its age which you can look past if the rest of the game is good.  If being the key word there.  The game is extremely buggy even with patches that are suppose to alliviate a lot of the issues.  It also has compatability issues with the 64 bit version of windows 8.1.			"

												The game is okay to play. To be honest, I couldn't really get into the game because of how aged it was. There was no control compatiblity, all controls as on keyboard, Which I am not used to. In order to play this game on a new age computer, you have to download a certain patch for it. But sometimes, even that patch can break the game for you. After a while of playing it with the patch, buttons I wasn't even pushing would set off (Starting the game shooting without pushing a button). I really wanted to like this game, I honestly did at the beginning, but It's too aged and too buggy for me to fully enjoy. I suggest watching a playthrough if you still wanna play this game, just to give you a preview of what it's like. (Don't watch Mallek ishtar's Playthrough, it does not do the game proper justice.)

												Meh, 5/10. There are better things to spend your money on. If you're a fan of the now defunct Pen and Paper world it's absed on or the books you'll probably be in love with it. As a RPG player to another RPG player who is not familiar with the lore and world, this a niche game, made for a loyal fanbase. It's underwhelming, I'm glad I bought it on 75% sale for halloween.

												The game is adequate, or at least for its time it was. It has, in my opinion, aged very poorly and will ultimately make you wish it had been made with modern technology. The combat felt clunky and kind of dull. Everything about this game looks amateur when viewed through a modern day lens. It has strong role playing elements and from what I experienced a solid story. In fact, it does role playing better than any other RPG recently released. I choose the Nosferatu breed of vampire and as the description of the class indicated, I was unable to interact with normal humans, for a single glance at my face inspired dread and fear. Because of my less than attractive features I often had to stray from the beaten path to get to objectives. I often traveled through the sewers. Getting too close to people got me a masquerade violation. The game didn't offer up easy work arounds either. It respected the fact that I had a brain and could work out my problems without a map marker. Outside of the solid story, strong role playing elements, and respect it has for the players cognitive abilities, it isn't anything special. You'll only end up wishing someone else revisited the concept with our more advanced tools.Edit: How could I forgot to mention one of the biggest problems this game has? It doesn't work on modern operating systems. You'll need to install unofficial patches if you want to even play the game.			"

												Haaaa, this is a tough one.Vampires: The Masquerade is a semi-famous Pen&Paper rulebook which, duh, is about Vampires and their Masquerade to stay hidden from humanity. This game is one of the few (if not the only) PC adaption.Clear pro's of VtMB: The story is quite solid, the characters are quite finely fleshed out. The atmosphere of the game is fitting and the background&setting (naturally, when derived from a RP rulebook) nice to explore.Aaaaand, that's about it.On the other hand, the list of downsides: The game is old. Obviously this means it has an outdated graphic engine, but that really isn't a big deal (at least not to me). HOWEVER, the gameplay is as well OLD. It puts you back into the days of awful backtracking. It doesn't have all those nifty features you would be used from modern RPGs. The fights feel sluggish and uninspiring, the animations/hitboxes don't seem to match whatsoever.There are quite a few bugs in the game, too. Actually, you can't even start the game on a 64bit system unless you download yourself an unofficial patch to fix the problem. (And another to fix up the game's limited resolution options.)In total, VtMB was, no doubt, at it's release a REALLY formidable RPG with an immensely powerful and detailed background. By today's measure, however, it's barely a better interactive story teller with fundamental RPG elements.Rating: 5/10, sorry, I like the Franchise and the P&P, but the game just isn't playable past it's 'classic' valueAs such, I can only recommend this game to nostalgiast who WANT to play old games or hardcore VtM fans and only below a price of 5€.

												Lot of people said this is an underrated gem. I don't think so. The whole game is really outdated both on technical and visual side. Come on, everyone said this game failed on sales and i totally understund why... Released in the same year like Half Life2, KOTOR2 and WOW... Playing the game and see that blurry mess on the monitor I feel myself in the '90 software render and no bone-skinning era. The bad looking visual is deepend on the false design concept or poor implementation. Nut just beacuse it released in 2004 ! The character models, animation is a mistake too. Not just bad, it's irritating bad, and hurts my eyes... after all it's broke the gameplay completely. Compare this to Blood Omen 2 for example wich released two years earlier in 2002 it's totally fallback. All in one: i don't recommend this game for anyone ( rather try out Kain series or Bloodraye, i promise you will not regret ) !			"

												Unless you're starved for a game to play, really like vampires, or like the universe - avoid this game. To say it's unfinished is an understatement. Given another year in development, with actual QA testing it could have been good, but as it stands it's mediocre at best. Even with the fan patches the game has quite a few issues, isn't well balanced, and just feels tedious at times.There's a lot of hype around this game, and a lot of people defend it - I thought I'd understand their devotion to the game after playing it, but... Nope. It could be that I'm indifferent to vampires in general, but I see very little value in this game - it was clearly rushed, was released too early, and/or just plain poorly executed.I wish I could add more to the review, but honestly the only impression I'm left with after beating it, is that it killed time at the best of times, and was tedious at the worst. If I had to give it a score, it'd be 4/10. There are so many better RPGs out there, and spending your time with Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines would be a waste if you aren't already a fan.			"

												I know most people will just thumb down this review without even reading it because its just one of those games where its the socially acceptable thing to love it unconditionally.. But i know a great game when i see one and this is not one of them. It is not a bad game by any regards, but it is certainly not the cult classic all the reviewers had made it seem.Its very cartoonish and arcadey and a majority of the game is spent going from A to B in mini city-like towns doing mundane quests for random NPC's with tons of loading screens inbetween. I would say 90% of the game is running back and fourth between loading screens and 10% is actual combat.The combat consists of an awkward free mouse aiming spam-clicking action onto your enemy as fast as you possibly can. Every time you hit an enemy you either knock them down or send them flying in an overly-dramatic sideways barrel-roll through the air.. It is laughable to say the least. And you will notice right away that there is no depth to the combat mechanics at all. The block is way too slow and unresponsive to be deemed worthy of any use in combat. It is also impossible to do any sort of stratgy like circle around your enemy to get behind them because they always face you no matter how fast you try and run around them..And there is no way to prepare for an enemy attack because it  occurs instantly and the game shows no animation to let you know the enemy is lifting up his arms to attack. It just happens instantly when you get near the enemy.  Not to mention the silly damage numbers that float above their head with each strike. It's is just a very hard game to reccomend to anyone over the age of 12 as it is extremely cartoonish and bubbly.Quests..some very long, very carried out, and not very specific in what you have to do. Many times you are forced to look up a walkthrough online just to figure out where to go. Each quest requires a lot of backtracking (check your email, go back to your haven and check your mailbox, go back and talk to so and so again) Not to mention that these extremely long quests only result in a mere 1-3 exp reward which is very frustrating considering you need at least 8 exp points to unlock anything worthwhile.. The only leveling up that seems to make any difference is lockpicking and hacking because strength, melee, and brawl seem to change very little in terms of the physical damage i do to my enemies. And the gun combat.. The gun combat takes the trophy for the worst gun combat i have ever seen in my 15 years of gaming. The first time i used my revolver i walked up behind an enemy, aimed it at the back of his head at close range, and when i fired i saw huge yellow letters that said ""10"" listing the damage amount that my shot did.. The enemy than said ""Ouch"" and turned around and started punching me, i than shot 5 more times and each shot showed huge yellow damage numbers. I than had to ditch the gun and just kill him with my fists. It is just so arcadey and childish. Not to mention ammo is extremely scarce.For a vampire game you would think it would be raw, mature and gritty, not bubbly and cartoonish.The textures are extremely low resolution for the date the game was released.If you are 9-13 years old i can see you enjoying this game			"

												Wow great, I paid Money for this game and looked realy forward to it... and it will not work on my Win 8 PC. This makes me rly mad. Yeah, sure, you can download fan patches at the internet, but after the next 2 hour download it's still not working. What to say? I can nothing say to the game, 'cause it wont let me play. If you have a modern PC... don't buy it.			"

												While this game seemed like it had the potential to be Fallout: Vampire Edition, it suffers from one major problem. It doesn't work properly on modern systems. You have to manually cap how much RAM your computer has to play the game, which requires a restart. And if you want to play another game that needs the cap taken off? This will require another restart. To reiterate, unless you don't mind turning your computer off and on again twice just to play one game, I'd probably stay away.			"

												Compaired to Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption, this game is a step back in presentation, story telling, and gameplay. I've been wanting to play this game for years. I find it very boring, not much going on besides talking to people. Missions are bland, not much build-up to anything. The world is empty, not many places to visit and do things at besides mission areas. Not much of anything to buy either. I was expecting Grand Theft Auto set in the Vampire universe, but I got anything but. As of this review, I have yet to finish the game, but I'll keep playing because I already spent money on it. I want to like this game, I really do, but I'll have to recommend a ""no.""*update*I finished the game and my opinion hasn't changed. The game as well as the ending can be sumed up in one word: ""meh."" The game isn't bad, nor is it good. If anything it was a good time killer. I still think Redemption was a better experience than this game was.			"

												This is a cult classic game I had only heard of when I saw it on sale and figured I'd pick it up to see what the fuss was.  Admittedly, they do a very nice job of creating a dark atmosphere within the limited graphical capabilities of the time, but ultimately the game itself is unplayable.  Bugs which have persisted since release were never fixed, resulting in a lot of frustration - like the completely invisible boss I had to fight.  You can actually play this game for a while before finding out that you did the wrong sequence of highly specific things for a given character build and now you can't go any further in the game.  If they cleaned up the technical issues then this would be a pretty slick release, but as it stands it's just not worth playing.			"

												You need to use a fan created patch to make this game work because the developers won't do it.Other than that, it's a good game.edit: After playing it a little bit more, I find that there are some glitches. The camera can go through walls and letting you peer into a big black void filled with the rest of the map, or you'll enter a different area and you will be transported way above the level and being unable to move forcing you to reload to an earlier state. I still found the game to be enjoyable to play. Most of the maps in the game are a bit small since its an old game designed for old hardware so you'll find yourself having to sit through a lot of loading screens. The AI in the game can be really dumb sometimes and ruin your immersion, like for example, some bosses will just sit still and let you shoot them to death or some enemies can always see  you making it impossible to sneak. One thing I did like about the game though is Jeanette is #1 waifu 2 kawaii 4 me senpai notice me.			"

												First of all games should not require any effort whatsoever beyond installing to play. None. This is on par with buying a car you have to drop an engine into so you can drive it off the lot. The fact that you have to add a mod just to make this game work is insulting. I've seen people say ""oh well you didn't play this game or that game that needed this and that"" and the truth is they're idiots. Because that statement and type of thinking is a logical fallacy called appeal to tradition. Just because other games sucked too has ZERO bearing on whether or not this one does. Or saying that tons of people love it so it can't suck is just appeal to the masses. Justin Bieber and Brittany Spears are millionaires with millions of fans. Are you really going to say they don't suck? The masses like garbage and we all know that. This is why and only why pop music exists.        I haven't seen one intelligent comment on why this game DOESN'T suck. The problem is that this game absolutely does suck and not in the way a Vampire game should. I began as a GM for Werewolf AND Vampire the Masquerade when they FIRST CAME OUT as a tabletop RPG's in 1991.Many people who may read this weren't even born then. Or they were far too small to be playing them. Understand this means you sorely lack the context to understand why these games suck. I watched Kindred: The Embraced religiously for the brief period it was on. It was even shot in my backyard of San Francisco. The point is I am and have been a huge Vampire fan from day one. So my hopes for this game were very high. And I was sorely disappointed.     Anyone who has been a gamer for a couple decades knows and has seen the evolution of games with super powers. From tke original Xmen Arcade game released in 1992 to the flurry of super hero games released on all consoles, it has always been hard to get super powers right. This is where this game ultimately fails unbelievably. The game does not match the tabletop RPG AT ALL when we look at starting characters and power. In this garbage you are essentially nothing more than human who has to suck blood randomly. Guns kill you, baseball bats kill you, a stiff wind kills you. I've been fascinated by vampires for 30 years and done an immense amount of research on them. And the piece of crap representation in this game fits absolutely NONE of the stories.    The fun part about playing a vampire game is the power associated with vampires. Some great examples are the Legacy of Kain series. With Legacy of Kain 2 being the crowning achievment. You start out weak but not even close to as weak as a human. The game  does a fantastic job of evolving the character to be more and more powerful as you progress. VTMB is just an utter waste of money and time. They betrayed their own tabeletops and all of us original fans. Whitewolf made the same mistake when they released the second rulebook for the tabletop game. They just tried too hard and ended up diluting the quality of the game with crap that really didnt need to be added. Take the money you would spend on this game and find ""The Book of Nod"" which was a companion fiction novel that is a much better way to spend your time than on this trash.			"

												Aside from the unique game concept, a rpg about vampires in modern-day america, this game is pretty much garbage. There's very little character involvement and development. You /maybe/ have three outfits that you can earn throughout the game, and the outfits you're given pretty much suck as it is. The fighting is a bit stiff, as well as other movements in the game like talking and cutscene acting, and yes, given that this was made a while ago when software wasn't all that amazing, it still is very lacking. There's not much of a desire to go on with the story because the story in itself just isn't enthralling, or even interesting. Sure, sometimes you're a little curious as to what they mean by a few things so you go about the missions, la-dee-da without a care in the world only to, again, be let down by yet another over-used plot device. I've watched a few playthroughs of the game simply to see if it was worth finishing, and I'm not even convinced that this game entertains me when I'm bored enough to play it. Overall, I do not reccomend this game. It certainly wasn't worth the $20 I shelled out to get it, and so, I ward others away from it unless it's being offered for maybe, MAYBE, $5 or less.			"

												Overall a very well rounded game with a great deal of replayability. The player choices are sometimes frusturatingly  limited in the main plot line, but the overall degree of control over side quests is immense. Combat options are diverse, however the endless swarms of enemies in some dungeon zones can be tiring. Overall the npcs are well rounded and believable characters. There are multiple endings, though they are not the light at the end of the tunnel. The missions along the way are more meaningful than the end result. Perhaps this games best feature is the ability to blend some modern day realism with a dose a fantasy terror. The ""dungeon"" areas are really not boring and offer up a challenge for several playthroughs. The environments are fairly detailed and the overall map desing usually makes sense. The older graphics also do little to diminish the gore factor in this game. Some scenes should not be redone in HD. The game is plagued with several tech issues if you are running a newer operating system. The game works fine normally if you run in compatbility mode as an admin. Also be sure not to auto-update as this can cause crashing. I also recommend downloading the unofficial patches as they really do add more depth and refinement to the overall gameplay. So wether you are a fan of ""Blade"" or ""Twilight"", then this game has something for you.			"

												I would like to share my experience about this game, because i really like it's own unique, unforgettable atmosphere. One of my favourite (classic) rpg since almost a decade. Graphics are a bit crappy, but playable and let me be honest: it doesn't matter in this genre. Usage of 8.x Unoffical patch recommended!			"

												For anyone who likes a more realistic sort of vampire setting and enjoys gameplay that gives you a good amount of freedom as far as how to build up your character and a variety of sidequests, as well as multiple ways to achieve most of your goals in-game, you'll probably enjoy this game.It's based on the tabletop roleplaying game and does a pretty good job at sticking to the Meta rules of the World Of Darkness, so anyone who enjoyed the tabletop game would also likely enjoy this.

												An Amazing game. Hits all the right spots, dialog, voice acting, plot, and atmosphere. Yes it is buggy, and the ending was completed in a haste, leaving the game ending unfulfilling. But none the less, one of the best games i have ever played, if Troika had been given the time needed to complete it properly it would replace Deus Ex as my favourite game ever.			"

												It may be a little old and buggy, but this game has great atmosphere, a good story, and hey - you get to be a vampire AND blow the living crap out of things. Not some sissy sparkling vampire - your choice of a variety of classic and deadly vamps from civilized to psychotic. Also, though I'm told the unofficial patch does make everything better, I fully enjoyed this game in its retail original form - enough so that I just bought it again so I could have it on Steam. Gameplay is similar to Deus Ex, though darker.			"

												Deus Ex with Vampires.  Nasty ones too.  A cult classic game that was screwed over by the man then given new life by the fans.  If you play this look up one of the many fan patches that restores the game to what it was supposed to be.  Also be sure to have a clean pair of pants ready for the Haunted Hotel and the Werewolf boss.			"

The characters, the dialogue options and the great script will make you truly feel like a creature of the night.The character interaction carries the game, you'll loath lengthy combat sequences and wish you could go back to messing with mortals or your fellow kindred. The combat itself is passable, quality differing depending on your character development choices, but in many cases there are various different ways to diffuse a possibly hostile situation.I recommend this game to anyone who likes to be immersed and becoming part of a fictional world.

												Are you into feminism? Then this is the game for you.In this game you play a real feminist in an supra-realistic world. At the beginning of the game it shows the evil in the man/woman relationship and you nearly die because of this. To repent, you are sent into the world to help womankind. Here starts your voyage through the catacombs of the human psyche and you meet many hussies, harlots and men. You must show them the errors in their way.  You can do this the male or bad way: melee attacks or guns. This only leads to destruction and makes you weaker and weaker. If you follow this path, you are soon going to die. The best way to proceed in this game is using the female powers. Reason yourself out of most problems and show them the true way. If that fails hug and embrace them with your love. During this loving hug you and your enemy get stronger and more in touch with each other and the world. In summary, girls in mini skirts and lingerie rule.			"

												Best game of its time, an genre, if you like vampires buy this game, you can play it the way you want it, stealthy, persuasive, or you can be a big beast that solves things with your bare hands, the skill tree in this game is big, and the possibilities of ways you can create to complete your missions, it's amazing, with 6 clans to choose, each with unique story, and you can even see the other clans that are unplayable, it's a fantastic adaption of World of Darkness, The dialogue is big, each clan and depending on what tipe of person your character is, it  can look like a totally different game. There are several melee weapons, and ranged weapons too. The graphics are outdated due its realease in 10 years ago, but you still get the dark feeling of the game, and the sountrack gives you an immersion in the world. The maps are detailed, with various types of stages, from Haunted Hotels to an ancient tomb with hundreds of undeads, there is SO many types of enemies to deal with, you'll hardly get bored in this game, there are a lot of side quests to complete that give you experience points to spend with your character sheet. Now the problem in this game, is being able to run in more advanced computers, due to compability problems. But there is a community forum to help you figure out what to do, there are many unnofficial patches to remove the bugs and even add some few new things to the game. For me V:TM-B It's a should play to people that like the genre.			"

												This is apparently a sequel to Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption, hence the really long name. However don't let that put you off - this is such a great game. If you haven't got this game you must get it! I'm not a massive vampire fanatic or anything so I was skeptical at first. However this isn't your average load of vampires or vampire setting. Forget sparkly celebrities and even your average Bram Stoker vampire - these are the vampires of the present day world. The game begins in Santa Monica, CA but you are also able to travel to Downtown LA, Chinatown and Hollywood. This is where the real RPG element comes in. You choose who to work for, whether it be Prince LaCroix who technically saved your life, the Anarchs or more obscure factions. You can also choose from quite a huge choice of Bloodlines (also known as Clans - basically the equivalent to classes) which also affect what you look like and how you are treated. The game can run on pretty much any system now too! GET THIS!!!			"

												This game was a pleasant surprise. I picked it up on sale for next to nothing and have already invested a good 20 hours into it. I've been a fan of pretty much all of the World of Darkness game systems since I was a teenager and it's nice to see Vampire brought to life in a video game. The game does have it's issues, but they are easily overlooked. There's an unofficial patch that I downloaded that seemed to solve a majority of the glitches. I've experienced minor graphical hiccups with water textures once or twice and the controls take some getting used to, but other than that I have no real complaints. It's an older game so the graphics are a bit dated (2004 i thhink), but the story and the environment are all very immersive and the characters are believable (as far as WoD standards go) and well written. A couple of canons make an appearance as well for those of you out there who are familiar with the lore of VtM. All in all I'd say it's a great game that definitely captures the spirit of VtM. It makes me long for my days of LARPing.			"

												Quite possibly one of my favorite games ever. No RPG before or since has nailed presentation, atmosphere, and dynamic NPCs the way this game did. You really feel like you're wrapped up in the game world, and the missions (including the overwhelmingly brilliant haunted hotel mission) are some of the best in the genre. Despite the base game's numerous bugs (it was released too early to capitalize on the Source engine before Half-Life 2), several excellent unofficial patches solve a great deal of the engine issues and add great gameplay tweaks. An absolute must-play.			"

												The story for this is pretty good. The characters also being very true to the idea that VtM was going for style wise. Though last I checked, just because you've been embraced doesn't necessarily mean that your stride should be the equivalent of a pimp-swagger. but hunched over. For the time, the graphics are okay. However, one of my biggest issues is how dumbed down the disciplines are. Playing a Toreador seems rather pointless because they are more social encounter based, and their disciplines do not really follow the actually VtM standard. That's just an example though.			"

Initially I was expecting an experience similar to that of Vampire Rain, but no. It's a fairly straight forward RPG. It's got fairly decent gameplay though, and some hilarious dialogue with one of the races. I'm sure I spent more than half my time on this game trying to understand what each dialogue option meant, as it was written in cryptic riddles. Such fun!			"

												One of the Most Immersive and impressive piece of gaming that I have ever played. Hauntingly scary at times, Almost open world with a sandbox feel. Multiple vampire clans you can play and align yourself to that makes replayablity very high. Cheap Price for a great game. Keep in mind it has aged so the graphics are not so hot but f....graphics the gameplay owns.			"

												As glitchy as it is, it quickly became one of my all time favourite games and got me more interested in the world of Vampire the Masquerade. There's great replay value because of the 7 different clans and the multitude of dialogue options, as well as the desire to see each of the 5 different endings. Some clans are more frustrating to play than others, especially with all the necessary stealth, but they really weren't lying when they said this was a cult classic.			"

												While fans of the White Wolf game will enjoy this RPG, fans not familiar with the setting will still enjoy the experience.Set in modern day where vampires walk among us.  You take the role of a newly turned vampire.  Given a crash coarse in the ""masquerade"", the term used for not exposing vampire's existence, you're then thrust into the world of a modern day LA.  You can't just willy-nilly go on a wanton blood bath, as breaking the masquerade can have severe consequences (perma death).  There is some politics involved as you soon learn that not all vampires see eye-to-eye on everything.Game itself is skill based, but left up to the player as to what they want to do.  Want to charm you way through a lot of conversations avoiding combat as much as possible?  Sure.  Want to skip the talk and let the bloodbath begin?  If you want to. There are multiple endings, something we see more common now but was somewhat rare back in 2004.  So the game has a high replay value as you can join a different vampire clan and go a different route politically.It's too bad that CCP's World of Darkness MMO was cancelled, leaving this game as the showcase for White Wolf's world.4.5/5  (some minor glitches for the half pt off)			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines is game not to be missed by RPG fans. Even after a decade, this title still holds it's own against ""modern"" games. From character creation to it's voice acting and storyline VtMB is a treat. Having had the chance to play this for the first time through steam, I have to say this was money well spent. Gameplay is very engaging and is most definitely worth multiple playthroughs as each class of vampire will have a VERY different experience. I'm so impressed by the multitude of paths and choices presented to the player, especially considering the release date of this game. I find myself wishing for a remake of the game but I think that it would be an impossible task to try and top a game that, not only fills what I think to be a huge void in the gaming market, but brings fantastic ideas to table and is able to execute them with such grace. 9/10 simply a must have experience for any rpg addict.

												Amazing game. Great RPG which actually makes the player interested in vampires and their politics. I did not share a big interest in vampires before this game, but when I played this gem, I actually was interested in their politics and lore.Animations are great (especially face animations. And boobs.) I dont mind the graphics myself, but some casual players might not be okay with it. It's so sad that they had to rush in with this game and had no time to do it in their own way.Unofficial patch is highly recommended. It fixes bugs (lots of them!), adds stuff etc. Wesp has done awesome job, still updating and making new patches.Overall, Vampire the Masquerade - Bloodlines is one of the best RPG games in my opinion, although it has its flaws (what doesn't?)I would give the game the score of 92/100.Oh, and remember...Dont open it.

												Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines is far from a perfect RPG experience. That being said, those who can overlook it's bugs and simple combat can find an engaging and refreshing take on the vampire genre.What Vampire does well is create an oustanding amount of compelling and interesting classes with rich backgrounds drawn from various forms of Vampire myth, as well as well written dialogue and interesting quest-design. While this may not excite the common RPG player, Vampire enthusiasts will enjoy the rich world created to explore. The various ""Bloodlines"" serve as both the class system as well as a twist on character's story and how they interact with the world. A noble Ventrue vampire will find manipulating vampire's of lesser bloodlines easy, while the insane Malkavian will be forced to spread mania to acomplish his or her goals. This all leads to a considerable amount of replayability amongst the different builds and bloodlines.Unfortunatly Vampire isn't without it's problems. Combat can become repetetive, especially towards the later end of the game where non-threatening enemies appear by the truckload. Bugs are relatively routine, though only one was game-breaking to the point that I had to use console commands. I did have to use an unnofficial patch from a third party site to even get the game to function on my computer, and even then I found myself having to alt-tab in order for the game's visiuals to display on the screen. Lastly visuals in the game are rather dated, but considering the age of the game, this is something the user should overlook.While Vampire won't stand out to anyone not interested in the World of Darkness, any curious Vampire enthusiasts should consider picking this game up, it's well worth it's minescule asking price. 8/10			"

												Wonderful game, with some amazing ideas. I very much recommend it, as it belongs in the RPG Hall of Fame, despite all its shortcomings. But remember: for all intents and purposes, this is an Early Access game, that never got finished. It lacks general polishing and bug-fixing, and the endgame was pretty much just tossed there, to have an ending at all.It will offer 25-30 hours of great fun, playing as a vampire, with a very very good RPG system under the hood. This game truly excels when doing what Vampire: The Masquerade is all about: keeping up the Masquerade, while going about your vampire business. The system forces you to be mindful of keeping your vampire existence hidden from mortals by the way of Masquerade Violations. If you commit an act that reveals you as a vampire (feeding in public, using obvious vampire powers in public, telling humans about your condition), you lose one such point, and if you lose them all, it's Game Over.The RPG system also rewards going the non-violent way in quests, as there is no experience awarded for killing things, only completing objectives - often giving higher rewards for not killing anyone. This mechanic, combined with the fact that combat is a horrible click-fest, makes it well worth it to pursue other ways of completing the quests, and using violence only when absolutely necessary. Right up until the end-game, situations where violence is the only way are few, and well placed. Going without leveling up any combat skills is a viable (although challenging) route to take right up to the ""Hell at the Hotel Hallowbrook"" quest during the end-game. And that quest also happens to be the part where the game pretty much starts falling apart.I keep mentioning the end-game, and for good reason: it is astonishingly bad. While up until this point the game is all about giving you choices, by the end it turns into a mindless action game with boring combat, and even more boring and repetitive boss fights. The only way through is by fighting, so all the points in Persuasion, Seduction, Stealth and other skills turn completely useless, and you are forced to kill waves after waves of enemies... The last hours of the game might as well be another game completely, and a bad one at that.My recommendation would be to play the game until you meet a taxi driver that keeps asking questions, answer him as you want, then go on YouTube and watch someone else suffer through the horrible mess the game devolves into. That way you get to enjoy all the wonders of the game, and also get to skip 1-2 hours of mind-boggling stupidity, that has nothing to do with the game you've been playing anyway.Another recommendation would be to download and install the Unofficial Patch - that fixes a lot of bugs, fixes broken parts of the game, and generally brings Bloodlines closer to feeling like a finished product.Link: http://www.moddb.com/mods/vtmb-unofficial-patchBuy the game and have fun with it!

												Well my Neonates this was bound to happen eventually I'm going to do it I'm going to take my mind and put it to reviewing.Vampire: The Masquerade-Bloodlines.So what did I note about the game,what did I take seconds to critcise under my breath when I should've been working find out now!So what was the first thing I noticed?The Lore.Oh yea this is a lore game and all the lore in this game is uber-fantastic it's rich and flavorful hell it's one of the best things in the game it gives the game boat loads of personality and more reason to play and involve yourself as much as possible it was so inviting that I actually started to roleplay as though I actually knew anything about the lore surrounding the game in the end I had to look up a lot of extra stuff.What came to be noted by me after Neonate?Well it was the gameplay.This was harder to comment on as you could play nearly anyway you wanted to by using stealth or going guns-a-blazing or if you want to to even more extreme just bare knuckly boxing the crap outta everything the gameplay is the second best feature of the game it's an encapsulating gameplay system that I love entirely.But I bring unfortunate news neonate I apologise but we do have one flaw that needs to be pointed out.The lack of customisation to the characterThis one struck me down as soon as I really noticed it and the thing is it was extremely heartbreaking for a Roleplayer like myself who loves character creation and customisations the flaw with this game not having it was they never explained why we were sired or why were dressed the way we were and not counting the other armor we can buy which looks different to the beginning equipment theres little to no character customisations,also as a side note this does not include levelling skills as that was covered above.So what do I give this epic adventure through the eyes of a Vampire well neo-nate I give it a Alright, just alright due to the lack of character customisation and a few moments in the game when you can be instantly killed and how being killed sets you back to the main menu it doesn't score higher had they let me create a custom character it would've scored at at least a Bad♥♥♥♥♥seal but then again the game is old			"

												Fantastic game!takes a lot of tinkering to get it to run on a modern PC tho not supported on anything post xp.but what you get when you do get it running, is a great detailed game that had a rich story and great characters. the game is pretty linear with the story with a few side quests here and there, but this game will take you quite a long time to complete if you go for 100% and you do need it, the game is hard, it doesnt hold your hand. each race of vampire gives you a different experience especially the malkavian race they are completely insane and that pours into every aspect of the game, your dialog is nuts and there are a whole managery of easter eggs just for them. the game is old but has not aged that badly, the controls and clipping can be an issue because of the games buggy nature, i recommend running with the console on for that emergency ""noclip"" some of the puzzles can also leave you scratching your head too. this is one of those memorable gems that keep players coming back for more. for some this game at full price may not be worth it with all the tinkering and bugs, for those of you like this pick it up on when it comes on sale, but for those who want a unique game experience or those of you who loved this game back in the day this is a must have for your collection, i spent a good 2 hours getting this to run and it was well worth it. im probably clocking over 30+ hours now, it doesnt show as you play this game from its launcher not the steam one to get it to run. loved this game as a teen in highschool love it even more now as my machine then barely ran it, was one of those games that really left me wanting to play it again and again.

												As someone who isn't a fan of anything involving vampires except for the Buffy TV series, this game was definitely a nice surprise.  The game's structure is similar to the Deus Ex series, complete with hub areas, RPG elements, and the ability to direct conversations in different ways.  The combat does show its age due to the simplicity, but the story and character writing are really where this game shines.  I found the deep vampire lore to be very interesting without being off-putting.  Overall, if you're a fan of games like Deus Ex, do give this game a chance, especially since YouTube videos don't really do it justice.			"

The gameplay is good, yeah, and I like the concept, but the writing is what makes this game shine. The plot twists I've encountered so far have been good, and set up well enough that I can look back and say, ""Okay, yeah, I can see that,"" or, ""I really should have seen that one coming."" Anyways. Fantastic game. Clan Gangrel is great fun. I'm told that you shouldn't play the game as a Malkavian first because you can get spoilers due to some of their abilities or something. Worth the $20.			"

												This is my favorite game of all time. The amount of endings this game has and the amount of diffrent unique dialogues that can change the course of this game is just amazing. I've played this game to the end so many times and I always love how cinematic and amazing everything just is. I recommend this game to everyone. It is a must play!			"

												One of my favourite games of all time; Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines allows the player to delve into an atmospheric free-roam world and take control of one of a number of vampire clans, all with unique powers and abilities. The level design is the best I have ever seen in an RPG, and the fact that there is absolutely no repitition in regards to sidequests/main missions is a rarity in gaming today. Overall VTMB garners a 10/10 from me.			"

												Bought this when it was first released (as an avid White Wolf RPG player of old, couldn't resist)..  Back then, it was so bug ridden it was unplayable.  I'd since lost the CD and forgot about it until a friend said it was back on track..And so it is, with a vengeance!  There are still oddities to it, and a few glitches, but nothing that really holds you back..Some may point out that the graphics are a little dated by today's AAA standard.. Well, so are the graphics in a damn good book, and I'd much prefer a damn good book to a glitzy all-flash-and-no-s♥♥♥♥♥n title..  Books and well spun tales are so much better to digest.  And they're more chewy into the bargain.The story, all important in a good RPG is all there in all its glory, warts and all..  Some things you see coming.  Some things see you coming.  And they often don't play nicely.  Which makes for lots of fun!The fact you can get to play one of the Malkavians is cherry on the proverbial porcupine.  Or was it cake.. Can't remember.  Either way, something crunchy and squishy.  With a hat. "

												I don't recommend games often but this one deserves it. I was skeptical to even start playing simply because it was vampires and lets face it vampires aren't something that's considered very cool nowadays. This game will change your mind, vampires are badass. The game offers an extremely rich lore and replay value that will keep you coming back for more. Most of the negative reviews are about the fact that it's very difficult to get to run on a modern machine, which I'll give them that. It took me an hour or so before I could get the game running with very few crashes at 1080p, but the hour or two that it takes you to do that is well worth it. I got the game when it was on sale for $5, but I would gladly have bought it at full price had I known how delicious it was. 10/10 GOTY 2014			"

												It is a great classic RPG, even though the graphics and certain gameplay mechanics are outdated.  It did have an issue installing on my PC(Windows 8), and you have to adjust for compatibility with Windows XP Service Pack 3 for it to start properly.  Overall, it was very fun and I would recommend it to anyone who may or may not be a fan of this franchise.  My main issue with this game was the old graphics.  There's patches and unofficial mods you can get to boost the resolution and graphics qualities, but I never looked into those.  I didn't have a problem that the game is older and isn't HD by any means, but I couldn't adjust the quality at all and some of the finer details of the game are lost from the lack of visual quality.  It doesn't keep you from playing the game to its fullest extent, it just makes it a little challenging at times reading signs, or looking for tiny details.Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone.  I got this game on sale and my first playthrough took around 25 hours.  It's definitely worth the time.			"

												This game, THIS GAME RIGHT HERE. Its like eating rainbows while flying on a top hat wearing, monocle bearing narwhal who flys through mystical lands with bacon trees and skittlefalls. And joing you on this journey is the most badass team ever, featuring ( but not limited too) James Bond, Robin Williams, zombie Bruce Lee, and Doctor Phil ( because on this journey you'll need to talk about how awesome you feel ). So buckle up and hold onto to your hat buddy because you're on a no stop ride ( unless you need to use the bathroom, the narwhal is a nice guy )to a great time! 10 out of 5, you should play.			"

												A little dated by modern standards perhaps, but the game holds up well on its own merits as a title worth owning and playing if one enjoys the White Wolf take on the Vampire genre as well as the supernatural as a whole. Even the human characters are interesting just to converse with or even listen to while you stalk them for the proper time to feed...			"

												Perhaps the single most true-to-source computer roleplaying game I've ever seen. A bit dated and flawed, but there are tons of mods to help that. The characters and excellent and the multiple specializations and approaches to a situation ensures that the replay value is immense. You've not had your mind blown before you've done a second playthrough of this game as a Malkavian.			"

												This is a good, if a bit old, RPG, that simply lets your imagination run wild.  There is plenty to say about it, but I'll try to keep it brief, and the awesomeness can be summed up easily:  ""You get to play as a VAMPIRE"".  Not pansy♥♥♥♥♥Twilight sparkle vampires, but bloodthirsty, bullet-resistant, cursed with awesome (and a curse) vampires.  Gameplay-wise it's a bit of a balancing act, with some abilities far more valuable than others (at least in some situations).  For example, a number of the vampire bloodlines have magical abilities that allow them to magically dominate, or insta-kill, or otherwise be extremely powerful against human enemies.  BUT, are not nearly as effective against the supernatural.  Otherwise, I have typically found a few solutions to most every quest, and while the areas available aren't huge, you're quite free to play as you please in them, and that freedom you are granted is rare in modern games.  Which is why I suggest this, not so new, but good, game.			"

												I bought this game purely out of nostalgia, and that it was 3 quid. Considering its age, and buggy, generally unfinished state, I was pretty shocked to see its normal price on here at 20. Nope. On starting it up it told me I had less than 15mb of free memory, which was...interesting. I had to follow a guide - http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2025035,with the patch found - http://www.tessmage.com/forum/index.php/topic,58452.msg86035.html#msg86035(452MB) to get it working. Thanks to the relevent people on this one.It is enjoyable in general, just bear in mind its age!			"

												I had an amazing time playing this game. I am shocked that a game so old could still look this good. Soundtrack was great, and the gameplay was solid.  combat mechanics were quile odd, but I can live with that.A major complaint I have is that I had to turn to a fan-brew patch to get this game to work on Windows 7. STEAM SHOULD NOT SELL GAMES THAT CANNOT RUN WITHOUT HACKS. I repeat, STEAM SHOULD NOT SELL GAMES THAT CANNOT RUN WITHOUT HACKS.  It is like selling a new car without any wheels. Sure, I can find them elsewhere and put them on the car myself to make it work, but it isn't really ethical to conduct business in this way, is it?A minor quibble once you consider how great this title is.

												While the pen and paper is terribly pretentious, if you like good narratives, enjoyable gameplay, and RPGs, this is a good title to play. It has its faults, a few bugs here and there, but overall, a solid game experience, and it seems to reference most of the old World of Darkness fluff too, if that's your thing.			"

												Vampires are awesom. NO, not the Twilight rip off's of the originals. THIS is the way Vampires are MEANT to be portrayed, this is what a modern Vampire world should look like! I enjoyed every bit of this game and the character creation RPG elements in it. Again, as in other reviews I mentioned I would do some things differently. I would actually be able to do more things cosmetically with the character you 'create'. This is a WoD based game, I would recommend anyone who's interested in this game to look up WoD (World of Dakrness) and read up on some stuff. Even buy the books and get into the RPG dice game.Final Rating: 8/10			"

												This game was a pleasant surprise. I picked it up on sale for next to nothing and have already invested a good 20 hours into it. I've been a fan of pretty much all of the World of Darkness game systems since I was a teenager and it's nice to see Vampire brought to life in a video game. The game does have it's issues, but they are easily overlooked. There's an unofficial patch that I downloaded that seemed to solve a majority of the glitches. I've experienced minor graphical hiccups with water textures once or twice and the controls take some getting used to, but other than that I have no real complaints. It's an older game so the graphics are a bit dated (2004 i thhink), but the story and the environment are all very immersive and the characters are believable (as far as WoD standards go) and well written. A couple of canons make an appearance as well for those of you out there who are familiar with the lore of VtM. All in all I'd say it's a great game that definitely captures the spirit of VtM. It makes me long for my days of LARPing.			"

												Vampire: The Masquerade- Bloodlines is game not to be missed by RPG fans. Even after a decade, this title still holds it's own against ""modern"" games. From character creation to it's voice acting and storyline VtMB is a treat. Having had the chance to play this for the first time through steam, I have to say this was money well spent. Gameplay is very engaging and is most definitely worth multiple playthroughs as each class of vampire will have a VERY different experience. I'm so impressed by the multitude of paths and choices presented to the player, especially considering the release date of this game. I find myself wishing for a remake of the game but I think that it would be an impossible task to try and top a game that, not only fills what I think to be a huge void in the gaming market, but brings fantastic ideas to table and is able to execute them with such grace. 9/10 simply a must have experience for any rpg addict.

												While the game looks dated (because graphically, it is), this is likely one of the best action RPG's made for the PC in the first decade of the 2000's. The game give you fleshed out character customization, well done first or third person game play (both combat and stealth), and a story with good dialogue, and choices that alter not just the games ending, but smaller events throughout. As a note, my time played is much lower than reality because I had this game, separate from steam, back when it was first released. Replaying it has been a blast.			"

												This is an amazing game which I have beaten going on 5 times now. It's old but is still extremely good and has aged pretty well. It is however a buggy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥due to time constraints and the dev group not existing anymore but there is a devoted community of modders who patch the game to make it playable, as well as entire overhauls on the game. THe story is absolutely fantastic and based on one of my favorite universes of all time, the World of Darkness. Worth way more than the price. P.S: If you do play it, save Malkavian for a 2nd playthrough.			"
