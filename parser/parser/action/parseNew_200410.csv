												Beautiful game.  Unfortunately, that's all there is.  Controls are shot and unless the company intends to patch it massively, they're going to be bad, even with a dedicated flight stick/HOTAS setup.			"

												I feel this game has too many bad reviews, that don't do it justice. The gameplay is excellent. It's similar to freelancer, but with inertia and glide/slide mechanics. It's a joy to pilot the fighter!Sure it could be longer and have more options, ships and whatnot, but then it wouldn't have this price tag.Great dogfights, varied mission objectives. Hope they make a second one!			"

												I am a big fan of space flight simulators. It doesn't matter if it's the X3 type where you control a vast trading empire as you roam the galaxy with your fleet or the the more simpler classic version where you just fly around in your ship and shoot other ships. That's why a game like SOL:Exodus managed to excited me before I even knew anything about it beyond the genre. Trouble with getting excited over a genre rather than the individual game however is that more often than not, you buy a really bad game.SOL:Exodus is a simple flight simulator. You fly around in a small fighter craft and shoot at varying forms and sizes of enemy ships, from other fighter craft to big burly bomber ships. Not much else to it, as you complete missions you get the ability to upgrade some of your ships basic systems but it never goes beyond more health or more damage. Sounds like a concept too simple to screw up, unfortunately it is not that.The flying mechanics in Exodus is down right broken. There is no perpetual motion, no strafing, no features of the kind you would expect in this kind of game. You fly in a straight line against your chosen target until you get to weapons range then you match speeds and mash the fire button until it is destroyed. Rinse. Repeat.Zero gravity flight is usually some of the most innovative and interesting gameplay you can find but in this game they somehow managed to make it dull and uninspired.The storyline of Exodus takes place in the far future, Earth's sun is set to go supernova and you are part of an expedition that's traveled to the far reaches of the galaxy to find a suitably planet for all Humans to relocate to. You start the game as you discover just such a world but before you have any time to celebrate you get attack by a bunch of religious fanatics. Going back to Earth to tell your fellow humans about this wondrous discovery of yours you find that a religious cult has taken over, one that believes dying in a supernova is a good thing. And so now you must fight these over the top bad guys in order to let humanity migrate to this new world you have found.Graphically the game falls flatly on the mediocre scale. Space is nice and black but don't get too close to anything or you might notice the game's low budget. Sound is equally unspectacular and the voice acting is just plain atrocious.SOL:Exodus is a bad game in a dying genre and it will unfortunately get a lot of sales from people like me, desperate for a new fix. If you have any sense though you will stay well clear of it.Also that one dead achievement makes my pseudo-OCD go nuts.			"

												It's not bad - more Starlancer than X-Wing or Freespace. But sometimes you don't want the complexity of all those systems to manage. It would be perfect if they made a Battlestar Galactica mod for it, since it's got the whole ""WW2 aircraft carriers, only in space!"" vibe. All in all it's more than worth the < $5 cost these days			"

												Very Short Campaign, Great Game play. Adds a new Unique feature to Dog fighting called Sliding. the best way to describe it would be a 360 degree turret ability with all guns and missles. It integrates almost seemlessly with the navigation controls so you are able to pilot and shoot with it. The AI Elites can be a handful without sliding so if your having trouble learn to use it. That said however the AI has a serious flaw with close proximity to solid objects, if you lure them into a dogfight at very close range to a large ship they may crash into it killing themselves. I was able to do this twice, once by accident the second time on purpose ^_^.Overall, a very thought out and well made space combat sim. The story and campaing however due to it being much to short was a dissapointment.			"

												The biggest problem with this game is that you do basically ALWAYS the same thing.After the training, the first two missions are absolutely identical.... shoot at things while some wannabee priest screams about being god and joining the dark side because they have cookies. Good for the rist 20 minuted, the problemhere is that this continued for all of my gameplay period, so i decided to quit playing.Graphics are ok, the soundtrack is tedious and repetitive.You have only one ship which you can upgrade in term of weapon, shield and ""turbo"".Yes, everything already sawn, nothing new here.Said this, i simply cannot recommend this game			"

												If you liked classic space sim games like X-wing, I think you'll like this.  The core flying and shooting gameplay is solid and familiar, which for some reason few games have pulled off in the last decade.  The voice acting wasn't bad either; it kept me interested in the story.  I wouldn't have minded a longer game - I finished it in 3 hours - and there's no multiplayer or other game modes, other than replaying the campaign.  The leaderboards and vanilla achievements aren't enough to make me play it again.  But if you see this at $5 or cheaper, I'd say give it a try!			"

												What is SOL: Exodus?it is a rather short but cool linear space sim. You control a small fighter against alot of enemies and usually have to protect some ship with too low hp (even on easy) the game has a rather neat hacking system tho, wich makes it a bit more interesting.The campaign can be completed in 3hours on easy but will take maybe up to 10 hours on hard depending on your skill and luck as your teammates are really useless.The good:- its a space arcade sci-fi fighter sim- hacking is new and interesting- hard difficulty is hard- mission challenges makes you want to replay missions- the achievements are doable- xbox controller supportThe bad:- Too short- Repetative- Hard is too hard- no co-op or mp- your ships flight path is weird sometimes, this can be very annoyingIn short if you like arcadey space battle games this game is worth checking out on a sale, just dont expect AAA quality.despite its shortcomings I actually had alot of fun.

												Sol: Exodus is the kind of action space game that hails back to titles like Freelancer, and it is a welcome addition to Steam's game library.  If you are like me and find many of the space genre games to be overly complex and often tedious like X3 or Starpoint Gemini, than SOL:  Exodus may be the title for you.  A welcome addition here is native controller support, which adds to the arcade feel of the flying and fighting sequences.  In addition both widescreen and modern AAA graphic effects are available, although the actual ingame graphics are nothing extraordinary for the genre.  Overall, SOL:  Exodus is a solid action space fighting game that should be part of any gamers who have a fondness for accessibility and action over deep gameplay mechanics.			"

												Sol Exodus is a ""space fighter"" game that is exceedingly difficult due to enemies that move too fast / your own ship that move too slow, forcing you to rely on missiles which you only have a very limited supply. You are also often saddled with extra objectives like protecting other ships. The missiles are so slow and ponderous you wonder if you're playing a 1970's game rather than a space game. And the plot about a religious zealot organization with starships that puts the human exploration command to shame yet the exploration command was the organization tasked with finding a planet for the citizens and colonists of Earth. WHERE did these yahoos get the money? The plot made no sense, the weapons are weak and lame compared to classics like Wing Commander or Freespace, or heck, even current clones like Eterium. it's basically an indie clone with the barest of backstory. Graphics are not bad, but overall it's an also-run that were difficult to play long-term.			"

												*scaled rating at the end*I wanted to like this game. I really did. But it's just to plain and dumbed down. It can almost fly itself. Space combat here reminds more of Independence War. You can literally spin around 180 degrees. Kinda like doing sports car drift in space. Interestingly, it does not work with CH Products sticks but is perfect with my Logitech 3D Extreme. Acting and story telling are straight out of the Alien Breed Series. Wingmen are useless. Most of my missions were solo.The only reason for my low scores here is that I bought this and Freespace 1 & 2 at the same time. I loaded this first. But played both versions of Freespace and the modded version of Freespace before a played the fifth mission of this. When a 10 year-old game gets my time over a new game....hmmmmm. Well, I'm just saying.Thumbs up because it works and I bought on on 80% off sale.Graphics 8/10Audio 8/10Controls/UI 9/10Immersion 4/10Grind Level 3/10 (low is good)Replay Value 3/10Overall fun 4/10			"

												As much as I wanted to love this game, it's terribad.Controls are garbage, with no real mouse support (the virtual stick which they've added in is a complete joke that may as well not even exist for how useless it is) in this day and age, kills any hope of it having any life beyond a $2 sale.  Games from 10 years ago managed to get this right, out of the box, there's simply no excuse today.Length is unforgivable despite the bargain bin price.  At BEST, the game is 4 hours of playtime, so unless you get it at the $2 sale price mentioned above, it's simply not worth putting up with and wading through the aggravation.There's suggestion from the developer that there will be DLC, but honestly, they need to give away content until it reaches a MINIMUM of 10 hours before even considering charging money for what should have come with the game.$2 max is all it's worth.

												I dunno ~ it felt alright and looked alright.  The basic concept is that you play an FPS space shooter like the old school PC games.  Protect the main ship and kill big/small ships attacking...  You don't explore or choose missions, its story based in large open areas.I just didn't like the way the weapons felt, not fun to shoot stuff, but it is fun to fly around.  The bad guys felt like they needed AI tweak. The mini-map is lame (needs 3D quad  space map, not 2D FPS map.)  The difficulty swings wildly... you are never in danger though.... just your fleet ship you spend most the game protecting.   I didn't finish it because I didn't feel like it.If you like this sort of thing, worth it at a discount... but it is a step backwards from Wingcommander in story space flight or Decent  in combat value - in my opinion.

Sure, the game may throw a new gun or missle or enemy type at you once in a while, but it always feels tacked-on and insignificant. Not like Wing Commander. How many of us replayed that mission in WC3 thinking we could repatriate Hobbes? How many of us played that mission in WC4 twenty times, thinking if you just flew good enough, you could end the game early by destroying the Kilrathi homeworld with Tolewyn's secret weapon? You will find nothing here that grips you like that, at least gameplay wise. Like I said, the story is pretty cool, so I'm just going to watch it like a movie on somebody's YouTube channel that does playthroughs.			"

This game could have gone Starlancer with it but for some reason the developer is obsessed with religious space radicals. Let me make it simple for you misguided developers. If you are going to go Wing Commander, you need to look at what Chris Roberts did and learn from it. He took WWII and turned it into a space combat dream. This...this like a bunch of teenagers played too much Dead Space then played maybe one mission of Wing Commander and deciding they could make something just as good.If you are going to copy X-Wing or Tie Fighter, the same deal goes there. You have to have your Empire and your Rebellion.This isn't rocket science! Heck if you have to copy something, look at space based anime. There are fantastic shows like Yamato 2199 which have a much better story than this tripe. I might finish this game someday but right now, its just pulling teeth trying to get through each mission.

												Passable space shooter.Absolutely nothing special, but a competent implementation of the genre. If you're after a few hours of non-newtonian space dogfighting with an instantly forgettable storyline, go for it. If you want larger scale a la Tie Fighter or Freespace then look elsewhere.			"

												Has it's fun moments. I think that the cons out weigh the pros...Cons: A.I. - both the enemy ships and your allies are completely one sided. As in, your allies are horrible and hold no aggro which means the enemies always just attacking you.Targeting is bad.Flight and combat is boring. Evasive manuevers? What are those?Leveling up with the points is just sad. Very linear.No additional equipment or ships to use?Pros:The game was cheap.It looks pretty decent.All voice acted dialog. "

												Dated graphics, boring gameplay..... and their backstory is nothing more than ""those are the enemy, go shoot them"". Forget about this one =(			"

												Taking into account that this was the developper's first try, I think this is a great showing for them. It is not as deep or fleshed out as some other bigger titles, but you get a fast paced, simple yet enjoyable space combat sim. For what it costs at the moment, I say pick it up.			"

												This is like the old Wing Commander games - Nav points, set missions, boom boom.If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this sort of this. It's the same type of thing, with updated graphics and hacking is a nice addition.The only criticism is the short gameplay. What I have for play time is accurate, from first play to beating the thing. They could add so much more to this, or the community could. They've thought about Workshop support, and that would give the game a permanent place on my hard drive.			"

												great game from a small team, I got the BETA and outright fell in live with it. Those who enjoyed Space Shooters from ye old ""Freespace"" or ""Wing Commander"" fans to those who dream of saving the human race (or what's left of it) with the only thing seperating yourself from space is 3 inches of steel and a glass pane, then this game is for you.Great job SEAMLESS ENTERTAINMENT, you made me cry... in a good way.

												I really want to like this game. Plot is great. Voice acting is superb for a videogame. But it's just not Wing Commander, and it plays like a sloooooooow MMO, where you're pretty much doing the same things for EVERY.BORING.MISSION. Sure, the game may throw a new gun or missle or enemy type at you once in a while, but it always feels tacked-on and insignificant. Not like Wing Commander. How many of us replayed that mission in WC3 thinking we could repatriate Hobbes? How many of us played that mission in WC4 twenty times, thinking if you just flew good enough, you could end the game early by destroying the Kilrathi homeworld with Tolewyn's secret weapon? You will find nothing here that grips you like that, at least gameplay wise. Like I said, the story is pretty cool, so I'm just going to watch it like a movie on somebody's YouTube channel that does playthroughs.			"

												Nem vagyok oda a sci-fi cuccokért, de Wing Commander a szívem csücske volt réges-rég. Ez részben hasonló. Az írányítás fura, de hamar megtanulható, bár néha rá kell jönni melyik billentyű kell bizonyos dolgokhoz (pl.: hekkelés). Összeségében nagyon jó kis játék, de nem könnyű még kis fokozatban sem, persze ez lehet csak a hozzánem értésből adódik számomra :P			"

												SOL: Exodus is a simple and repetitive game. All the missions share a general idea...fly around and shoot various enemy ships until something happens. Should be somewhat fun. But the controls, spaceship movement and limited weapons make you feel constantly underpowered and frustrated. You have three weapons. Machine gun, homing missiles and an energy orb that shoots out the front in a straight line. Only 1 of these weapons is useful and it’s the homing missiles. It’s also the only weapon that requires you to re-dock with the main ship (Atlas) to get more ammo. You also re-dock with the main ship for health. Graphically, SOL: Exodus was decent! I really didn’t have any issues with how the game looked. The voice acting is not the greatest. Delivering most lines in an unenthusiastic tone. Plus, the dialog comes one right after the other. Meaning there’s barely any pause between people talking. It sounds very procedural. There's lots of timer based things in this game. Sit around and wait for something to get scanned, etc. I felt like I was just along for the ride most of the time. I was forced to cheat and bump up the health of the Atlas and my ship for Mission 4. It just wasn't do-able without it. The game has a ""checkpoint"" system but upon dying...you start the mission all over anyway.  Pros+Got in a bundle which means I paid very little for it+Graphics are decent. Space looks niceCons+Repetitive+Average voice acting+Spaceship movement isn’t natural and holds no inertia+Only 1 weapon is useful+A lot of missions depend on your main ship's health. (Escort mission style essentially)+Felt underpowered all the time+No checkpoint system even though you see it come up on the screen. Dying = start mission over3/10 PoorBottom LineSOL: Exodus struggles in several keys areas that really bring down this fairly decent looking game.			"

												Anyone buying this game expecting Wing commander or Freespace look somewhere else. You only got 1 ship, no different weapon loadouts and a bad story. I would not recoomend this game. 2/10 stars.Try the demo before buying. Trust me, the game is much worse.			"

												This game crashes on startup for me, and the problem seems to occur for others, according to the community page. There is not likely to be a fix. Try the demo at the very least before buying.Interestingly, this game used to work for me. I don't know what broke it - possibly the upgrade to Win10, but there is at least one person reporting the crash on Win7. From what I remember, it was fairly fun, but that is irrelevant if it doesn't run any more.			"

												This is an entertaining game. It's not Freespace; the story isn't as good, there are no squad mechanics, and nearest I can tell no branching mission line. For those reasons nor is it Wing Commander. It's also, in my view, a bit too easy. It is also too short. That said, it was an entertaining few hours (my profile says 52 hours because I went out of town and left the thing running in the background, but I finished it in three hours over the last two days). I'd recommend it if it's on sale for a few bucks. This is not a game you really want to spend $25 or something for. For $6 I think it would be worth it. $8 might be pushing it a bit.			"
