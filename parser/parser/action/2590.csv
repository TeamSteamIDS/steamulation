												Alpha Prime is basically an extended tech demo, clocking in at 5 hours of playtime. And oh boy, does it show.Let me get out the good parts first. As far as tech demos go, it looks pretty, with loads of cool effects on many interiors (outside doesn't look that good), and runs very nicely on my crappy laptop at 1280x800 resolution, except when there's too many particles (my NVidia G105M HATES them), you probably will run this perfectly. Also, ALL cutscenes are in-game, which is definitely a plus for both disk space and cutscene quality (seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those pre-rendered cutscenes)....and that's all the good points.As for the bad points, well... everything else.The story is not just completely forgettable, it's also accompanied by hilariously bad writing and voice acting. I'll sum it up nicely for you: Miner has to find artifact on Mars-like planet because of ♥♥♥♥♥ ex-girlfriend, shoot many things because CORPORATIONS ARE EVIL (also evil robots for no good reason), ♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss fight for the artifact, dead because your ♥♥♥♥♥ was a ♥♥♥♥♥ all along. Seriously. I did not give a single ♥♥♥♥ about the story, except for the hilarious parts, my favorite being Paolo, the Italian with incredibly bad engrish, getting shot in the leg and saying ""No! Paolo go nowhere! Paolo is a cripple! Disability pension!"". Too bad the game kills him WAY too early, clearly he should've been the protagonist instead.Oh yes, the gameplay. Enemies have perfect accuracy and INSTANT reactions, which makes even Easy a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ nightmare. Enjoy sniper shotgunners and exploiting their line-of-sight by leaning or crouching behind things so you become completely invisible to them.Literally none of the weapons are either balanced or enjoyable, and ALL of them have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage. The first weapon is a useless hammer, you can attack as fast as you can press the mouse button but you gotta be WAY too close, not to mention every single enemy has a ranged weapon anyway, so good luck not dying. The pistol shoots too damn slow and feels underpowered. The shotgun is one of the worst i've seen in any game, you have to be almost as close as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hammer to do any decent damage (or any damage! Enjoy missing every shot while emptying all 8 shells!). The gatling rifle is the best one, which isn't saying much because it does ♥♥♥♥♥♥ damage and low ammo per clip. The sniper rifle would've been the best gun, had they not ♥♥♥♥ed up the zoom mode so badly that everytime you try to aim it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ chore and you'll miss many shots because of it. Both the rocket launcher and grenades are hilariously bad because you need sniper-like accuracy for it to do any decent damage, because the splash radius is just TINY. And finally the Flamethrower... the worst weapon in the game, yes, even worse than the hammer, you have to be almost as close to anything despite the flame going at least twice the distance for it to do any damage, and what it DOES damage is absolutely pathetic, a mosquito would deal more damage than this.What else? The movement is hilariously broken, especially the jumping. They let you do a floaty jump but if you fall more than 5 meters you're pretty much dead. As for landing the jump itself, it seems to slide off things until it finds the flattest surface possible, it's really weird and it causes weirder deaths because of it. Because stairs are treated like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ramps, I jumped downstairs and INSTANTLY DIED. And don't try to stand still either, because you'll slowly slide down that ♥♥♥♥ like's it's covered in butter. Also beware for anything with physics, it might just kill you, the most hilarious one is getting yourself killed by your own basketball. ON THE GROUND. JUST BECAUSE IT MOVED TOWARDS YOU. And finally, all the models barely look better than the ones on Doom 3, which is clearly what they were trying to mimic (some of them look just as ♥♥♥♥♥♥, too).Bottom line, just... don't bother. Only reason I even got this was because of a bundle. Spare yourself the torture.EDIT: Steam keeps putting this game on sale (I already regret making this funny), and I'd like to point out a few other things about the game, so here we go.This game has a lot of stuff that's so underused and generically/badly thought out, you can seriously tell this was a tech demo from the start and didn't actually evolve past that, they just made it longer.You get a hacking device early on in the game that lets you open locked doors and help you out in combat by making certain objects blow up... except sooner than you'd think, you'll never use it again unless you absolutely need to open a door. Zero combat use after a certain point.Yes, you can hack one of those silly remote-controlled box lifters at least twice during the game. Oh boy, just what I was missing from my favorite FPS game, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ box puzzles! Good thing I'll never see them again.Did I mention slow-motion? If you've paid any remote attention to the story, you know that stuff's Hubbardium, which is, you know... the very same reason that made everyone on the planet INSANE? And screw you if you think you deserve a good explanation for that (even in the end, it still doesn't make enough sense), so start pumping that ♥♥♥♥ into your veins and enjoy the orange effect.And finally, yes indeed, you do get to drive a vehicle in one of the final parts of the game, with decent physics to boot (as far as martian-like physics go anyway). But once more, it was badly thought out to the point that you'll only get a brief section of it and never see it again. Come on, split that stuff out evenly.Oh, and since people want to know the fun parts of the game, here's my list of screenshots, containing most of the amusing parts in the game. Enjoy.Some of Paolo's lines:

												Alpha Prime is a terrible game, and I kind of like it that way.It's chock full of awful encounters, you fight the same three enemies the entire game, half the guns are useless and the other half only slightly less so, and levels seem to stretch on endlessly as they blur together. ""Balance? To hell with that"" you can hear Black Element yell as a barely discernible enemy on the other side of the room head shots you with a shotgun. Elements from other games are unglamorously fitted into parts of the game, like a patchwork quilt of design that's been out of style for years and manages to be significantly worse still than what they were lifted from.There do not currently exist words in the English language strong enough to properly describe the true horror that is Alpha Prime's writing, such an elongated mess of horrendous characters, dialogue unfit for a B movie, plot lines thrown out and then just left there, and a bit of casual misogyny thrown in just for flavor. It's agonizing to listen to, stilted voice acting keeping it from even being somewhat amusing, and there is so, so much of it.Alpha Prime is bad; a masterwork of mediocrity at the best of times. But again...I kind of liked it, maybe because for as miserable as it most certainly is, it's strangely polished in ways that made it kind of endearing if only ever so slightly. It feels like a game that might have been an obscure hit a decade ago, and I guess part of me still enjoys the sort of game that is so unmistakably rubbish, but its developer still clearly put a ton of effort into making it so I'm willing to go along for the ride even as I ask myself what is wrong with me. It's not broken, well, mostly. It's just bland, tedious, uninspired and a posterchild for dreadful videogame writing (though I will definitely be using ""total lamers"" as an insult).Can I recommend it? Probably not. Would I play it again? Not on your life! Do I regret playing it? I wouldn't say so.			"

												This game is bad. but could be so bad it's funny kind of bad. Cheesy emotionless voiceacting,graphics are meh.And i just died from getting hit with a basketball.No seriously i found a basketball court, tried to score, ball hit the wall and flew back at me, and the ball did more damage then the pistols,shotguns and machineguns.And theres no checkpoints so SAVE for goodness sake.But it did make me laugh,you can pick up anything and throw it around,the dialogue is pretty riffable.And you can spam the melee weapon and end up hitting things faster then a machinegun which is pretty funny  If you like sci-fi cheese, and making fun of bad games this is for you.Got killed by a basketball 10/10			"

												For a buck from Humble Bundle it was a great play through, felt nostalgic like playing the first Red Faction all over again.Like other users have noted the voice acting is just awful.As for the accuracy from the enemys, It's a nice change from the COD/BF shooters where you can clear a room in seconds and be at full health just a moment later, to actually having to assess how you're going to clear the next room and prioritise which enemie to take out first.And to be honest, it's the first game that implemented leaning where it actually needed to be done.All that said, I would give the game still a low 6/10, mostly thanks to the game being so ''unpolished'' and wouldn't recommend for the retail price.

												I actually liked this one a lot, though I played on Easy after reading about the uneven difficulty.Enjoyed the gameplay, the story, the characters.  More than worth the $1 I paid for it, and now it's on sale for half that!Be aware that there's a LOOOONG unskippable cutscene at the beginning.Edit:  I've been told that the cutscene is, in-fact, skippable.  Either my memory fails me in this, or this has been patched in after I played it (not going to bother re-installing to make sure.)			"

												I have nearly 500 games in my Steam account, and the vast majority of them are still unplayed. So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.One Hour Reviews - Game 6Alpha PrimePurchase Date: 1/16/2014Alpha Prime is another game I picked up thanks to a Humble Bundle.  18 months later I am finally getting to check it out.  Turns out I could have waited.Alpha Prime starts out much like one of those B-movies you expect to see on the Sci-Fi channel, with a bit of a cheesy story and some bad acting.  After listing to a laughably bad impression of a drunk guy, I meet my ex-girlfriend and get an exposition dump to explain the start of the game.  So about the first 10 minutes of my hour long review is spent in the opening cutscenes.Eventually though I end up on a planet and find myself in trouble in no time.  I quickly discover this game has all of the hallmarks of a standard shooter.  It starts me with a crappy melee weapon and slowly but surely I find better weapons to upgrade to.  And it's all the weapons you'd expect to see from pistols, to shotguns, to assault rifles and grenades.Along with some rather bad acting and dialogue, everytime I would pick up a weapon, the game would tell me ""Picked Pistol"".  Not picked up.  I started to feel like I was playing Pokemon.  Pistol, I choose you!  Shotgun, I choose you!The enemy AI seemed pretty dumb, although they were all good shots, so it still added some difficulty to the combat.  You definitely want to quick save the game often, as you will be reloading a lot.  But not necessarily because you died in combat.  Once I had to reload because the entire game crashed.  Another time I was crawling through an airduct (another hallmark of a first person shooter), and I somehow managed to crawl through a fan without the game registering a collision.  So I kept crawling through the airduct but then I ran out of level, and fell out of the world.  Some games when you fall out of the world it will 'reset' you to a nearby save spot.  This game just kills you dead.The game lets you interact with items in the game, although most of the time it serves no purpose.  There was one time I had to drop a sheet of aluminum over a hole in the floor to run across it.  A few times I opened up air ducts or lockers.  But a lot of objects were just randomly lying around like books or boxes.My favorite though was the random basketball I ran across.  Not only that but I found it in a room with a basketball hoop.  I wasted several minutes trying in vain to make a shot.  It's hard to actually throw items in the game.  All you can do is drop things, but if you happen to be moving your mouse as you drop it, you can kind of 'fling' things around.  In the end, all I succeeded in doing was get the basketball stuck in mid air.  I even tried shooting it down with my assault rifle, but it wasn't going anywhere.Between the crash, the glitches, and the bad dialog, you're probably thinking this isn't a very good game, and you'd be right.  The only charm it has is in that B-movie vibe you get from the story, but even then it's pretty cheesy and there are some gaps in logic that make it hard to ignore.Like Pablo.  Pablo is a character you meet, who is kind of charming with his broken English.  He gets shot during a cutscene and goes on about his shot leg and how he can't go with you.  Then the cut scene ends, and there is Pablo standing up on both legs, watching as I leave.   Meanwhile, 5 feet away is a med station.  I guess the med stations don't work on bulletholes in legs or something.It's not so much that I dislike Alpha Prime, but there's really just nothing particularly redeeming about it.  There are simply much better games out there to spend your time on.Overall Recommendation:  Pass "

												As someone who grew up playing and loving a lot of FPS its been actually a long time since i have played one, let alone one with mouse and kb. Alpha Prime is a game that reminds me of the fun of i had with those games, but also more of reminder of just how far game dev. has come in such a short time. AP was released in 2007 alongside the likes of the first Uncharted, MW4, Crysis, Halo 3 to name just a few. Thats tough company to be a part of and why AP is forgettable. But while AP is just another Half-Life inspired shooter with horrible voice acting, terrible writing, and story the action is pretty intense, the level design and setting is strong and the game on normal setting was very challenging. If you are looking to scratch that nostalgic FPS itch Alpha Prime is not a bad choice.The GoodSetting,levels and pacingLeaning and being patient is vital for survivalIntense firefightsNo shield, No regenerating health, no auto aimAI is smart and always movingThe BadHorrible voice acting, writing, storyUseless weapons(hammer, grenades, flamethrower) and bulletimeWhy do i pick up horbarrdium, and vials scattered throughout lockers and levels are not used?AI is a little too perfect in aiming "

												Quite a long lengh game, Graphics are not brilliant but they work well with even bad computers and the story is not brilliant but i liked it and i would deffinatly reccomend buying it and i'll tell you why. Just with tv shows and films there are occasionaly a few with bad writing and they are usually rubbish but for some reason you find it enjoyable and sometimes needing it, my family call this (grippable crap).This games story/graphics and mechanics arent at all bad for the price, also the story can keep you on edge. There is alot of hidden agenda going on and as you play all you can know is what your character hears or sees. I personally found this quite grippable due to the thrill and mystery as you attempt to find out who is lying and who is on your side. Even after all that you can never truely know what was going on and what the characters are acctually like which is what kept me playing and what will probably draw you in further.As for the gameplay theres many ways to fight enemies: Guns / Hacking nearby machines / Throwing objects / slowmotion abilitys. Go on it's only 2.99			"

												Alpha Prime is a game that takes it's narrative very seriously not encumbered by the fact that it's narrative, along with every other thing in the game, is so mediocre it should win an award for it.The story is quite simple, and quite painful. It's a standard dystopian future. You are just another guy working for the Corporation(Yes it's actually called that) when something goes wrong on one of it's mining outposts and your ex-girlfriend sends you to save her current boyfriend trapped there.The gameplay is about as standard as it gets in the world of FPS's. It even has a token slow-motion feature. The weapons feel weak and the enemies are mindless drones.Although the game is not bad looking for it's time the lack of any sort of directed art style takes a lot away from it and the generic music and terribly uneven voice-acting leaves much to be desired.The only true highlight of the game is your insane Italian stereotype of a companion but he alone is not enough reason to buy.

Many elements in this game reminds me of the glorious days of Doom and Half-Life series.GFx and physix engine is really nice and i enjoyed them through the game.  Had some really funny moments as well using the physix. ;) You can ingame controll machines and cameras and in some places use machines to get past some levels. Using the forklift was quite fun to use i must say. The story is not the stongest but i must say i still enjoyed the story for what it was. The voice acting is like a B movie but ok.GFx 7-10 ( Gfx was really nice to look at for the most part. )SFx 7-10 ( Music is great but does not maybe fit the story? But still good to listen at. )Gameplay 9-10 ( fun fun )I think all who can enjoy a fps shooter will enjoy this game. And for the price of 4.99€ its a bargain. BUY!..Do i recommend it... YES!...

												Based on the reviews, I was expecting a really badly made game. However, I was somewhat surprised. Sure, Alpha Prime is nothing extraordinary, but it's not crap by any means either.It's a standard corridor FPS with a story. If you like FPS games, there is nothing to complain about here, aside from perhaps the difficulty being a bit too high. I've played on Easy and even then some sections were unusually hard and caused me to die many times.The story isn't bad either. Again, it's nothing groundbreaking, but for an FPS game it's pretty decent. Most FPS games don't make anywhere near the effort in the story department as Alpha Prime does. The cutscenes and the radio dialogue sections between the characters were a nice addition to keep the game interesting. Most characters were developed reasonably well in terms of personality.The graphics are very nice. Considering the game came out in 2007, those are pretty decent visuals, even by today's standards. The music is also not bad. There are only about 1 or 2 jarring heavy rock tracks, but the rest of the soundtrack is pretty good and gives a nice epic feel to the battles.The enemy variety could've certainly used some work. You spend a good 80% of the game just fighting spec ops, which gets repetitive eventually. There are some other gameplay sections added too, like hacking, and using a loader to move boxes out of the way, which is a nice change of pace, even if some sections were quite annoying. The loader in particular was difficult to control, and having to move a dozen of boxes out of the way just felt like a waste of time.In general the game is not as bad as the reviews claim it to be. It's just a standard, above average FPS that will keep you entertained for a few hours. If you are into the genre, give it a try, otherwise pass it up.			"

""Boom boom and good good!""Seriously though for a game released in 2007, this game is pretty alright. Voice acting: You'll either like it or you'll hate it because it's pretty bad, but for me it's quite funny so I like it (that Italian dude tho). Played it on hard mode right off the bat but it's cool. Some might say that this is too hard because the enemies' aim is good but it's more realistic that way so that's a plus for me, especially how you can use things to indirectly kill enemies. Graphics are good for its time, nothing to complain about.Buying it for full price would definitely be a gamble (considering people's tastes these days) but if you can get it for a good discount, then it would be a great buy indeed.Again, I'd like to remind you that this is a $5 game released in 2007. Don't expect too much of it so you'll [probably] have as much, more or less, fun with it as I have. Close enough.			"

												After playing for a hour this game, I have discovered this is probably one of the buggiest games I have ever played.**Most of the doors you can just walk troughThey dont block you even if they are locked, you just meet a wall there cause theres actually nothing there**Sound acting is just pure simple horribleLike Paolo, he has probably a American doing horrible Italian accent with words with no proper prounciation**The A.I is being stupidBasicly most of the time you can beat the enemies to death with a hammer, no problem, they wont even shoot you**You can die by anythingExample: Basketball, can of beer, a ragdoll, A GUN ON THE GROUND CAN KILL YOU BY PHYSICS AT FULL HEALTH**There's literally nothing stopping you walking trough the map Example in the vents, those vent fans you can go easily trough without giving a f*ck and fall trough the map into nothing**The game crashes when you close**The game crashes randomly**Most of the time you are in some tight closed hallway shooting down thousands of enemies all yourself11 out of 10Will play more and more and more, since actually these bugs happen a lot that It starts becoming funny.

												This was a good game overall, kind of surprised me after reading some of the reviews. Like others, I played on easy due to the recommendations, but even then there were times the AI seemed to be soo acurate, with nearly one hit kills.Saying that, I actually enjoyed having to think before going into a room. The oxygen and health dispensers was a novel idea, and the complete storyline was well done. Arnie had a great voice, and the one liners he came out with, made it flow well.I recommend this game. Yes, its a cheapish one, but so what. It was released about 7 years ago, but it still stands well compared to some newer games I've played.But do it on easy to start with *wink*Here's a little review I did of it as well:

Review for Alpha PrimeProsGameplay I personally enjoyed the gameplay it was fun to play, other reviewers mention that its similiar to Doom which i haven't played maybe that is the reason game felt so good and enjoyable.
Soundtrack I liked the music in game, in all action moments in was just as needed it made everything interesting. Very good soundtrack.
ConsStory It wasn't interesting, you could say what would happen who is who and so on. Very predictable and simple.
Cutscenes Everyone who played the game or most of the people who played the game didn't like them, they were long simple and uninteresting.
Technial problems Game craches once every hour for me, i completed game in more then 3 hours and it crached 3 times for me.
DecisionGame itself can be quite enjoyable for it's short time, but it has too many bad sides to recommend it to anyone, if you get it for free or almost free you can check it out as gameplay and soundtrack is good but that's all that there is to it.5 out of 10 "

												I figured I'd write a review in case you have some spare coins and are looking for a cheap game.I've played through this twice so I know this game and some of it's problems.In short: This game feels like a mod for Doom 3.First off, the game is really linear and doesn't sport much exploration. There are a few exceptions; secrets and alternative routes. Good level design helps very much in this regard as each area feels pretty well thought out and assets doesn't feel overly repeated.I thought level design was pretty good. What messes things up is the scripted stuff. I.E take the wrong route, the jump-scare-enemy bugs out and crashes your game... twice.. or until you enter the room through the expected entrance. If you spot enemies and shoot them from afar, an elevator might not come down because the enemies the were scripted to use it and bring it down, thus, you'll have to reload to an earlier savegame.Unfortunately, stuff like this screws the game up badly. Use quick-saves often.This game is pretty weak on the story, which is delivered by some of the absolute worst voice actors I've heard. There are no exceptions. In fact, it's so bad it gets good. Ironic as it is, I laughed through the cut-scenes. Not much of it makes sense. Theese things, though unintentionally, serves as a comical break between game-play. It just feels funny.. for some reason. Brilliance in it's own, accidental way.Difficulty wise, the game is schizophrenic. You'll have a complete breeze throughout the first third of the game. Braindead A.I. This gets compensated as the soldiers appear. It's not easy any more. The difficulty suddenly sky-rockets through the roof. It's braindead A.I but with pinpoint accuracy. Regardless, it's a challenge.This game also features a hack system. You can hack surveillance cams, turretguns and locked doors to reach secret areas.Hacking is really only required once, and that is to open a door. Everything else is solvable without it.Vehicle sections in this game is bad. You'll want to get them over with as soon as possible. Thankfully you won't have to do it much.Alpha Prime is not a game with a limited two-weapon system, you can actually carry the entire arsenal. However, you are most likely to use the assault rifle.. It's way too overpowered compared to the other weapons. You'll only use the sniper rifle when the distance requires a scope, otherwise the assault rifle is about as accurate, holds more rounds and fires more rapidly.In close quarters, you'd normally favour a shotgun, but a two shot burst with the assault rifle is just as good and ammunition is plentiful. The use of explosives is rarely ever called for, and in those situations, they are so unreliable you might be better off with the assault rifle even in these situations. Lastly, the embarrassing axe that leaves bullet-hole decals on walls. It fires as fast as you can click your mouse button. It's completely broken. Luckily, you'll never ever find use for it. It's exists just for the sake of it.In terms of graphics, this game can't compete with the mainstream contemporaries of it's time (which would be Bioshock or ... Crysis). Rather, this game looks like a bright Doom 3, which means it looked dated even at release. But as this game is old and has a low pricetag, that shouldn't matter now.Sound assets works. Nothing really special to mention here. None of the weapon-sounds makes them feel punchy enough, but the overall ambience is doing it's job rather well.So, overall, this game looks and feels like a non-scary Doom 3 mod. It's kind of a B-graded game that certainly has it's problems. But if you are ready to overlook that and just take it for what it is, (a game that's actually cheaper than a subway sandwich) you might have good time with it. I know I had.I like it for what it is.Cheers!			"

From what I played it was really good! The Ai is smart for how old this game seems to be, and also they're very hard to destroy. Though it sometimes gets confusing where you are suppose to go... I got stuck lots of times because I couldnt figure out where I was suppose to go, Hit, or anything. There are no markers telling you where to go, so sometimes you just have to guess. Overall though, It ends up Entertaining. For such a small amount of money, It's pretty good.			"

												On the plus side, Alpha Prime’s cut scenes are so bad they’re almost amusing. Monotone voices recite bizarre dialog, main character Arnold makes side remarks to his ally Livia, then Pablo turns up with his broken English and immediately starts taking about flotillas hidden in shoes. What?!Alpha Prime reminds me of the generic Doom clones that came out in the early 90’s when everybody and their mother was having a go at making these games. You wander down generic corridors, often without any objective.  Robotic foes turn up and stand largely motionless while their hitscan weapons cause your health bar to deplete, and you fire back with an arsenal seemingly manufactured by Fisherprice, Also who names their FPS protagonist Arnold?

												I would call this game decent in almost every aspect. The graphics are not bad for a 2007 release I think. OK, it's not Crysis but that game was way ahead of it's time. Compared to the more typical games from that year, it holds up well. The sound is probably the weakest part of the game. Guns and other sound effects are really not that interesting.There are quite a lot of cutscenes with spoken dialogue in the game. Storyline and voice acting is again, decent. Certainly not the on the level of the more big budget releases but that's ofcourse understandable. I've seen and heard worse. The AI baddies have very limited dialogue. The ""Go go go!"" and ""Quickly fallback!"" can get on your nerves quickly, especially when you encounter larger groups. Just kill them... quickly (or fallback :) The game lends some aspects of some well known FPS games, like the resupplying of health from dispensers on the walls, like in Half-Life. (So no health regeneration) The slowmo from F.E.A.R. although it doesn't seem to work that well, like in F.E.A.R. I ended up not using it that much. Along the way you pickup various weapons. Nothing like we've never seen before. There's a melee weapon, pistol, shotty, machine gun, a sniper like weapon, flamethrower and rocket launcher. Oh and of course, your grenades :)Don't expect this game to be a walk in the park. It can be really challenging on normal or hard difficulty. The AI is deadly accurate and you take a lot of damage really fast. It can lead to frustration fast if you are not careful enough.  It's not a game were you can storm into every room Rambo style to shoot everything that moves. Luckily you can quicksave the game instead of having a checkpoint system. You can also hack security camera's, often giving you the ability to see what's in another room. There's also the ability to lean, wich works well and is a welcome addition to this type of shooter.  The game doesn't do anything new or something that you will remember for years to come. It's more of a short blast. If you are into a more simplistic shooter, with above average difficulty, this is an interesting game to look at. Especially giving the fact that the game barely costs anything.			"

												This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It has some atrocious voice acting. This may be a plus for you, and if it is, you're in luck, as it's about the only redeemable part about it. Especially the random Italian dude who goes by the name of Paolo Bellini. He's a boss. And the two drunkards in the beginning of the game too.Everything else though? Well, let's see here. The gameplay is asinine. You'll have enemies shooting you through walls, shouting the same 3 lines of dialogue over and over again just to occasionally peek out the corner to try and take a shot at you. They're damn accurate but fortunately you have shrooms (hubbardium) that gives you bullet time so I guess that's okay. :|There's a plot but it's forgettable since it's been done so many times before. Yet the game thinks otherwise as it loves its cutscenes, sometimes being really long and drawn out. Also I guess there was a twist but you could see it a mile away anyway since there were only like 5 characters. And when the plot tells you one of them isn't what they appear to be, I'm just going to say that it's probably not that hard to find out.The dialogue and the voice acting, as mentioned above, are so bad it's good sometimes, especially the main character's attempts at humor. And you get calls, a lot of calls. One of these even got me killed once, as my character sat there listening as the dialogue kept going on while this one soldier kept shooting him until he was dead. And no, I couldn't skip the damn call. Autosaves? What are those? This game doesn't do autosaves until you beat the level you're in, so get used to quicksaving a lot.All in all this game is worth it only for the ridiculous dialogue but you can probably find that in YouTube clips. Play it only if you're high, otherwise, avoid.			"

												Think I'm a little bit late to the party, but I actually very much enjoyed this game.  Rarely do games keep enough of my interest to complete it in one sitting, especially when it's 8 years old and story-driven, but this one did just that.  It was the whole package: the Doom-esque gameplay, the story genuinely kept me interested, some of the characters were poorly voice acted but I liked their writing (and accents, if nothing else).Few gripes with the gun imbalances, some cheap-death scenarios (but knowing they're cheap along with the ability to quicksave sort of renders that null for me), some of the movement and map geometry, and a few times some buttons I had to find to progress... certainly not a perfect game, but fun.Relatively small dev team, too.  So that's neat.  Solid recommendation - flawed but entertaining.Also, basketballs are made of pure lead.  Trust me.			"

												While many things could have gone worse, Alpha Prime finds itself so deep in the uncanny mediocre valley that it just annoys me. At times the action is fair and challenging, only to then become frustrating and unfair moments later. Sometimes the story hints at a better direction, but then falls back into of the pit of Not-worth-caring-for. All in all, the two euros I got it for wasn't a huge setback. But with so much potential for something cool and possibly refreshing at best, the most infuriating thing about Alpha Prime is that it never gets anywhere near you think it should. If you're starving for a bit of Sci-Fi action and find it cheap, go ahead if you're willing to risk it. There were moments when I enjoyed myself, but they were too weak, as well as scarce. But despite any redeeming factors it might have, you're better off playing almost anything else.			"

												A classic FPS with a lot of interesting mechanics that you wouldn't expect in a low budget game.It reminds me a lot of Chrome from Techland (especially the music) , one of my favorite shooters.The graphics are good. The controls are ok , although you might need to experiment with the mouse sensitivity a bit. The story is nothing you haven't heard or seen before , but it could be worse. The AI is not very intelligent and seems to hit you always , but at least they don't know you're there until you shoot or come closer , so you can sometimes take some of them out with headshots before they shoot back. You can use a bullet time power that you get early in the game to make this a little easier. You'll also get a simple remote hacking device that allows you to hack cameras in the next room or hack gas pipe so they explode and can take out some enemies if they are near the pipe. If you're desperate you could also throw random objects at your enemies :) . SO if you're looking for an interesting and original story this is probably not your game. If your looking for a decent shooter that doesn't cost too much and offers you several hours of fun , then you should definitely try it. There is a demo available by the way so you you can test it without having to pay money. Also don't overcritize the game should you not like it ... it's a low budget game as i said and for that they did a fine job.			"

												For the most part, I’d say that the weak points overpower the few positives in Alpha Prime and because there isn’t anything that’s really new or unique and the sound ruins the intensity, I find it fairly boring. You shoot enemies, watch a cut scene, shoot some more, interact with something, repeat.A pretty shell for a game that's pretty lacking. Not much fun. Flashy weapon effects partially mask the mediocre gameplay, and to the untrained eye, Alpha Prime could almost pass as ""Doom 3"".All in all this game is solidly average. It’s a decent if predictable story saddled with a pedestrian game.			"

												Is this game worth the full asking price?  No, probably not. There's simply too many other, better games out there to be had for the same price.Is this game fun? Sure it has it's moments. At times it feels more like a strategy game than a straightforward shooter.At no time in this game can you do anything even resembling what is shown in the videos above, as far as running around jumping at enemies throwing grenades and shooting rampantly. You will always be low on HP, and low on ammo. The enemies always shoot first and they never but rarely ever miss. Most of them take 8-10 shots to the face to kill, and they come in groups.The weapons are frustratingly bad. Others here have mentioned how incredibly terrible the shotgun is, and I agree, for a game anyhow. Most FPS players are used to an overpowered unrealistic shotgun. In the MW and COD games you are using a rifled barreled fully choked military grade weapon. In this game, the shotgun is basically a sawed off shotgun from a seedy pawn shop. Surprisingly is shoots very similar to a real sawed off shotgun, but that doesn't mean it should ever have been put into the game this way. You'll need to be no farther than about 15 feet from your target if you hope to even hit it. About 6 feet if you hope to kill anything. It's just frustrating. Especially since the game keeps giving you ammo for the damn thing, over and over and no ammo for the assault rifle, which itself is pretty underpowered.  I found myself going for my pistol, over the shotgun, because the pistol is so overpowered compared even to the AR that it's kind of silly. Too bad you rarely get any ammo for it.The best gun in the game by far in my opinion in the sniper rifle. Though throughout the entire game, you'll only get about 40 rounds for the thing, and all but the lowest enemies require 2 or 3 shots to the face to kill with it. Why is it my favorite? I don't know, I guess it's the only one of the weapons that almost felt like it was done right.The grenades are a joke. You can toss one 4 feet from a guy, and he won't even go into the damage animation.You literally have to hope the grenade lands at his feet, preferably ON his feet if you want him to die.I suppose I should mention there is a Flamethrower, a Rocket Launcher, and a Hammer for a melee weapon.No real reason to mention them though. On several occasions I hit an guy in the face with a rocket, and he didn't even care. I'm sure it did some damage, but it's comical to see such a huge explosion, and out of the fire and smoke the guy is still shooting at you.The Flamethrower has the range of a hairspray can lit with a lighter. It's sometimes funny to watch the flame thrower enemies shooting flame at you from 8 feet away and you not taking damage. It's not so funny when you're the one using it though. Also it's comically underpowered. A complete botch of a weapon and no surprise, there's plenty of ammo to be found for it. The game also hides the damn things in secret rooms, as if it's some super weapon you'd actually want to use.The Hammer is your melee weapon.It's so pathetic that it even exists that it's hard for me to find words as to describe why it's even in the game.Enemies shoot you with unmissable headshots from hundreds of yards away, and the game gives you a frigging hammer.Do I even need to mention it's uselessly underpowered?The levels are passable. They are strictly linear affairs, which isn't uncommon. The amount of unused and useless rooms was probably meant to give the game some feeling of depth, but to me it just felt unfinished.The platforming parts of the game are stupid. This game should not have them. The jumping is beyond bad. Your legs are made of glass, because if you fall or jump from more than about 6 feet you will die. I'm no badass weapon weilding space marine like this guy but I've somehow managed to survive jumping off the side of a pickup truck. That would be death for the hero of this game.The physics in the game are annoying. Throughout the game, most things you grab will fall through the floor, or go into a frenetic jiggle spazm until it flies across the room, only to then sink into the floor when it comes to a rest. It was kind of cool to have to take the lid off of boxes to see what was inside though. Unfortunately of the hundreds of boxes in this game, only about 10 have anything in them. Which lead me to beleive the location for the game is a facility to mine and store Empty Boxes.There's an F5 quicksave feature that eventually becomes so necessary that you become glad it doesn't take but a second or two for it to save. I found myself killing one enemy, hitting save, killing another, hitting save, etc.So why am I giving this game a thumbs up?Truthfully, it's a bad game, but I had fun in spite of myself. Plus there's 90% off Steam coupons to be had which means you can experience the pain of this game yourself for only 50 cents. It's hard to pass up anything for that price.If nothing else, you can have the experience of what an FPS game is like when you do nearly everything wrong in making it.			"

												You ever been in a car crash and seen it coming?  In that split second before it happens you think ""Oh man, this is gonna suck.""  That's what I felt like while installing this game.  I also go that feeling while setting the graphics options, and again during the first 20 or so minutes that I've played as I write this.  So far, so accurate.  Graphics are actually not terrible considering it's age, but oh man.  This is gonna leave me with a sore back in the morning.  Worse than that time that I tried to suck my own junk for an hour straight thinking that if I could just make it another inch or two I'd reach the promised land.  Nope.  At best you just end up with a load in your mouth, and what the Hell good is that?  Anyway.  Yeah.  I'm going to finish this game though, because my game backlog is huge and I deserve nothing less.

												Bloody hell, this game is awful.Terrible gunplay, worse animations, laughable voice acting that makes The House of the Dead 2 look good. Horrible graphics too.The story is completely forgettable, there's something about a space mine in a planet and everything goes south, crazy people goes around with guns, robots, an italian guy... I don't know. You can tell from the first 10 minutes that the game tries too hard to be Doom 3, and FEAR too (that bullet time effect...) It's just another shooter trying to copy the big ones and falls into mediocracy like many others, don't waste your money.Good thing I bought this with the Humble Bundle.

Unless you play perfectly, you will haave to find a healing station after almost every fight with the robots.

												Alpha Prime is a Sci-Fi FPS based on a space station (a mine for a rare, new mineral called habardium.. or something) which has suffered an accident and on which there are only a handful of survivors. You have been sent in at the behest of your ex in order to save their current husband to be from the station.The game plays somewhat like an inferior Fear, having sci-fi weaponry and the ability to slow down time for a short while, but the guns in the game feel very underpowered. The assault rifle is the only weapon that is of any worth - the sniper rifle, shotgun and pistol doing practically no damage and being inferior in every situation to just tap shooting from the assault rifle. For 10 rounds you can kill an enemy which may take a second or two, but two shotgun blasts will take perhaps double that - and the shotgun is only able to be used at close range, where your health will vanish pretty quickly.The game is pretty unforgiving in some places with the combat. Your slow motion doesn't recharge on it's own and requires the mineral harbidudmidmm (you know, the mineral that's being mined on the station that you're turning into your own battlezone) and a single enemy, unchecked, can easily kill you. Additionally, ammunition for the assault rifle is pretty hard to find, even though it drops off of the enemies that you kill, meaning that a tight spot might grow tighter.The game has aged to a far greater degree than Fear, whilst the Unreal 2 engine's physics and lighting standards are still adequete enough, the physics in this game leave much to be desired. Ragdolls seem to go through objects sometimes and get stuck in them, the ground is often littered with random objects which you can easily get snagged on and the lighting seems hardly like a step up on DOOM. TL;DR it sucks			"

												Alpha Prime is not a bad game, it's just boring. When I started playing it, I expected something Doom-3-esque, with elements of thriller and an atmosphere of a dead mining station, and first couple of levels looked exactly the same, but 30 minutes into the game it became dull. I really appreciate the fact that you can die fairly easily if you are not careful and an encounter with two enemies is already a problem, but it's done the way you wouldn't want it to be: enemies absorb bullets like sponges and can survive even after half of a machine-gun clip is shot in their head. The other problem is a permanent lack of ammo towards the end of the game. ""Hardcore"" you may say, ""Bad game design"" i may reply. This game also has some interesting features, like hacking system, and it's a shame that it hasn't been developed enough anв there's almost no use in it, except the parts where you must hack something to proceed further into the game. The last, but not the least problematic thing is the plot: it is silly, illogical, predictable and even naive, not to tell that voice acting is fairly below average (seriously, I couldn't keep a straight face while listening to that Italian guy). I found myself enjoying playing some of it's parts and rather liked than disliked the game overall, but I'm almost sure that you won't. Every gamer has his own standards and mine are low enough to play this boring piece of crap and even don't mind some of it's major problems, but seriously, go play Doom 3 or Escape from Butcher's Bay, or FEAR instead, they are worth your time much more than this.

												A fairly standard FPS, with a bit of an old-school bent to the gameplay. I like the simple and fun shooting mechanics. The engine is actually quite nice looking, with shaders reminescent of IDTECH4 games. The story could have been quite excellent, but it was not fleshed out well.Weapons are okay, though not all of them are useful. Enemies are difficult but not very intelligent. Oh, and Bellini is one of the worst steretypes of an Italian I've ever had to endure in anything. That was quite insulting :P			"

												If this game is on sale for a good price I'd recommend picking it up; I did get a few hours of fun out of this game. However, if you're one of those people whose interest in games weighs heavily on the storyline then do NOT get this game as the voice acting is terrible. The fps gameplay doesn't bring anything new to the table but it does feel very smooth. Keep in mind that once you get to level 6 the game becomes quite difficult, and not because it is a fun challenge but because the AI is a bit ridiculous (near perfect accuracy on ""Easy"" difficulty).

												Excellent game. I have not completed it yet because of it's extreme difficulty and it reminds me A LOT of F.E.A.R. and Dead Space, with Hubardium being the Marker and the slightly repetitive enemies and levels. This was just a sum-up. I feel it's good for anyone who likes FPS's and a bit of a challenge. Basically F.E.A.R. minus the scary bits and in-depth storyline. I got it for $1 a few months ago and it wasn't even on sale! But now it's $5. Great game all around and I can't make a full opinion because I haven't completed it so I don't know if the story is really in depth or if there are any plot twists. 8 and a half/10 Nah a solid 9.

												Good little shooter, enouigh storyline for the genre, for me anyway.  Decent graphics, very low price, runs like a scalded hound on even my old core 2 duo.  No crashes or weirdness, cutscenes are amusing and do advance the story somewhat.  Reminds me a bit of Sin-Episodes, only I like this better.  I tried enabling PhysX, didn't like the look of the game as well with it, and made it crashy and messed up my save, only time I had a technical problem.  If you try to run and gun in this, you will be very dead, use cover and pick your shots.  Also, no regenerating health, which is a plus for me.People make a big deal about a bug where you can kill your character with a rebounding basketball, I found that hilarious.  It is bizarre, but I haven't seen many (any?) games without some strange effect in one place or another.  I've been stuck behind a box in Quake 2, stuck to the surface of a lift in Half Life, and been killed in Halflife 2 by walking next to a stationary train, just to name a few.  These games all cost me $50+, as opposed to $1.09 for this one.  Just don't play with basketballs.  :)			"

												God, this game was really getting on my nerves. You are a, not so, elite ""prospector"" with the desire to help your former crush. So you go off to a foreign planet, where a big mining operation found something called ""the heart"". Although you are just there to find your crush's boyfriend, the company doesn't like that at all, and sends the marines.So you are in a small war, with the great myth of whom to trust. The marines, that come after you are really smart, the work together and if you retreat, don't follow you blind into their death. You really have to be patient and thorough to be sure you got them all, they are hiding in places where you won't expect them, atleast I didn't. When you like fast tactical fights, one against many, in almost always tactically disadvantageous situetions this game is actually not that bad. The story could use a little less ""phone calls"" and a little more actual human interaction, but is still nice, and you got to ask yourself ""who is the real bad guy here?"". Because of the high difficulty and you skills of being downed to 1 HP and 5 minutes away from the next healthpack, make good use of the Quicksave key, you will need it.			"

												This game got justifiably panned upon release. It follows a typical pattern for many games of having a delayed release that's delayed so long that its engine is just archaic compared to current titles released in a normal time frame. Alpha protocol and the  world environment in Dragon Ages are good examples of this both of which have engines that are over five years old. This game pretty much sucks, but you have to keep a couple things in perspective. If you go into the game knowing that it is old (think 2004-2005 quality) and you only pay 99 cents like I did, taking those things into account makes the game not so bad. Combat with aliens later is much worse, particularly boss battles; all of which take place in small environments that The braindead A.I. cannot compensate for. So if you are a FPS ♥♥♥♥♥ and you buy this game for nothing and you recognize that the game is archaic compared to its release date, you might actually enjoy this game. Or you might not...			"

												A classical FPS, with the classical weapons - you know, pistol, shotgun, machine gun, sniper rifle, flamethrower, rocket launcher, grenades - that kind of thing. However, it has a few orginal aspects. Like the ReCon hacker tool that let's you hack into cameras, open locks, and take control over all sorts of machinery.The game is fun, though, and sometimes quite challenging, because the enemy are no imperial storm troopers. They actually know how to hit a target. When they shoot at you, they will hit you. The rarely miss. So you have to use cover all the time. Luckily, one of the moves you can do is peek around the corner to shoot.The story is a bit... meh... but, who plays an FPS for the story, eh?			"

The action itself once you get past the laborious cut scenes is run of the mill fps without anything to really make it stand out.  You play for a bit, then comes another dreaded cut scene or bit of dialogue read with all the energy of wet bread.  The character models are awful, showing no emotion at all, with hollow expressions. I don't like giving negative reviews, but after 20 minutes of play and two cut scenes, I uninstalled this stinker. Avoid this one, even if it's free.			"

You are John Prime (or whatever his name is) who is lured by his ex to save her current boyfriend from what can only be described as the biggest cluster♥♥♥♥ of trouble ever. Yep , stuck on a mining planet with a bunch of crazed miners and hostile robots. And then the corporation owning the mine sends swat teams to clean up the mess (you included).Gameplay is pretty standard- you've got your shotgun , machinegun , sniper and stuff. Oh , and bullet time. Bullet time is pretty much useless , cause unlike other games that use a slowing time mechanic , here your bullets and you get slowed down the same amount as the enemies. You know how in Max Payne you trigger bullet time while falling so you gently soar like an oak leaf in October , but you still can aim with almost the same speed as outside bullet time , and your bullets travel a little bit faster than the enemy's. Well you wont see that in Alpha prime. In bullet time you move and shoot just as slow as your enemies , you still aim at normal speed , but it seems the AI does too. What you can , and should use are the lean buttons. Yep , [Q] and [E] are going to be your best buds again after all these years (ok you might have used E for Use , its bound to F now). I have found that you take 5-10 times less damage if leaning compared to popping out using A/D. Your health does not regenerate , but there are med kits and med stations (a-la Half Life/Jedi Knight) scattered around.Oh , also , dont let the screenshots fool you - the game has 1080pIn conclusion: OK game if you like generic FPS , can be a little unforgiving at times , but the first few levels have more than enough med kits.Also , I read someones review , that said objectives pop up for a few seconds and then you cant check them afterwards. Not true - you need to hold down the Z key (redefineable , I use TAB)			"

												Game was a nostalgic blast for me. Solid shooter that clearly takes its influence from the Half-life 2 style era while looking like a prettier and more optimistic Doom 3. However it honestly has better gunplay than both. ADS, peeking, solid hit detection, good feeling to the guns, and challenging shoot outs with an optional bullet time element and some occasional triggerable eviromental bits through the game's ""hacking"" feature. The game is also a lot of fun with how it lets you toy with the world around you with some gimmicky but fun physics that range from lifting lids off of crates for ammo to simply playing basketball in a gym room. Oh and no regenerating health, you find your supplies across dispencers and pick-ups like it should be done giving the game more depth and challenge. Its mostly raw solid gunplay and shooter action following familiar mechanics that works out pretty well. The game also has some of the best music I've probably heard in a long time from an FPS game, and the best part is it's free on their website.The game attempts a story, but the less said about it might be for the best as it really isn't that great and far from the highlight of the game. By the end the plot seems a bit confused of itself and ends on a note that will likely just leave you scratching your head. Meanwhile another thing worth noting on the downside is that several of the game's special mechanics get a little underplayed on the last two levels with the bullet time recourse running low, and hackable objects basically removed from battles. The game is also critcized for near perfect AI aim, which is true but honestly I think it actually added to the fun. Peaking around corners and trying to hit headshots before they shot back at me was just a part of adapting to the gunplay and felt natural. The AI also moves around, doges, calls out orders, and fliches to damage also giving them more life and opening them up to weak points making their aimbot skills more tolerable. At the end of the day I really enjoyed this game and it kind of made me sad we don't get games like this anymore. It had a weird plastic sci-fi feeling with amazing industrial techno rock music that felt right and sort of felt nostalgic of the 90's/early 2000's while giving me gameplay from a better era of corridor shooters. I'd recomend this game to people who grew up around an earlier era of FPS, or just want a bit of an escape from the current market for a good cheap action packed FPS. I suppose you could look at it as a cheesy fun comfort game in that regard. Oh and again, its cheap... $5.... considering people are buying retro 2D torture platformers for double or more, I'd say this is a steal of a deal by comparison.			"

												Hah.... hahahah. This game seriously must be a joke. I actually bought this game half expecting it to be like Chrome (remember that game? yea I didn't really either...) But what I got seemed to be so bad it was funny. The movement is fluid if nothing else but that is where the enjoyment ends....I spent a good amount of time laughing at the horribly animated cinematics and how the voice actors sounded worse than my mothers soap operas. Everything sounded so out of place. Not to mention that the story has plenty of holes, as it appears you are the ONLY PERSON who can possibly save 1 person on a planet full of crazed maniacs...Oh yea, and the back story, non-existant; all you know is that your character looks like Bill Muray and that he has some history with a chick, and he likes to have long...dramatic... monolauges. Let me just bring into perspective how laughable this is, the game give you the cheesiest looking hammer in the world to begin with, as a weapon... in a planet you know you will need to defend yourself on... I spent about half an hour walking around yelling ""FIX IT FELIX"" and then replying to myself saying ""THIS GAME CANNOT BE FIXED"".Enemies only have the edge as their 6th sense allows them to turn on a dime the second you enter a room, they are creepy sounding and clunky, which makes them terrifying in ways the game didn't even intend. Other than that they are laughable, and take a few hammer swings to cough up what ever gun they are carrying. So what do enemies in this game look like? Anyone who's alive. I ran into one friendly and quickly lost him, + robots, can't live without the robots.Weapons are unimmaginative, you have a pistol, a shotgun, a rifle and some grenades and then probably some more weapons I failed to care about retrieving. The weapons are slow, sluggish and don't give you the feel of power a gun should. Over all this game is a waste of money, I couldn't even beat it as a joke. It was so bad that I actually had to debate getting any further than I was. All in all, I would say that it isn't worth it unless you are like me and unfortunately got it in the developer pack (which I would totally recommend for just about every other game than this one)			"

Con:Short game to complete, and one of those annoying progress->save->die->progress->save->die->...die->die->die kind of games. Slow-mode was interesting but only marginally useful in game at best. Character dialogues, cutscenes, and overall story all were uninteresting, lacking substance. no depth in voice acting. Graphics consistantly produces aches after 15 minutes of game time. every. single. time. Literally a pain to play. "

The story is basic, but it has some twists. Hacking and vehicles are here.

Take your time with the Demo!First one point to give. This game isn't at all that bad, but it's few virtues don't suffice to make it recomendable.Before you buy this game, try out the Demo - if you like the game, buy it, you probably won't regret it at all. If you are in doubt or even have reservations against this game, don't buy it. It is at time very stereotypical and sadly very shallow. The fights are ""sometimes"" marvelous, not always though, because sometimes the AI glitches. One reviewer noted that you need brains to play the game. I wouldn't say so, the game is at times too easy and sometimes even with all tactical acting so unfair (which might have to do with some of the AI glitches) that younger and more agressive audiences will often ragequit the game. I experienced myself one rather ugly glitch, were an enemy fell off a ledge (the same fall would have killed you instantly by the way) and was unreachable by my own armaments, the foe was unkillable - at the same time he could kill you in his spare time with a rocket launcher. This wasn't the only instance in which the impression came to mind that the game could cheat.You have to keep in mind though, that this game was released in 2007, so it's dated and maybe it might have trouble with some GA settings. On the other hand this game is solid, not good but neither bad. It's hard to give a recomendation based on just what I experienced in the game. So I create here a conditional recomendation. If you are into FPS with Sci-Fi or Science Horror genre settings you might wish to add this game to your library, but Fans of the ""pure"" FPS genre beware, this game might take you to places you never wanted to know - maybe ask your friendly collorectal surgeon next door whether he can give you some insights about a place were the sun never shines.Personally, I won't recomend the game at all, the story is a bit to worn for me, and there are too much stereotypes and even to much bad placed movie quotes inside...

												Alpha Prime is a mediocre game in the guise of a hilariously bad one. It is just as boring as Quake II, but Alpha Prime made me realize that Quake II had some solid gameplay concepts under the hood. The game is so in love with its first draft story that it stops the game to recite it the same way an overpaid Linux engineer interrupts a company meeting with an ode to Hungry Man dinners. It's three hours long, but even at that length it's intolerably boring.			"

												This is a bad game overall. I will be comparing this game to Bioshock and Half-Life, the two master pieces this game tries hard to imitate. Issues I had with the game:My biggest gripe is the constant stop and go with game play. What causes the stop and go? The constant com link chats you have with in game characters. Unlike Bioshock where you are allowed to keep walking and keep up the action, when a character decides to chat with you through the radio you are forced to stand still until the conversation is over. This can take 15 seconds or 2 minutes. It really hurts the game play. It might be better if the voice acting for some of the characters wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ poor. (Oh my word that Italian guy is the absolute worst). One momment you're jumping into a large areana killing guys and then heading upstairs only to be stopped half way up to talk about interpersonal relationships with a girl who has you in a cuckhold.. which brings me to my next gripe.The story is bad. It does a poor job of trying to explain itself. I felt like it could have been really awesome. In the begining I was actually interested. You first land on the planet and you get a hard Bioshock vibe. These old miners are addicited to this mineral and they fight anyone who comes near. (Sounds like ADAM and Splicers, right?) But the game quickly throws these enemies out and replaces them with the same 4 cookie cutter enemies for the rest of the game.  The relationship between the main protagonist and the girl changes so often, one moment he'd die for her and the next he's complaining about her demanding nature... pick a side fella.Sides, theres another gripe I have with the game. The game gives you 3 characters that are on your ""team"". The only thing they will ever do in the game is talk to you over the radio. Once you actually meet any of characters they are quickly written off in various ways, never do you actually fight along side a team mate..... but this is probably due to the fact that the games AI is ridiculous.The AI can notice you from across the map at points in the game, which completely ruins the level designs because in the levels on which you are fighting on a two floor arena the enemies on floor oposite of you will notice you immediately and engage with you. So instead of having two equal difficulty floors you have one giant arena with enemies coming from all around.Quick final gripes:* The script is far to on the nose, reminds me of classic horror films where scientists would make wild very detailed conclusions that would end up being 100% true.*  The Flame thrower is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cousin of the weapons family in this game. Burns ammo so quickly, reload takes forever, range is garbage, damage is practically 0.* Some elevators wait for input, some decide to leave when they feel like it.* Bad Lighting, some white characters look black at points in the game. * If you stand still on the stairs you will slide down making some combat points in the game really hard.* The main antagonist sounds like a college aged math student. Nothing against college aged math students, only they don't really sound like the threating type.* The final boss is soooooooo easy, it took me one try and less than a minute thirty to kill him. * After walking into some doors, ones that load up the next level, you will pop up into a location in location that makes you feel like you teleported half an hour  further into the game. TL:DR Poor mans copy of Bioshock/HalfLife isn't worth your time or money, at any price.			"

												Literally the worst game in human history. It makes Desert Gunner look like Morrowind. The voice acting alone makes the game nearly unplayable. Loading the game up instills a sense of mortal terror that you might hear a character talk. It's also absurdly difficult. On normal you start with 20% health and every enemy is able to nearly OHK you with a pistol as soon as you peek a corner. The mechanics are bad, things as simple as pressing a door button becomes infuriating after twenty seconds of playing, since pressing door buttons is about 40% of the game's content.I highly recommend this game.

												It's ok when it works, but it keeps crashing.It is incompatible with win7, so I ran the compatability test. suggested was winXP +2SP.Also, you need to set the main .exe program to run as admin rights.Doesn't work with graphics higher than 1280x1024. The first time you try to run it, you will get a white windowed display for a split second. That's the graphics problem. open the config.cfg file with notebook and change the values for height and width.Remenicent of Doom3 and other first person shooters. And 'save' a lot. The auto save is very spread out between level beginnings.I paid 49 cents for it, and I think that was too much. We should not have to purchase a game from Steam and then trouble shoot it for them to find how to make it work. (I call your attention to Edna and Harvey games).Once you get past the Steam added trademarks, you will see it was made in 2006. No wonder it was made for winXP.			"

												Keep in mind, just because I'm voting ""recommend"", doesn't mean you should actually play it by my recommendation,  I just don't feel like a red thumbs down is very fitting of this game. If you have this game or have access to it for free, I would say go for it, but don't pay money for this, your time will be better spent on another FPS... or you know... in the real world. The storyline is sort of bland: Arnold, your silver fox, body builder, genius badass is mining a mysterious radioactive ore on some planet in some fictional universe with humans. He is the only one not being driven mad and so you have to shoot your way out of the space ship and blah blah standard Sci-Fi FPS.Spoilers ahead???The differences: Oxygen depletion happens when you're not in a sealed structure or breathing directly through an oxygen mask on a wall. When outside, you have to move quickly and get to the next oxygen mask to strategically plan your next move. You can also save at any time and will probably need to do that a lot because of how often you die. There are a standard set of guns, although the flamethrower is sort of sadly useless... There are some cool tech gadgets, where you can hack cameras and mines through the walls before entering a room. Some missions require you to carry [giant] batteries with you to restore power to doors and such. So overall although they did mix it up and add some spice to the gameplay, its still primarily an (almost) outdated FPS.The storyline is lacking, but certainly has some [randomly] brash lines, and decent voice acting. The protagonist has solid voice acting actually, in fact, one of the better voices I've heard considering the lines he was reading were complete ♥♥♥♥ half of the time. Some of the other characters sound like they read one line per day with the same inflection and different words, particularly the foreign guy without much experience in English.The most memorable and worthy lines of the game, that convinced me to keep playing during a hard and honestly boring part:""Arnold, you'll have to hold them off just a little bit longer!!!"", says the other character while he was hacking a computer-motherboard-mainframe-core-system to save both of their lives.""Why? So you can finish surfing porn?"" Arnold is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a badass even when a tech guru is saving his life and he is shotgunning 20 dudes at once.The game is hard, like 2007 hard. I'm saying like you can't just play this game through casually on normal difficulty because people will actually hit you with most of their bullets and rockets (Although, even in the hands of the villain, the flamethrower sucks ♥♥♥ unless you're stuck in an elevator with them). TL;DR:I know I've just expressed a lot of conflicting like and dislike for this game, but that's how it feels to play it overall, you like it, and then you kind of wish you didn't spend an hour playing it, especially when you forget to save for a half hour and then get smoked by a big fat robot rocket. Slow, tactful, diverse. Enjoy.			"

												It is really, really bad. Graphics are very dated on the highest settings. Gameplay for me was tolerable, but the voice acting... It is terrible. I tried ignoring it, but the cutscenes are so long and drawn out, that you can't. The gameplay itself isn't good enough to carry the rest of the game on its back. I got it on a Steam sale for $1. Not worth it even at that price.			"

												I have to say I would not reccomend this game. For an abundance of reasons, though the main one is that the game feels ""Choppy to play with unsmooth combat."" However it has decent cutscenes and graphics. If you have time to kill  for a 4-6 hour storyline: a 90% off game for only $0.49. Is there a reason not to purchase and play it?Even at half off I cound not reccomend this game. if this game is under $1.20 -  $1.75. I would say you would enjoy it and not blink an eye at the cost. Seriously though. Don't buy it at its full price.			"

												It's ok when it works, but it keeps crashing.It is incompatible with win7, so I ran the compatability test. suggested was winXP +2SP.Also, you need to set the main .exe program to run as admin rights.Doesn't work with graphics higher than 1280x1024. The first time you try to run it, you will get a white windowed display for a split second. That's the graphics problem. open the config.cfg file with notebook and change the values for height and width.Remenicent of Doom3 and other first person shooters. And 'save' a lot. The auto save is very spread out between level beginnings.I paid 49 cents for it, and I think that was too much. We should not have to purchase a game from Steam and then trouble shoot it for them to find how to make it work. (I call your attention to Edna and Harvey games).Once you get past the Steam added trademarks, you will see it was made in 2006. No wonder it was made for winXP.			"

												8/10A punchy, fast flowing all action sci-fi FPS that delievers one hell of a ride!Yes: you take fall damage from anything and everything higher than you can jump.*The AI is STUPIDLY accurate ALL THE TIME.*There is a problem with a lack of friction/'physics engine plus jumping sections aren't anything like crisp enough.Some other people will slate other shortcomings, I wasn't really bothered with much else. (Ok maybe a little cheesy? but I had an utter blast!!!) *And now my confession: I used the godmode cheat so I didn't have to replay section by section I found is truely wearsome to take damage nearly EVERY SINGLE time I met an enemy.End of the day, something caught my eye early on with this game, I payed £0.29, played the game for a few hours and I REALLY REALLY enjoyed this game. I hope others will try this game and have as much fun as I've had. I will return to take another look... the detail in this game is really something else. I repeat for a final time, I'm really pleased with this. :)			"

												Want to know how bad this game is. I enjoyed playing through this garbage with the cheats on than when they were off. This game is a disaster,Aimboting AI that charge towards you relentlessly, horrible voice acting made me skip almost every cutscene I actually prefer listening to the bad dialogue of Resident Evil 1. Whoever thought it was a brillant idea to stop your character playing to answer pointless calls during the story (while being shot at) just stop... turn around, start headbutting a wall till your head is nothing but the dust from your skull. Whoever thought up the story should do the same bleak, boring, couldnt give a damn about what happends where and to who. The only good thing about this game is the music... thats it, thats where all the budget problay went to. Now I can see why its price is so low.			"

												Surprisingly fun, despite the voice acting being almost offensively bad. On easy it's a hell of a challenge, but on hard, you'll become good friends with the floor from all the times you drop dead onto it. Robots that had competent programmers and soldiers that don't wander around like it's Night of the Living Derp mean that you have to take your time and think about how to approach the situation given to you. There's a nice range of weapons, each with some sort of useful application, and the hacking cam mode is a nice feature, if a little unchallenging. The ability to lean and peer around objects and walls is an incredibly useful addition, and very nicely done. At around 5-6 hours, it's unsatisfyingly short, but a fun ride while it lasts. Dig the spare change out of your sofa and buy it, it's worth every last cent.			"

												Played the Demo(thought was great), and bought the game for 50 cents(not as great as you expect it to be). If you are expecting some sort of crazy story line of robot vs human then you'll be disappointed. The robots in this game isn't truly explained. You end up fighting them both, but mostly humans. This game isn't worth full price because it doesn't seem like a full game like Doom 3. It could have been much better, but it isn't. As you go on through the game it gets boring fighting the same humans. They are all allied to each other at the end. Don't expect many robot battles. If you want some sort of awesome war game go for Quake 4. You have allies to help.			"

Guess I'm just a sucker and I feel like I have to finish what I startDoes it have any redeeming features then?-None whatsoever, the gameplay is poorly balanced, some of the difficulty spikes are frustrating, additional elements like the buggy or the trams are tedious to control and you'll wish they weren't in the game. The voice acting is so bad that it's funny and the sound montage is so amateur it's hilarious. Furthermore the game is full of bugs of every possible nature, flickery textures and floating objects everywhere, things falling through the map or blocking your path, but most of all the game crashes, all the time. I've not managed to play it for more than 30-45mns without experiencing at least one crash.Wow that sounds pretty bad.-Yeah but it gets better, the game actually stopped working for about a week, it just wouldn't launch. I contact Meridian 4 customer support but did not get a reply. Then the game got put on sale for half a dollar and somehow it's working again.Half a dollar, that is pretty cheap!-Yeah that's pretty much what it's worth.

												Alpha Prime is one of the most basic FPS games I've come across. It really shows it's age as a 2007 release, the voice acting is one of the worst I've ever heard. The A.I here has some sort of aimbot scripted into it, because it will get brutally hard, enemies do not miss, your health soon drops into the red zone in most battles.  I paid little attention to the story once I heard the voices, one of them is so bad it's almost comical that it was included in the game. For £2,99 is it worth it? Probably? You can get about six hours out of the single-player campaign and that's it. There is zero reasons to keep it installed once you finish it.  "

												This is a fairly short B-list sci-fi shooter without many pretentions. It was released in 2007, so you should be expecting dated graphics.

												I'm a fan of FPS games, so this looked a reasonable choice to play but I'm disappointed. The game itself would not be bad at all, blunt story, nice graphics (Doom3 in color :D) but it fails gameplay-wise. Jumping is like on the Moon, even when indoors where gravity should be Earth-like. Enemies are dumb as hell, if you restart a scene, most of them will wander to the same spots... Biggest issue is though you do not feel when you are shot. There is indication on screen edges still you do not recognize when you are shot. Therefore you notice enemies too late and they are unforgiving.			"

												You will find yourself noticing many games that Alpha Prime borrowed things from. It's kind of a m ix of Halo, Red Faction, Doom, and a few more. It is a solid game though. It does nothing new but has some fun shooting mechanics, decent graphics, decent story, never crashed on me, and was an overall fun time.			"

												So far this is a nice game. It is almost like half life needs a little more though. Some new guns, and maby an update a little glitchy when picking things up and such.I would buy an add on if they included that into it.For 0.99 cents its worth it in my book.			"

												This is a fairly short B-list sci-fi shooter without many pretentions. It was released in 2007, so you should be expecting dated graphics. If you are able to look past these defects (and some bad voice over and questionable choice of weaponry too), you can find here the type of game that it's fun to romp in about for a while and that does not overstay its welcome.It is worth a playthrough, as long as you keep your expectations in check.

												This game is EXCELLENT. If you like the sci-fi shooters such as Red Faction, Mass Effect, Dead Space, Lost Planet,... then you will enjoy this game! And the graphics are very good in 1080p and all settings maxed out. No need for anti aliasing, save a few watts and leave it disabled. Looks great and runs stable.The only thing you should do is edit the settings config file to manually Enable V Sync. Because in-game options do not have v sync setting. Go to your install folder and edit settings.cfg. Find ""vsync 0"" and change it to ""vsync 1"". More info and original post by slimak: http://steamcommunity.com/app/2590/discussions/0/648817377636759394/?insideModal=1The reason you should enable vsync is the exact same reason you should ALWAYS enable it in every game. Because you don't need your game to run at 5000fps, to run hot and use extreme amounts of electricity whilst generating large amounts of heat and GPU load. That's why you lock it down to 60 / 75fps or whatever your display's screen refresh is. Alpha Prime uses about 230 Watts to run on a high end gaming computer. The same game runs at only 160 Watts with exact same settings, graphics card fan is quiet and low heat after enabling vsync. Wattages meassured computer's power consumption at the wall socket during play. Enable vsync and enjoy this fantastic game.			"

												Alpha Prime is one of the most basic FPS games I've come across. It really shows it's age as a 2007 release, the voice acting is one of the worst I've ever heard. The A.I here has some sort of aimbot scripted into it, because it will get brutally hard, enemies do not miss, your health soon drops into the red zone in most battles.  I paid little attention to the story once I heard the voices, one of them is so bad it's almost comical that it was included in the game. For £2,99 is it worth it? Probably? You can get about six hours out of the single-player campaign and that's it. There is zero reasons to keep it installed once you finish it.  "

												A shity generic FPS with all the features an FPS dosent need: hacking, moving objects, pointless puzles, opening lockers to see what is inside, then accidentaly closing them, then accidentaly opening another one instead of just making a button that picks up anything useful without going throughh all that useless ♥♥♥♥. The voice acting is terrible. The main caracter has no empathy for people who went mad and inmediatly declares them ""not people"" (even though he may have known some of them). The AI is terrible. Enemies dont respond to being shot properly. Autosaves arent frequent egnouh. You can get stuck easily if you try to go somewhere you're not supposed to. Never changing level design. A terrible story. I'd rather play a flash game on the internet than this. 1/10.			"

												Despite what other people say, this game is awesome. It's a decently old title but is fun nonetheless. I have a lot of fun with this game and recommend this to anyone that wants a decent story, some pretty neat gameplay mechanics for its time, and an interesting world full of robots and people trying to kill you, this game is a challenge even on Normal, expect to die a lot unless you learn how to duck behind boxes and pillars.The story is pretty standard, but don't let that turn you away from trying this out, it has pretty lighting effects, and cheesy voice acting, but like i said, this game has some time under its belt. If you like First-person shooters then this is a must buy, if you can get past the dated look, cheesy voices, and enjoy the game how it was supposed to be then you won't be disappointed with this at all.

												Passable if repetitive soundtrack, somewhat pretty visuals, but it's broken. Utterly broken. Poor AI is made up for with inhuman reflexes, accuracy, and bullet spam. Enemies are repetitive, and 90% of them have the same generic gun to plink at you with. And you can kill yourself by hurling a popcan at the floor. Yes, an ordinary soda can can kill you if you throw it at the floor. Try it if you actually spent money on this beast. Broken physics, horrible block puzzles, annoying train sequences, bog-standard FPS guns... if you can pick it up for a buck on Steam if they do another sale, go for it; The voice acting is good for a cringe if nothing else.

The story is so-so but the game ends up being more frustrating than fun due primarily to the fact that the enemy accuracy is so high and health recovery so infrequent/unreliable.

												Alpha Prime is a fairly interesting game, it's a sci-fi FPS that takes elements from games such as Doom 3 and Quake 4 (Even the aesthetic of the game will remind you of them) and implements some of its own little things here and there. At first it does seem cliche and it kind of is but players will soon find that there is a very slight supernatural element to the game that affects the psyche of all the people surrounding Alpha Prime, turning them into deranged madmen and making the base's AI go nuts and the Corporation is on clean up duty. Your job is to save your friend who's stranded on Alpha Prime.Unlike most shooters that take a more old school approach (health packs, hip fire, carrying a full arsenal, etc), on normal difficulty the enemies hit very hard which will require you to take a more tactical approach to combat situations which will encourage you to use the lean function as well as the remote control mechanic, allowing you to hack into devices such as cameras, gun turrets, doors and other electronic devices. So since that little introduction is out of the way, now I'll start the review and first I'll break it down into lists of pros and cons to make this review a lot more straight forward:Pros:- Fun and solid gunplay- Nice visual effects- Cool art style- Graphics still look good even today- No regenerating health, all done with medkits and health stations- You can fire from the hip (Always good to have)- Characters have a bit of personality to them- Level design is pretty good- The soundtrack is just awesome- Enemy AI are quite intelligent, always seeking cover, trying to outsmart and outgun you whenever possible and will rush you when they have the chance- A nice array of weapons to use (A gatling-based assault rifle is pretty awesome)- The remote control is cool and fun to use, turning gun turrets against your foes is always fun- Very challenging, will crush gamers who are used to modern FPS and regenerating healthCons:- The story could have been really cool but it was fairly bland and the cliffhanger didn't help either- Bullet time and flamethrower are near enough useless except for the last boss- Enemy placement can be very cheap at times making the difficulty feel very artificial- Enemy variety is near enough non-existant, just different guys with different guns and some robots- Weapons given to the player have pretty poor pacing, it gives you every gun near enough from the get go- The remote control mechanic is too underutilized, you'll often forget you have it later in the game- Voice acting can be pretty atrocious sometimes- The one vehicle segment is just awful, it controls like crap and you can't even run enemies over with it- Enemies have pinpoint accuracy to the point where it's unfair at times (And you can't even dodge their shots in bullet time, yes it's that useless)- Some character models look creepy, making the main character look like a plastic action figure- Cutscenes and dialogue segments go on for WAY too long and when you need to do something, you can't pause them but thankfully they can be skipped- The game only runs for the best part of 4 hours, for a single player only game that will be far too short for mostThe game has a lot of flaws, but it's nowhere near as incompetent like games such as The Stalin Subway and Dusk 12 (Which I did enjoy somewhat). It's not awful by any stretch, some people will love what Black Element did with the game, others may not. It really comes down to a matter of opinion and my opinion is that I really enjoyed it, as short as it was, it was a fun little sci-fi romp with lots of action, somewhat interesting characters and cool aesthetic. It's a shame the remote control was barely ever used and the game was very unbalanced at times but it was a fun game to play as the afternoon or evening just wizzes by.I do recommend this game to those who enjoyed old school shooters or for those who will enjoy something that makes players take a more tactical approach to their combat strategy, for me the positives outweigh the negatives and since I'm a sap for obscure FPS games, there is a chance I will like it for it's quirk. For those who prefer modern FPS with highly linear levels and the overuse of iron sights and regenerating health then this really isn't for you. But if you like kickass FPS soundtracks then this game is great to have, it has some truly fantastic music in there that just gets you really pumped for the action, big kudos to the composer! I'll wrap this up now though, it's on sale now for £0.59 or your regional equivalent and that will give 4 hours of great sci-fi action. I'd say it's worth picking up.			"

												This game is poor. Simple as that.The graphics weren`t good even for the release date.The voice acting is poor.The history is nothing new.The weapons are common.The difficulty is uneven. The enemy has perfect aim and timing.Well, to be sincere, I have no will to play this game anymore.I even tried to search on the internet to verify if the game was a hit for the time it was released. It just seems that even for that time it wasn`t good.Black Element studio probably had a very limited monetary value to spend on the game, and that should explain it all. Still, I`m giving a ""No"" because I think this game just missed the point. Didn`t find it fun and/or entertaining.4/10			"

												This game truly shows its age as others have noted.Pros:- It's a game- Nice graphicsCons:- The voice acting is truly sad, so much I've skipped every screen- There's no real direction or idea of what to do or where to go- Gameplay is horrible. When you jump you go backwards- You die quite easily and your shots do very little damage to enemies. It got so annying I enabled the cheat just to run through it and annihilate everyone with rockets. It's really the only way to have fun, but even then you can die in God mode. Go figure.It's not even worth getting if it's free. Just skip it and save yourself the headache and time.			"

												Do you like Syfy Channel? Would you like to be some guy that looks like Bill Murray in a Dead Space scenario type? Do you like to break controls because of lots of glitches, sometimes bad level design, and enemies with pixel-perfect accuracy? To be honest, I didnt expect much from this game but, aside from the terrible glitches I experienced, it's a decent ride. The story is something that feels like good fan-fiction at first but by the time you get through the first half of the game, you realize that not much is really going on, characters feel flat and their motivations are just...well, I think that Commando with Schwaznegger fleshed out a much deeper story.In terms of gameplay, it mixes the slo-mo mechanics from F.E.A.R. games with hacking. A pretty interesting idea that I believe was intended to make your combat experience more diverse. Unfortunately, it falls flat, seriously, the slo-mo mecanic doesnt work to your advantage and the hacking system seems to be completely forgotten by level designers towards the final levels of the game.As for design, acting, sound and stuff, its good, didnt have any framedrops or audio problems. My only ""problems"" and I cant say that I disliked them because they're hilarious are: one voice actor who needs to be fired, because he's reading the freaking script! And that your character looks like Bill Murray, seriously, I thought I was Murray in a commander Shepard suit. Overall, I'd give it 6/10. I would suggest it if: you find it cheap, you like movies like sharknado, you dont mind some frustrating combat.			"

												ok so i don't a lot of playtime. i do understand that and i didn't get to see the game a lot either. i just couldn't get passed at how bad the shooting really was. i used various weapons and i swear i shot more bulliets at the enemies that just did nothing and i took way more damage from them. trust me im not new to shooters either. since its an old game im sure there are some issues with it. so if you get it cheap and don't expect a lot from it you might enjoy it. for me i'll move on to another one.

												Just tried playing Alpha Prime. The game has decent graphics for a 2007 game, it plays very smoothly, but it has a ton of flaws in my opinion.First, options are lacking, especially sound options. I wanted to try and get the game music down but NPC chatter and cutscene sound higher than that, like I usually do, and there's no separation for that, but maybe they just cut corners on that end.The other thing that really eludes me is what am I doing in the game. I assume there's a storyline and that there are explanations and reasons for what I'm doing, but I don't know them, and I have no idea when are they planning on telling me more than the fact that my name is Arnold.Third, I played the game for 20 minutes, and I already got 4 out of 8 weapons in the game. Why are you making it that easy on me? It's like this is going to be a hour and a half completion time for this game.Nevertheless I didn't really enjoy the game and I call it quits on this one. Some old games are fun to play, like Fable TLC and Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project for me, but this one isn't one of them, sadly.If you got the game whenever and however, I wouldn't recommend playing it, it feels insanely weird in my honest opinion, and the fact I have no idea what am I doing is driving me crazy.

												Review - Alpha PrimeI stopped playing this simply because of how hard it was. Or the ♥♥♥♥ing healing system. I saved more here than what I would do on pirated Skyrim on a linux laptop. I played on normal and would play it over again on Easy, but the healing system won´t improve and the fact that I dont have the time for it.After all I have spent more hours on this than Fallout 3 and Watch dogs lol.ProsGraphics - I loved the graphics. They just gave me this feeling. Like a Alien Isolation made 5-10 years ago. Smoothness - Easy 100-200 fps. Barely even requires a GPU.Story - Of the time I played I loved the story, which was kinda destroyed by the cutscenes, which I will go over laiter.Grabbing feature - This, I loved. It did help some, like moving covers of ammo boxes, but mostly dropping plates on severed bodies was fun.2007 Game - For a game released 8 years ago its awesome. But then again Postal 2 was released in 2003?Windows 10 compatibleConsAiming - You tilt your gun and the reticle just gets bigger? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ aiming, even for the sniper.Cutscenes/Voice Acting - Don´t even.Healing/Difficulty - Impossible to bust in and shoot everything but the mechanics for this was the thing that ruined this game for me.Sneaking/shift walking - Useless, the enemies will wallhack and spot you anyways. They won´t even get VAC:ed.Summary:Poor man´s Postal 2 + Half life 2. Could be good in the long wait for HL3.Worth: Probably the 50 cents I payed for it.Rating: 5/10 but do recommend it if u play on Easy and is rather careful.			"

												One of the finest shooting games i have played for a while, it's old, it's gold and it should have been outsold everywhere it came out, good controlls easy to manipulate in options and everything, the only problems i may say about the game is that i can't use mouse 4 or 5 which is really important to me because i use mouse 2 to jump so i can't use that one to aim, you don't need to aim that much in the game, you aim the same way you do in Quake 4 or some other classics it's just a basic zoom that doesn't help that much. it also feels good killing stuff, trhe only boring part about the game is killing robots, there just ain't no fun witht he robots... it's almost like trying to kill the aliens in Crysis, it's just stupid that's all.I give this game a 8 out of 10 because of the mouse problem, the robot problems is just a part of the game, it's just an opinion.Come on guys i know this game is old but even old Unreal had mouse 5 and if not atleast mouse 4 as I remember it			"

												Alpha Prime is pretty much a generic first person shooter to be honest.Pros:>Controls are simple >Gameplay is smooth (though Ai is not all that great)>Graphics aint bad, they get the job done. (Look pretty enough)Cons:>Story is really weak and has no substance or development. (Ending is awful too)>Character development and designs are poor  (All wear similar dull outfits, same fo the enemies and the game constantly switches who is really the bad guy way too much)>Dialoge is terrible. (I have seen Z movies that had better)>Voice acting is weak as well (especially the woman, seems like shes not even trying)>Level Design is bad, nearly all the same generic hallways, rooms and stair cases (Boring)Overall even though the story, levels and characters where all quite bad the actual gameplay was decent and smooth,  (Ai is hit and miss and vehicle handling was too :/)  graphics were easy on the eye though. The game is pretty short and its dirt cheap so really your do get what you pay for.I thought it was ok to kill a few hours.2/10			"

												It's somewhat fun for an afternoon if you use cheats and just go for the story.The story is not as bad as some would have you believe, though it is mostly  un-original. A few twists are in it, though. The  ending seems a lot like Doom 3.The environment would be interesting, were it not often too convoluted, with the objectives just being ""Take X and go Y"" - and not telling you where X and Y actually are.Enemies are inhumanly strong - a shotgun to the face at close range only works for grunts, anything beyond needs two hits.Voice acting could be worse, though the main characters are quite good. The random talk of the enemies is bad and often nonsensical, though.All in all, I paid 50 cents for it and I don't regret that purchase. I'm not sure I'd pay more for it.The music is quite nice mostly.			"

												I had this game just laying in my library for years now and I would of never noticed it or gave it a try if it was not the second game in the list. After booting it up the game looked old and bad, from the menu the text looks like it was the same text they coded to boot the game and they never bothered changing it, just kept it the same cuz someone thought it looked cool. Afte launching it the characters looked really bad and their models were horrible. Livia has a nice ♥♥♥ but a butterface, they could have at least added more details to the main characters,  i would not have cared as much if the enemies were ugly, but the main characters are no excuse. The AI is also horrible, since basically every shot the AI shoots hits you 95% of the time, no matter what distance, even if its shotgun it basically hits from 30 feet away. but the environment was beautiful and had alot of color and detail to it. The background fighting scene music was terrible and it just ruined the scary tone the game tried to go for.  After the tutorial and going through the cutscenes, you are put against drugged enemies and robots?, I don't know why robots. I finally got into a part where I picked up hubbardium, and it looked strangely familiar in the syringe I thought it was health and when I used it, it slowed down time, and the deja vu kicked in. fighting drugged enemies that are longer human, in slow motion in a game where its basically cut scene then shooting scene, WHERE HAVE I PLAYED THIS BEFORE, ohhh wait. this game is generic copy of FEAR, everything about this game screams fear, from how the weapons look, to the enemies, to the slow motion, and the scary eniovronment they went for but was laughable when you saw the enemies. I really tried to like this game I really did, I gave it a chance even though it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone but I just could not, When I got to a part where I met an italian stereotyped character, it just became a joke, the voice acting was so horrible that i just could not play any longer. If I were to rate the game I would give it plagiarism/10TL;DRShowing Results for: Alpha prime Did you mean:  "

												Alpha Prime is pretty much a generic first person shooter to be honest.Pros:>Controls are simple >Gameplay is smooth (though Ai is not all that great)>Graphics aint bad, they get the job done. (Look pretty enough)Cons:>Story is really weak and has no substance or development. (Ending is awful too)>Character development and designs are poor  (All wear similar dull outfits, same fo the enemies and the game constantly switches who is really the bad guy way too much)>Dialoge is terrible. (I have seen Z movies that had better)>Voice acting is weak as well (especially the woman, seems like shes not even trying)>Level Design is bad, nearly all the same generic hallways, rooms and stair cases (Boring)Overall even though the story, levels and characters where all quite bad the actual gameplay was decent and smooth,  (Ai is hit and miss and vehicle handling was too :/)  graphics were easy on the eye though. The game is pretty short and its dirt cheap so really your do get what you pay for.I thought it was ok to kill a few hours.2/10			"

Product received for free
												So this was one of those free games that collected dust in my library with no playtime in sight until i decided to try it a couple of days ago. It really surprised me in a positive way. The difficulty can be all over the place, from frustrating to smooth sailing. It's a pure shooter, not unlike Half Life 2, at some points it even reminded me of the Riddick games.I can safely say the game aged well, visually, it is however still a pretty old game so don't expect to be blown away by the visuals. Voice acting is not top notch, even for those days, but after a while of playing, you won't even notice how bad/good it is at times. Gameplay wise, it was an extremely fun experience, possibly one i will repeat in the future. In any case, the game is worth the price if you already haven't gotten a key when it was given out. Hope you enjoy it as much as i did.			"

												At $4.99 I definitely recommend this.  More than decent graphics a la Doom 3 mode and the video honestly on Steam doesn't even come close to showing how nice it looks with graphics maxed.  The AI = hard as they are accurate with their weaponry.  The characters you interact with in this story make for a decent story.  Paolo Bellini at first makes you think oh no horrible dialogue finally showing up in this game is going to continue throughout the game and ruin it but it doesn't.  He is hilarious.  A nice break from the more serious characters in the game.  The audio in this game is excellent and I am certain I heard a song in this game that is from Natural Born Killers or something or was similar but it didn't seem out of place.  They fit it perfectly with the scene and the sound effects going on around the song.  In regards to replay value I think there is some as I can see me wanting to play this game on harder difficulty and also trying to go through the game with less deaths and it is possible if you make better use of cover, grenades and use all weapons.Alpha Prime .... another game I just said hey let me try this from my Steam list and I wasn't disappointed.  This game is worth more than what I payed in a bundle to get it and it is worth more than the $4.99 Steam has it on sale for right now.  Seriously definitely a must play for fans of 1st person shooters and sci-fi games.			"

												Average Average-y Average-ness.Alpha Primes biggest issue from the very get-go is that it just isnt very intresting. The setting is very much a case of been there, done that a hundred times. The enemies fall under this too. The graphics are workable enough and give off occasional pretty light shows but otherwise just are quite standard with little popping out.The storyline too is very cliched, some poor and forgettable voice acting, a selection of guns which run the usual gamut of a melee type, a pistol type, a machine gun type and shotgun type and so on. Theres just nothing very intresting here. Okay, its not an awful game by any means but thats because it never even tries to rise and never once gives any reason to push onwards towards the rather underwhelming ending.And, while its gone down in price heavily, its just still not worth using time up over playing. Unless you REALLY have a need for a new FPS, dont bother and instead go and find something more worth your time, money and hard-drive space			"

A similar First Person Shooter like DOOM.
But insanely hard! Once again, bots the have aim-bot hacks, sniping you with shotguns from extreme distances, shooting you behind cover, and hitting you when you pop out. They NEVER stop to reload so good luck.

												This game is quite terrible.I got this game at first because it seemed like it'd be a decent mediocre shooter. But then I realized it was a bad game, not necessarily a huge issue for me because I can enjoy bad games. This game however, is just plain not fun. I gave it two hours to enjoy it. Just, no. It's not. The story? I dunno! It seems really badly written in the first 2 hours I played, it really just seems to awkwardly play off the protagonists love-triangle thing for some woman he divorced but still loves or something. It's extremely uncomfortable.Not to mention the terrible dialouge and some of it almost offensive (paolo) and the scripting and character personalities is utter garbage.The gameplay is, honestly not what I expected. I expected a game that I could just do really stupid stuff with. That's not this game. It takes itself very seriously. What I mean by that is taking bullet damage feels like taking bullet damage. You lose health reeeaaalllll quick in this game. It honestly expects you to make full use of the arsenal of guns it gives you, bullet time (whhhhyyyy is bullet time in this gameeeeeeeee) and leaning. I'd just like to point out that in less than 20 minutes of this game I had:A hammerA pistolA shotgunA gatling gunA sniper rifleAnd some grenadesWhy I got these things so ridiculously early in the game is beyond me. I'm thinking it's because this game is trying to be like duke nukem or something in terms of difficulty and how to play the game. But seriously, sometimes I just think ""did they actually PLAY the game they created?"" Because who in their right mind would play though this thing? It feels uncomfortable and with tight rooms and small corridors or open places without much cover. It makes this become serious sam in tight corridors. Which is terrible. If I remember correctly, some of the worst gameplay moments for me in Serious Sam 3 BFE was in corridors and small spaces. Well that's what this game does and there's nothing but those kinds of fights. WHICH DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE. Why would you have a system that almost suggests you play it like it's Max Payne and you should avoid taking bullets at all costs. But yet it's like, serious sam mode where cover is for pansies and you're a man apparently so you need to stand out in the open and eat as many bullets as possible.You know a game has poor design when less than 30 minutes into the game you encounter a scenario where the only way you can get past it is ""to get lucky""I had to enter a small corridor with a pair of stairs and since like, the enemies in this game channel the force apparently. These two just dump their gatling guns on you and it's a TIGHT corridor mind you and taking high damage at point blank by guns that have 22 bullets in them before reload? I died there so many times before I got lucky and killed the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Ugh. The art style is generic, the graphics are passable, the guns are kind of fun to use. I liked the shotgun. That was it. The bullet time sucks and it's obviously a gimmick. The sounds are kind of basic but they're good enough and the music is somewhat out of place in a sense it's unncessarily intense for a small skimrish scenario.Anyway, all of that aside, I suggest you do not purchase this product. It's not good, it's not fun. I couldn't bear more than 2 hours of this game. Stay away and do not play this product.Thank you for reading my review, I hope you found it helpful in your decision of whether you'd want to purchase this product or not. Have a good one.			"

I would recommend this game to any fan of FPS games.7/10 Fun FPS game, old but still good!			"

												I like to take my time on First Person games. I like enjoying details and looking at everything.I started this game, and within a short while, I was dying(literally) for it to be over.I mean... for a buck right now on sale, sure, it is okay for a dollar.  I bought this forever ago (IDK why steam says I played it an HOUR, I completed the game, maybe it was before they tracked playtime, IDK)If you have a buck and you love FPS games, try it out I guess, but I found it glitchy and the story was nonmotivating IMOOthers have said that the enemies have quite an unfair accuracy, this is totally TRUTH.  You can't barely peek out to try to find them.Lots of dying, each time you have to pretty much die just to know what is around the corner, or to learn some kind of strategy to overcome them in a hallway or some junk.Like I said, mediocre game, but ok enough to justify a dollar.  Just don't expect anything like the video implies :P "

												Don't.  Oh god stay AWAY from this game.  It is an RNG nightmare.  Occasionally enemies are CRAZY accurate, other times they can't hit you to save their lives.  While the game is ""fun"", it get's frustrating fast.  The bullet-time mechanic makes the assault rifle so crazy overpowered it's kind of stupid. None of the guns save the shotgun feel like they have any kick at all. In short, if you like Medicore FPS games, grab this.  Otherwise spend money on a better game, like Doom 3			"

												It kinda lacks the guts to be good. There are a few gameplay aspects such as slo-mo and leaning that are nice but otherwise it's not too great. The most common gun has an audio error causing it not to make any sound about half of the time. The voice acting and story isn't very good either. If you pick it up for $0.99 like I did then I'd say its worth that price but overall I wouldn't recommend the game.			"

												Alpha Prime is a first person shooter set primarly within the titular facility, Alpha Prime. The game is something like a cross between Red Faction and Quake 4, but not nearly as good as either one.Visuals - The graphics are definitely one of the game's strongpoints. It looks great, and I really don't have anything to say against it.Story - The story is lame and entirely forgettable. Honestly, I hardly cared about what was even going on in the story while playing. It's the same guy-gets-sent-to-abandoned-facility-to-investigate-and-then-gets-trapped scenario we've seen countless times. Several characters are met, they try to work together to find a way off the asteroid, trust is questioned, relationships are strained, lame villain goes after artifact of mystical power, obvious traitor is revealed, etc. The characters are forgettable, and the writing is particularly awful, often leaving me staring slack-jawed at the screen wondering what the game was even trying to convey to me. It can certainly lead to some amusing cutscenes and dialogue, though. It's kinda one of those ""so bad its good"" things, except rather than ""so bad its good"", it's more ""so bad it's passable and just enough to keep the game moving forward.""Sound - Mixed bag here. Let's go over the voice acting first: It's awful, but in a hilarious way. Some of the conversations heard in the game can be amusing just because of how poor the writing and acting is, and Livia's voice constantly sounds like it's coming over a communication device, even if she's in the same room as you are, which I found very strange. On the other hand, the music is actually quite good, especially in the later levels. The good tracks usually start playing when enemies are sighted and you start shooting, and they do a good job of getting you immersed into the action.Gameplay - For the most part, it's typical FPS fare. Most levels are spent traversing rooms and corridors gunning down enemies, hitting a switch to open a door nearby, etc. The game is very linear, levels are a fairly straight path for the most part, with the exception of a few very small detours to hit a switch, or pick up and replace a broken circuit. There are 7 or 8 different weapons, and you'll find yourself with the full arsenal fairly quickly. Health does not regenerate, and you must find medkits or use med-stations on the walls to heal yourself (If you've played Quake 4, it's exactly like that) You have a hacking device which allows you to gain access to various machines that are within range, including cameras, gun turrets and even mines. Unfortunately, your chances to use it on anything besides cameras are few and far between, so its usefulness is fairly limited. This was an interesting idea that they could have done a lot more with. Some people have knocked the game for being very difficult, but those people simply don't know how to play. The enemy accuracy is EXTREMELY high, even at a good distance, they will likely hit you dead-on, and running into a room full of enemies guns-a-blazing is suicide. As I played, though, I discovered the usefulness of the lean function. By hiding behind cover and leaning out to shoot, enemy accuracy was pretty much cut in half. I took far less damage this way and it made the rest of the game fairly easy to complete. The game also has a bulletime function, which slows down the action and can help a bit, but I personally didn't use it too much. Thankfully, the controls won't be adding to your death total, because the game's controls are tight, aside from one of the late levels where you have to drive a vehicle across outdoor terrain. The controls felt slightly delayed, and the game wasn't lagging at all, everything was playing a top speed. I adjusted quickly, however, and this is the only level that has this. Another problem is that the collision detection between you and objects is a bit wonky. There are a few parts where you must jump over crates or onto other objects, and your character will be struggling to get over them as something seemingly pushes him back. Thankfully, moments like this are relatively few, so it's only an occasional annoyance. The game is also very short, clocking in at around 5 hours, though with the game's forgettable story and characters, I honestly see the short length as a positive rather than a negative.Final - Alpha Prime is, overall, a fairly mixed bag. Great visuals, mostly functional controls, good music, but completely forgettable story, lame characters, very short length and pretty much no replay value whatsoever. If you look past the horrible story and characters, the game will provide some decent entertainment for a few hours. If the game was any higher than its asking price of $4.99, I wouldn't be able to recommend it because it's certainly not worth any more than that. I recommend either playing the demo to make sure you'll enjoy it before dropping the 5, or just wait for a discount and get it for a buck or two.			"

												Alpha Prime (Released: 7 Nov 2007, Acquired: 23 Jan 2014)Given that I got the game in 2014 (7 YEARS after release), this game still has much kick being put into it. I wouldn't go into the plot since steam already has it. As an overview, I am going to say that this game has a feel of an old school shooter. Health do not regenerate and health packs are needed, replenishing your oxygen supply is also in order out in martian soil. One is able to carry around 7-8 weapons, going around getting creative on how you want to kill your next enemy. Oh, and sometimes out in martian environment, you get to drive a jeep of some sort. Graphics are as that of the 2000s, not great but bearable, not bad for a 2007 game, but we all seen better. The sound wise, loops and loops of action music played through when you are dealing with enemies, voice acting is OK, although sometimes it can be quite laughable.Next I am going to list the Pros and the Cons of this game.PROS:old school shooterchallenging (due many factors)explorable environments and multiple entry points and ways to begin a gunfightget to play with a lot of weaponsintriguing storylineno gore (if you do not like gore)CONS:overpowered enemies (contributes to it being challenging)lack of health packs lying around (you need them due to OP enemies and this contributes to it being challenging)repetitive gameplay (explore, shoot people, find important plot points, shoot more people!)linear gameplay (kind of expected in a 2000's game)loopy music (can  get on your nerves)no gore (if you LOVE gore)In conclusion, I would not recommend this game in the current age, although if you are one of those people that would fancy yourself a challenge or you are into that kind of old school shooter style. If you want a relaxing game you can shoot people in the face without really worrying about health, this game is totally not for you.I may have left out a few pointers here and there, would love some comments and feedback on my reviews so improvements are in order.

												Terrible game 3/10! Why? Oh, just you wait until I explain why.Like every C-line game, it's a MUST to have control issues. The mouse control in the menus is very awkward. The mouse control in the game is EVEN MORE awkward. Even if you set the X and Y sensitivity to THE SAME VALUE in options, the horizontal sensitivity is fairly bigger! You have to fiddle with your X sens and raise it inch by inch JUST TO GET THE X AND Y TO BE EQUAL. Not to mention that the SNIPER SCOPE has X sensitivity 9000 and Y sensitivity 1, AND YOU CAN'T CHANGE THAT AT ALL!!! WHAT IS UP WITH THAT? Who came to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ conclusion that the horizontal sens must be higher than the vertical one? A ♥♥♥♥ING RETARD! It feels awkward as ♥♥♥♥! Other problems include aimbotting enemies that can get you even through the smallest crack with 100% accuracy, even on EASY it's ♥♥♥♥ing hard, since the game is PADDED in such a way that you HAVE to backtrack a LOOONG way to the health stations, since they're few and far between... Even more stupid issues with the jumping puzzles, since you have to land perfectly in the center of an object otherwise you get SLAPPED back to your place.. Horrible, cheesy, awkward voice acting. Padded game. Elite enemies. Unskippable cutscenes.TL;DR, simplyfing this game down to two words ""♥♥♥♥ING CRAP!"" Do not buy -15/10.			"

												This sucker was a hard pill to swallow.  I just could not finnish it :(This game has very few good things about it. I will have to say though it is nice to have the good satisfying feel of a classic true old school FPS and it does have a quick Save / Load.However this game falls in so many places.  To start;  The AI is very unbalanced and you WILL die ALOT in this game,  We are talking bots that do more damage than you and you go up against groups of them.  As many others have said, the voice acting is terrible,  I would almost swear this was done intentionally to troll us suckers who bought the game, but it does provide a good laugh.  In the little time I have played it, I encountered a few annoying bugs.  For example, Paulo, the gentleman who hurts his leg and the 10 minutes is running out like nothing happened gets Stuck in front of a wall.... glaring at it.   You must wait for him to follow you to an elevator, but he seems to have been frozen staring at this wall.   I was forced to restart the level just to get past.I would have to say if this game is given to you, give it a shot.  It does provide a fair amount of laughs.  But I will have to recommend not buying it.PROS- Has the feel of a true old school FPS- Quick Save / Load  availableCONS- Unbalanced AI- Terrible Voice Acting- Unfixed BugsRate: 2.5/10			"

												Alpha Prime is a run-of-the-mill action sci-fi shooter without anything to differentiate itself from the herd of FPS games aside from a ""bullet-time"" mechanic which isn't all that special. Unfortunately, it does nothing spectacular, but its not awful.The story is pretty good. There are some interesting characters, but most are flat and boring.The combat/gunplay is pretty fun, and can get tense as to when you are trying to get to the next health/oxygen station.The non-regenerating health is always a mechanic I enjoy, making you play more carefully than dumb run-and-gun.The graphics are obviously dated and can look bad at times, but they're not unbearable. Although character models suck and look muddy and just plain awful.Voice acting is on the weaker side where it sounds like they spoke too loudly into the mic.The difficulty is horribly uneven. Enemies have pinpoint accuracy and are able to see you from a mile away. They don't gain difficulty from intelligence, just strength.There's one portion of the game where you drive a car with the WORST physics imaginable, its absolutely horrendous.There is no auto-save feature, causing me many frustrations when I died. Save often.Its not really a game worth your time. For $5, there is alot better out there. If you get it in a bundle or for free, its pretty good, but for buying it on Steam, don't bother			"

												Alpha Prime is generic and uninspired in every aspect.  Shooting, action, environments, sound design, voice acting, writing... all as plain and unmemorable as you can possibly get.  I used ridiculous-looking and wildly underpowered weapons to shoot the exact same ""spaceman commando"" character models inside of the same dark space station corridors over and over again.  I stopped occasionally for a couple of bigger set piece moments and once for an awkward, floaty jaunt across the planet's surface in a vehicle that is definitely NOT the Mako (wink wink).  I tried to kill people with grenades that don't actually kill people.  I fought a 2 minute boss battle that uses the same ""shoot him until he gets into the thing to recover his health and then hack the machine to kill him"" mechanic that I've seen a dozen times before.  I sat impatiently through long dialogues of contrived nonsense that did nothing but interrupt the flow of the game and left me more confused than before.  Not dreadful so much as thuddingly uninspired and incoherent.  Possibly worth a quick 5-6 hour playthrough if you can get it for a dollar or less but in this age of virtually unlimited gaming options for low prices, you're better off almost anywhere else.			"

												For 99 cents, this completely average shooter gives about 4 hours of fun, so not a bad trade. While the game is linear and fails to achieve anything unusual, it also doesn't do anything bad (although the vehicle sequence has terrible controls, but so do most games). The guns are kind of neat though.			"

												Old school fun with some cool gameplay unfortunately cripples by sloppy collision boxes and the protagonists affinity for getting caught up in inch-thick cables lying on the floor. As a low budget game however, it delivers great action for the old school FPS gamer.Read the full review here: http://www.1pstart.net/2012/08/21/alpha-prime-review/ "

												I got this as part of some Humble Bundle, and at one point, I played it. And even though this game really suffers from an inherent lack of polish, I found myself really wanting to like this game. It bring some solid concepts forward to the table as a shooter, such as the hacking interface. It's sort of like Watchdogs as an FPS with this; scan security cameras to check enemy locations and numbers, set up environmental hazards up for remote detonated traps, and even use some of the machinery for surprise attacks. It has good ideas... BUT...There's a lot wrong with this game. On a presentation scale, it's easily the worst part about the game. For a game released in '07, it looks like it comes from '02, and really doesn't have a lot of the aged visuals that can still look good in the modern day with games like, for instance, Unreal Tournament '99. The voice acting is atrociously bad, though it sounds more like bad localization and English dubs, and a lot of the sound quality is atrocious.Gunplay is enjoyable, and some of the weapon designs like the gatling rifle and the sniper rifle are appealing, but the difficulty is extremely harsh, and the AI is pretty unforgiving. Even with patches to fix this, it still does put a damper on the gameplay as a whole.So, I still do find myself really wanting to like this. It's a decently interesting package that does seem appealing, but suffers from some serious issues that drag it down hard. There are definitely other games out there more worth your money, but if it shows up in a good Humble Bundle or something, maybe give it a gander.			"

												I'm surprised that this game was actually playable and enjoyable, given its poor reputation and not so fond memories of it.The movement is wonky, physics are glitchy, checkpoints are all messed up and story is shallow like a summer puddle. Yet I had fun with it thanks to the good weapon handling [even though hammer and flamethrower were utterly useless, and shotgun and grenades had limited usabilty], hits on target were clearly visible, and the damage- while a bit low, seemed to heave enough force. Some of the better mechanics were definitely this funny ""hack vision"" and bullet time. The first allowed for some alternative ways to dispose of enemies [shame that level designers completely ignored the potentials it granted, and stopped including it halfway through the game] and gain some view on enemies through cameras; bullet time was used as a rather scarce resource that could grant you a bit more of an upper hand at some of the more dangerous situations, like hard shots or full rooms, so it felt like a fun trump card instead of a core mechanic.While I found it fun, I can't disagree that it would have benefitted from different design decisions, for example: fov slider, smarter level design [this hack thing could have provided some neat secret stashes around the levels if they weren't so straight forward], more and better balanced weapons, more frequent checkpoints, so you don't save all the time, or ""use"" function on stray medikits, since you could've picked up a huge health boost for little damage by accident. The last boss is also ridiculously bad, it's just: activate 3 terminals, laugh at the ""grand challenge""'s poor aim with rocket launcher [enemies are terrible with it as it's not a hitscan weapon they're so used to], while spamming rockets at his face, taking no damage even though the room is cramped, and finally flip the final switch when he wants to cool down for a bit. So it's poorly designed, buggy and wonky, the story is dumb, it's short and the music is boring. Yet it's a fun to play single player FPS, that I can recommend for a low price.			"

												Great game! Kinda short, finished it in about 8 hours. Story and graphics are ok. Some reviews on here say the AI is too accurate and it makes the game extremely difficult, personally I have to disagree. I found the AI's accuracy to be about average, and honestly the game wasn't all that hard. I had some trouble in a few areas, but nothing that isn't too difficult to beat once you know where the enemies are. I'd give this game a 8/10.			"

												Alpha Prime is a first person shooter set primarly within the titular facility, Alpha Prime. The game is something like a cross between Red Faction and Quake 4, but not nearly as good as either one.Visuals - The graphics are definitely one of the game's strongpoints. It looks great, and I really don't have anything to say against it.Story - The story is lame and entirely forgettable. Honestly, I hardly cared about what was even going on in the story while playing. It's the same guy-gets-sent-to-abandoned-facility-to-investigate-and-then-gets-trapped scenario we've seen countless times. Several characters are met, they try to work together to find a way off the asteroid, trust is questioned, relationships are strained, lame villain goes after artifact of mystical power, obvious traitor is revealed, etc. The characters are forgettable, and the writing is particularly awful, often leaving me staring slack-jawed at the screen wondering what the game was even trying to convey to me. It can certainly lead to some amusing cutscenes and dialogue, though. It's kinda one of those ""so bad its good"" things, except rather than ""so bad its good"", it's more ""so bad it's passable and just enough to keep the game moving forward.""Sound - Mixed bag here. Let's go over the voice acting first: It's awful, but in a hilarious way. Some of the conversations heard in the game can be amusing just because of how poor the writing and acting is, and Livia's voice constantly sounds like it's coming over a communication device, even if she's in the same room as you are, which I found very strange. On the other hand, the music is actually quite good, especially in the later levels. The good tracks usually start playing when enemies are sighted and you start shooting, and they do a good job of getting you immersed into the action.Gameplay - For the most part, it's typical FPS fare. Most levels are spent traversing rooms and corridors gunning down enemies, hitting a switch to open a door nearby, etc. The game is very linear, levels are a fairly straight path for the most part, with the exception of a few very small detours to hit a switch, or pick up and replace a broken circuit. There are 7 or 8 different weapons, and you'll find yourself with the full arsenal fairly quickly. Health does not regenerate, and you must find medkits or use med-stations on the walls to heal yourself (If you've played Quake 4, it's exactly like that) You have a hacking device which allows you to gain access to various machines that are within range, including cameras, gun turrets and even mines. Unfortunately, your chances to use it on anything besides cameras are few and far between, so its usefulness is fairly limited. This was an interesting idea that they could have done a lot more with. Some people have knocked the game for being very difficult, but those people simply don't know how to play. The enemy accuracy is EXTREMELY high, even at a good distance, they will likely hit you dead-on, and running into a room full of enemies guns-a-blazing is suicide. As I played, though, I discovered the usefulness of the lean function. By hiding behind cover and leaning out to shoot, enemy accuracy was pretty much cut in half. I took far less damage this way and it made the rest of the game fairly easy to complete. The game also has a bulletime function, which slows down the action and can help a bit, but I personally didn't use it too much. Thankfully, the controls won't be adding to your death total, because the game's controls are tight, aside from one of the late levels where you have to drive a vehicle across outdoor terrain. The controls felt slightly delayed, and the game wasn't lagging at all, everything was playing a top speed. I adjusted quickly, however, and this is the only level that has this. Another problem is that the collision detection between you and objects is a bit wonky. There are a few parts where you must jump over crates or onto other objects, and your character will be struggling to get over them as something seemingly pushes him back. Thankfully, moments like this are relatively few, so it's only an occasional annoyance. The game is also very short, clocking in at around 5 hours, though with the game's forgettable story and characters, I honestly see the short length as a positive rather than a negative.Final - Alpha Prime is, overall, a fairly mixed bag. Great visuals, mostly functional controls, good music, but completely forgettable story, lame characters, very short length and pretty much no replay value whatsoever. If you look past the horrible story and characters, the game will provide some decent entertainment for a few hours. If the game was any higher than its asking price of $4.99, I wouldn't be able to recommend it because it's certainly not worth any more than that. I recommend either playing the demo to make sure you'll enjoy it before dropping the 5, or just wait for a discount and get it for a buck or two.			"

I DECIDED TO FINISH THIS GAME FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY WHILST MY OWN LIFE WAS ON STAKE.But seriously.Pro's:- OK visuals.- Varity of guns- Bullet time. Pretty fun tho it gives no advantage what so ever- Destructible environment- You can pick up things and throw them around- You can play basketball. But be cautious because the basketball can kill you instantly.Con's:- Terrible story, couldn't get a hold of it. I tried.- A level of voice acting which will make you cry of grief. The main character's voice is OK- Enemy AI sucks major ♥♥♥♥- Enemies you fight are too strong. They see you from miles away and have pristine aiming skills.- SAVE the game, the game will not autosave for you. Almost never.- One way street game. You can't use other routes.- Short campaign. Not sure if that's really that disappointingI don't recommend this game since it isn't fun and rewarding to play. The story isn't interesting. Dying simulator. But you can decide to pick it up for a good laugh.			"

												The game is poorly balanced. Even on Normal difficulty, the enemy AI has perfect aim and a single gatling shot can deal up to 15 points of damage. That's seven shots to death from full health! One shotgun pellet deals upwards of 35 damage, and the aforementioned perfect aim makes death in one or two hits inevitable.The enemy humans do not need oxygen, so you can't wait them out and pick off the ones running for the oxygen pumps on the wall. (In one section, you're in a semi-protected tram car with an oxygen pump nearby.)Your eye level is not the height at which you can be shot, unlike most first-person shooters. Chest-high walls DO NOT protect against headshots while crouched.The grenades do less splash damage than bunny farts, and the fiddly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't follow the same physics rules your body or other thrown objects do.I'd type more but Steam won't let me.

												Hello, all.I bought this game at a sale a few weeks ago and played it thereafter. It's a nice and fun game, with a rather OK story and good overall mechanics. There are a few flaws in it, as in there is no use for the flamethrower, because there are either not small enough corners to be able to use it and you'll get shot from far until you are able to do, or if there are such places, the power of the flamethrower is by far not what one would expect from such a weapon, and you still get shot :)) Also, there's a small drive test in the second half of the game, and as this is a shooter - the driving part is eratic and strange :)) All in all, if on sale again, I would buy it a second time. I've had a few nice hours playing it.Pros: story, gameplay, mechanics.Cons: Flamethrower, driving.			"

												Alpha Prime could have been a good FPS, thanks to its engine, gameplay and graphics quality. However, the more-than-flat story, poor voiceover made me feel bored all along the game, finishing it with a taste of nothing. The unbalanced difficulty, with enemies aiming perfectly even at long distance, is also an additional issue.PROS+ Good engine+ Interesting gameplay+ Fine graphics+ Very few loading screensCONS- Very poor storyline- Poor voiceover- Poor ending- Overskilled enemies			"

												Oddly this is a great game! Its surprising that small company can come out with a game this good. Its not polished, but it has a good fighting system. The fighting is challenging, the weapons are unique and the storyline is quite good. You should especially buy this during a sale, and you wont be sorry you did. I just hope this game has a sequal it surely deserves it!			"

												There needs to be a ""Maybe"" option for games like this one.While I do recommend this game, it comes with some stipulations:1. It must be $5 or less.2. You must LOVE FPS games.3. You must understand while the game itself is meh to ok, you're really coming to laugh at the story and dialogue.You know those films where the dialog and acting are so bad, it becomes entertaining in a funny way? This is the video game version of that. Summing up the game play:-The levels are designed well enough and varied, but VERY linear and there's a very noticeable lack of detail at times.-Enemies aren't varied at all. It's all enemy soldiers and three versions of robots.-Standard weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, Sniper Rifle, Machine gun, Rocket Launcher, grenades, etc.-The enemy AI goes from being completely unaware that you're standing in front of them to being able to see your movement through walls and rock. -Don't waste health because the enemy doesn't miss. Ever. Ok, the guys with the rocket launchers will miss, and the shotgun weilding baddies lack range, but the guys firing pistols and machine guns will always hit you.-A Max Payne bullet time like system that felt like it wasn't fleshed out. It can help even out the bigger fights agains the enemies who don't miss.-A driving section that comes out of nowhere with poor driving physics.-A hacking skill that seems like an after thought, and could have been used more effectively. The game itself would be kind of bland without the amazingly bad dialogue and voice acting. Don't worry, you'll get the jist of the story. It's just that you're playing a Sci-Fi game with dialogue that's like it's from a bad 1930s crime novel. On top of that, it's read by people who got bad scripts or don't understand punctuation. I'll grant you something might have been lost in translation, but those English voice actors should have known better.Again, if those three stipulations are things you can deal with, pick it up. If not, you should skip this game.			"

												Its like a crappy version of Doom 3, which means its still a pretty good game. I did manage to kill myself with a basketball about 10 minutes in. so that was fun. Story is forgettable but not bad. Voice acting is average but poor recording quality makes it worse. If you like Doom style gameplay, you'll probably like this enough to get past its shortcomings and find the enjoyable game inside. If you're hoping for an intense action game like Halo or Mass Effect, you'll have to find your thrills elsewhere though.Game on.			"

												Alpha Prime (Released: 7 Nov 2007, Acquired: 23 Jan 2014)Given that I got the game in 2014 (7 YEARS after release), this game still has much kick being put into it. I wouldn't go into the plot since steam already has it. As an overview, I am going to say that this game has a feel of an old school shooter. Health do not regenerate and health packs are needed, replenishing your oxygen supply is also in order out in martian soil. One is able to carry around 7-8 weapons, going around getting creative on how you want to kill your next enemy. Oh, and sometimes out in martian environment, you get to drive a jeep of some sort. Graphics are as that of the 2000s, not great but bearable, not bad for a 2007 game, but we all seen better. The sound wise, loops and loops of action music played through when you are dealing with enemies, voice acting is OK, although sometimes it can be quite laughable.Next I am going to list the Pros and the Cons of this game.PROS:old school shooterchallenging (due many factors)explorable environments and multiple entry points and ways to begin a gunfightget to play with a lot of weaponsintriguing storylineno gore (if you do not like gore)CONS:overpowered enemies (contributes to it being challenging)lack of health packs lying around (you need them due to OP enemies and this contributes to it being challenging)repetitive gameplay (explore, shoot people, find important plot points, shoot more people!)linear gameplay (kind of expected in a 2000's game)loopy music (can  get on your nerves)no gore (if you LOVE gore)In conclusion, I would not recommend this game in the current age, although if you are one of those people that would fancy yourself a challenge or you are into that kind of old school shooter style. If you want a relaxing game you can shoot people in the face without really worrying about health, this game is totally not for you.I may have left out a few pointers here and there, would love some comments and feedback on my reviews so improvements are in order.

I DECIDED TO FINISH THIS GAME FOR THE SAKE OF HUMANITY WHILST MY OWN LIFE WAS ON STAKE.But seriously.Pro's:- OK visuals.- Varity of guns- Bullet time. Pretty fun tho it gives no advantage what so ever- Destructible environment- You can pick up things and throw them around- You can play basketball. But be cautious because the basketball can kill you instantly.Con's:- Terrible story, couldn't get a hold of it. I tried.- A level of voice acting which will make you cry of grief. The main character's voice is OK- Enemy AI sucks major ♥♥♥♥- Enemies you fight are too strong. They see you from miles away and have pristine aiming skills.- SAVE the game, the game will not autosave for you. Almost never.- One way street game. You can't use other routes.- Short campaign. Not sure if that's really that disappointingI don't recommend this game since it isn't fun and rewarding to play. The story isn't interesting. Dying simulator. But you can decide to pick it up for a good laugh.			"

												Glitchy. Somewhat unstable. Bad voice acting. Uninteresting cutscenes. Rather useless sounds. Boring weapons and aiming with them reduces playability, visibility and gives only a slightly smaller reticle. Overall nothing in this game feels like a finished feature. 3 months more polishing and the game would feel a lot better.As it is, the game is definitely not worth much. Although being an FPS game I do not think the combat has anything to offer really, so if you buy this game dirt cheap and want to play it through you should just drop the difficulty level to easy and run it through. Yes, you can play the game with higher settings but it does not make the game any more interesting as the combat is what it is.I'd say the price cap for this game is around 2€.			"

												The game is poorly balanced. Even on Normal difficulty, the enemy AI has perfect aim and a single gatling shot can deal up to 15 points of damage. That's seven shots to death from full health! One shotgun pellet deals upwards of 35 damage, and the aforementioned perfect aim makes death in one or two hits inevitable.The enemy humans do not need oxygen, so you can't wait them out and pick off the ones running for the oxygen pumps on the wall. (In one section, you're in a semi-protected tram car with an oxygen pump nearby.)Your eye level is not the height at which you can be shot, unlike most first-person shooters. Chest-high walls DO NOT protect against headshots while crouched.The grenades do less splash damage than bunny farts, and the fiddly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s don't follow the same physics rules your body or other thrown objects do.I'd type more but Steam won't let me.

												I will say this; Don't buy this game. It turned me off within twenty minutes, and I usually have a really decent tolerance for games that others dislike. In all honesty, I'll put down a list of Pros and Cons to help you understand why. Pros: 1.$ 0.49 Cents. (This is only a pro because it was on sale and I didn't waste too much money.)2. Uninstall buttonCons:1. Horrible intro.  It was too long, offered me very little back story, I couldn't skip it, and the dialogue was either Cliche, or justbad writing in general.2. Controls are whack, disorientating, hard to work around. You end up doing awkward things, but you could get used to it I suppose.3. Voice acting is terrible, and on many an occasion (And this particularly bugged me) during cut scenes, the clips of speech for one moment sound like they're right next to your ear (When they're five feet away) and if you shift away slightly, not even a foot further, suddenly they sound like they're ten to twelve feet away. It bugged me, and instantly turned me away.4. Gun controls are slightly off, and make battle generally difficult. Your best bet through most battles is to simply crouch and aim. Running and gunning or even simple ducking for cover are difficult.5. On another addition to issue #3 Lipsync also annoyed me. Pretty much the whole intro was bad.I sincerely hope this is not the end product, or even close. The idea sounds somewhat neat, but there are a lot of things needed to be done before i ever consider this again; Until then, I want my forty nine cents back.[Edit] Still awful.16/10 would uninstall again			"

												Great game! Kinda short, finished it in about 8 hours. Story and graphics are ok. Some reviews on here say the AI is too accurate and it makes the game extremely difficult, personally I have to disagree. I found the AI's accuracy to be about average, and honestly the game wasn't all that hard. I had some trouble in a few areas, but nothing that isn't too difficult to beat once you know where the enemies are. I'd give this game a 8/10.			"

												You know that feeling when you're one of the rare people that have heard of a certain game, and at the same time, one of the even rarer people that finished it ? Feels good.Many, MANY reviews on here claim that this game is god-awful, not even worth a dollar. It's definitely no masterpiece, but as far as mid-00's first person shooters go, it's very decent.Pros : Gameplay is decent. Weapons feel powerful and ARE powerful, except for the flamethrower which has a pitiful range and does next to no damage (so it's a straight downgrade from the shotgun in that regard) and the hammer, which you will never, ever use in this game except to retrieve extinguishers and fooling around with corpses and windows. The level design is (relatively) really good, in a linear first person shooter manner; I honestly wasn't expecting that. Graphics are on par with their time. Of course, by that point, Doom 3, Far Cry and Fear were all already released so compared to them it's really nothing special, but they're serviceable. Rock soundtrack's nice. Just lower the music volume a bit, you'll thank me later. The story, characters and dialogue are hilariously ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Just grab a drink and don't take any of it seriously. Remember, believe in Glomar and prevent Bellini from becoming a tortellini. Also, Bruce survives at the end and gets together with Weiss, and there's nothing you can do to make me believe otherwise. Seriously, Bruce's dialogue towards Weiss and his animosity towards Livia is beyond ""implying"" territory. Roughly five hours of content. It doesn't outstay its welcome.Cons : I have experienced two or three crashes and one game-breaking bug where I had to find a battery to open a door, but the battery was behind another door that was open to me five minutes earlier, but not in the moment, for some reason. Solved it by restarting the level and bringing the battery just in front of the door even before the game told me I'd need one. Story and dialogue are REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥. That doesn't bother me in this case, but peeps that can't stand B-movie stuff will be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. They tried to copy/paste some elements from other popular FPS games of the time to see what would stick, and it shows. Hello, useless bullet time from F.E.A.R. Never used you once, never felt the need to. On the matter of level variety, all you're gonna get is metal corridors and Mars hellscape. I liked it, though. Again, roughly five hours of content, and that's after exploring every nook and cranny, restarting some levels and getting lost at one point because of a bug. Extremely short by the standards of that era's shooters. You'll finish it in 4 hours or less if you're experienced, you don't get bugs or glitches, and you instinctively know where to go at any given time. The enemies' accuracy is off the damn charts, and that's what people here hate the most, it seems. Again, that never bothered me. There are just some things to know : One, the ""lean"" buttons are there for a reason. Use them. They will aim center of mass, not at your head; take potshots around corners and boxes whenever possible. Two, headshots are really easy to pull off in this game for some reason. Three, never, EVER come close to a bot or a shotgun grunt.P.S. : People seem to think this game has an ammo shortage problem. Don't know what they're about, I had a full inventory of everything but the assault rifle and the rocket launcher before I fought the final boss. If you can't aim or if you can't conserve ammo properly, don't blame it on the game, guys !			"

												Ech! That's my summary. Now for the long version.The story in this game is pretty much tossable. Something about people going insane for some key thing yet every enemy you meet is standard special ops big corporation whatever and some robots that decided to shoot anything moving.Dialogue feels very forced from the poor writing and the fact it doesn't sound like anyone took a voice acting lesson. I kept cringing during some of the talk as they tried to cram way too much exposition.The game took only four hours to finish and there was so little fun that it felt too long. It's extremely linear with a paltry variety of enemies. The ending was terrible and made no sense after everything was ""revealed."" Weapons are pretty standard for any FPS (rocket launcher, flamethrower, machine gun, shotgun, etc) but there wasn't anything fun about using any of them. The sounds were lame and there was nothing that made you feel like you launched a rocket or shot somebody close range with the shotgun. Enemy designs are alright but the weapons and environment don't look so hot and sounds are weak (Nothing like barely seeing a guy around a corner and he just stands there yelling ""Go go go!"" with the idle animation of somebody who didn't detect you. Also experienced horrible screen tearing during the driving sequence (also not as fun as it sounds). The final boss in the game is the ONLY boss which stinks because it seems like the story could have had more interesting characters working under the final guy.			"

												Alpha Prime (Released: 7 Nov 2007, Acquired: 23 Jan 2014)Given that I got the game in 2014 (7 YEARS after release), this game still has much kick being put into it. I wouldn't go into the plot since steam already has it. As an overview, I am going to say that this game has a feel of an old school shooter. Health do not regenerate and health packs are needed, replenishing your oxygen supply is also in order out in martian soil. One is able to carry around 7-8 weapons, going around getting creative on how you want to kill your next enemy. Oh, and sometimes out in martian environment, you get to drive a jeep of some sort. Graphics are as that of the 2000s, not great but bearable, not bad for a 2007 game, but we all seen better. The sound wise, loops and loops of action music played through when you are dealing with enemies, voice acting is OK, although sometimes it can be quite laughable.Next I am going to list the Pros and the Cons of this game.PROS:old school shooterchallenging (due many factors)explorable environments and multiple entry points and ways to begin a gunfightget to play with a lot of weaponsintriguing storylineno gore (if you do not like gore)CONS:overpowered enemies (contributes to it being challenging)lack of health packs lying around (you need them due to OP enemies and this contributes to it being challenging)repetitive gameplay (explore, shoot people, find important plot points, shoot more people!)linear gameplay (kind of expected in a 2000's game)loopy music (can  get on your nerves)no gore (if you LOVE gore)In conclusion, I would not recommend this game in the current age, although if you are one of those people that would fancy yourself a challenge or you are into that kind of old school shooter style. If you want a relaxing game you can shoot people in the face without really worrying about health, this game is totally not for you.I may have left out a few pointers here and there, would love some comments and feedback on my reviews so improvements are in order.

												I will say this; Don't buy this game. It turned me off within twenty minutes, and I usually have a really decent tolerance for games that others dislike. In all honesty, I'll put down a list of Pros and Cons to help you understand why. Pros: 1.$ 0.49 Cents. (This is only a pro because it was on sale and I didn't waste too much money.)2. Uninstall buttonCons:1. Horrible intro.  It was too long, offered me very little back story, I couldn't skip it, and the dialogue was either Cliche, or justbad writing in general.2. Controls are whack, disorientating, hard to work around. You end up doing awkward things, but you could get used to it I suppose.3. Voice acting is terrible, and on many an occasion (And this particularly bugged me) during cut scenes, the clips of speech for one moment sound like they're right next to your ear (When they're five feet away) and if you shift away slightly, not even a foot further, suddenly they sound like they're ten to twelve feet away. It bugged me, and instantly turned me away.4. Gun controls are slightly off, and make battle generally difficult. Your best bet through most battles is to simply crouch and aim. Running and gunning or even simple ducking for cover are difficult.5. On another addition to issue #3 Lipsync also annoyed me. Pretty much the whole intro was bad.I sincerely hope this is not the end product, or even close. The idea sounds somewhat neat, but there are a lot of things needed to be done before i ever consider this again; Until then, I want my forty nine cents back.[Edit] Still awful.16/10 would uninstall again			"

												I've played through Alpha Prime several times and enjoyed every minute. Sure, it's not as good as a premium game, but I wouldn't dismiss it for that reason. It's cheap, fun, and looks awesome! The cutscenes are pretty boring, but thankfully you can skip them. Frankly, I don't even remember what Alpha Prime is about. That's ok, nearly every shooter plot is terrible. All that matters is running around a cool space base killing hoards of monsters...that part rocks!			"

												I think the people that gave this a negative review must have not played it very long or gave it a chance, because this game is really good. As you progress through the game you end being able to do more then just shoot bad guys, in some areas of the game you have to puzzle solve or try not to drive off a mountain top. I think the graphics gameplay and  design are all top notch. Overall I would put it right up there with any other FPS. Excellent.			"
