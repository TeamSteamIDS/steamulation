												[ENG] Desperados: Wanted dead or alive is an epic game, indeed, but this sequence is pretty bad... The camera and the attempt of make a 3D game make a damm bad thing, besides,  the developer screwed with the original dub!! Seriously, it's horrible if you compare with the 1st game! And ah, the plot is pretty weak... But ok, still is a Desperados, worth it for 2 dollars (and not a single tip more).[PT-BR] Desperados: Wanted Dead or alive é um jogo épico, de fato, mas essa seqüência é muito ruim ... A câmera e a tentativa de fazer um jogo 3D fazer uma coisa damm ruim, além disso, o desenvolvedor aparafusado com o dublagem original!! Sério, é horrível  se você comparar com o primeiro jogo! E ah, o enredo é muito fraco ... Mas ok, ainda é um Desperados, vale a pena para 4 reais( e nem um tustão a  mais).			"

												Oh sweet memories, this game was epic back on 2007 but time has been passing, this game is a very good combination of western, tactical shooter,action and some adventure... you will pass many enjoyable hours playing this game BUTalthough i use to love this game i had forgot how much confusing are the key bindings ,how quick this game can make you mad and that your characters in game are siting there and die ( you control at least 3 characters in every mission and they sit)I think this game is half way in end, with this I mean that the programmers could have done much more that this befor realise the game but apparently they didnt.. so i recomend it to buy it when is on sales not more than 4 euros and dont bother if you get easily angry beacause you will have 2 options 1st unistal the game2nd break your pc:P			"

												Just play first one. Not this.. This is Cooper's failure.. If you are a fan of Desperados series, may be you can consider to buy it in big sale..not worth  6 $			"

												Could have been a good game, but the developers must have misunderstood what people liked about the original. The focus is all wrong, the characters look and sound wrong and the experience is just wrong. Stick to the original and you will be better off			"

												Unfortunately I have to confirm that this game is unplayable and broken on AMD graphics cards. Certain objects are visible trough buildings, trees,... It looks completely broken and is unplayable.People with nvidia cards might get a good game, but don't even bother getting or installing this game if you have an AMD card in your rig.			"
