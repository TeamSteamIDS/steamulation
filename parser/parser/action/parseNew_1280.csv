												There's no other feeling like crawling around in the tall grass as you slowly inch toward that Allied tank eighty yards in front of you carrying nothing more than a STG-44 and a Panzerschreck with only one AT rocket left, praying that you're not unlucky enough to be spotted by the tank commander surveying the surrounding landscape through his binoculars. This game is filled with these moments, instances where it's kill or be killed and by God it's not going to be you who's dying today, so instead of running and gunning, you think before you act. A vital network of trenches has been overran and it's up to your company to take it back. You fix your bayonet and wait until the man operating the MG starts to lay down suppressing fire, then you're off, sprinting alongside the others on your team onto a field towards a trench wondering if you'll get picked off by a stray bullet; if you'll meet death today. By grace or luck, somehow you make it to the trench line, and when you begin to clear it out you stab a man in the chest when he manages to catch you by surprise, good thing you remembered to fix your bayonet. Now that the location is secure you prepare yourself for the inevitable counter-attack, while someone on the far side of the battle waits for the MG to begin firing as he fixes his bayonet...			"

												Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45 has more realistic mechanics and more challenge than Red Orchestra 2.Aiming is very unsteady.Many tanks to operate.Running speed is slower.Character feels heavier.Smoother online gameplay.Less run and gun.Less spawn spam.More mature players.More teamwork/communication.Less arcade feel.Cannot aid injuries.Hiking uphill affects endurance.Can shoot off the gun from the victim's hands.Much noisier when near explosions.Much shakier when near explosions.Much shakier when near gun fire.Hitch a ride on a vehicle.Feels more like WWII.The disadvantage now is that there are fewer players online.9/10.

												A massive new update (6.0) has just arrived on Steam and it’s pretty damn great.  The changelog[darkesthour.darklightgames.com]is 17 pages long. Some of my favorite gameplay changes:— 90 FOV, finally!— A completely reworked spawn system. It combines the best elements from spawn mechanics of Ostfront and RO2. You can select a spawn point by just clicking on it on the map screen. And this applies to MDVs: half-tracks show up on the map as spawn points. — You can select the tank you want to ride from the list and spawn right in it. You don’t have to rush to the tank as soon as you spawn and then deal with a crew of random players who made it to this particular vehicle first. No more waiting for tanks to appear or for the annoying “Waiting for additional crew members” message to disappear. But you can still spawn as a crewman on foot and join someone else’s crew.— Reworked stamina system and gunplay. You can sprint for longer, but changing stance drains your stamina. So doing the “whack-a-mole” thing by popping out of cover for a quick shot and immediately ducking again will tire you out. Dolphin diving — even more so. And it’s much harder to shoot when you’re out of breath: your weapon starts to sway.— All vehicles now have rider positions.— Improved hitbox detection on exposed operators of vehicles. E.g. I think you can now shoot everyone riding in a half-track as long as you can get an angle.— Ammunition is now included in weapon drops, instead of being in a separate pouch. A downgrade in terms of realism, but these were really tricky to pick up.— Wire-cutters and barbed wire that actually stops infantry, just like in Carpathian Crosses. — You can drop and pick up binoculars.— Windows users now run a modified RedOrchestra.exe that is “large address aware”; this eliminates crashes to desktop caused by the engine running out of memory.And in general, the game looks and feels a lot more polished now. There’s a gazillion of little fixes and visual improvements. I can only hope that someone will update some of the old custom maps to be compatible with the new patch. And the Darkest Orchestra mod.

												As you'll probably know, 'Darkest Hour, Europe '44-'45' is a modification for the original Red Orchestra, set on the western theatre of the Second World War focusing on the beach landings in Normandy, which is shown by it's content, map design and models. Content wise, it obviously expands to that theatre and period, including its weaponry, vehicular combat, mapping etc. It contains most of the same mechanics from it's mother title, with more added features.Personally, I have been casually been playing the mod for quite a few years, and enjoyed it everytime I give it another go, so be it with myself, or a few others. At this current moment, most servers and community input rely of the 29th Infantry Division, a unit for the mod which is known to be the main playerbase. I believe it has been active for quite a few years, keeping servers up for pubbers and members alike with a mature and friendly enviroment. Of course there is other smaller units which are always to be present, but if you are interested in such affairs, the Jackboot forums contain that sort of infomation, if that's your cup of tea.The original Red Orchestra is known for its realistic approach to the First Person Shooter, and may be a struggle of patience to regular FPS players. Aesthetic eye candy from such titles is not the focus here either, and will only be of interest to those of the period, and having the needed patience for it's pace. Quick Analysis.Positives:+ An alternative to Arma.+ Enough content to compete with Ostfront.+ Active units and clans to participate with, if interested.+ Atmospheric, giving a sense of realistic combat.+ Runs well on most systems.+ Free.Negatives:If you were to be picky, apart from some small animation and sound quality issues, the only reason you would dislike parts of the title, would be it's entirety due to it's mechanics. It can appear very sluggish at times, in terms of gun handling and such, but as said previously, it's aimed at those wanting a more realistic experience to the usual FPS style. Being a mod, it's obviously going to build on the original, not take away.In comparison, it is the best/ only alternative for the ArmA 2 Invasion 44 modification, if you do not have a 'beefy' system to handle it, and is easier to set up if you would rather play it casually. The public playerbase is fairly active currently, but will reduce over the years.Oh, and remember! You'll need to suck a bag of raisins through a straw before you'll get the 'Practice' mode to work.

												If you like World War 2 first person shooter PVP simulations, this is a good game to get as a mod of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45.  This game is more on the realistic side of WW2 combat while still using the Battlefield 2 type of game style. You will be using authenically modeled weapons with iron sights. There are no bullet counters, no zoom function, hard to tell friend from foe and have friendly fire.  Has fatigue that limits movement and no healing. Tanks are modeled as close to real thing.  Some classes are Limited in number to a few, while plenty of soldiers with bolt action rifles.  Has artillery strikes called in by a radio located at major bases.You can play as infantry or tanker only.  Has working motar tube soldiers.Darkest Hour is the Normandy to Germany battles.  Has German vs English, American forces.  Darkest Hour is a Mod of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45, so you need to buy Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45.Needs more people playing and more servers hosted.for more info:

												This game is fun, actually better than the main game, Red Orchestra Ost Front. Darkest Hour: Europe '44- '45 is a fun to play FPS game, it features loads of roles, such as Artillery Officer, Corporal, Rifleman, Tank Driver, Recon and much more! despite this game not having a huge amount of servers up. It's still great to play, there is maps ranging from Normandy, Operation Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge, and then maps into Germany itself. 8/10, really good game. P.S, If you want a good server, then try one of the 29th ID servers, the guys there are nice, helpful, and there is always a good amount of people in the server.			"

												It was a great game until the developers ruined it.  The garand recoil action is silly and feels loose.  You can't see the sight picture after your shots.  It used to feel realistic with ballistics but now just feels sloppy like any other first person shooter.  They also put way too many textures on an old single threaded engine that no CPU can handle, unless you llike frames dropping into the 30s.  Didn't have this problem in 5.1.  I can go on and on and on about how the devs ruined this masterpiece.  I think most of the old players, especially the ones that are really good at playing infantry will tell you that they are disappointed with the 6.0 update.  Hope you like your creation developers because we don't.			"

												Writing this review as I just clocked 200 hours on Darkest Hour.What a fantastic game, while the community is small it is a very dedicated community. Most of the players are active during the weekends so you might wanna try your luck then and there.It is such a shame to see not more people playing these kind of games where the gameplay and the atmosphere makes you wanna goosestep in tight formations or sing the stars and stripes out loud like Darkest Hour does.The gameplay might be off for some new players but you will love it when you are used to it because this isn't CoD nor BF nor CS... this is Darkest Hour. Be prepared to miss most of your shots, be prepared to get killed lots of times and above all prepare uranus.Graphics are good for what the game it is, being supressed gives you PTSD, grenades and HE shells blow of entire limbs and play with your body in the air with blood smeared all over the place. The sound and atmosphere of a MG42 firing at you and supressing you will make you produce 50 shades of brown and cry for the admin.Get up, on your feet. Step into a tank and blow the enemy to pieces. Yes, you heard that right! TANKS! A huge amount of vehicles you can play like the infamous Tiger II, Jagdtiger, M18 Hellcat, Sherman and even troop transports.This game has it all, the looks, the feel and the community that make it all worthwhile. But Red Orchestra Ostfront 41-45 and install Darkest Hour Europe 44-45 right away.			"

												Darkest Hour is just an AWESOME mod for Red Orchestra!! In this mod you can play as a tank comander in WW2. You can play in a tank alone or with some friends. And there are MANY great maps which are based on real WW2 maps(And they are big!!). There are even more different tanks most of all on the ""Real Panzer"" server. There are...... for GERMANY: Tiger 2; Panzer4 f1, h, j; Panzer 3 j,n,l; Panzer 2f; Brumbär; Nashorn; Sturer Emil; Tiger 1 E; Jagdpanzer 4/70,4/43; Jagdpanther; Elefant; Flakpanzer 4 wirbelwind; Pz. Sfl IVc; Puma; SDKFZ 251  and even more......for the SOVIET UNION: T-34 1942; T34-85; ISU 152; Su 100; Su 85, IS 2 1945; IS 1942; IS 1; KV2; t-70 and many more......for the USA: M4A1; M4A2; M4A3 105 HVSS; M4A3E8; M4A3E2; M5 Stuart; Greyhound; M10 ; M36; Hellcat and more......For GREAT BRITAIN: Matilda; Valentine; M3A1 Stuart; Cromwell; Sherman Firefly; M10 Achilles; and many more...And of course this is for PVP with up to 20 vs. 20 players. 1 match takes min. 1 hour and the goal is to capture more strategic points than the enemie. And when you die you simply respawn and take the next tank ( they spawn after some time again in the garage/spawn so there are always enaugh) you want. And you must not even play as a tanker, you can also play Sniper, AT-soldier...There is also an ingame-chat and voice-chat so you do not need things like teamspeak. Its just great and the right game for every one who is interested in WW2 or in tanks!!			"

December, 1944. - Belgium, Lutremange.It was snowy, me and my buddies were in a forest. On our way to occupty a lumber camp, that wasn't too far from our FOB. We walked through the forest, completely aware of our surroundings, with our hands and butts freezing cause it was too cold. It was quiet for a moment, until suddenly we get ambushed by Germans. Me and the guys dig in quick as possible, our pointman screams out ""RETURN FIRE!"". We clash in a lenghty firefight, until the Germans had gotten the upper hand with an MG-42. We were being suppressed and we knew that we had to retreat back to our FOB, we were all shaken and scattered around the forest. A few guys tried to retreat back but were shot down by the MG-42 before they could even stand up and run.One of the guys in patrol who was next to me popped a smoke infront of the Germans POV so they couldn't see us, he then grabbed me and said ""Come on, we gotta move!"". We tried running back to FOB, under heavy fire from MG's and rifles, we ran and ran, we were tired and exhausted. I took a hit on my foot causing me to trip and fall down onto the ground. The guy behind me tried to get me up before he took a fatal hit to the chest. I continued my retreat towards the FOB, a few minutes later, I found myself wandering in the forest, alone, no weapon, no ammo pouches. Until a German popped up infront of me, he aims his rifle at me, but doesn't shoot. We both looked at eachother, I stood infront of him unarmed and he was infront of me with his rifle aimed at me. From the look of his face, I could tell that he was afraid, confused and tired, just a normal human being sent out to fight. I take one step forward and *BOOM* I fell on the ground, bleeding out and slowly losing breath as I watch the snow cover my body... Pro's.(Things might get updated here)- Good looking HD textures, don't expect to much though, this isn't a game from 2014.- A good community.- Long or short but also realistic battles.- Almost realistic Wounding System E.g. some bullets doesn't end your life, leaving you badly wounded. If shot on the leg, you will be come unable to run for a few minutes.- HUD isn't bad, just a simple weapon info, character info, compass and then your friendly map to help you navigate.- Immersive combat and good looking weapons.- Practice mode for newbies.- Different classes with different guns and special equipment on the battlefield, E.g. Bazooka's, STG-44's, Radio Operator, Mortar Operator. etc, etc.- Maps are well designed and look good.- Tanks are also well designed, the best looking tank is probably the Tiger.- Different factions for each country E.g. Paratroopers, 2nd Rangers, 29th ID, Fallshirmjagers, etc. etc.- Game is trying to resemble tactical and realistic combat gameplay, so Communication and Teamwork helps to achieve victory on the battlefield.- Devs & the small community are still active.Con's- Only one active server which is mostly active on EU time, sometimes US players get on.- Game can be frustrating and hard for new players.- A few maps are buggy.- Lag spikes, doesn't happen often though.- Bots are stupid, literally stupid and don't function well in Practice mode.- Animations can sometimes glitch, when running or doing other things. But it doesn't happen a lot.- Some maps can be a slaughter fest for attackers or defenders.- Some maps are very hard for the attacking team.- Only three'ish countries, the Commonwealth (Britain and Canada), the US and Germany.- Voice acting isn't the best.This is a good and fun mod to play and maybe one of the best mods/games to resemble World War 2 combat in the Western front.

												This still remains perhaps the most immersive online WWII FPS I've ever played, with the only real competition being the now long-dev-abandoned Resistance and Liberation Source engine mod. The mechanics feel realistically cumbersome enough to simulate actual combat and reject most senses of arcade-style multiplayer where individual kills are your prime motivation. Balancing survival with securing/defending objectives as a team really take priority over your own rank on the team for a given round. It also forces you to really adapt to having to bear the burden of being a rifleman/grenadier when you jump into a server even shortly after the round begins, since every other role gets snatched up right away, and this forces you to really adapt to the teamwork-centered style of gameplay that the game demands. Moreover, for me individual confrontations with enemies really feel like they sometimes come down to simply getting the drop on an enemy, often by sheer luck, which makes the playing field feel pretty even once you overcome the initial learning curve (a German Grenadier can often defeat a Thompson-wielding US Sargeant at close quarters just by luck of the draw). There are no bunny-hopping no scopers zipping around the map ruining the immersion for everyone else, which I certainly appreciate. It also has the unique distinction of not every single map feeling finely-tuned to be precisely balanced for both teams. Since one team defends while the other is on the offensive, your team may or may not have a strategic or tactical advantage depending on the map, which is fairly true to actual warfare. This can be very frustrating at first, but if you're open to it, it does eventually force you to adapt your play style to work as a team and shift your tactics to engage the enemy at hand. I have never had two different rounds of the same map play out the same way, and I have never gotten a deathmatch vibe from it (apart from the unfortunate times DM maps that have been ported over from games like the original Day of Defeat and MOHAA are voted into rotation).While the build of RO that it's based on is now over 10 years old, the dev team has done a truly admirable job since resuming development in the past year or so. The smoke, explosion, ballistic, sound, and sensory (vision and hearing distortion and suppression from incoming fire, etc.) effects all contribute to a highly immersive gameplay experience. The map design is by-and-large really superb, and uses the engine's capacity for larger scale maps very effectively. Again, for a game that includes vehicle + infantry combat side-by-side, it avoids the pitfalls of making vehicles cartoonishly overpowered or easy to use.I tend to find the winter maps the most atmospheric and immersive, and this may be due to the fact that much of the original RO maps were set during winter and the textures, etc. lend themselves best to that setting. Some of the French town maps have a feel of authenticity that reminds me of the first two Brothers in Arms titles. I do prefer some of the previous versions of maps from before the recent revamping of development (Lutremagne being the most notable example), but on the whole the original quality has been maintained, if not enhanced. Overally, if you enjoy the gritty, tactical military FPS experience with a strong emphasis on historical accuracy and a good number of engagements and maps that don't appear in other WWII games, Darkest Hour oughta be worthy of your time. It won't impress you if you're used to the more glossy and photorealistic FPS games of more recent years and value this over more tactical/realistic gameplay, but if you can suspend that hangup and take DH for what it is, I'll wager you won't be disappointed.

												Honestly it's a very good game. If you will mix Call of Duty, ARMA and Batllefield you will get Darkest Hour. Some people say it's a dead game. It's not true at all. At evening you can find full server. Community is nice (mostly).Gameplay is unique. It can be hard game to novice but if you will play few hours you will understand most of game mechanics. Graphics is nice. You can play this game on toaster so dont worry.  Most of revievs are positive and with a good reason. I checked negative revievs - few or them are like ""I dont like this game"" and thats it or ""German and Allied uniforms are too similar and that kinda stuff - it's true but in real life their uniforms were similar too (if you talk about coloristics*).Pros:-Nice mix of few games-Nice community-Devs are again supporting this game-Great for fan of multiplayer battles-II world war-Nice but old graphics-New sounds (from version 7.0 americans has new, much better voice acting and weapons have new sounds)-Tanks are okay-Battles (tanks vs tanks, infantry vs infantry, mixed battles - tanks and infantry vs tanks and infantry)-Cheaters doesnt existCons:-You can play offline but bots are broken-Small amount of servers with people-You can find few gliches-Good but hard to learn mechanics-Hard game for novicesI will rate this game 8/10 for players that spend few hours in this game and 6/10 for novices because hard mechanicsEnding result: 7/10I highly recomend that game for II world war fans.

												This game is by far the best of its class when compared to other ww2 shooters in that aspect. It requires teamwork, cooperation, and experience when it comes to using tanks,mortars, and even the placement of smoke grenades when it comes to advancing across a map. --[GRAPHICS] --The graphics are a bit dated, but considering it all its definitely one of the greats. Given that there is a community for a mod of the original RO1 game and a handful of developers/players who still update it from time to time.--[GAMEPLAY] -- This is why people keep coming back to play this game, It has an element of realism that makes the game feel immersive, such as if you get shot in the hand you drop your weapon, in the leg and you fall down, and.. in the head .. you actually die lol. The vehicle combat is by far the best I have seen to date. You can man a tank with 2 others, Driver, mg gunner, and tank commander. Vehicles can have tracks blown off, optics destroyed, engine destroyed, and yet you can still fight. IMO I will probably always come back to play this game.-RECENT CHANGES/UPDATES- Patch 7 is a huge disappointment, the recent update by far was a setback in the gaming community in my opinion.- The soundpack itself went from being almost perfect aside from some voice commands, to being just utterly terrible.- The weapons dont even sound like the classic Garand,BAR,thompson etc, they are poorly looped and sound as if a 12 year old created them. The new vocal commands also sound worse.- 3 new maps have been added and.. for the most part arent that bad.			"

												A truly amazing game especially with all your Realism Units, hands down the 29th Infantry Division is the best especially with the amount of people you meet and the time you spend with them, doing drills, scrims and having super ownage of a time fighting against each other. One thing I love about the 29th within the game is when it comes to the time of a historical anniversary moments one we recently had amazing fun with was the Bridge Too Far scrim. But back to the game it's a bit buggy in places but as the devs have came back to make the game better I would have rated whe I first started the game it was a 6/10 but now as they came back to it and of the realism units I highly rate it a 10/10			"

												Darkest Hour is the best WW2 multiplayer shooter I've ever played. It is realistic enough to where you have to think in order to survive, but not spawn somewhere and spend half an hour to find someone like on Arma. This and Red Orchestra: Osfront 41-45 are FAR better than Red Orchestra 2 in my opinion. You can just pull out your bayonet and fix it on your rifle instead of unlock it, and every other gun is there for you to choose (but you have to choose that certain class). It requires timing and patience, and reloading can kill you if you're not in safe area. You have TONS of vehicles to choose from, unlike Red orchestra 2. If you're mortaring you NEED a spotter and you NEED to work together. On most maps you can go into ANY BUILDING YOU WANT instead of Red Orchsetra 2 in lot of maps you can't go inside any building. Example: Spartovnovka; There are houses EVERYWHERE and you can't go into a single one?Darkest Hour and Red Orchestra: Osfron 41-45 is fun and has a lot more freedom than Red Orchestra 2. And of course, this is just my opinion. This mod deserves a lot more credit than it has right now....EDIT: Now that it has been updated to 6.0 it is not as good at all. Soon devs want to add crafting and a squad system to it. This mod was not ment to be that kind of mod...Unfortunately I have to find a different game to play...			"

												I have witheld writing a review of this fantastic game because of its ""longing for a better way"" feel. It's cold, it's dark, it's muddy(ish). What it has is a relatively pure experience, carved out of Oak and sealed in a bottle... like good olf Jack Daniels, time makes it that much better. But. past the grit, tank battles, and horror of the bullets whizzing by and around you.... I have felt a bit of sadness for this mod recently. They fixed quite a few things, the 90mm somewhat acts like a 90mm (of which I hoped it would), but it still doesn't match the powerhouse of the 88mm in the German Panther's, Tigers, and Sloped monstrosities.   Is there a Pershing Tank? No. Not a single one. There isn't even a map where you can fight it out in Cologne.  Purest's will argue that there was only two Pershings ever fielded and it wouldn't be right in a game about the blah blah blah.... I harken back to the point that it is a GAME. With that said, it is NOT Red Orchestra 1, it is a mod covering the Western Front... So, why in the H E Double Hockey Sticks is their Russian maps back on this game? In all  fairness, the Developers can do what they wish. But with as many people that love the game for its grit, many still love the way it tackled some hard fought subject-matter, far over-shadowed by the Russian's losing so many people. See, apparently, as Englishman, Americans, etc. We are the purest form of evil, and the Russians sacrificed so much more than we did, that we have to include them in the ONE GAME that actually has M1's sounding like M1's, shooting like M1's shoot (I should know, I own several.), and GI's just trying to solve a problem they didn't create.  OH... I forgot, it breaks up the map rotation...But, wasn't that what RO was about?			"

												I have witheld writing a review of this fantastic game because of its ""longing for a better way"" feel. It's cold, it's dark, it's muddy(ish). What it has is a relatively pure experience, carved out of Oak and sealed in a bottle... like good olf Jack Daniels, time makes it that much better. But. past the grit, tank battles, and horror of the bullets whizzing by and around you.... I have felt a bit of sadness for this mod recently. They fixed quite a few things, the 90mm somewhat acts like a 90mm (of which I hoped it would), but it still doesn't match the powerhouse of the 88mm in the German Panther's, Tigers, and Sloped monstrosities.   Is there a Pershing Tank? No. Not a single one. There isn't even a map where you can fight it out in Cologne.  Purest's will argue that there was only two Pershings ever fielded and it wouldn't be right in a game about the blah blah blah.... I harken back to the point that it is a GAME. With that said, it is NOT Red Orchestra 1, it is a mod covering the Western Front... So, why in the H E Double Hockey Sticks is their Russian maps back on this game? In all  fairness, the Developers can do what they wish. But with as many people that love the game for its grit, many still love the way it tackled some hard fought subject-matter, far over-shadowed by the Russian's losing so many people. See, apparently, as Englishman, Americans, etc. We are the purest form of evil, and the Russians sacrificed so much more than we did, that we have to include them in the ONE GAME that actually has M1's sounding like M1's, shooting like M1's shoot (I should know, I own several.), and GI's just trying to solve a problem they didn't create.  OH... I forgot, it breaks up the map rotation...But, wasn't that what RO was about?			"

												Really good game. If you are a graphic geek, this is probably not for you. Gameplay is really good, really realistic, and there are no COD 12yr olds that call you names. This is strategic ww2 action game.So. Should you consider getting this? YES.Will you have fun playing this game? Not on all maps, but mostly,YES.Server activity? Well, if you play  during school times and all, there should be few people in servers, but in evening, they are full.BOTTOM LINE:This game is fun, physically somewhat accurate, you need to develop a skill, and a nice community:)Go for it, get it:)			"

												Obviously being inspired by games like Call of Duty and movies like Saving Private Ryan, Darkest Hour pulls the front to the west. This together with the large maps of Red Orchestra create a nice variation and enhancement to the game also with the addition of mortars this is a mod that cannot be missed if you own the original game, simply because of the sheer fun you can have with it.

Yes it has bugs and is not as well rounded as COD games are but the realism and all around gameplay makes it overall a way better game in my opinion. It's structure is so different then the first few COD games that its hard to even compare the two.

Once it is afternoon in Europe the servers get full until early morning in Europe. Player basis is largely from Europe, US and some Russians, Asianic people are rarely sighted.The gameplay is good and totally based on skill instead of unlocking anything. There are no unlocks, no levels and everything is available at start. That said, don't be suprised to get yelled at if you don't know how to properly use a kit.I wholeheartly recommend this game whilst it is still alive, and with the upcoming patches and increasing popularity, I give it a solid two-three more years before it is finally at rest in the Game Heaven.

												This mod really makes a dent in the base game, and i mean a good dent because this mod is a major improvment from the base game. First off, sniper scopes work for me now which is a big deal because my prefered play style is sniping. Next it is over my favorite part of the war, i don't know why i don't find the Battle for the Pacific as interesting, it was basically taking one island after the other. I would almost say that this is way better than the base game, WOULD. The reason i say that is because all the normandy invasion maps are some how broke so no d-day.

												This game is great so many roles you can choose from and tactics and communication from your voice chat is crucial. With the new release there is some new bugs and glitches but the developers from Darklight Games are going to fix these issues. I highly recommend this game if you like WW2 First person shooters.

												Honestly one of the best WW2 games I've ever played. Compared to Red Orchestra 2, theres way more maps, vehicles, weapons, and just overrall game content. A great combination of realism and fun. Graphics might be a tad dated, but honestly with all the content it carries makes up for it and more. If you thought RO2 was a good game, you haven't seen anything until you've played this.			"

												Larks and frivolity await those who try to enter the big top at the circus. Dare the ringmaster use those animals after that scandal? Will the clown's facepaint reflect the innermost thoughts of a damaged and troubled mind? Will the lion eat a child?All these questions are very good but when we get to the nub of the issue, they are irrelevant. Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45 is a reality tv show starring Vanilla Ice. This show aims to recreate the horrors of the western european theatre of war via partying on the Jersey Shore. With ensemble cast members such as Joe Scificiccicio, Emily ""Cut-throat"" Furzenschieldfelmacher and Kyle Scudding the whole affair seems somewhat ""in terrible taste"". The recreation of the battle for Iwo Jima is not only rather inaccurate (There were NO Japanese Cavalry divisions that consisted of Samurai riding Panda bears) the makers also seem to have forgotten that this battle did not actually take place in Europe, a little known fact. How can I recommend something like this when ""Big Jack's Circus"", the local performing act, is struggling to keep the business ticking over? With a ringmaster who is going bald, a potent metaphor for him losing grip of life in general, leading a cast of performers who'd rather not be there with the zooalogical equivalent of a septic tank kept in the back for the animal sections of the performance one must wonder: How can we enjoy life around us when so few others enjoy it with us?What can one reviewer do in the tide of content that flows upon him? Is it possible for him to keep up with every single game without having to cut corners whether in terms of his product or his very own thoughts.... his very own mind?The worst bit of this is that it doesn't support controllers so jog on Vanilla Ice, we'll be watching some other circus.Or will we?

												If you want a long range, easy to run, intense as ♥♥♥♥ world war two simulation game, Try Darkest Hour for your kicks. There are countless situations that will test your tactics, and skill in this game. Server primetime is ~6pm EST and will give you a virtual case of PTSD during that primetime. Tank crewing with your friends will make War Thunder Simulator feel like arcade. Give it a go. It's cheap and difficult. Give the game Festung Europa a shot, by the same mod team. It will be out soon enough.			"

												Must have for the hardcore fps gamer. If you like COD, you will hate this. This game is absolutely not forgiving! Super intense gameplay never seen in modern games. Here you will crawl and hide for enemy machinegun fire. You will hide for enemy tanks, you can hear in the far distance. The sounds are heavy and epic. Aiming is difficult something I like very much, it creates intense firefights. Lot's of maps to play and big. Work together else you won't make it.			"

												As an armor warfare addict, i played the fantastic ""Real Panzer"" upgrade, and it then was the best experience, even compared to RO2..But then they decided to throw some-limited- eye candies and so reset game and to do it they wiped out the entire work the community had done on the RealPanzer upgrade.Result: game went back to square one, and is now an outdated game... there is no more reason at all to buy it anymore, compared to Red Orchestra 2...To resume : they suicided the game, thinking the players would drop RO2 because RO1 had now some ugly""better"" textures... :(#Fail.

												Riddle me this: if the game is called Darkest HOUR, why does it last from 1944 to 1945? That's the biggest hour I've ever heard of, because IT'S ACTUALLY A YEAR. Anyways, the only way to make this game fun is to huff a lot of glue when you play, but that actually makes the game SUPER FUN so huff away, everyone. It will mess up your aiming but honestly I think most of the other players are also huffing glue judging by the things they type in the in-game chat and the way they sound on voice chat. I don't know if Steam will ever be able to deliver physical objects or something but if it does this game should come with a 6 pack of glue. For huffing.			"

												Though this mod is buggy and requires tweaking by the user in order to get it to function properly, the Darkest Hour Mod is one of the best First Person Shooter games I have ever played. The infantry combat is like the base game, Red Orchestra Ostfront, in that it is purposely sluggish and difficult to shoot anything beyond 200 meters. Yet, killing a person with a sniper rifle from far away or blowing up an Allied tank with the Panzerschreck gives a very rewarding feeling. However, the greatest defining feature of the game is the armor combat. Depending on the map, there are various vehicles to choose from with most of these vehicles made by the modders. Plus the combat is immersive for when you are looking down the sights, you need to adjust your range by either moving your main gun up and down or adjust the sight to destroy a target at long range. These targets can be destroyed from less than 50 meters to over 1200 meters away from you. These features along with the small yet dedicated community are one of the reasons I keep coming back to play.			"

												Darkest Hour is one of the few mods for Red Orchestra Ostfront that succeeded well and did a great job and capturing the Western Front as it was.  I'd like to start off by saying that I've played DH since about 2009, that was the first time I got on. And back then, this game was more populated than it is today. Needless to say, DH is not dead no matter what people tell you. DH has always been low populated in terms of community and that is what made it special, a small but very tight knit community. Even back then people would fearmonger and go all ""DH is dead/dying"" etc. If you are living in and around Europe, then past 7PM and later during the day you can play this game. An estimated number of 55 - 64 players will be on the server (29th Infantry Division one) which is the most populated. So you can play this game every day and have fun. Darkest Hour is not for everyone, the maps are rather large, there are many vehicle and class types and it has quite realistic gameplay. Communications are always preferred, through microphone or general team chat. The community in general is friendly as long as you work with your team and don't behave like an a-hole. And finally I'd like to add that DH is NOT abandoned, it is being updated actively and worked on still.			"

DONT BUY IT! And here's why!1) THE COMMUNITY!-NO GROWN MEN PLAY THIS! I love little boys as much as whoever is reading (not as much as catholics though, damn you father MULRANEY!!!!! AAAAAAAHHH HE MADE ME A GIRL!) this review right now and no matter how much we like prepubescent voices making degrading comments about how REEEEKT we are and how small are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and crooked our♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥are IT GETS OLD! Unlike this community! I swear this game was made under a bridge becuase only TROLLS PLAY IT!2) THE GRAPHICS!-The textures are str8 outta witcher 3 so you know this game looks like a busted♥♥♥♥♥meth addicted asian waitress having a stroke while trying to carry a platter holding 3 boiling hot bowls of wanton soup while her ankles snap in and out of their sockets sending face melting MSG saturated firey death flying onto all the children of the trailer park ♥♥♥♥♥ who brought her kids to a Dim Sum joint to have a birthday party! ♥♥♥♥ YOU MOM! 3)The STORYLINE!-Am I supposed to believe that Matt Damon's funked up cauliflower lookin♥♥♥♥♥is a genetically engineered super assasin!? Unh UH! NO SIR! Get a casting agent who knows who TOM HARDY IS!4)SOUNDTRACK!- The music in this game isnt even ACCURATE to the period! Who's idea was it to have TAYLOR DAYNE-TELL IT TO MY HEART playing when you storm the beaches of Venice in your landing craft while you watch in horror as your fellow soldiers are all tackled by handsome men in speedos groping and kissing each other your heart pounding in your ears and your bulge throbbing at the prospect of meeting the same fate. So determined you grab your nerf super soaker loaded with warm baby oil you had heated up in the microwave but not too long becuase you knew the bodies you would be shooting on the beach were hot enough;] Then it HAPPENS! A wild screaming german man with a big floppy uncircumsized♥♥♥♥♥♥♥goes running by and you send glistening showers of golden muscle accentuator showering over his body, seizing the moment you draw your giant floppy black♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and leap on him in the sand and well....... you could say it was his DARKEST HOUR!IN CONCLUSION- My phone numbers 123-neva neva land!

												Do not buy this game!It used to be really great, but now it is just a place where old veterans making their own war. where all newcomers are unwelcome.Servers are usually empty, and even if you get 20-30 people on the server, they will vote for some strange maps which remind counter strike and unreal turnament maps, or a giand combined arms maps, where the only infantry is you. Other players will just spam tanks and shoot each other ignoring any objectives.Another problem is that many players (and you can se it on Youtube) change their config.ini file the way that they can see enemy anywhere even behind the cover.Originally it was not easy to aim in this game, but yet you can see other ""veterans"" just shoot from the hip while running and score headshots hundreds meters away.Most of the maps turns into duel between tanks, or tank and AT soldiers, while other classes are just targets.And again its very hard to play when enemy seems to always know exactly where you are regardless of how well you hide. At the moment you make your first shot all enemies on the map just point right at you and kill from the first shot. Like if you play against the AI which ignore any line of sight rules.If you are really interested in this kind of games play Red Orhestra 2 or Verdun, or Sqad. "

												The game is great but the community is dead and/or mostly autistic 16 year olds/30 year olds who role play or some stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥like that. For example I joined a server that had 10 players (the only one with players on it) and I was constantly told to leave over and over and even kicked for no reason they also all had some clan tag thing in their name. And on top of all that from time to time you may be behind a tree or some heavy foliage and all of a sudden dead from out of nowhere and this isn't ""the enemy is behind or to the side of you"" they shoot spot on through everything and know exactly where you are sometimes and don't even get me started on the tanks; people only ever play the tank crewman there's no combat, no skill, no teamwork just people sitting in tanks doing nothing. On the plus side however there is ususally a highly populated server (around 40 players) where people actually play the game which are from time to time pretty one sided.			"

While it has an offline mode (Pratice) like Ostfront, The bots are very useless having no path finding and will often just sit in spawn either standing still or walking circles leaving you to deal with the enemy. If you are the kind who prefers multiplayer only, then by all means go ahead as there are still servers around. But if you prefer Offline, get Ostfront.			"

												I've tried playing this a few times now. I have Red Orchestra 2 and thoroughly enjoy that, plus the Rising Storm adaptation for the game. Both of those games are brilliant and a lot of fun to play. However I had a shock playing this mod.First thing I noticed was the graphics (ok small point in the main look of things). But there was a noticeable jump backwards, and it looked about as good as COD2 to me, which was surprising considering RO2 is actually very well detailed on the whole. The gameplay. Now without crosshairs is standard for all of these games. But playing without them for Darkest Hour just made it impossible for me. I do well on Rising Storm and RO2 online, but on DH it was just a nightmare. The game seems buggy and difficult to get into, aiming seems to be luck rather than knowing what you're doing and people can run around and hipfire for some stupid reason and kill you a lot easier than you can kill them in aiming. Also one of the MOST annoying mechanics I found was that when you fired a bolt action rifle, it didn't auto reload like on other games in this series. You had to click fire AGAIN for it to reload. That threw me a lot. I can understand making the player conciously reload the gun with new ammo, but not force the player to have to double tap just to put fresh rounds from the magazine in. A lot of controls were messed with for no apparent reason, though I'm guessing it was just to make it ""different"". So many people tried to say on the server i was on that DH is more realistic than RO2, I call that a total lie. It's just completely screwed over the basis of the game it was modding on. I understand this is a mod and I appreciate the Devs hard work for it, but right now I cannot honestly recommend this game. I hope in the future when I try it again it will be a lot more playable. I'd recommend they look at Rising Storm and take tips from the success there.			"

												This game is great. If you love Call of Duty: United Offensive, then you will definitely love this game. The learning curve is going to be difficult. This game is almost too realistic, it'll make the baby players want to never play it again. But the Hardcore players wish there were more games like this one. "

												Wonderful mod, I wish the devs for RO2 could take a page from this and add as much tanks as people have done here into RO2I am a best at RO2 but when it comes to Darkest hour. I might as well have a sign that says DONT SHOOT THAT MACHINE GUNNER, SHOOT ME INSTEAD! The Tank combat servers are GREAT the maps are huge, the best fun you can have is when you ahve 4 teammates on teamspeak with you playing the roles of the tank crewman, there is nothing like it!Some of the communities are nice but many admins are just ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥♥looking for a chance to drop the hammer on someone. One time I recalled a coversation between a player and an admin about german and american tanks. The player I guess had his facts straight but, because the admin couldnt handle being wrong he kicked the guy. Thats why I left the game.  But if your willing to follow the rules and so and so your good to go.			"

												Up to this current time, as I'm writing this review, I am still astonished at how fun this game is. Ever since I first purchased this game, and dropped into the several different battlefields and maps this mod has to offer, I've been impressed with what I've seen. Minimalistic HUD, unique gameplay and several other elements make this game the work of art it is now. With this mod, it takes it a step further by offering quite a bit of new content, and good content.New battles to experience, teams to play with and more hidey-holes to snipe from, this game has left its mark on history in my book, as being one of the best, realistic, simply challenging FPS games I've played to date. While it has a smaller community than it used to, it always has me coming back for more.I would highly recommend this game as one of my top favorite WW2 FPS games, and there are only a few on that list.Hope this review helps! Until next time,May your bullets make their mark in history.			"

												This is a mod for Red Orchestra: Ostfront, just set on the Western Front with the Germans, Canadians, British, and Americans. It was a nice change of scenery. It has some features which are more realistic, like actually having to start the ignition of vehicles, but it is lacking in some weapons featured in RO, i.e, MP41, panzerfaust (it is cumbersome having to actually reload an anti-tank weapon). The vehicles are just as detailed, however, and the maps are great. Scopes on sniper rifles allow for peripheral vision, which is great if that is something you like, but the magnification is less and sniping is more difficult oftentimes. It's a free mod, so you might as well download it and see for yourself, but I personally really enjoy it.			"

												Another RO mod. Again - realism, teamwork and lot of weapons, maps etc.. The game is after the final update, so you can find here more vehicles, infantry weapons and maps. You can choose to play as infantry on smaller maps, or you can try to be a tank crewman on really big maps with a big amount of tanks.. I like tanks, especially those, which were made in the Third Reich. There are Panthers, Tigers and lot of other types, on the top there is Panzerjäger VI Ausführung B with its 128mm cannon.. 91/100			"

												A great mod, for a great game. This game is based off of Red Orchestra Ostfront, which depicts the intense and real combat in the Eastern theatre during 1939-1944. This one on the other hand, is the Western theatre. Instead of Soviets vs. Germans, the warring sides are the Americans and British against Germany. This game it very visceral, very real. Once the bullets start flying, you WANT to take cover. The tank gameplay is superb. I love the range of mountainside-villages like in the Battle of the Bulge to the wide open areas of Omaha Beach in Normandy. Red Orchestra is a great series, and if you want some new flavors but still center around the gameplay you love, Darkest Hour will suit to your tastes.			"

Just remember to use move cover shoot....cover.....poke your head out too long...the vets gonna get cha.  The ONLY beef I have is there are cheats and if you're on one of the private servers, someone will pop you off if they want your type of tank or MG and you will suddenly find yourself on the other team as a rifleman, when you crewing a Tiger a second before.For this reason alone, because its so unfair and frustrating, I give it a 7/10 instead of a perfect 10.

												I play this game almost everyday (Under the name Harvey if you're wondering), I had written a review for it before but i am rewriting it since there is a newer version.this game is utterly terrifying, the combat is fast and brutal, the detial is gorey and gritty (Reminds me personally of Fury and BOB), You have to work together and know how exactly to use your class to win let alone survive, To win you have to fight dirty; Kill or be killed and kill with discrimination (Fighting dirty does not mean spawn camping please do not do that) I highly reccomend playing it at full volume if you're using headphones, the sounds are perfect, while some sounds for the weapons arent as Authentic as some claim, they all sound just like Real guns and opperate accordingly, The weapons are an absoulte joy to use, personally to me, There is nothing like emptying an M1a1 Thompson magazine on a Nazi from 7 feet away.The Vehicles are absolutely Awesome, When you Fire up a tank you can practically smell the exhaust, They take alot of practice to get the hang of using, they certainly require some balls espically for the Allied tanks, but the Boom of the gun is satisfying and hearing a shell soar past you is intenseLastly, the game is pretty active, ofcourse only 2 servers are occupied, but its not rare for the infantry server to be completely full, and for the Tank server its usually full on Sundays. the community is great too, nothing to be intimidated by, like with all games youll have the S'talker and the two players bickering about god knows what, if you ask a question about the class you're using you're likely to get a straight answer.Anyways, thats all i got for a ""New and Improved"" Review, I hope i have convinced you to try out this mod, I unintentionally left out some detials on how the game itself functions but im sure the other reviews explain such things.

												Best WWII Game I have ever played. Based on Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. This mod enchances the game play of the base game. The biggest strong point of this mod is the maps are based on some great locations durring durrign late WWII when the americans got involved. Im actually a huge fan of russian and german weapons myself, but I like the addtion. Everything is modeled down to that particular time period which makes a great realistic feel to the mod. Its been 10 years now and the game engine is dated, but I still play this game from time to time because its great fun and you cant really get this kind of experience from any other game, if you are into a late WWII western front experience.. People usually play on the weekends durring the afternoon PST my time.			"

												I recently came back to Darkest Hour, after many years without playing. Red Orchestra 2 really didn't sit well with me, it always felt like it had lost something from the original. Darkest Hour, on the other hand, builds upon the original in many ways, making it an even better tactical game. Now that it has updated and included maps and units from the original Ostfront, it is a great time to dive back into it. There's always one server with people, but it desperately needs more players to keep going, and deserves to.At least until everyone votes for the damn Bridge or Donner maps...			"

												Easily the best part about RO, this mod. Always has at LEAST one populated server every once in awhile with more. I barely play Vanilla RO compared to this, even though i've only played just over 20 hours...so far!			"

												Up to this current time, as I'm writing this review, I am still astonished at how fun this game is. Ever since I first purchased this game, and dropped into the several different battlefields and maps this mod has to offer, I've been impressed with what I've seen. Minimalistic HUD, unique gameplay and several other elements make this game the work of art it is now. With this mod, it takes it a step further by offering quite a bit of new content, and good content.New battles to experience, teams to play with and more hidey-holes to snipe from, this game has left its mark on history in my book, as being one of the best, realistic, simply challenging FPS games I've played to date. While it has a smaller community than it used to, it always has me coming back for more.I would highly recommend this game as one of my top favorite WW2 FPS games, and there are only a few on that list.Hope this review helps! Until next time,May your bullets make their mark in history.			"

												An enjoyable mod to the original RO. Very well done, it's honestly hard to believe that it was made by fans. Downside is that, given how old it is, there are alot of elitists. If you can look past that though, it's pretty good.			"

												The latest patch revived this game a little bit. This is a good ol' realistic first person field combat game require your awareness, patience and co-operation ability. Consider it a mix of old-school Battlefield 2 mods like Forgotten Hope and Project Reality plus ArmA. Always prone, read map, hide in bushes, make calculated steps to flank opponents otherwise you will always get one-shoted from nowhere. As a standard rifleman all you have is an unwieldy bolt-action rifle and two hand grenades. The 10-years-old graphic and ~200ms ping can't take away the fun as long as you don't CQC. Originally a mod for Red Orchestra: ostfront 41-45 which holds a special place in my heart....			"

												This game is epic and actually defines realism properly. The only situation it faces is the lack of players thus a lack of servers. If only this game had more players, it would be much more enjoyable.			"

												This takes modding to a new level, when I say this it's mainly because this game started out to be just a mod and it gained so much fame and attention it turned into it's own game. This should be the standard for mods in the future, especially ones build off a simulator. I can only imagine how much work it took to make this mod and it deserves attention for it. Keep up the good.			"

												Red Orchetra Ostfront 41-45 is already a great game, this mod improves the experience by 10X. That feeling when you are pinned down by automatic fire and you are just praying they dont throw a grenade at you chicken♥♥♥♥♥♥piece of cover, and even when you die because you poked your head out too soon, I still enjoyed the experience. Every match is like a whole new story and you get to experience it first person. One thing to summarize it: TEAMWORK, you will not win if you dont work together.			"

												I sit in a trench next to my buddies defending. A grenade pops in. I manage to dive out of the way, but my friends arent so lucky. I pop my head up and shoot an advancing brit with my Kar98k. I go back down into the trench and attach my bayonet. Then a brit dives into the trench and shoots me with his revolver. Its been two weeks and i still have PTSD.			"

												It's the game that RO: Ostfront always should have been. The selection of weapons, vehicles, and maps available in Darkest Hour is excellent. The graphics, though not cutting edge by any means (especially by 2017 standards), are often surprisingly good, and there are many high quality maps produced by the community itself. I am particularly fond of the many vehicles' accurate interior models and multicrew functionality.  Considering multiplayer team deathmatches are the core of the gameplay, it is good to see that at least three public servers are still active. On a final note, the community is by and large very mature and courteous, and Darkest Hour is one of my favorite games to play with friends.			"
