												Turn Clue into a first-person shooter on 1920's era luxury liners, sprinkle in bits of The Sims, and you've got The Ship. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. To be more specific and familiar to the gaming audience, The Ship is a very polished and creative take on the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer experience (but also keep in mind that this game came before the Assassin's Creed Multiplayer genre was released)....where the main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so, there are plenty of lethal weapons and objects to wield, and even some environmental traps that you will find yourself potentially avoiding. To add flavor, everyone else on each map has a quarry as well. While pursuing your own target, you'll need to stay alert and attempt to spot the passenger readying a knife for your back. The Sims element of the game, quells upon your daily needs to survive (food, drinks, toilet, sleep, etc). The 'character's needs' element makes for a deeper gameplay experience, as your character is vulnerable to attack while you're downing a bag of chips or snoring on a bed. And it is surely funny when your friend murders you on the toilet. The Ship is one of very few games that brings a large amount of enjoyment to my friends and I. Built on Valve's Souce engine, a majority of gamers can experience a $20 title with basically 4 copies to gift away. A little too much? Ask four of your friends for $4 each, and your all set! Overall, The Ship is a very innovative, satisfying and humorous experience that a bunch of 5 friends can't pass up. ""Let us set sail!.""			"

												This is the Multiplayer portion of The Ship. I said I didn't like the singleplayer, but the multiplayer is a totally different story.Also another little note, at time of writing, the in-game server browser is broken. You can find games through Steam (Steam Window: View > Servers > Change Filters > set game to The Ship).The Ship seems to be a lesser known, yet highly underrated game about murdering other people without being spotted. It's a true blue stealth game in that you actually have to kill your quarry without being seen by anyone. If you pull out a weapon in front of a guard, security camera, or are seen holding one for too long by other players, you get arrested and penalized. The game also punishes random deathmatching, so players have less incentive to grief. The game is really tense because everyone is a target. while you're hunting your target, someone else is hunting you, and you have no idea who it is until they start looking shifty, make a move on you, or kill you.It also combines a little bit of The Sims in that you have to manage your needs: hunger, thirst, toilet, cleanliness, boredom, fatigue, socialization... All the while trying to hunt down your quarry. The game also encourages mixing up your murder weapons by increasing the money you get for a kill with a given weapon the longer it goes without being used. Once a weapon is used, it drops to the bottom of the list and only gives you the minimum payout.The game is a buttload of fun and deserves more love and attention. This game also comes with a bunch of copies that you can give to friends. I highly recommend it, especially if you can pick it up during a sale.			"

												The Ship is an amalgam. It combines gameplay genres in satisfying and entertaining ways. Whereas many games that incorporate multiple genres end up as generic experiments gone wrong, The Ship not only manages to keep from sinking, but sets sails for the high seas of adventure. This is one seriously imaginative game. While certain elements may remind you of other popular games, The Ship manages to combine these elements to create a unique concept in gaming. Essentially a murder mystery, The Ship combines elements of the whodunnit classic board game Clue with shooter elements, in addition to some personal management features not unlike The Sims. There's lots of action, tasks, strategy, and laughs to be had. You can play with others online or offline with bots. Each mode has its own good and bad points, but the good points outweigh bad.The unique part is that this means that you yourself are someone's target, and must avoid being killed by your secret stalker while you're looking for your own target.The basic idea behind The Ship is that you play out a murder mystery on a luxury liner that's decked out in the art-deco style of the 1920s. But this isn't an adventure game, despite the Agatha Christie premise. A first-person perspective and maps loaded with narrow corridors and small rooms make the game feel like a shooter, although instead of blasting everyone in sight, you're assigned to kill a specific victim on the sly for cash, and his or her current location is updated at the bottom right of the screen every 30 seconds. Instead of blasting away with shotguns and BFGs, you mainly do your dirty deeds with improvised weapons such as golf clubs, letter openers, barbecue tongs, and croquet mallets. The Ship brings a hilarious, fun, yet totally odd style to the first person shooter community.  When most players are playing along, this game is a blast and there are some really great moments to be seen here.  The single player mode leaves a bit to be desired, as it mostly just acts as practice for online play, but it's still actually pretty usable and fun.  For its budget price, it won't work if you're looking for great graphics or a lot of all-out action, but once you get into the game's wacky style of play I think you'll find it's wonderful and very satisfying.

												I spent about 2 hours playing this with a couple friends today, and as another review had said, it is autistically fun. Playing the ""World Leaders"" mode is absoutely the most hilarious thing I've experienced in a videogame thus far. Becoming George W. Bush and being assigned to take out Margaret Thatcher, you just can't beat. On a satisfaction scale from Fruit Stripe gum to a guilt free blowjay, I give this game a ""Sneeze that's been holding back for half an hour"".			"

												Does anyone remember when Assassin's Creed announced it would have a multiplayer mode for the first time? I sure do, because at the time, all I thought was that they were ripping off the ship.I was wrong. AC multi is a lot worse.The Ship is one of the best multiplayer experiences on the internet. It's a combination Assassin's Creed, The Sims, and a little Madworld mixed in.Players are stranded together inside one of several large cruise ships as a random skin, populated with a large host of NPCs as well. Each player has a target, who they recieve a face for and nothing else. Their job is to find that player on the ship and kill them. The trick is that you lose points if you kill anyone you're not hunting or being hunted by, including said npcs. There are cameras at various locations around the ship, which will cause you to get arrested and timed out if caught brandishing weapons openly. However, you have a set of needs such as hunger, thirst, hygeine, bladder and sleep, similar to The Sims, which force you to keep moving to meet them, usually away from the cameras. Your goal is to act as much like the unassuming NPCs as possible, both to avoid detection from those hunting you and to disguise yourself from the prey you're tailing, all while managing your meters and picking up the weapons you'll need to secure the kill.There's a huge host of weapons and environmental hazards with which to do so, and point values for each vary wildly over time. This forces players who want to stay on top to constantly be changing their tactics and style. Certain weapons can only be found in specific locations on each ship, so highly desired gear can become choke points which force players to meet similar to Q3A duels.The ship is full of more than weapons, though. In addition to portable food items which can restore health or your need meters in a pinch, most guests board with more than the clothes on their backs. By raiding their rooms for garments, you can swap out your clothing if you think you're being followed or after each kill to disguise yourself and throw the other players off your scent. You can't change your face, but someone following to the side or behind may think you're an NPC and move on.The result of all this craziness is a really clever form of deathmatch that uses true stealth and deception, because you're trying to trick other players instead of AI. Stalking prey feels really rewarding and so does tricking your attacker into revealing themselves under a camera or turning a corner and unexpectedly fighting back. The ticking time from your meters at the bottom, the rapidly changing point structure and high ranking players attracting more hunters make the pressure always on and puts players on their toes.If all this seems right up your alley, wait unless you're super eager and have nothing better to do. The Ship is getting an HD version in early 2016, though as far as anyone can tell right now, it will be multiplayer only. The Ship also has a singleplayer campaign, though it's not nearly as fun imho. The unique aspect of Ship combat is pvp stealth and sneaking up on Sims in their sleep feels more like a clunky, uglier Hitman Absolution.			"

												Think ""The Sims"" crossing over with ""Assassin's Creed"", you are all random shipmates with individual pseudonyms aboard a variety of different and even exotic vessels for maps. Your main objective: Kill your designated quarry, whilst watching out for other competing hunters, and tending to  your own basic human needs; hunger, sleep, boredom, hygiene, and using the facilities (Make sure you close the door first!).And proclaim your prominence as the dominant hunter, with a comedic arsenal of fun assertives such as: A Tommy gun, Blunderbuss', shanks, Wallet-bombs, and even Mannequin Arms. Just don't get caught by the fuzz when commiting your dasterdly deeds!There's just nothing more amusing than whipping out a full automatic, and eviscerating your best friends while they're busy ""passing time on the porcelain throne""... *sighs happily* Good times.All in all... The perfect party game to play with friends. ^^			"

												The Ship is definitely not your usual first-person shooter, where you just shoot anything that looks at you funny - although there is a game mode for that.It feeds on your cleverness and paranoia. Each game round, you have to kill on specific person onboard one of several ocean liners - the titular Ships - and at the same time, someone is hunting you. Both you and your target - or 'quarry' - can take cover under the watchful eye of a Security Guard or Camera, but your hunter will likely be quite happy to bribe the Security to ignore their crimes while they bring that big ol' bat of theirs and beat your♥♥♥♥♥to death with it.Each other player you meet is a potential threat, and whether they come right at you wielding axe or gun, or sneak around and try to whack you from behind or lure you into a trap is up to them.But, again, it's not just that simple - the winner of the match is decided by who has earned the most money for their kills at the end, and each weapon has a randomized and steadily increasing price for its use, be it Frying Pan, Revolver, Flare Gun, Umbrella or Wallet Bomb. Once the weapon is used, its price drops down to a measely $100. Thankfully, you have access to a list that shows which weapons are paying out the highest. It's up to you to find them, mind.While all of this is going on, your character has needs of their own - hunger, exhaustion, hygiene and growing loneliness all play a factor, and the longer you're alive, the harder it becomes to stay that way.The environments are beautifully stylized. Each map has a different theme while sticking to a creepy, paranoia-fuelling atmosphere. The larger ships are a little dark and foreboding, while the smaller ones are much more colorful and fun. As the amount of people out for your blood increases, the atmosphere and your sanity darkens.Every ship is laid out completely differently, from the very simple to the aggressively complex. Learning the maps and where to find hiding spots and secrets is the key to success.The character design is quite cartoony, something between TF2 and TellTale characters. It fits the tone very well, being neither silly nor realistic.The sound design is just marvellous. Every weapon impact on your quarry is satisfying, my personal favorite being the 'THWANG' of the Frying Pan or Cooking Pot. Old timey music plays through every radio and in every bar and restaurant, footsteps getting louder behind you make your heart jump, the wind, splashing water and airhorn blasts outside make you chill, and... well, let's say your character's visit to the bathroom is... descriptive.If I have to criticize it, I will say the AI bots are very thick, more concerned with wandering about like cattle, more grazing, sleeping and pooping than hunting, only engaging in combat when they happen upon their quarry by chance.All in all, I love this game. An exciting, fast-paced murdery romp on the high seas, combining regular first-person combat skills with strategy, planning and lunatic paranoia. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be totally enthralled.			"

												This is a fantastic game especially for one that was created all the way back in 2006. You forget that it is 10 years old when you are playing; this is mainly due to the fact that it is a concept that is currently unrivalled when compared to games of today. Admittedly, it takes a fair amount of effort to create a multiplayer game; the server has to be hosted by a member of your party as there are no public servers available (This requires forwarding of port 27105). Other than that, it's an easy game to get into. The basic premise of the game is that you have to hunt for your quarry, while being hunted. You get a list of the best priced weapons when pressing M, if you find these and kill your quarry without being detected and therefore detained, you will get a higher amount of money. There are various maps, all of which are fairly good, these can be selected with console commands. The spare slots in the server are populated with a fairly good AI.If I can offer one piece of advice, it's keep an eye on the people around you, and watch that eye.My only complaint is that this game is so old, if it was revamped and brought into today's standards; I could imagine an even greater game would be born.

												The ship is an interesting game that has a lot to offer. If I had to describe it I would say it's like the Sims and the Assassin's creed multiplayer combined, all along with a rather interesting art style. It is like the Sims in that your character has persistent needs throughout the game that you must deal with, and along with the hunt and hunted type pvp you'll be doing means you have to balance killing your target, hiding from the person hunting you, and making sure your hygene, hunger, tiredness and other statuses are fullfilled. The game also features an ecconomy where you get money for kills and this can be spent on items or supplies to refill hunger or thrist.Overall the game is a boat load of fun and it gets even better with friends, if you and some friends can buy this together it should keep you entertained for a while. I've not seen any downsides yet and the only one I could list is if you don't really like this type of pvp multiplayer.			"

												This great deep game is all about choices and consequences.One has to constantly ask oneself, should I kill my target with a cooking pot or a knitting kit? Should I do it right here or wait until she inevitably has to go to the toilet? One has to think all the time. The game trains the mind better than Yoda.			"

												This game sells itself short. Well, it fails to sell itself at all really. Gifted to me by a friend, who was equally unsure of the game, I thought I would give it a try. What an excellent addition to my 2013 collection The Ship turned out to be. Just in the nick of time as well!To put it simply, you're a predetermined character on a ship and are given a mark. Similarly, another character has been given you as their mark, so you can't just run round willy-nilly. If you ever watched Ace Ventura as a child then you'll catch the game's drift fairly quickly. You're on a hunt - for humans. Varied weapon choice provides replayability and good humour. There are plenty of bizarre and wonderful weapon to find and take out your mark with, each with a reward. Bat someone with an umbrella in a public place and you'll be well remunerated. Similarly, tipping hats to Cluedo and whacking someone with a candlestick will also get you big bucks.Considering that the sole goal of the game is to commit murder, The Ship is surprisingly light-hearted and amusing. It's one of those games you can dip in and out of without getting hooked, but get quick jollies from. I've thoroughly enjoyed this somewhat hidden gem and would recommend it highly. "

												TürkçeHarika bir oyun. Tüm oyun boyunca her defasında yalnız bulup öldürmek için başka birini avlıyorsunuz,  ancak biri de sizi avlıyor. Kim sizi avlıyor hiç bir fikriniz yok. Kimseye güvenemiyor arkanızı dönemiyorsunuz bile. Saklan, kaç, avla oyun bundan ibaret. Oyunu öğrenmekte oynamakta gayet basit. Öldüğünüzde yada hapise girdiğinizde baştan başlıyorsunuz ancak dolaplardan eşyalar, silahlar bulmak çok kolay. Ayrıca yemek yemek, tuvalet gibi ihtiyaçlarınız var onlarıda karşılamanız gerekiyor. Gerçekten eğlenceli.EnglishGreat fun and suspense game. In different maps you hunt and get hunted. But you have no idea who hunts you. Most of the time nobody trust no one and you spend your time following and running. It is very easy to play and learn. Whenever you die or get into the prison (because you tried to use your weapon while people were watching) you start over, but you can find weapon and other stuff you need in the closets very easily. You basically gear up from scratch every time and start hunting. So easy and fun.			"

												An amazingly made game which should definitely be noticed. It revolves around a ship which is suspiciously marooned or something, away from any chance of rescue. The strange Mr. X - the complete leader of the ship with a strange kind of Russian accent - orders the ship's passengers to kill or be killed.You get a quarry to kill in the Multiplayer. But there's a twist... you're being hunted. And so the main aim is to stay alive with the Sim-like twist you have to fulfil your needs so you don't die of having to go to the♥♥♥♥♥♥or starve.In the Singleplayer, you're tasked with incredibly unique missions, and eventually you will complete the game.One-of a kind.

												This is one of the first games I purchased on steam and It's honestly one of the best games out there. You're given a quarry to find and murder and you're someone else's quarry for them to find and kill but you have to be sneaky and wary of your surroundings, if you're spotted with weapons drawn you'll be arrested and most likely miss your chance to get to your quarry. The weapons (frying pans, scalpel, syringes full of poisonous liquids) have different worth's and the better the worth the more money you will gain from killing your quarry with them with the worth changing on each round, The player that gets to a certain amount of cash wins. If dealing with all that wasn't enough you have to compete with your own body, you have to deal with hunger, thirst, hygiene (sort of like the Sims)  and if you don't shower often enough you will turn into dust and perish.I murdered my quarry while they were on the toilet with a blunderbuss. That's the kind of game this is.			"

The ShipThe Ship is a fun semi-realistic multi-player game that takes place is a semi-modern early 1910's. The game modes consist of Hunt(You have a name of another player/CPU and you must find him/her and kill them without getting arrested or killed yourself), Team Elimination(Simple; Two teams find and kill each member of the opposing team), Death-match(Kill everyone), Duel(One-on-one battle), and Team VIP(Kill the enemies teams, VIP whilst keeping yours safe). I gotta' admit it, It's a very fun multi-player game. I especially like the realism aspects such as, Thirst, blatter, colon, hunger, sleep, entertainment, loneliness, and some more(If I remember correctly). If you fail to attend to those needs, Your player will die in a unique way according to which thing you forgot to attend to. Anyway, In conclusion; The Ship is an awesome multi-player game and I for sure, suggest that you guys should try it out.RatingsCategoryRatingGame-play8/10Realism9/10Popularity in players3/10Weaponry variety10/10All-round Enjoyment9/10 "

Posted: September 1, 2015
												This game is one of the most unique, creative, and best multiplayer games that there is. It requires you to be a lot more strategic compared to other games in the FPS genre. Every round, you are given a random person (called a Quarry in the game) that you have to try to hunt down and eliminate without being caught by security guards, security cameras, or witnesses. If you get caught, then you go to jail for a bit. But at the same time, you have someone that is also trying to hunt you down and eliminate you in a stealthy manner as well. Every so often, you are notified of the location where your Quarry is/was. But your Hunter is also notified of the location where you are/were every so often as well. So it's a constant feeling of uneasiness because you can't really trust anybody as you're moving around the ship. And you're trying to eliminate your Quarry while also trying to not get eliminated by your Hunter (and you don't know who your Hunter is). If you eliminate an innocent (someone that is not your Quarry or your Hunter), your character loses money. And if you eliminate too many innocents and put your character in a lot of debt, you automatically get kicked and temporarily suspended from the server for 1 hour. Another good thing about this game is that all of the characters have real human needs that need to be attended to every so often. These needs include eating, having a drink, going to the washroom, showering/bathing, sleeping, socializing, reading something, etc. Having to attend to these needs prevents players from just camping the whole time. If a character's needs are ignored, then there are consequences such as the character naturally dying. Or falling on the floor and going to sleep for a bit which makes you completely defenseless against your Hunter if they find you. So the requirement of having to attend to real human needs every so often is one of the things that makes this game so unique and different from the rest of the FPS genre. The game also requires you to use different weapons/methods towards eliminating your Quarry each round. Eliminating your Quarry with the same weapon repeatedly every round results in very little award money for you. Each round, the weapons get a different award money amount based on which weapons have been used the most so far in the match. The weapons and items that you will find as you search around are randomized. The Ship also has a pretty decent single player campaign/story. And it also has a tutorial for new players to teach them the basics of playing the game. The game can be played by yourself offline with bots or online with other people (and bots if wanted). You can host your own server by yourself (playing with bots at first) that other people can join (players that join replace the bots). The game also has different gamemodes and maps as well. This game is very deserving of a lot more online players than it currently has. So I definitely recommend The Ship for people that are looking for a multiplayer game that's very unique, creative, and different!			"

												The Ship is a game where you hunt other people while being hunted yourself.Ever played Assassin's Creed's Hunt mode or Trouble in Terrorist Town? This is very similar.The main difference between The Ship and those games is its Sims-like needs system.This concept may be foreign to people unfamiliar with The Ship, but eating and drinking are essential to not dying.Too hungry? You die.Too thirsty? You die.Too tired? You fall asleep and somebody literally stabs you in the back.Managing one's needs is a way The Ship forces players into the open.Just skip the Single Player game, it's agonizingly slow and boring.

(and to vary, everyone loose their ♥♥♥♥ing head by that)The Ship can´t be more big than it is, 5 covered, and going to end with the same fate of the ""Titanic""(looks like big ships can´t coexist without being sunk) but you have an usefull map which indicates objetives in every moment so you can´t be like a missing turistic in a new country.But this is not you average boring ship, is a completely facking mafia from the inside, conspirancy ,hitmans, even yakuzas....Packed with weapons in every corner, lockers, and every single room you can find (i don´t know how this ship was ongoing)To make thing harder than it already is, your character things he is in some kind of ""Sims"" game, he has needs...everytime.....Oh God...a ♥♥♥♥ing kid.10 missions to complete, to get a wtf ending But despite the negative facts, it has a good dynamic, and good idea from base. Is a good way to go later with the multiplayer (When the fun doesn´t end neither). "

												This game is a fantastic group experience for anyone wanting to spend an evening stabbing your friends in the back. The Offline part is garbage, and playing the online multiplayer is decent fun, but the game truly shines when you have a large group of friends (4+) on a private server taunting eachother over voice chat and screaming in panic when you pull the shotgun. If you're flying solo, then keep on browsing, but if you've got friends to VC with, this game earns a flawless 10/10.The only downside is that, rather than fix the server issues (There are no dedicated servers, you have to find publicly run servers to play on or make one yourself.) They instead released a worse version of the game under the pretense of it being a ""remastering."" The new version straight up removes some of the game elements and changes others,  while adding little, if any to compensate.Worst of all, in my opinion, is that with the release of a re-mastering, they've removed the ability to buy a 5 pack of the Ship for 20 dollars. 5 friends tossing 4$ in the hat was the single greatest purchase I've ever made on steam, but asking each person to pony up 10$, especially when the game's most fun with friends? They properly shot themselves in the foot with that.TL;DR This old version is better than the remastered one, and the game is best experienced with friends, voice chat, and perhaps just a little alcohol.

												Multiplayer:Fun as hell if you're playing it with friends. Knowing that one of your friends might be the one who is assigned to kill you  (or maybe you're the one who's quarry is your friend) makes the whole thing funny while you are Skyping or smtn.Singleplayer:It's quite short and the story is pretty much meh. All you gotta to do, are some tasks given by the Bellboy. Those aren't the ""Kill that guy""  objectives only. Hard difficulty makes your butt clench very hard, especially while fighting with the melee weapons.Overall: Mostly it's a multiplayer fun - lots of maps, weapons, interactions... Interactions kinda reminded me of The Sims. Even the animations and characters looked like from The Sims. Ships are confusing at first and walking around non-stop might affect your patience, because sprinting drains fast and restores slowly. Also, your character needs drain annoyingly fast.No achievements, SP is short, MP is fun while playing it with friends only, in my opinion. Wait for the sale, it's not worth 10 euros.6/10Btw, why the ♥♥♥♥ there are 3 different downloads for this game - MP, SP and even the Tutorial needs to be downloaded???			"

												The Ship is a very fun murder game where you have different ways of murding someone and different gamemodes.Gameplay: The gameplay is great as you must kill your victim, but you can't be seen by a witness, camera or a security guard. The style of gameplay is great as the game makes you use a different  weapon to earn more cash than using the same weapon.Gamemodes: There isn't just one gamemode where you have to kill your quarry, but there are different types like that. Take deathmatch for instance: kill anyone you see. That gamemode is good for people who like having a bloodbath and going on ruthless killing sprees. Or there is The Hunt: you must hunt your specific target before the time limit, and you must protect yourself from your hunter as everyone on the boat is a quarry. The Hunt teaches you not to kill everyone you meet straight away.Conclusion: The game is a brilliant massacre on a boat and I love throwing a wallet/purse bomb into a small room with loads in. 10/10  Would kill someone with a cane again...

												The ship is a very interesting idea for the game. It has potential to be somehting GREAT. When you buy this game, you will find three new games in your library (The Ship, The Ship Single Player, The Ship Tutorial) - I will go over each one.The Ship is the heart and soul of the game, and is what could be amazing about it. Basically, all the players have a ""mark"" on one of the other players, but nobody knows who you're hunting which can provide interesting scenarios. To spice things up, you cannot kill or even bear a weapon while being watched by civilians, guards or cameras. This means, you could lure a potential hunter into a trap! This sense of an almost ""stalemate"" makes things very interesting and with enough dedicated players could make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable games here. The problem is, the servers are down so you have to manually join servers - not too big a hassle, but it is definitely inconvenient, especially when trying to play with friends. Also, from what I've seen, not too many active player hosted servers.I expected the Ship Single player to be the same as online except with bots - essentially be a ""training area"" for noobies. It is instead, a very short campaign with no options to play ""multiplayer except with bots"" unfortnately. Like I said, the campaign is very short, it is unrewarding, has annoying voice acting and is terribly unrewarding. The ""levels"" if you want to call them that can be too easy or ridiculously unfair out of nowehere. The most annoying part is one slip up (even if just caught with a weapon) all the progress yo made in that level is restarted, which means more walking across the ship to talk to the annoying sounding characters. Campaign can be beaten in about 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you are at it, and if you want to ""role play"" or not. The game also has really annoying mechanics. You have various needs sor tof like a sim game, which would be fine, if they didn't randomly have to be upkept every two seconds. The most annoying is the ""sprinting"" in this game, which is the alternative to walking very slowly. The so called ""sprinting"" is tremendously slow and runs out of energy almost immediately. You get about 2 seconds max at sprinting to then have to wait for about 10+ seconds before you can do it again. The killing animations are hilarious, so killing other players is the highlight of the game, to be honest, which seems to be lacking in variety in the campaign - hence why the multiplayer could be so good!The tutorial is short lasting, covers all the mechanics of the game and is pretty important to ""play"" just to make sure you know what you're doing. Why the three games weren't integrated as one, I'll never know. The tutorial speaker, however, talks incredibly slow and waits long amounts of time before going on to the next thing she needs to say - this gets annoying very fast.I know it sounds like I am just complaining about the game - which hoenstly my review is mostly that. With that said it is not a terrible game and when on sale for 5$ I think this is one everyone should pick up. BUT PLEASE PUT THE SERVERS BACK UP DEVS. This game has gret potential and I know it can be enjoyable despite the annoyances. At its current state, however, I cannot recommend it.+GREAT potential in multiplayer+Funny killing animations-Outdated graphics-Annoying mechanics (read review)-Servers not up in-game			"

												Enjoyable party game. Hunt down your target and kill him or her unseen while you avoid being killed by your hunter at the same time. You have no idea who is chasing you and it could be any of the available passengers. It's a multiplayer oriented game. Get it if you have some friends to play with otherwise skip it. The community is dead but there are still servers running, accessible via steam. How to acces the steam servers: Don't start the game. Go to your top left corner in steam and click on View--->Servers---> Change filters to 'The Ship'---> Select a server and connect.			"

												I'll start with the Con's. Graphics not very good anymore. Annoying music keeps looping in levels. Built-in server browser is not working so you need to manually add servers for multiplayers. And then the good.... Well good sides goes something like this: I lurk around the ship corridors nervously looking for my target while avoiding exposing my back to others too much. One can never know when YOUR killer strikes. We all hunt each other - problem is you can never know who it is until the weapons are brandished. Assuming you see them do it. Bam! i found my pray and in a busy intersection i find a quiet little spot where nobody is looking. I whip out the ice pick and stab the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to death from behind. Yes! price money is mine. Later i get hungry so i head for the bank automat and pick up some cash. Life is good. i head for the nearby snack machine. There is a bit of a crowd here so surely nobody would try anything? Like a poker player i place my back against the corner and take some potato chips to sate that hunger. As i take my first bite the man standing next to me in the crowd puts away the book he was reading and whips out a shank and stabs me in the ♥♥♥♥ing face while i am enjoying my potato chips. It just happened to be so that i placed myself into a defilade and the crowd was not looking at me at the right moment. I fall down into a pool of blood and my killer scurries behind the corner and starts to walk casually away. I can almost hear him whistle as he does his casual trot on the corridor. A crowd gathers. 'Oh, yet another one bites the dust'. and then they carry on with their own game of cat and mouse. Many more will die tonight. This dear reader is what 10/10 moments are in a game that is revolutionary in idea but unfortunately very much ignored when it was released and thus it is almost abandoned except for the player base. Did i mention even newbies can be good at this game? Practice a bit with bots and then hit for the MP servers.			"

												Moje česká recenze: http://www.playhit.cz/2015/01/ship-opomijeny-deathmatch/The ship is a great experience, especially with friends. It has some of the most hilarious ways how to kill a fellow passanger, like closing them into a freezer or throwing an umbrella at them. It's a better hunting simulator than other actual hunting simulators out there :D. In the beginning of the round, you get a name of your quarry and your future murdurer gets your name. It's only up to you to escape and still kill your victim. All that while managing your human needs. The insecurity and distrust is incredible, if you use teamspeak during the game and it reaches the fun level of Trouble in Terrorist town mod. The ship is great fun but doesn't offer much replayability, only if you really fancy it I guess or have 20 friends who do, because the servers are sadly very empty these days, playing with the AI is decent though 8/10 "

												I've only played the Multiplayer side of it, I haven't try the single player segment, but I'm gonna review this since the multiplayer is a reason to buy this alone. This is one of the most unique deathmatch experience I ever had, at first it might seems like a pointless game, that make their player roleplay, but in the end is one of the most detph deathmatch game, without the high skill entry point. Instead of jus finding weapons and killing everyone that move, the game rewards you for being smart at it, it make you track your target and kill him without witnesses, including the police. Since when they spot you they put you in jail, in which if you're lucky and play your card right you can make your kills there. The game have a wierd sense of humor, I can't explain what is, but is both fun and dark, also the wierd and twisted violence combine with the slow but tense paced of the game, can make some of the most funniest moment in any game I'd ever seen.My only complain about this game I have is, I wish I had played this a lot sooner, there's still people playing this, and there's hardly an empty server, but I just wish had played this on the glory days.

												The Ship you and some other passengers, are enjoying a free cruise out in the middle of the ocean when the person who gave you the free ticket tells you that you the passengers will start hunting each other, at least that's the single player part of it, now if you decide to buy the arcade version only (charging for single player, EA take note) you will spawn as a random created person with a random name (my favorite being Moses Bring) there are rounds, and in between each round you have a set-up period where you can take of your needs, (Like the eating, the pooping, the talking) or getting new weapons, but when the round begins you are given a name of another person on the ship, and their realitive whearabouts, are you are tasked with killing that person without being seen by the ship athourties, however there is a person with your name tasked to kill you, so it adds a lot of suspense to the game, that being said, there is one HUGE flaw in the game, when you want to play online and you go through the game, the game won't be able to find any servers, this however can be fixed by going to view and click on servers then find the ship. so that being said, The Ship is a Very fun game, with countless hours of gameplay, not to mention 1920's era music playing through the ship, so that's always nice			"

This game is only great if you have friends though as AI are kind of easy to deal with.You could get this game when they are having a sale and it's worth it as you get 1 copy of the game and can choose which friends you want to give the extra copies to.

												A fantastic multiplayer experience as The Sims meets Hitman. You have a specifc person to kill every round and must do so without being detected by security.  Your choice of weapon will affect the bounty you get.  Weapons that have been commonly used give less money, so finding a rarer weapon might net you LOADSADOSHHHH.Mix in the mind games on trying to stalk your prey whilst keeping yourself safe.

The Ship - one of the most original games I`ve played.The devious Mr. X (original name right there) hosted a game on a ship that`s miles away from land. Every one is a hunter, and a hunted. The game's a murder mystery one, that hosts quite a lot of original ideas, for example: you're a human being, so you need needs, like entertainment and sleep. Multiplayer is the main focus of the game, as shown by the hour long singleplayer campaign.I recommend the game, but only if you can deal with it's small playerbase.			"

												This game is basicly assasains creed on the sims. You are on a ship and the owner of the ship Mr X hires you to kill a person and someone has to kill you. You must avoid holding weapons infront of police, cameras and lots of people. But beware someone might have bribed time to ignore crime so they can kill people even infront of police and cameras. To sum it up in one word is incredibly hard, because it isn't just a murder game. It's not just sims. It's The Ship			"

												Clue meets the first person style of video games!This underrated game combines the element of assassinating and downright murdering someone's face with a tad bit of life simulation of having to take care of yourself- the need to feed, bathe, sleep and so on. It also gives the feeling of suspense and danger as you too are being hunted.A really top game to play with friends and family, and decent people. And if playing with others just isn't you thing there is always the single player piece of it to play. For either case there is bound to be hours of fun.Other great aspects of the game is the hilarious rag-doll physics, the lack of lag, and even the some-what stylized look of everything which helps keep it from feeling too outdated.

												It can be a pain to get the multiplayer set up for this game, but it's absolutely worth it. The multiplayer (which really is the main part of the game, since the singleplayer, while interesting, is basically just a fancy tutorial for the multiplayer and doesn't last more than an hour or two) is pretty dead at the moment, and while you can still find servers to play on if you check the forums for how to find them, you'll generally have to supply your own friends to play with if you want to play with actual humans. There is an HD rerelease launching next year, which will hopefully fix the server issues and revive the playerbase, but for now, if you've got a group of friends and want to kill each other with an assortment of weapons on boats this is a great way to do that without getting in trouble with the law.

It is an action packed fight to the death assassin game, there are multiple ways to win, and watch out if your seen with your weapon or attacking someone you will be put into the slammer. I think that is an amzing way of coding the game and the fact that they thought of that blows my mind. It is absolutely fantastic the gameplay. Though I have to say the bots can be stupid at times, but you will never know what could be around the corner waiting for you.			"

												One of the most unique concepts for a game I've ever seen.  Clue meets the Sims in this early 1900's cartoon fps.  The only thing that brings this game down is it's buggyness, but when it works, it's a whole lot of fun.  Makes an excellent drinking game as well!  I definately recommend playing this game with friends either in the same room or at least on Skype/whatever online phone program you have.  Being in communication with others and playing as a group makes this experience much better.  Keep the ship alive!			"

												Turn Clue into a first-person shooter on 1920's era luxury liners, sprinkle in bits of The Sims, and you've got Outerlight Ltd.'s The Ship. One of the more recent releases on Valve's Steam download service, the game twists around the Clue formula to make it a little more interesting. Instead of having to uncover a killer, The Ship makes you the killer. The main gameplay mechanic revolves around finding your target, called your quarry, and breaking their face as stealthily as possible. To do so there are plenty of lethal odds-and-ends to wield, and even some environmental traps. It's certainly a quirky take on first-person gaming, but it's an entertaining one once you get the hang of it.			"

												The Ship.We have a love-hate relationship.I love this game because of the sense of Paranoia it gives the player, not knowing where your hunter is, and questioning wether or not your target knows you are hunting them.The economic reward mechanics are clever, the least used items being the ones with the highest reward, leading to some crazy if not impractical kills.The only issues I have with this game is the lack of a proper tutorial and a, fundamentally, broken server system. The severs don't appear on the list without going through the Steam server list, and setting up a server is difficult, it's best to play it over LAN with friends.Would I still recomend it? Yes.It's one of the best multiplayer focused games out there, and needs more love.			"

												No words can describe how much I loved killing Kim Jong Il as Ronald Reagan! I love it, it is a great game composed of hunt, elimintation, team vip, and others. The servers may not work in game. But you can get through it in Steam. By hitting ""View"" at the top right. But anyway it is great game if you are mad at your friends or so. Enjoy killing your friends and fellow shipmates!			"

												The Ship is an underrated gem. It really is, and needs more players. is it dead? Kind of. It has around 3 populated servers with different amounts of players at different times, the rest are dead.It is still worth a buy, if it is on sale. I bought it when it was on sale.This is still a great game none the less.			"

												I played this with a friend, and it is hilarious.Okay so its not a great graphical game..so what? Minecraft seem to be populair even tho that game is balls and it looks like a rubix cube.Yeh the Pyshics in this game doesnt really fit in and the graphics arent that great.That doesnt stop this game from being hilarious and funny.I recommend buying this game with multiple people/friends and play it while having microphone communication.Awesome!Would totally play it again... if i had a friend playing with :D			"

												It's a pretty damn good game.Pros: - Source Engine, it's a damn good engine.- Single Player, and Multiplayer.- Fun with friends and fun solo.- Can steal someone's clothes off their corpse.- Good Variety of Weapons.- Good Graphics.Cons:- Sometimes when I'm standing still out of the way of a camera or cop, and it says I'm not being seen, I pull out out a weapon such as a gun and I'm instantly caught even though there was no witness.- Can get tedious if you constantly get arrested because of bs that the game makes up.- Sometimes throwing weapons can be sparratic.- No Master Server Browser. (You have to look up a Server IP on your browser, though that's not very difficult.)Overall? I give this game a 8/10, it's a good game to play despite all the cons.This game gets the Melon seal of approval.			"

												Okay, let me just say, this game is great, are you the hunter, or the hunted? Well, both, You chase down your quarry, on a boat. Once you mindlessly beat your quarry to death with a pool que, you think everythings okay. Well it turns out the man that followed you into the womans bathroom is your hunter, so your in trouble, you can run to the nearest guard to prevent a pot in the face, or you can of course fight back and perform organ surgery with a umbrella. Some times it is difficult to avoid cameras and guards, so its hard to kill your quarry sometimes, be stealthy, and fallow your quarry, zig in and out of crowds, keep an eye out for your hunter, have a weapon, have a change of clothes to confuse your hunter, bribe the officers, and kill them all HAHAHAHHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Seriously, this game is great!			"

												This game is lovely. For a game released in 2006, it's a damn good amount of fun! I've spent a couple of hours playing it lately, and I have to say, for a game I got on sale for $5, it gave me a very large amount of bang for my buck.While the in-game server list isn't functional anymore, you can join servers from the Steam server browser. To use it with The Ship, click the ""View"" dropdown menu at the top of the main Steam window. Then, click ""Servers"". Once the browser is open, click ""CHANGE FILTERS"" at the bottom of the window, click the ""Game"" dropdown seleciton menu and scroll down until you find ""The Ship"". Once you're done, click ""REFRESH ALL"" and you're all set!			"

												Two things surprised me about this game... Firstly when I played it it was actually populated, more populated than most popular source mods (i.e. Empires) and some of  the more notorious total conversions (Nuclear Dawn). Second, the gameplay was actually fun... Like... Like the kind of fun Team Fortress 2 used to be before they added in all that unnecessary ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.If you don't believe me, this game actually has hats BUILT RIGHT INTO IT. They're already a part of a working game mechanic (create a working disguise to fool your hunter), they aren't superfluous and/or stupid in any way.Although very old now, the art direction doesn't feel very dated. This is largely in part due to how well the source engine has aged. The cartoon-y look and feel also contributes to making the game still look good nearly six years after launch.Downsides are so: Rounds feel incredibly short to do what you need to do and the nigh-$20 price tag.

												Honestly, it's a game that appeals to a very certain group.Basically, broken down into catagories: The Good: -Fun game to play with friends, though primarily you need to have more than 4 friends or it gets old real fast on finding out who's who in the murderer/victim fastion. -Most Servers have bots to liven up slow gameplay, so this isn't usually a problem.-Straightforward gameplay with only a few occasional camera/guard glitches in being detected.-The graphics are smooth, and ran on my old toaster. No issues with lag unless map's changing soon.-There's usually a shiv in the prison. Shank time 2k16.-I beat someone to death with a manniquen leg and got like $10,000. The ""Bad"":-The server system is indirect and clunky, relying on server connections through the steam client itself. It was more of a mystery to me to figure out how to get into servers with friends than it was actually finding out that the sketchy looking guy following me down a hallway was trying to pull out an umbrella to bludgeon me with.-The game is nigh impossible to play without at least 3-4 people on the server. Even then it's predictable and repetitive. For max game play experience, be sure to join a game with bots.-Sometimes the controls (i.e. opening closets, doors, etc) can glitch out and leave you stuck a doorframe until someone beats you to death. This is used more than once to block people into a room.-""Autoban"" features on most servers if your money drops too low. This is also inconvenient when you just have a really bad round. Overall, I'd say wait until it's on sale to actually purchase it. I received this as a gift from a friend, who I enjoy playing it with in our group, but standalone or on your own is somewhat unpleasant with the thin presence of other players. Suggested because the game is complete and playable, but be warned that going in this one alone might now be the experience you're expecting, especially since most people will have to google search how to join a server in the first place.

												I had no idea I didn't leave a review on this before - but better late than never! I'll just start by saying, in short, that this is genuinely the most unique, fantastic and fun Source game you'll find!This Source remake of the GoldSrc version of The Ship is an incredible one at that - not only was the free, GoldSrc version a unique concept, but this just adds to that in the greatest way possible. Whilst it's now, disappointingly, quite a dead game, it's still incredibly fun with bots and when, if you manage to convince, you pull friends along just to murder them!It's a rather casual game as opposed to TF2 or CS:GO, whilst Source has been known to have a very specific style to train for, The Ship is really easy to learn and gives you the pleasure of enjoying the engine even if you're not good at shooting or fighting in general as this game, obviously, isn't meant for constant fighting!I recommend the hell out of this - it's genuinely one of my top favourite games and has a brilliant structure to it, earning itself high marks simply due to this! Overall the gameplay and the theme it sets is definitely worth your while and can be enjoyed by even the simplest of players!			"

												The ship. A quite unique kind of stealth elimination game, get close to your enemies and then backstab then with a frying pan or a manequin arm.....It is hell of alot of fun, killin people here and there without getting cought by the Police, but if u do have money u can also add the strategy in this game , why?Well bribe the cop and kill everything u see xD .The game is kind of hard to master but after that it is a pleasure for both eyes and mind!Only con is : A small number of servers with enough people to play with.But i used game tracker and i found 2,3 servers which i had loads of fun on! xDLike the time i was takeing a sh** and got killed by Bin Laden ..... Best part : I was Bush .11/10 would get killed by Bin Laden again while takeing a sh**			"

												This is a very fun multiplayer game set on a ship in the 1920s where you needed to kill your target while avoiding being killed by your own hunter and to have earned the most money by the end of the round by pulling off successful hits. It incorporates authentic music and surrounding to give you a real feeling of being aboard a ship in the time period and you have a vast amount of objects that can be used to kill your quarry that keep the game interesting and fun to play. The main problem a lot of people have is that they can't find a server because the mster server is down, but this issue can be circumnavigated by directly connecting to a server using this site http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ .  Just copy one of the ips (I recommend RKSzone as it is the most played)  and go into your favorites tab and find the option ""add server to your favorites by ip"" and paste it there and you should be able to join. Hope to see you aboard.			"

												The AI is awful, so no point getting this if your friends don't play it. However, if you can play this as a group with friends, it's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. The traps sound fun in theory but in practice you'll just be shooting or stabbing your prey most of the time. The thrill is in the chase, as the combat is fairly weak, but it's still fun none the less and the sims-like 'needs' system prevents camping. Overall, a quite fun game even though it has its flaws.

												Multiplayer: it is beautiful, it deserves every award for anything ever. And even if the entire game sucked, the spasms people go through when you chuck something at them would make up for it, or maybe not because you might die from laughter. The only problem is mediocre graphics, but for i personally love them, they make it just cartoony enough. Nice community, only a few servers though. A nice selection of cruises, another problem is navigatio, a minimap would be nice. 11/10, would have bought just the multiplayer for $20Singleplayer: meh, some missions were good, some were not. Good ones in order from best to mediocre: captain murder, Ambassador helper, Bruno's Citizen Slaughter ,prison shankerBad from mediocre to terrible: getting into control room and escape, saving Mrs. Tweed's dog, Doppleganger domination.yes yes i know not all were includedtutorial: not really necessary, the game plays like a regular shooter aside from ""i"" being inventory and middle click holstering weapon.All: do like the rarity of guns and the weapon choice (prison shanks >: ). soundtracks are nice, best menu theme ever.summary: buy nowalso a few hints and tips: claymore is OP (as the AWP) and on the same level as winchester. when out of bullets you can still throw the gun. you can push people overboard on multiplayer. I an 75% sure that empty needles dont do damage so never have only that unless you can inject and get away.Flare guns respawn very fast, a good strategy for the game is fill you inventory with flares and shoot, throw, shoot, throw, etc. until you run out of flares. 1 shot 1 kill for flares. flare strategy is best used for the singleplayer gunbattle. Also another strategy is have half sleeping potions and half flares so you never miss.			"

												Very similar to (although much better than) its cartoony sequel, ""Bloody Good TIme"".The Ship is an old game now, but still plays well and is worth picking up in the sales or a game bundle.  It's a murder party which takes place on a variety of ocean cruise liners, set some time between the wars.  The atmosphere is spot-on.  You're given a target to hunt for and, in turn, you are being hunted by one other (undisclosed) passengers.  You first have to find one of a large variety of weapons to do the deadly deed, then track-down your quarry, fool them into thinking they are not your target and find a safe place to despatch them, but away from the ship's crew and security cameras (in the 1920s ?!) or you'll get caught and put in jail for a while before re-joining the game with all your posessions gone (but there's a hidden shank in the prison!).  You have to do all this while balancing your normal bodily needs of eating, bathing, going to the toilet, reading, interacting with other people etc. and avoiding getting murdered yourself!  Great concept and it works very well, if you can find a populated server, which is the main challange!Very Important: the in-game browser does not work any more to find internet games (which you will want to do - don't bother with the single-player game).  Instead, go the the main menu of Steam, ""View"", then ""Servers"" and filter the search results for ""The Ship"" (you'll also want to tick ""has users playing"" in the browser).  There are still people playing if you look at the right time (e.g. peak hours or weekends).The same trick also works for findings online games with the sequel,  BGT.			"

												Absolutely a blast to play and one of the best multiplayer experiences out there. The Ship: Murder Party is a little bit Sims, and a little bit Assassins Creed. The combination of the two provides an interesting balance between hunting your prey, avoiding your stalker, and ensuring that you use the bathroom when you need to. It's an enjoyable, and relatively easy going play experience that allows players to take part in a murder mystery dinner part of sorts, though it's far more chaotic. For those unsure of what The Ship is, it's this summed up in bullet points:~You  recieve a target to kill.~If you kill your target you receive money based on the item you perform the kill with.~If you get X money you win the game.~If you attack with a weapon in such a way as you are seen by ship's personel, or similar you'll be arrested and fined a certain amount~The game continues in quick, several minute rounds, until someone has earned enough money, or the map changes.Very fun, though a little chaotic when playing with large numbers of players.

												The Ship is one of the most layered and unique multiplayer games I've ever played (there is single player but this is best experienced with friends). It's a hunter style game where each player has a target and at least one player targeting them. The catch is you only have the name of your target and where they were last seen and you have no idea who's targeting you. You travel around the map collecting all sorts of strange weapons, each with a kill value attached (based on ease of use and how many kills have been made with it), trying to find your target by talking to the other players and bots, any of which could be looking for you. You can begin to see why this game is so tense. Once a player has been killed everyone else has a limited time to try and get their kill before the next round starts.This is just the base layer though. On top of that you have to be careful where you kill your prey, as they're are guards and security cameras that will instantly take you to jail if you brandish a weapon in their site. Also committing a murder in front of to many player witnesses will have you serving time and paying a fee. If that wasn't enough, you also have to manage a number of The Sims-esque statuses. You have to eat and drink, use the bathroom and shower, participate in leisure activity, get enough social interaction, and most terrifying, sleep. All of these are tied into your actions, if you sprint you get hungry, thirsty, and tired. If you go to the bathroom your need to clean goes up, etc. If any of these aspects max out, you die.All of this makes for a deep experience, lots of hilarious exchanges, and tense standoffs and hunts. The biggest issue is setting up and getting connected to multiplayer games. The in-game master server list is broken but you can look up guides for selecting a server before launching a game. For private games Steam does include a dedicated server tool or you can do what I did and set-up a VPN and play as a LAN game. Whatever route you take it is worth the effort.Also of note: buying this is essentially buying 5 copies of the game. You get one and 2 gifts. The people that receive those gift copies each get one additional gift copy. Coordinate with your friends and the base price is less than five dollars a copy. If you find it on sale then the price per copy can drop to under a dollar a piece.			"

You have needs and responisbillites in this game, such as eating and going to the bathroom, but they are never much annoying. All the different weapons are fun to try out and I never get bored.			"

One of my favorite moments was waiting outside the room and blowing away one of them with a machine gun. So many creative weapons and hilarious scenarios that can be acted out. If your looking for some crazy, silly and just ridicoulus fun then definitely get this game!			"

												The ship is a mystery game set in the 1930s. You play a passenger on a ship who is tasked with killing one other passenger. However, since each person has this goal, someone will also come to kill you. Each round you must eliminate your target whilst avoiding your own hunter. The game also comes with two extra copies and those compies in turn come with one extra copy. So buy it and give copies to your friends.			"

The in game $ is kinda cool but I was disapointed where you can't purchase weapons in a store, needs to be more purposes for $ in game. Multiple ways to kill your target, & the ai feature was a nice bonus to the game. Also, the main issue that I disliked the most is that I can't find any public servers without looking for a servers ip, there needs to be an easier way. Overall its worth purchasing & playing with a group of people, I guarantee you will have fun.			"

But, if you're willing to do a little prep work this game is great for friends and the inevitable murder of them.			"

												One of my favs your goal is to gain either the money goal in the server or to have the most money in the server you do so bye murderering your quarry stated at the bottom right of the screen killing your target gets you money but killing those that are not your quarry will result in money loss the money you get is dependent on the money the object used is worth calculated by the last time it was used so for example you kill someone with a blunderbuss the next time you kill someone instead of getting lets say $2000 you get $100 but if you leave something alone for a long time you will see that the money from $2000 will be something higher like $8000 if you buy it youll probably ask WHERE ARE THE SERVERS which you actually have to go to steam client - view - servers - the ship and in short GET THIS GAME			"

												I feel like The Ship is a diamond in the rough. It is definitely some of the most fun I've had playing online.This game may be old, but it's gameplay modes are so simple yet so fun to play. The mechanics used in The Ship perfectly highlight the entertaining chaos that happens during the hectic rounds.The maps are ingeniously crafted with care at every corner, plus the graphics are cartoony meaning it still looks fantastic even after 8 years of time since its release.Honestly, I wish more people played this game. It's a shame that its main server went down, but many servers are still filled with enthusiastic players to provide an enjoyable, fun experience.When you buy The Ship, two free copies are given to you to give to your friends. If that doesn't sell it to you, I don't know what will.You should play this game.			"

												The story (more or less):The Ship puts you in an interesting scenario; You and several other cheapskates have been lured onto a luxary cruise liner, the bait being that it was free. The downside becomes apparent when your benefactor, Mr. X, announces that you are now all captive and part of his ship-board entertainment, which is basically a huge game of cat and mouse whilst looking after your characters basic needs, sims-style. Each person is given a target to murder, but also has someone after them as well. There is a plethora of various items scattered around the ship that can be used to kill your quarry, some giving higher cash prizes for a kill than others, depending on Mr. X's mood... but beware, for you are being hunted as well.Gameplay:Story mode is linear and....er... that's about all I picked up. We're all here for the multiplayer after all! (Moving on)Multiplayer:The multiplayer is fun, especially with friends or people you know. Finding a server within the game is next to impossible... due to them being shut down, but search via steam and you get a good few active ones at any time. The organic feel of roaming around, trying to find your quarry whilst simultaniously trying to avoid every other person in case they want to whop you over the head with an umbrella or frying pan is very fun. You collect money from killing your quarry, dropped wallets/purses and killing your hunter before they kill you. You can, however, loose it quite fast as well. Carry too much cash around and someone can kill you and steal a large portion of it. Get caught with a weapon out or in a restricted area and you can be fined and jailed for a set time. (Get caught with half an armory in your coat and your money will vanish in an instant). So you need to keep moving and save all your money in the bank right? Wrong. You can do that, but you need to buy food, drink, new clothes to disguise yourself and bribe guards to look the other way for a bit to gain the advantage.This game is great, organic, sneaky, hilarious, stalking fun. Murder someone on the toilet or while they take a nap, trap someone in a room and wait until they starve to death while you eat crisps on the other side of the door. It's an old game with it's fair share of small problems, but for the (at least) 3 copies you get for the price, it is awesome!			"

												Absolutely a blast to play and one of the best multiplayer experiences out there. The Ship: Murder Party is a little bit Sims, and a little bit Assassins Creed. The combination of the two provides an interesting balance between hunting your prey, avoiding your stalker, and ensuring that you use the bathroom when you need to. It's an enjoyable, and relatively easy going play experience that allows players to take part in a murder mystery dinner part of sorts, though it's far more chaotic. For those unsure of what The Ship is, it's this summed up in bullet points:~You  recieve a target to kill.~If you kill your target you receive money based on the item you perform the kill with.~If you get X money you win the game.~If you attack with a weapon in such a way as you are seen by ship's personel, or similar you'll be arrested and fined a certain amount~The game continues in quick, several minute rounds, until someone has earned enough money, or the map changes.Very fun, though a little chaotic when playing with large numbers of players. Recommended.			"

												I really Do love the ship I mean the mix up with the sims and hitman it provides a sense of paranoia that when your character sleeps poops, baths,eating that some is just wating for the time. I do really like this game however i did not like the fact they seperated the single player from the multiplayer I just feel that it is cheap. Also now it is hard to make a server but still really you need to play it. My friend has a really crappy laptop and it gives him 50fps on lowest so you can run it on the crappiest thing in the universe.Overall I Like this game I do have some issues as of its age now but it is still great 8.5/10			"

												Clever. Interesting. I'd easily give it a 7/10, but there are only 2 or 3 servers running at a time.You are assigned a quarry (think nemesis) to kill and you have to do it away from cameras.People get hungry and sleepy (think sims) so they can't just stand in front of a guard or cameras the whole time.Ojbective is to get the most money from slaying your nemesis.

Winning by killing your prey and watching out for your hunter. And the dynamics are easy to understand, and the maps are very interactive. You have needs and responisbillites in this game, such as eating and going to the bathroom, but they are never much annoying. All the different weapons are fun to try out and I never get bored.			"

It's a lot of fun, so don't judge the game by appearance alone.			"

												The Ship is one of the most layered and unique multiplayer games I've ever played (there is single player but this is best experienced with friends). It's a hunter style game where each player has a target and at least one player targeting them. The catch is you only have the name of your target and where they were last seen and you have no idea who's targeting you. You travel around the map collecting all sorts of strange weapons, each with a kill value attached (based on ease of use and how many kills have been made with it), trying to find your target by talking to the other players and bots, any of which could be looking for you. You can begin to see why this game is so tense. Once a player has been killed everyone else has a limited time to try and get their kill before the next round starts.This is just the base layer though. On top of that you have to be careful where you kill your prey, as they're are guards and security cameras that will instantly take you to jail if you brandish a weapon in their site. Also committing a murder in front of to many player witnesses will have you serving time and paying a fee. If that wasn't enough, you also have to manage a number of The Sims-esque statuses. You have to eat and drink, use the bathroom and shower, participate in leisure activity, get enough social interaction, and most terrifying, sleep. All of these are tied into your actions, if you sprint you get hungry, thirsty, and tired. If you go to the bathroom your need to clean goes up, etc. If any of these aspects max out, you die.All of this makes for a deep experience, lots of hilarious exchanges, and tense standoffs and hunts. The biggest issue is setting up and getting connected to multiplayer games. The in-game master server list is broken but you can look up guides for selecting a server before launching a game. For private games Steam does include a dedicated server tool or you can do what I did and set-up a VPN and play as a LAN game. Whatever route you take it is worth the effort.Also of note: buying this is essentially buying 5 copies of the game. You get one and 2 gifts. The people that receive those gift copies each get one additional gift copy. Coordinate with your friends and the base price is less than five dollars a copy. If you find it on sale then the price per copy can drop to under a dollar a piece.			"

												3.9/5Overall the gameplay is very intresting & fun with a group of people or friends. Multiple gamemodes but there needs to be more types in my opinion. The in game $ is kinda cool but I was disapointed where you can't purchase weapons in a store, needs to be more purposes for $ in game. Multiple ways to kill your target, & the ai feature was a nice bonus to the game. Also, the main issue that I disliked the most is that I can't find any public servers without looking for a servers ip, there needs to be an easier way. Overall its worth purchasing & playing with a group of people, I guarantee you will have fun.			"

												Multiplayer: it is beautiful, it deserves every award for anything ever. And even if the entire game sucked, the spasms people go through when you chuck something at them would make up for it, or maybe not because you might die from laughter. The only problem is mediocre graphics, but for i personally love them, they make it just cartoony enough. Nice community, only a few servers though. A nice selection of cruises, another problem is navigatio, a minimap would be nice. 11/10, would have bought just the multiplayer for $20Singleplayer: meh, some missions were good, some were not. Good ones in order from best to mediocre: captain murder, Ambassador helper, Bruno's Citizen Slaughter ,prison shankerBad from mediocre to terrible: getting into control room and escape, saving Mrs. Tweed's dog, Doppleganger domination.yes yes i know not all were includedtutorial: not really necessary, the game plays like a regular shooter aside from ""i"" being inventory and middle click holstering weapon.All: do like the rarity of guns and the weapon choice (prison shanks >: ). soundtracks are nice, best menu theme ever.summary: buy nowalso a few hints and tips: claymore is OP (as the AWP) and on the same level as winchester. when out of bullets you can still throw the gun. you can push people overboard on multiplayer. I an 75% sure that empty needles dont do damage so never have only that unless you can inject and get away.Flare guns respawn very fast, a good strategy for the game is fill you inventory with flares and shoot, throw, shoot, throw, etc. until you run out of flares. 1 shot 1 kill for flares. flare strategy is best used for the singleplayer gunbattle. Also another strategy is have half sleeping potions and half flares so you never miss.			"

												3.9/5Overall the gameplay is very intresting & fun with a group of people or friends. Multiple gamemodes but there needs to be more types in my opinion. The in game $ is kinda cool but I was disapointed where you can't purchase weapons in a store, needs to be more purposes for $ in game. Multiple ways to kill your target, & the ai feature was a nice bonus to the game. Also, the main issue that I disliked the most is that I can't find any public servers without looking for a servers ip, there needs to be an easier way. Overall its worth purchasing & playing with a group of people, I guarantee you will have fun.			"

												If there ever was a Cluedo game where you picked your murder weapon, your persona and a murder location. It would be Kill Doctor Lucky. But if it had to be a video game, The Ship: Murder Party would be down right on the money. Where do you even begin with this game? You are a passenger on a ship, with a little Assassin's Creed mark in your lower right corner, and a Ship to scour for weapons, enviromental kills and other fun things you can do to your friends in this multiplayer experience.And while it might not seem at all proper to pipe someone's head in with this neatly convinient pipewrench you found in the highly restricted engine room, there are at least one other person out and about trying to do the same to you. All in an attempt to satisfy a masked figure who won't let you off the boat until you scored a high amount of money. How to get money? Well murder in creative ways, use non-traditional weapons. Nobody loves a serial killer with trademarks on this boat though, so out you go to find more weapons. Perhaps that big pot you saw down in the kitchen could bear down on this elderly woman's neck when she looks over to get the waiter's attention?All is tongue-in-cheek crazy and the visual tone of the game gives it the 'innocence' it deserves. And there is nothing better walking past an enemy you thought was a bystander to hear an unmistaken click of a revolver. Great game, preferably play it with friends if you can get away with it, the 4 player pack is worth every cent/penny and allows for massive entertainment. The Ship: Murder Party definately delivers.			"

												Like a classic murder mystery novel or game of cluedo. With purse bombs. And umbrellas. Balance your hunger, thirst, need to pee, social needs and literacy with the demanding life of an assassin. In a game of hunter hunting the hunter 'The Ship' requires players to keep a balanced lifestyle whilst attempting to bloodily beat up their quarry using the weapon which gives the most payout. Sometimes it'll be a katana, sometimes it'll be a rolling pin. When a player has taken out their target, each other player has 90 seconds to kill their targets to earn the bounty. After a number of rounds the player with the most lucrative assassinations wins. Connect via steam servers and this game will surely be a 'hit' among friends.			"

												This game is like if Clue and The Sims had a baby that was a first person shooter, and that first person shooter baby was injected a high dosage of heroin or steroids. This is a title you wont want to miss, and will most likely lose track of time playing. Highly addictive gameplay mixed with a sense of paranoia and excitement breeds exceptional scenarios that make you think.. How the heck am I going to kill this guy with a paddle bat...The only issue I have with this is that the in game server browser is broken/ has never worked, which can be worked around via an online game server list and enabling console to connect to the servers, which at the moment are HIGHLY POPULATED.TL;DR, Super addicting, needs server browser to work but we just use console and internet server lists.Loogie gives dis game a 8/10, I dun like having no server browser sorry.

												Getting a server hosted for this can be an issue at first, but if you manage to figure it out, you have access to a hidden gem. A rather odd but nifty combo of covertly detouring your target somewhere away from the prying eyes of security and fellow members of the cruise, keeping a keen eye on what items will grant you the most valuable kills, and all the while making sure to keep your money safe and your personal needs satisfied. Imagine elements of The Sims thrown into Assassin's Creed: Revelations multiplayer... on a cruise. Odd thought.Get a big group of friends together for the inevitable arguments, screams over wallet bombs, and hasty searching through prison bedside drawers for the one shank available. You can even decide to play with World Leaders. Who would win in a fight: Margaret Thatcher with a frying pan, or Ronald Reagan with a croquet mallet? Don't mind Tony Blair, he just got shot by Saddam Hussein with a flare gun. Enjoy!			"

												This game is great.It's one-of-a-kind with its play style that combines suspense and tactics with a first person shooter. Well, I say 'shooter' - you'll probably spend more time rooting through cabinets and suitcases or clubbing people in the face than you will actually shooting.If you've got this far, you'll probably understand the basic idea of the game; you have to hunt someone whilst being hunted. But it's not just that. You also have to stay out of jail, keep on top of money and look after yourself by going to the toilet, having a bite to eat or taking a nap every now and then, and all of this takes place in a maze of similar-looking corridoors filled with falling lifeboats and lunatics who want to kill you with a letter opener. If it weren't for the viewable map, the game would simply be filled with passengers constantly dying of thirt whilst searching for a bar at which you can buy some life-saving beer. And all of this is outside the main purpose, which is to stay on top of the leaderboard. To do that, you've got to search for a weapon that'll give you a good amount of money for your kill, before hunting down and slaughtering your quarry within the time limit - whichever deck they happen to be on. Whilst all of that's happening, you're trying to work out which of the random people you bump into is going to brutally murder you, which will undoubtedly lead to you carefully backing away from, or pulling a gun on, any person who looks remotely suspicious, despite their totally innocent intentions (murdering somebody who isn't you).tl;drI impaled a man with a set of knitting needles because he looked at my funny, and you will, too.9/10 (one point lost because of issues finding servers)			"

												>Be me>Join a server>Come across a fight>Hunter is arrested>Hunter is black man10/10 realism.But seriously, this is a really fun game. The 6 hours I have have all come after I bought the game yesterday. It's that addicting and fun. But here are my pros and cons:Pros:Addicting gameplayGood selection and rotation of mapsServers are very good, not much desyncAmazing conceptGood graphics.The needs system is cool, and you need to balance that and hunting your target.Good character randomization. You don't see the same character twice.Weaponary choice.World leaders modeCons:There's only one or two servers with people, so you're a bit limited, but it doesn't stop you from playing with other people.The graphics look a bit dated, but that just adds to the charm of the game.It's hard to get around in a stairway or tiny little hall, since people's hitboxes are fairly large.Overall I'd say this game is a 9.5/10. Just minor things that won't hinder your experience at all. If you're looking for a cheap, fun game that'll soak up hours, then this game is for you. If you're looking to do world leaders with friends, and want to kill Bush as bin Laden, then this game is for you. If you wanna inject someone with poison, and run away as they slowly die, this game is for you. And, most of all, if you enjoy blowing people across the room with a blunderbuss, and then getting shot yourself with a tommy gun because karma hunter, then this game is for you. "

												This game is great for people who like to kill their friends and to just have fun. Usually, games like this get you to kill without taking into account about your needs. This game is perfect because it balances the needs and wants of the character just enough to make it believable. Sure sometimes the needs get annoying but that's part of the game.I also like the overall challenge of the game as a whole. The multiple game modes are great and the maps are awesome. My only concern is that I think there should be a workshop for people who want to make and publish maps. I think this mostly because once you've played all the maps, they get slightly boring.But besides that, great game! I definitely recommend this for people who like action, and spy related stuff. 9/10!			"

												Simple but fun, awesome to play with friends.Let me just write down some excerpts from gameplay with my friend Nick that we busted out laughing from.My target is Nick, I pull out a sword to kill him and he pulls one out to defend himself. We both get arrested and sent to jail.Nick: good thing they took all your weapons, now you can't get me.Meanwhile I find a shiv in my cell and go out to have ""lunch"" in the cell room with him. I stand up and look at himMe: Now Nick, it's best we get this over with before you get out on parole *pulls out knife and chases him into the showers*I die and my target is Nick again.Me: Nick, grab my weapons off my body. They're expensive D:Later we go to a ""safe"" spot for him to give them to me but he gets arrested so I wait outside the jailcell until he gets out.Me: Who are you looking for?Nick: Someone named Ferdinand.Me: Oh, I saw her go this way! Follow me.Nick: ...Ferdinand is a dude...Needless to say I did not kill him that time since he caught onto me.I would rate this game a 7/10, great party game but kind of bland when playing by yourself with people you don't know. Best if you get everyone you know with mics into a voice chat lobby like curse or mumble!			"

												Fun little game, bought it on sale for 5 bucks and that alone was worth the single player mode. The whole premise is sound and fun. The only sad thing is that it seems to be a hidden gem because I haven't found many people who play it. But buying it gets you 2 free copies to send to friends and then they also get to send a free copy to someone else so you can get a small group together to play.			"

												Personal Rating: 7/10This game is fun, however what would be more fun is if people actually played the game still. I mean, trading cards were added which is great for me as I like to craft the badges, but how many players did that honestly SHIP in. There are a variety of weapons, outfits and items to choose from that can kill and maim your shipmates, from Frying Pan to Flare Gun, you can pretty much use anything to your advantage.If you have a few friends that would like to play this game, then you can get it pretty cheap in the sales now-a-days and set up your own server. I did it a while back and we had hours of fun. Of course, to stick a twist on the endless murders, you need to keep yourself alive and cater to your basic needs such as sleeping, showering, eating and talking to people. The simplest of tasks become so tense as anyone can just sneak up on you while you shower and blow your face off with a shotgun.So, should you buy this game? If you can get it on the sale, sure, but if you're buying it for full price then be prepared to be dissapointed at the lack of players. You could always play the single-player though which is fun...			"

												I can easily understand what the makers of this game we're trying to go for, it's pretty much the first ever version of trouble in terrorist town (from gmod) and it works well. You can pay for the single player and multiplayer separately and it's a good thing you can. Why? Because the single player is extremely dull because most of the missions are all the same. Somebody will give you some fetch quest like task, and there is always a guy in the way that you have to kill, then you have to backtrack to the person you got the mission from in (through a very confusing layout) order to get money. This is one of the most repetative games I've ever played and it doesn't help that your sprint is slow and takes forever to re-charge. Honestly that's all I can say about the single-player. Multiplayer is way better, while its server service/search is completely broken and you have to go online to find a server IP to get into one, I guarantee once you're past that point it's a blast with you trying to find your quarry and killing them before time runs out, but if you can make a server with your friends, you'll without a doubt you have an even better time. Multiplayer is worth the 20 dollars its asking for. However I think you should look up some videos online about The Ship before you buy anything. I give the ship(both single player and multiplayer together) a: 7/10			"

Or do what i do and kill everyone!With an assortment of weapons such as: Swords, guns, frying pans, sryinges, wallet/purse bombs and pills.Tommygun out of rounds? No problem! The gun itself is one big and throwable bullet!Here's a tip:Don't take the 'happy pills'! "

												I remember waiting to get this game, it released a day before my birthday 10 years ago (in 5 days is the 10 year anniversary...jeezomg). I cannot extol a game as highly as this one.  It is a guilty pleasure, it’s very tense for those actually vying to win the match; nothing comes close to explaining the thrill of tracking and finding your quarry…and murdering them in an unsuspecting manner..Each round you are given a name of a person you must assassinate using random weapons you find (which have different $ rewards), all while keeping an eye open for a person who is doing the same: hunting you.  The maps are deep and intricate, they really put effort and care into this game.  There are secret passages to sneak and escape, you can bribe officers to turn a blind eye, and you can steam people to death, explosives, firearms...I mean come on its awesome.There are also other types of gameplay like Teams and Deathmatch; there’s also a seasonal Christmas version of maps too.As aforementioned by others, a big beef is the lack of players, but when you get a good server its truly an amazing treat, sometimes you gotta wait for other parts of the world to log on (RUS & AUS I’m talking to you, get more players!).  Thank you Outerlight for this game and Steam or whomever is keeping it here running, legit there have been many a time I think about the sad day when they shut this game down due to time, players, costs, etc. and I would be so devastated.  Help keep this gem alive, it’s a classic. 10/10 A+++			"

												Now this is interesting. For all intents and purposes, this is a first-person interpretation of Steve Jackson's ""Killer"" live action game, but set in a tighter environment and with more weapon variety. With that in mind it even has shades of the excellent pre-murder-mystery game ""Kill Doctor Lucky"".Now, you might think that a game that, intentionally or not, reflects these other sources may be a bit derivative, but it really isn't. Indeed it is a particularly refreshing thing to be playing, not quite as frenetic as the FPS games out there, but lacking the long-term sense of digging in that the survival games have. It really does sit nicely in its niche and seems likely to occupy those periods where I need a quick blast of multi-player gaming that requires the use of my rarely deployed sense of deviousness.Graphically it isn't amazing, but it is still certainly appealing and a good job is done setting the different shipboard environments. more than anything though, this game is probably going to generate a lot of anecdotal moments and that is increasingly rare these days.Sure, the graphics aren't top notch, the sound is atmospheric but not rich and the environments are not sprawling (and this is a good thing), but what we have is a great little self-contained game that deserves ongoing attention. Well worth the price of admission.			"

This game has a hilarious sense of humor when you play it. The way you can kill your opponents with such silly weapons and how their bodies ragdoll all over the place is awesome. Worth every dollar if you have people to play with.			"

												Yes and no. Yes if you don't mind playing over LAN (which is, thankfully, not an ordeal to make work) but no if you expect to play this online. It doesn't work online, none of the fixes that have been offered work any longer (Direct IP connection, Steam Server List, Console Commands) if they ever did to begin with, although there are some public servers put up by a blessed few that seem to work don't expect to be customizing your private game. Further, the publisher stated they were unwilling to purchase the development rights to the game, meaning there will be no patch.The game itself is exactly how it advertises itself, it's a game of discreet MURDER put on by a Victorian era madman, this doesn't go as far as Clue levels of mystery which is a bit of a shame but it is a fun Cat and Mouse game... of MURDER. The enviornments are lovingly crafted, the game engine is functional with its wacky bits only complementing the wacky nature of the game, and the game balance allows for both a back and forth AND instant death.Camping isn't much of a problem in the game, not only due to the need to kill your target but also because your character will need to read books and piddle from time to time or they will die, like a chihuahua. Killing everyone you meet isn't so smart, either, likely because you will be seen with so much murdering, and because you quickly lose the game due to point loss. With these two issues countered there shouldn't be much to worry you about game balance.			"

If you recieve it as a gift, you also get a free copy to gift)Points of Interest-Comedic and silly gameplay, and a great casual or competitive game-People may say the online community is dead, because the in-game server browser is broken and they don't know better. To actually connect to an online game: Open the steam client and go to View > Servers > The Ship-The Single Player mode is not nearly as fun, but can be interesting.			"

												This game is just brilliant to play with a group of friends! Sure, the servers are lacking players but I find it more suspenseful when there are fewer players fighting on a massive ship. Basically, this game is like the sims (In that you need to keep your character sociable, well fed & hygienic) mixed with the ability to beat the hell out of other people with canes, umbrellas etc. The ability to throw a weapon is also such a laugh, you can run away from your pursuer sure, but more often than not that just means that they're going to throw a fire axe straight into the back of your head. The good: - Can wear kilts- Can find tommy guns in bedroom drawers (Easy there Michael Corleone) - Can get brutally murdered in the shower/ in your sleep/ while urinating!- There are many different ship maps to play on. (Each map is quite unique) - Range of weapons ranging from a simple umbrella to a winchester rifle :O- The element of suspense (Sure, it's a cartoony game, but when people are chasing you, oh god...)- Requires some form of strategy - The need to find your target & then take them out without any witnesses.- There is a lot of interaction within the game (As stated before, it is like the sims in some ways) - Range of game modes - Elimination, Deathmatch (Just a few examples) & the team varieties. - Well worth the money (Just a decent pick up and play game for the casual gamer)The bad:- Sometimes when the game indicates that there are no nearby witnesses, you get arrested out of the blue. - Going to prison within the game can be a traumatic experience (Don't drop the soap!) - Doesn't seem to be a mode in which you can just kill everyone freely at your leisure (Not good for those who are insane and itching to commit mass murder)The ugly: - The graphics (Don't worry, they don't ruin the fun or the tension of the game) So as you can tell, the game is pretty good. Sure, it isn't amazing, but it isn't to be expected from such a low budget game. However, there can be a lot of funny moments within the game when playing with friends especially. For example, a friend of mine was like 'You come in this room and i'll kill you' to which I merely shot him through the window with my tommy gun. Like I actually needed to go into the room... ;) If you're looking for a game to pick up and play whenever you feel like chasing people with an axe like a rapid lumberjack, this is the game for you!

												This is a highly entertaining game. I had never heard of it til I saw it on the Nov 14 Steam sale. It was cheap and sounded good.  My friends and I love playing (LAN multi only, online is no longer supported).  Basically everyone is an assassin and each person tries to kill their target without getting busted by the fuzz.  Controls are dead simple. It's even better when you don't know which character your opponents are controlling. I think it is a shame that the complete pack no longer has the gift copies (due to lack of gifting). Luckily (for my friends) the bonus was still in effect when I bought mine (amazing deal really when you consider it had 4 EXTRA copies)! And none are being wasted! Only wish we had heard of it sooner (maybe we could have kept online going),			"

												The Ship is a game where you have to kill someone and someone else has to kill you. Different weapons grant different amounts of money and If you're seen you go to jail. You must also take care of basic needs (food, drink, toilet, cleanliness, social, etc.) With the summer sale currently on, I suggest this game for the big discount as it would still be worth it for the full price. The single-player story is good, but the multiplayer is awesome and since there is a sale, the servers will be more filled than usual. Time to get money off noobs!			"

												So, this game. The Ship: Murder Party. A ""Murder mystery"" set on a 1920's cruise ship. Very reminiscent of TTT(Trouble in Terrorist Town) a gmod game that is also a ""murder mystery""A cartoonish graphical style, time era, and a good atmopshere is somewhere to start with all the good things about this game. Plenty of choice, so diffrent playstyles are possible. Good amount of maps, and it really doesn't get stale ever. There is no ""overpowered"" strategy to win.  Plenty of funny moments to be had. Good fun.However, no game is perfect. There are also plenty of flaws with this game, mostly in bugs and annoying cameras. Or just getting stuck. The UI and inventory are quite clunky aswell.The game overall is quite good for something of it's age I'll say. Give it a 4.5/5.			"

												Just as ""Zombie Panic: Source"" this multiplayer game (there is a singleplayer but I've never played it, it's meant to be a multiplayer title) is more relaxing and fun than most other FPS are. It's not strictly an FPS; though you are playing from the ego-perspective and your goal is to kill your enemies using guns and melee, it has rather simple but gameplay-wise important ""needs"" to be taken care of by the players one may know from life-simulations like ""The Sims"".Each player is assigned a specific player to kill when he spawns. You are given his vague position on the ship. You must find him and kill him within a specific time limit with one of many weapons found on the map. Each weapon gives you a different amount of money on kill. If all people kill with the very easily-and-everywhere-found fire axe they won't get much money. So you search all decks and rooms for more rewarding tools, while you constantly must look out not to get stabbed from behind by the player who is supposed to hunt you (which identity you don't know; there are random player models and you can merely guess who is your hunter by paying attention to the behaviour of the players). At the same time you need to take care of common needs like eating, drinking, sleeping and all - which again makes you vulnerable; of course the same applies to your quarry, so waiting for a good chance to get close to him is important. You also need to avoid security guards, cameras and other players serving as ""witnesses"" - if you don't you are put in the ship jail, losing some money and important time. Sometimes you are lucky/unlucky enough to have your quarry/hunter put in there too; if you find a self-made knife in one of the prison cells that gives you a seldom chance to get rid of him. There are traps on the ships like saunas, lifeboat releases or cooling chambers, but it rarely happens you get to kill your target with those.This basic concept leads to many unique and funny moments. There are other modes like Deathmatch and VIP in which there are two teams who must defend their own VIP and hunt down the one of the opposing team, but those are rarely played. Unfortunately so is the regular hunting mode, because there are almost no servers left to play on. The game was badly advertised and has almost died, if it was ever alive to begin with. There are Steam groups promoting the game and trying to get players to play it, but even that only leads to one or two fully-crowded servers at best.Ubisoft who has or had the rights on the title adapted this hunt-or-be-hunted concept in the Assassin's Creed series. I played the multiplayer of Brotherhood on my PS3 once, and while it was sort of entertaining I didn't get to like it too much. I would still prefer ""The Ship"". A sequel ""Bloody Good Time"" in a hollywood/movies scenario was released, but it doesn't look like Outerlight had much more luck with that. They are no more and the rights on ""The Ship"" apparently went to a company called ""Blazing Griffing"", who intends to produce a sequel called ""The Ship: Full Steam Ahead"" (http://www.blazinggriffin.com/the-ship-full-steam-ahead), but only if they get enough support from ordinary people: You can help them fund their so-called ""Kickstarter"" project here: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/709089895/the-ship-full-steam-ahead "

												First, I cornered Willaim Fopplethwaite in the kitchen, and whacked him over the head with a cooking pot. I soon found Amelia Smith in dining room, and preceded to take part in some impromptu interior decorating using a blunderbuss. Finally, I repurposed Alfred Mcawste as a golf club holder. After the massacre, I bought The Ship and a had a jolly good time playing it. 10/10			"

												This game is extremely underated.  After the learning curve has been past, this game is highly addictive.  It feels like the game successfully combined the simulation of the Sims, and included it's own bounty twist with weapons.  You spawn in as a hunter in a map that resembles a Cruise ship or resort.  With a randomly generated character, you are hunting another randomly selected player on the map to find and kill with weapons you must find on the map.  The game ends when either the time has run out on the current map, or a player reaches the goal to obtain a certain ammount of money.  To get more money, you kill the other players with weapons, duh.  The weapons variety are fun and interesting, from swords and Winchester rifles, to candlestick holders and poison syringes.  The more recent a weapon was used to kill someone, the less money you will receive from your quarry or bounty.  You lose money if you get caught in attempt to kill the person you are tasked on by a camera and/or another spectator.  As a penalty you are then sent to a jail from 20 to 60 seconds.  While you are on the hunt for that character, which is silhouetted until you talk to them, there are other factors which you must be wary of.  You must care for yourself, meaning you have a few gauges that tell you when you're getting hungry, thirsty, tired, need to use the restroom, are not entertained, and etc.  If you don't care for these needs, you will die or start moving slower, fall asleep in the middle of the room, or deficate on yourself.  You must also care for cameras placed around the map and spectators in the rooms.  To make the game more hectic, if a player kills his quarry/bounty, a timer starts for you to hurry and kill your quarry/bounty.  This causes a panic and makes it so you can't dilly dally.  But be careful, you can't just go on a killing spree and kill every innocent person, you will get kicked by the server and banned for a set time from the server owner.  You also can't go an get careless.  If you continue to get caught, you lose money, and if you lose too much money, you will get kicked and banned from the server on a set timer from the server.  With all these mechanics in play, this game is extremely innovative in many ways.  You feel so rewarded from using weapons that are harder to kill with as they don't get used as often.  Unless you can't get over the graphics department, I highly reccommend this game.  The only thing lacking are the servers.  You can't find any servers and must use a website listing all the servers.  http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/?page=1&sort=ping_a&game=the-ship For the lazy.9/10 Would definately buy the sequal (if there were ever to be one) at full retail and day one.

												I will start by saying the game is fun. It has aged slightly well with the graphics looking like they came from a early PS1 game. I'm not saying this is a bad this necessarily, but it does feel clunky at times. The controls for this game aren't terrible, but they are awkward for some things like opening containers. Before even starting the game I would recommend watching a quick gameplay video, there really isn't a worthwhile tutorial. I haven't logged many hours into this game so I can't talk about the replayability. From what I have played I have enjoyed. The Ship doesn't have any murder mystery solving so don't come in expecting that. It's a unique FPS that I highly recommend. 8.5/10 BigBulge69			"

												I have a very Love/Hate relationship with this game. I love it, my friends hate it, and I hate a few of my friends when they play it. The premise is that you are a passenger on a cruise ship which is taken over by a mystery villain. He declares that each person on the ship will have a target to hunt, and a hunter who's target is them. This means that you are always being stalked by somebody else as you try to outwit your target and kill them, keeping you on your toes. The suspense is only ever ruined when that target happens to find a Blunderbuss and spends the rest of the game hiding in a cabin and blasting anybody who comes near them.My group picked this game up on a good sale and we enjoyed playing it despite the cabin camper in our midst. It was entertaining trying to hunt down our friends and outwit our hunters. But at the end of the day we had a few people who took the game a little too seriously and some hateful words were said. Taken with a lot of salt The Ship is a wonderful game for every now and then. But it's definitely not for everybody.			"

												I enjoy the way you.....well kill people. Sleeping syringe + scalpel= Happy me. It has a wide array of servers you can join, and then you can proceed to pick up any combination of weapons and outfits in a large assortment of maps. If you like Gmod, then you will like this game. My complaint is that the server list is still broken and you have to kinda guess at which server is good to play on or not. What also sucks is how people can easily kill each other when they arent targets and receive almost no punishment for it.			"

												Great game! Fantastic content! The single player mode has a good but not the best storyline. If you like murder or murder parties you'll like this!When i played i felt a little like i was playing Bioshock Infinite cause of how the people looked and how they over-exaggerate their deaths. Such as flying bodies or last words. The weapons are believable to the time that this game takes place and it really takes you to the late 1800s with the music, atmosphere and realism.If you decide to buy this game don't think of this as a hard competition or how this is a to the grave drop-dead ...""AMAZING"" gameMake history yours.

												The gameplay alone is amazing.  The entire concept of having to be on board a ship full of murderers including yourself makes this rich, as well as having it very well balanced.  the fact that it adds many variables that you need to keep in check on top of killing adds difficulty and immersion to the game, and there's many opportunities for you to kill people as well as get killed. It's splendid and I'd recommend it if you can play LAN with a couple friends. My only gripe is the fact that there are no more dedicated servers to host multiplayer matches.  I hate this because playing with real people makes it more intense as you need to think who may be a real person or an AI, and it's a lot more fun to kill someone knowing they'll have a reaction.  On top of that; the games AI isn't very smart either.  They'll hardly ever attack you, or sometimes it's easy to know that they're hunting you. Still it's a great game and with how cheap it is with sales it's worth it for the experience.			"

												This game is extremely underated.  After the learning curve has been past, this game is highly addictive.  It feels like the game successfully combined the simulation of the Sims, and included it's own bounty twist with weapons.  You spawn in as a hunter in a map that resembles a Cruise ship or resort.  With a randomly generated character, you are hunting another randomly selected player on the map to find and kill with weapons you must find on the map.  The game ends when either the time has run out on the current map, or a player reaches the goal to obtain a certain ammount of money.  To get more money, you kill the other players with weapons, duh.  The weapons variety are fun and interesting, from swords and Winchester rifles, to candlestick holders and poison syringes.  The more recent a weapon was used to kill someone, the less money you will receive from your quarry or bounty.  You lose money if you get caught in attempt to kill the person you are tasked on by a camera and/or another spectator.  As a penalty you are then sent to a jail from 20 to 60 seconds.  While you are on the hunt for that character, which is silhouetted until you talk to them, there are other factors which you must be wary of.  You must care for yourself, meaning you have a few gauges that tell you when you're getting hungry, thirsty, tired, need to use the restroom, are not entertained, and etc.  If you don't care for these needs, you will die or start moving slower, fall asleep in the middle of the room, or deficate on yourself.  You must also care for cameras placed around the map and spectators in the rooms.  To make the game more hectic, if a player kills his quarry/bounty, a timer starts for you to hurry and kill your quarry/bounty.  This causes a panic and makes it so you can't dilly dally.  But be careful, you can't just go on a killing spree and kill every innocent person, you will get kicked by the server and banned for a set time from the server owner.  You also can't go an get careless.  If you continue to get caught, you lose money, and if you lose too much money, you will get kicked and banned from the server on a set timer from the server.  With all these mechanics in play, this game is extremely innovative in many ways.  You feel so rewarded from using weapons that are harder to kill with as they don't get used as often.  Unless you can't get over the graphics department, I highly reccommend this game.  The only thing lacking are the servers.  You can't find any servers and must use a website listing all the servers.  http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/?page=1&sort=ping_a&game=the-ship For the lazy.9/10 Would definately buy the sequal (if there were ever to be one) at full retail and day one.

												Very entertaining and good to unwind from fast paced games! I sincerely hope people pick up a copy of this game, though before you do, I must warn:-It doesnt have high end graphics;-The sprint the game is good but how long you can sprint is a bit short;-The game isnt for ahrdcore shooter fans, its basically a cloak and dagger game all about killing silently or out of sigh;-It might bget boring if you don't have friends with the game;However there's a bunch of funs thing, such as the Sims style needs where it makes it interesting how long you can stay hunting and hunted without dying, sleeping or needing to use the bathroom, plus you can also bribe cops to ignore crimes for a small amount of time and also for information, you have an arrawy of weapons and each of them give you a certain amount of cash when you kill with them.BUT OVER AND ALL, its a good game to play with friends!

												After finding this game on sale through Steam for four bucks, the decision to pick it up (along with two free gift copies) was a no-brainer.  It’s a bit like “Clue” in that the mysterious Mr. X has invited a bunch of people to embark on a cruise…but things get ugly when you learn that cash is rewarded to people who manage to murder their targets.  Guards and cameras exist to keep people from going homicidal, as well as a full-fledged jail for anyone caught breaking the rules. On top of being sneaky, you’ll have needs to meet like in “The Sims”…thirst, social, that kind of thing. The game does support AI…in fact the game comes with three different game modes: Tutorial, Single Player, and Multiplayer.  It’s best to try out the tutorial first, followed by the single player. Once you manage to get past those, you’ll find that there are a few in-game modes available: Hunt and Elimination.  Hunt uses a timer to mark the length of rounds while rounds in elimination ends with the last person standing.  It takes getting used to, but overall I found it to be a lot of fun.

												OK this game made me lose 2 friends and my life became better, its an amazing experience extremely fun with people you know, but the master server is down which means its harder finding a server to play on. This would be hard finding an optimum server that has low ping and can support your friends aswell, the website http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/ should be a primary guide for you to find a server but it has limited servers and many empty ones. Remember before you buy this game it is old, outdated, wont be patched for any bugs you come across but it is extremely fun if you can get over those.			"

												The Game is a missed opportunity for the Dev's , it is good but could have been great , the single player seemed a bit easy and un challenging, while the online play can be quite fun and intense , but there is much room for improvement , if the servers were more stable with more players it would be a much more fun game , such a shame that  Full Steam Ahead i.e The Ship sequel didn't raise enough funding because it could have well become an amazing game, i hope they don't completely abandon the idea of getting the game made , still The Ship is worth it's cheap price and the fact that you get extra gift copies with your purchase is a big bonus .

												After finding this game on sale through Steam for four bucks, the decision to pick it up (along with two free gift copies) was a no-brainer.  It’s a bit like “Clue” in that the mysterious Mr. X has invited a bunch of people to embark on a cruise…but things get ugly when you learn that cash is rewarded to people who manage to murder their targets.  Guards and cameras exist to keep people from going homicidal, as well as a full-fledged jail for anyone caught breaking the rules. On top of being sneaky, you’ll have needs to meet like in “The Sims”…thirst, social, that kind of thing. The game does support AI…in fact the game comes with three different game modes: Tutorial, Single Player, and Multiplayer.  It’s best to try out the tutorial first, followed by the single player. Once you manage to get past those, you’ll find that there are a few in-game modes available: Hunt and Elimination.  Hunt uses a timer to mark the length of rounds while rounds in elimination ends with the last person standing.  It takes getting used to, but overall I found it to be a lot of fun.

												DO NOT LISTEN TO ANYONE! THIS GAME IS NOT DEAD! The default in game servers are dead yes. But the game is far from dead. To access the servers just go to view - servers - and then select 'The Ship' in the games tab. The Ship is about a crazy man only known as 'Mr. X' who threatens all the passengers that their families will be killed if they don't play his game. That's where you come in. You will be randomly generated as someone and your task is to find weapons and kill your target. Each weapon will get you a certain amount of money and once the weapon is used...it's borderline useless unless you wish to defend yourself with it. For such a simple game it's pretty in depth. You have needs you must take care of while killing your targets/avoiding your hunters. Which makes it more interesting. You win by having the most money. The amount of kills and deaths do not matter. I got killed many times and came out on top with just one kill with a very high money grabbing weapon in one match.  The two cons to this game are:1. If you don't have a weapon you are completely defenseless. You can't use your hands other than to push.2. People can block you in rooms and hallways making half the game about just trying to move a couple of inches at a time or just waiting for a loser to back away so you can exit through a door. It can get frustrating.Pros (yeah it's weird starting with cons but there was less to say...good thing right?):A cool mix of 'The Sims' and 'Assassins Creed Multiplayer' with a goofy twistA quick jail system for when you get caught (great way to get all your needs done for free in one small area)Diverse weapons""Discovering"" who people are. Talk to them to have an easier time knowing who to kill and where they are.Diverse maps (No there isn't just ship maps. I've been in a blimp map (which was horrible), a house map and a dock/tropical island map)Overall, this game is small but really in depth and addicting. I was gifted this game but I would easily have paid for it. My only original doubt was that the game was dead. And it most certainly isn't. 9/10			"

												I got this game a while back while watching a stream and playing with the streamer + 10 other viewers on TS. This game is rlly a lot of fun and even though i ignored it a bit due to the server not showing issue i have been playing this quite frequently again. Basically you´re given a target wich u need to hunt down while killing it with an object ranging ffrom an umbrella to a machinegun. The idea is to not get caught by the camera's or guards doing it else u will get arrested [wich u can get killed in there as well if ur unlucky] prety simple right? Wrong not only is there a time limit to it but the object u kill the target with based on the object kill list [highest ranked object gives most cash] matters and u have to deal with hunger, thirst, sleep, hygiene and the occasional toilet visits as well to keep ur character from dying. And the biggest treath is that you are beign HUNTED as well :O. So kill ur target and escape from ur killer till timer runs out and gratz u won the first time now try to get on top of the list till u win the whole round] I highly recommend playing the tutorial first as it rlly gives u a idea on how everything works[takes like 10mins max] .  If u can get past that i wil guarantee u will have a fun time wether playing solo or with friends.			"

												The ship is a very interesting idea for the game. It has potential to be somehting GREAT. When you buy this game, you will find three new games in your library (The Ship, The Ship Single Player, The Ship Tutorial) - I will go over each one.The Ship is the heart and soul of the game, and is what could be amazing about it. Basically, all the players have a ""mark"" on one of the other players, but nobody knows who you're hunting which can provide interesting scenarios. To spice things up, you cannot kill or even bear a weapon while being watched by civilians, guards or cameras. This means, you could lure a potential hunter into a trap! This sense of an almost ""stalemate"" makes things very interesting and with enough dedicated players could make this one of the most interesting and enjoyable games here. The problem is, the servers are down so you have to manually join servers - not too big a hassle, but it is definitely inconvenient, especially when trying to play with friends. Also, from what I've seen, not too many active player hosted servers.I expected the Ship Single player to be the same as online except with bots - essentially be a ""training area"" for noobies. It is instead, a very short campaign with no options to play ""multiplayer except with bots"" unfortnately. Like I said, the campaign is very short, it is unrewarding, has annoying voice acting and is terribly unrewarding. The ""levels"" if you want to call them that can be too easy or ridiculously unfair out of nowehere. The most annoying part is one slip up (even if just caught with a weapon) all the progress yo made in that level is restarted, which means more walking across the ship to talk to the annoying sounding characters. Campaign can be beaten in about 1 to 2 hours depending on how fast you are at it, and if you want to ""role play"" or not. The game also has really annoying mechanics. You have various needs sor tof like a sim game, which would be fine, if they didn't randomly have to be upkept every two seconds. The most annoying is the ""sprinting"" in this game, which is the alternative to walking very slowly. The so called ""sprinting"" is tremendously slow and runs out of energy almost immediately. You get about 2 seconds max at sprinting to then have to wait for about 10+ seconds before you can do it again. The killing animations are hilarious, so killing other players is the highlight of the game, to be honest, which seems to be lacking in variety in the campaign - hence why the multiplayer could be so good!The tutorial is short lasting, covers all the mechanics of the game and is pretty important to ""play"" just to make sure you know what you're doing. Why the three games weren't integrated as one, I'll never know. The tutorial speaker, however, talks incredibly slow and waits long amounts of time before going on to the next thing she needs to say - this gets annoying very fast.I know it sounds like I am just complaining about the game - which hoenstly my review is mostly that. With that said it is not a terrible game and when on sale for 5$ I think this is one everyone should pick up. BUT PLEASE PUT THE SERVERS BACK UP DEVS. This game has gret potential and I know it can be enjoyable despite the annoyances. At its current state, however, I cannot recommend it.+GREAT potential in multiplayer+Funny killing animations-Outdated graphics-Annoying mechanics (read review)-Servers not up in-game			"

												I don't get how people stand to play this. It's way too buggy, the hallways can only fit 1 person in 1 direction.

												Whenever I bought this game, I was expecting a game where I WAS the ship, attempting to murder my passengers by ramming into an iceberg at 420 miles per hour.

												I received a low-threat prisoner, so I didn't pay much attention to him. How wrong I was..It was a normal, average day. The prisoners were eating their lunch.. then it happened.He attacked from the shadows.Prisoner ""Leeroy jenkins"" viciously started stabbing my guards with his plastic fork. It was 5 against one.He'll never win, I thought.He'll never escape, I thought.He'll never survive, I thought.I thought wrong.He managed to start a full-scale riot, him and his army of offenders. They broke all 7 of my steel doors with their bare fists, escaping into the yard. They were almost out. I quickly hired God-knows-how-many dog handlers, in a valiant effort to hold them back until the authorities get here. I managed to keep the tsunami of prisoners back, put the prison on lockdown and finally the armed police got here.I did it, I stopped the riot.But then I saw that one particular cell was empty. Then I realized..LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEROOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEENKINS!54/11 would plastic fork again.			"

												The game is okay - the multiplayer MASTER SERVER is no longer available and you have to use a different way in order to play multiplayer - Multiplayer can be fun but also frusting on the same time - you have to find items - weapons, disguise, food, stuff like that - most annoyingpart is probaly the blocking by other characters in the game - You have to find your target which is randomly given and you have to kill him.You get money ( which is points and u can buy some food with it) from the kill and the weapon will have effect on how much u get. Usually a weaker weapon grants you more money, but the money keep changing overtime.You have to becareful, you will be a target for someone else too.You can't kill a target if security sees you, or else you will be send in jail.If you are familiar wth THE SIMS, like ""peeing, sleeping,fun"" everything in THE SIMS si also in this game, The idea is nice but its just sad there are no MASTER SERVERS anymore.Graphics is ok for this game. not too HIGH qualityill give this a 6/10			"

												The game is really good, engine is cool if you look that this game was made in 2006, graphis are nice. Great to play with friends but there are some shortcomings. Multiplayer is not so great, because you cannot connect so easy to multiplayer, but you can play it with you're friends, as well, when i bought game i spare of that 2 game's for free, so that is really nice of them!9/10, gj!

												The Ship is an incredibly fun game ! And it really is fun - it is not the victory of each round that makes it fun, it is the actual gameplay! - if you win it is just ""hey, I won"". It is not the victory, but the gameplay, that makes this game worth playing - you can easily spend 2-4 hours playing it. I did try to up the resolution to 1600x900, but then some of the fun went away - it the characters are a bit pointy, it makes the game more fun, more cartoonish you might say.The Ship is a fantastisc game, no doubt about that, and it is really worth buying! the singleplayer part is both short and a bit boring, but the multiplayer part is so much fun!A must buy!

												Love killing? Great! Well not really, but great for the ship! This game is one of the best murder games I have ever seen. It is made for you to gather the right weapons to kill other players! Many servers, many players! This game may have a couple of the mild glitches and bugs, but what the hey! It is a old game! What can you expect from a game like that! For a cheap price, I say it is a great game to have fun with a couple of old friends! Killing is always good! Right? Well in games that is! :D~~~~OVER ALL~~~~Pros: Great Graphics for this game's time period.Many Weapons.Many Servers, with many players.Great Game play.Many Maps.First-Person Shooter.Great Deal.Humanisitic Daily needs added. Cons: Couple Bugs and Glitches.Movement may be annoying.Rage Inducing.Violence intended.Guns have no recoil. "

												This is an amazing game with the best multiplayer gameplay I know of. It's also fun to play against computer just because of the A.I.'s stupidity. EXAMPLE TIME! When playing arcade mode (against computer) you will often find A.I. characters crouching down in the middle of a room with their weapon out. They will most likely get caught by police, sent to jail, and get blown up when they get out due to you placing a wallet bomb at the jail exit. *Insert nerd-laugh here*			"

												A wonderful idea for an FPS - you are set to kill a single person, but you have no idea who is out to kill you. However, the main server is down and you have to work around to find a server - which usually only has one or two proper players on, and while playing with computers is fun, they can sometimes be a bit stupid. Still, it is very fun, especially having to keep track of all your character's needs, so it is worth buying.			"

												I saw Nerdcubed play it, asked a friend if I could get a copy, and he gave me one.It was not a mistake installing this game. Story - 2/5You are on a ship, (duh) lost at sea. You are hundreds of miles away from your last recorded position, and a villan as set up a little game. People are hunting eachother, in an attempt to be the last person standing. No real story other then that, the meat of this game is in the gameplay. Gameplay - 5/5You have a variate of weapons to complete your goals. (I.e, killing your target.) Axes, walletbombs, shanks, e.t.cIn the standard gamemode, you have a target, and you are targeted by someone. In a certain amount of time, you must kill your target without being killed or caught. You also have needs, such as bathing, eating, using the restroom, e.t.c. Its both fun playing with bots, and online.Multiplayer - 5/5Look at gameplay and story, but with your friends.Trust no one.AI - 4/5The AI is a bit questionable. You can easily find your hunter by watching them run at you, (Straight at you.)They often can get stuck behind doors, and dont often fight back. Extra -All the weapons are extremely well made for certain situations. Got a long hallway without anything to catch you? Use a axe or other blunt weapon. Need to set a quick trap? Use a wallet bomb. Have a short space, and need to quickly kill your target? Use posion, or a sleep syringe and a quick melee attack.Extremely fun on multiplayer and singleplayer.Would I recommend?Of course.Overal rating -4/5 "

												The ship is a great game. I enjoy it more with friends. The situations where your quarry is in prison, and your'e waiting outside the door, waiting to pounce, when suddenly, your hunter jumps in with a blunderbuss and blows your guts all over the outside of the release office, and the cops don't notice, because your hunter isn't in the cameras view. There is just pure satisfaction when you find a tommy gun on the closet, or the teasing, agonizing feeling that you get when your quarry is right next to you, but there are too many witnesses. The ""needs"" system is a great addition, but it's really annoying when you pass out or waz yourself right behind your quarry. (9.5/10)			"

												The tutorial is wonderfully made.A well laid out how to play and suggestions both fro single and multiplayer.Single playerThe storyline was well linked, though I think the map being player oriented would have made it easier to navigate.The quarry was too easy to find to me, and i never encountered my own hunter so it didnt feel so much as a deathmatchMultiplayer/ArcadeArcade mode was the best to me, the NPCs weren't very easy to beat  and made for a better game. Did not appreciate when kept being arrested for pulling out my weapon in an empty bathroom.as for multiplayer i am so disapointed. I live just north of Venezuela and i have no access to any games.Even if i leave all the options open I don't see any online games, nor can find a way to join any games. i bought this games with the sole intent to play online and that is the one thing i cannot do. i have checked on multiple occasions just in case there was maintenance an there is no change at all.

												The Ship is one of those games you just don't know what to do with. It's a stratagy game at it's core. You are given a quary (either another player or computer) and someone is hunting you (player/PC). You must explore the various ships to find weapons and kill your quary without getting caught. Sounds pretty simple, right? Well toss in the ""needs"" mechanic very popular with The Sims series, this requires you to find food, bathe, sleep, socialize, and entertain yourself. As long as you have a group of friends to play it with, this is a very interesting game with a hystarical soundtrack based in the 20's.			"

												My Rating-: 10/10I think this is a great game, i love to play it with friends.  Gameplay is good and the graphics are top hit! If single player, you can form a server or join one, and you can choose a choice between a variety of different great maps. The tutorial and the story is really good and well-built. In this game, you can be a hunter, and have to hunt down your quarry. There are hidden weapons in the map, giving you a money salary for a kill. People can hunt you down aswelk so be careful when you try to hunt down your quarry! The tutorial will describe the game to you more! Cheap game and worth buying i say!			"

It puts you aganist other shipmates in hunt gamemodes were you have to kill a target with an array of weapons from a Frying Pan to a Tommy Gun, while your hunter is hunting you. The needs system also adds to the atomsphere making awkward situations and funny moments. Like Assasin Creed's multiplayer just with a silly side of things.8.5/10			"

												Fun game. but you must add servers manually. The game was abandonded a couple of years back but still functions very well. You must kill with the weapon that is of most worth, and kill a specific individual before you yourself is hunted down. Avoid cameras, security and witnesses. Eat, drink, socialize, clean yourself and play to keep yourself fit and sane enough for your involuntary murder spree. The turotial/singel-player is difficult and very fun. I suggest gaming with friends for that extra ""nuh uh, im not hunting you *grin*"" situation			"

												In a few words: ""Counter-Strike: Intelligent Warfare"". Set in 1920-1930s you are on the ship with other players (or bots) and you are...um...bored, I guess :D . Coz you participate in a game where you are the hunter and the hunted. You gotta kill and not be killed. Make it ""le intellegent"" way: use huge number of various weapons, don't forget to eat, sleep, read, take shower - you are human after all %)Very much underestimated game concept reincarnated once again in Bloody Good Time later. Not your ordinary shooter for sure.			"

												The Ship is quite a fascinating game... well, if brutally murdering people with umbrellas and having a heart attack when someone snipes you is your thing. If you like all these things, then take a ride on The Ship! There is some definite comedy, strategy, and horror within this beauty of game design. You may say, ""well, it's quite outdated, don't you think?"" Why HELL NO! It's a bit old, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to murder someone with an axe... >:)			"

												The Ship is one of those games you just don't know what to do with. It's a stratagy game at it's core. You are given a quary (either another player or computer) and someone is hunting you (player/PC). You must explore the various ships to find weapons and kill your quary without getting caught. Sounds pretty simple, right? Well toss in the ""needs"" mechanic very popular with The Sims series, this requires you to find food, bathe, sleep, socialize, and entertain yourself. As long as you have a group of friends to play it with, this is a very interesting game with a hystarical soundtrack based in the 20's.			"

												The Ship is one of the most interesting multiplayer games I've played. Instead of running around and killing everyone, you're tasked with tracking down a single opponent (and avoiding the player who is out for you), all the while taking care of your personal needs, such as sleeping and eating. What results is a tense, exciting game with a great atmosphere of paranoia. Is that guy after me or just passing by? The gameplay encourages you to switch up your tactics by giving a higher payout for using certain weapons (the winner at the end is the player with the most money), and there are times when forgoing hunting down your enemy in order to track down a good weapon are in order. If I had one complaint about this game, it would be that the ships in the game have many narrow corridors, causing annoying traffic jams. With that said, The Ship is a unique, interesting game you should seek out. The playerbase isn't huge, but there's always enough people to have a decent game.			"

												The Ship is quite a fascinating game... well, if brutally murdering people with umbrellas and having a heart attack when someone snipes you is your thing. If you like all these things, then take a ride on The Ship! There is some definite comedy, strategy, and horror within this beauty of game design. You may say, ""well, it's quite outdated, don't you think?"" Why HELL NO! It's a bit old, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun to murder someone with an axe... >:)			"

												The tutorial is wonderfully made.A well laid out how to play and suggestions both fro single and multiplayer.Single playerThe storyline was well linked, though I think the map being player oriented would have made it easier to navigate.The quarry was too easy to find to me, and i never encountered my own hunter so it didnt feel so much as a deathmatchMultiplayer/ArcadeArcade mode was the best to me, the NPCs weren't very easy to beat  and made for a better game. Did not appreciate when kept being arrested for pulling out my weapon in an empty bathroom.as for multiplayer i am so disapointed. I live just north of Venezuela and i have no access to any games.Even if i leave all the options open I don't see any online games, nor can find a way to join any games. i bought this games with the sole intent to play online and that is the one thing i cannot do. i have checked on multiple occasions just in case there was maintenance an there is no change at all. Would not recommend unless you have friends that can play on WLAN with you			"

It's fun to go after each other sometimes but almost every time gets really annoying because you know exactly who to expect.			"

This is what I really wanted from 'The Ship'!The original single-player game is a pain in the drain! I could never kill that dude before he wacked the old guy in the wheelchair (and who cares?!)'The Ship: Murder Party' finally puts things in order! Now, single-player is simply offline-with-bots - just like CS, baby! And it works GREAT! TONS OF FUN!!!Originally posted by Redey59:""The master server is down, so the new way of joining servers is by ""searching"" for em, though there are probably more site's that do this, the 1 i use is http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/After doing that, you can choose between servers, click on 1 of those server names.If done correctly you should see a green line of numbers at the top left, copy that line.Then, inside ""The Ship"" you need to activate the devolper console. (its the same as in all other half-life 2 games so feel free to skip this part if you know how to enable it already)-Go to ""Engine Room"" (this is the ""options"" menu here)-Select Keyboard-Select Advanced-tick ""enable developer console"" onNow, back to the reason why you copy'd that line of numbers a while earlier, press on the ` key (this is to the left of the ""1""/Under escape/Above tabYou should see a box pop up, in this box type :Connect ""the line of numbers""i.eConnect 789.489.495.228;27015Now you are on your way to a multiplayer server :)Thanks for reading, i made this guide becouse i want to avoid the massive amount of questions at the ""disccussions"" tab, which is why there are not any strategies or tips here.Edit: you can also go to the ""favorites"" tab in the server browser and then press ""add server"", if you type the IP there it will stay there forever, removing the entire process of going to the site and such. (thanks for the tip: Flaming Waffle and Tyrak)Edit2: You can also look at all available servers in the steam client by going to: View > Servers > Change the filter for ""Game"" into ""The ship"", this will then also show a list, rightclicking on a server and then looking at its server info will then give you the IP of that server.""THIS IS COOL: at one point, I decided to play as a passenger, so I could just get a look and feel for the game. As a 'passenger' rather than a 'hunter', I couldn't carry weapons (and you can be killed) but I had freedom to explore the maps and then discovered that you are basically a mobile security cam! For over an hour, I followed 'hunter players' around, freaking them out and faking them out (they don't know who's after them). If they do something whle you're watching they go to jail. One dude didn't play that and wacked me fast. I was laughing my a$$ off (which is dangerous since I don't have much to begin with)!!!10/10 would get viciously killed acting a fool, again! "

												A word of warning for those looking to play this game online. The servers don't show up by default. There are servers but you have to search for them by entering the IP Address under the favorites tab or by using the console.That being said, there is still singleplayer and arcade mode. Arcade mode is simply multiplayer but with bots. The AI isn't that good at hunting though. I've gone whole matches with no deaths and I highly doubt it's MY skill that's keeping me alive but the bot's lack of skill. The game itself has the potential to be fun but, alas, there's just no way to play with anyone else with the servers offline. If new servers ever come online, I imagine there'd be a nice and steady swarm of people lining up to join in.			"

												The ship is a great game. I enjoy it more with friends. The situations where your quarry is in prison, and your'e waiting outside the door, waiting to pounce, when suddenly, your hunter jumps in with a blunderbuss and blows your guts all over the outside of the release office, and the cops don't notice, because your hunter isn't in the cameras view. There is just pure satisfaction when you find a tommy gun on the closet, or the teasing, agonizing feeling that you get when your quarry is right next to you, but there are too many witnesses. The ""needs"" system is a great addition, but it's really annoying when you pass out or waz yourself right behind your quarry. (9.5/10)			"

TONS OF FUN!!!Originally posted by Redey59:""The master server is down, so the new way of joining servers is by ""searching"" for em, though there are probably more site's that do this, the 1 i use is http://www.gameserverdirectory.com/search/the-ship/After doing that, you can choose between servers, click on 1 of those server names.If done correctly you should see a green line of numbers at the top left, copy that line.Then, inside ""The Ship"" you need to activate the devolper console. (its the same as in all other half-life 2 games so feel free to skip this part if you know how to enable it already)-Go to ""Engine Room"" (this is the ""options"" menu here)-Select Keyboard-Select Advanced-tick ""enable developer console"" onNow, back to the reason why you copy'd that line of numbers a while earlier, press on the ` key (this is to the left of the ""1""/Under escape/Above tabYou should see a box pop up, in this box type :Connect ""the line of numbers""i.eConnect 789.489.495.228;27015Now you are on your way to a multiplayer server :)Thanks for reading, i made this guide becouse i want to avoid the massive amount of questions at the ""disccussions"" tab, which is why there are not any strategies or tips here.Edit: you can also go to the ""favorites"" tab in the server browser and then press ""add server"", if you type the IP there it will stay there forever, removing the entire process of going to the site and such. (thanks for the tip: Flaming Waffle and Tyrak)Edit2: You can also look at all available servers in the steam client by going to: View > Servers > Change the filter for ""Game"" into ""The ship"", this will then also show a list, rightclicking on a server and then looking at its server info will then give you the IP of that server.""THIS IS COOL: at one point, I decided to play as a passenger, so I could just get a look and feel for the game. As a 'passenger' rather than a 'hunter', I couldn't carry weapons (and you can be killed) but I had freedom to explore the maps and then discovered that you are basically a mobile security cam! For over an hour, I followed 'hunter players' around, freaking them out and faking them out (they don't know who's after them). If they do something whle you're watching they go to jail. One dude didn't play that and wacked me fast. I was laughing my a$$ off (which is dangerous since I don't have much to begin with)!!!10/10 would get viciously killed acting a fool, again! "

												A word of warning for those looking to play this game online. The servers don't show up by default. There are servers but you have to search for them by entering the IP Address under the favorites tab or by using the console.That being said, there is still singleplayer and arcade mode. Arcade mode is simply multiplayer but with bots. The AI isn't that good at hunting though. I've gone whole matches with no deaths and I highly doubt it's MY skill that's keeping me alive but the bot's lack of skill. The game itself has the potential to be fun but, alas, there's just no way to play with anyone else with the servers offline. If new servers ever come online, I imagine there'd be a nice and steady swarm of people lining up to join in.			"

												Super fun game when you can play with friends, notice the ""s"" on friends because playing with one friend isn't so fun. Your or his/her's target is always one another even though the lobby you're in has 15 other NPCs playing. It's fun to go after each other sometimes but almost every time gets really annoying because you know exactly who to expect.			"

												While the game is more like a hunt and not a murder mystery it is still fun, when someone is killed nobody tries to find out who did it. As nobody cares.... You just need to camp in a room til the person you are trying to kill walks in or someone trying to kill you walks in, or do what I do and run around and kill everyone. However you will be banned for an hour when you get too low and money (You lose money when you kill innocent people).			"

												It was kind of fun with friends... I guess. Betrayal, mindgames, murder. Clue-like. But kind of boring as well, i'm not sure why...more depth, abilities, or environment interaction would be neat? Not much motivation to play or kill other than silly shenanigans, got old quick, personally. But perhaps YMMV. Similar in theory to the mod 'the Hunted'.

												How do you make a game with this much potential, then fail to fix the easy stuff that would allow people to actually play it?I like this game and it does have great potential, and that makes the disappointment that much worse. Developers: why are the simplest of things broken? Seriously. First of all, the single player campaign is not worth the money. It is far too short. Secondly, good luck getting into a multiplayer game with other people. You can't join a server from in-game. This seemingly simple mechanism is broken and apparently the developers could are less to address it (as evidenced by long threads complaining about it). I figured out that you can actually retrieve a server list within steam, which had me excited right up until every single server in the list returned a ""server not responding"" error message. I have tried to get into a game for 3 days now and I'm hanging it up at this point. With so many great games on steam, dont' waste your time on this one.			"

												The ship is one of these games that you should consider owning simply because it is such a classic title. It is starting to show a little bit of it's age but the cartoony style helps.This is basically the multiplayer game equivalent of a murder party turned FPS game, you only have one quarry per round, but knowing that someone is after you and that it is the only other person that you may kill without repercussion adds a healthy dose of paranoya to the mix.The game throws in a fair bit of deception too, change clothes to lose the trail of your killer, the maps are rigged with a few original traps and secret passages, And there are a few tools for the crafty players, such as sleeping drugs and wallet bombs.There are maps of various sizes that will accomodate a good variety of players (unlike a lot of games this is sort of important on the ship) and it also has ""passenger bot support"" which can help to add a ""bulk"" of innocents if you lack in player volume. Bots can also be hunters but they are pretty poor at this job.			"

												This game does not have dedicated servers to play. This means the average person cannot play with their friends over the internet.EDIT: Thank you Tiveran. In order to access the servers you must find them OUTSIDE the game. Please see Tiveran's directions. This game seems like fun with friends, I have not had a chance to test ti much. I will leave this review as negative for other people with the same problem.			"

Of course you can still use the singleplayer and coop feature, but its false advertising. Whats even worse is that the only alternative is a buggy remastered version with donald trump in it, who the f** wants to see donald trump in a game?

												To start, I really liked the single player but it gets boring cause of the lack of checkpoints....The multiplayer is good cause the bots wouldnt kill if you for no reason, but if you find a server(these days there are no servers)most people would randomly kill you and the severs usually have around 3-10 players and if u wanna play it with friends its gonna take a whole lot of pain and time but its kinda worth itI liked the graphics but it lacks some kind of life, its really dull, even though they are in the 20's or 30's! The most thing I hated in this game is that if your holding a hammer they will arrest,would they really arrest you in a real ship if you were holding a hammer, they need to make weps u dont get arrested for holding(but when you hit someone with them you get arrested of course)I liked the gameplay alot because its something new, some people say its like TTT for gmod, it is absoulutely not, it takes some kind of idea but it totally isnt the same, cause u know that everybody is is a murder but you dont know if he is gonna kill you!The last thing is that this game is for 20$ F**CKING DOLLARS! I bought this game when it was on sale, I totally wouldnt buy it for 20$, most peps also wont do it(that may be a reason to why most servers are empty)So overall, I would give this game a rating of 4/10			"

												Want to be an assassin on a boat that is far away from shore with all hands on board? Then this game is right for you. The game takes place in a boat that is not coming back to shore any time soon, and you are forced to play a game that you have become the hunted and the hunter. You have to track down your quarry and try to avoid the person that's his or her quarry. AND THAT'S YOU! After a few moments you now have to take care of your needs, which means you are in a Sims game (Sims is a game where your trying to take care of your family) and you have to take a bath, eat something, drink something, talk to people, go to the bathroom, have some fun, just about you would do to take care of yourself. Sure, you going to have to deal with this every time you play this game. But, don't worry, there's different game modes if you don't want to play hunter. This is like tag and hide and seek mixed to together. Only, your try to kill each other.			"

												I have been playing Tiger Woods '08 PC on a regular basis since it came out back in 2007. No modern game has come close. That is until this game was released. The graphics are top notch and very realistic. The addition of trees and bushes since last year improved the visuals a great deal. The graphic improvements will no doubt continue in the future with the possible addition of 3D blades of grass using Nvidia’s graphics technology.Online play is great with turn based multiplayer and the ability to play with up to 8 players. You can stop and resume your round at a later time. There are loads of different play modes available. If tournaments are your thing you can participate in many online. The game also has a cool replay feature that allows you to watch the last round from a number of different angles. Your opponent(s) can see the replays as well.Another big plus for the game is the freecam mode. Take a virtual tour of the entire game from every conceivable angle and soak in the wonderful immersion that this game provides.This game has lived up to its potential. Every update over the last year has shown improvement, especially the most recent update from last month. This community driven game will only get better in the months and years to come. Be sure to give it a try and you won't be disappointed.			"

												Want to be an assassin on a boat that is far away from shore with all hands on board? Then this game is right for you. The game takes place in a boat that is not coming back to shore any time soon, and you are forced to play a game that you have become the hunted and the hunter. You have to track down your quarry and try to avoid the person that's his or her quarry. AND THAT'S YOU! After a few moments you now have to take care of your needs, which means you are in a Sims game (Sims is a game where your trying to take care of your family) and you have to take a bath, eat something, drink something, talk to people, go to the bathroom, have some fun, just about you would do to take care of yourself. Sure, you going to have to deal with this every time you play this game. But, don't worry, there's different game modes if you don't want to play hunter. This is like tag and hide and seek mixed to together. Only, your try to kill each other.			"

												The game has lost its touch really.It's supposed to be a hunt and be hunted game, where you had to attempt a mix of stealth and brash stupidity in order to kill your quarry and not get killed yourself.Ever since the steam holiday sale, all the remaining servers have filled up with players who don't even know how to play the game and just run around killing everyone hoping they get who they're supposed to. It's just... gag. I can't even think of a word.			"

												The ship comes with both a singleplayer mode and a multiplayer mode but both are rather lacking. The singleplayer mode introduces you to the games basic mechanics but unintresting storyline and repetitive gameplay are not enough to make the game enjoyable. One problem I had with the game was that if you die you have to restart the level from the beginning rather than from the last objective. This led me to doing some chapters multiple times because they are long and I would end up dying near the end. The map is incoviently large and many times you have to spend most of the time just wandering around looking for where you're going.The multiplayer is not that great either. You cannot use the game to find servers and you have to do something complicated in the steam browser in order to find one. The multiplayer has a good concept- every player has someone to kill and someone who wants to kill them- but a lot of time it is hard enough to find the person that you are looking for, much less kill them. If you are playing with friends then the game might be more intresting but the game does not bring enough to the table to be something worth reccomending.Pros*Intresting Concept*More to the game than just killing( you need to manage hunger and cleanliness, etc.)*Whenyou buy it it gives you copies to send to your friends.Cons*Repetitive*It is too hard to find your way around the boat*Hard to find servers*Not very intresting			"

												The Ship is a relatively entertaining game, but is plagued by many flaws.It came out a while ago - 2006, in fact, and it does show its age, unfortunately. It's ""old-school"", but not in a nice way. It all feels just a little bit clunky and laboured while playing it, and that just wouldn't be tolerated if it came out today.Onto the game itself. I'll address the singleplayer first and foremost - it's pretty short and only lasts about an hour or two. It is intended to prepare you for the multiplayer, the main part of the game, but it's rather ineffective in doing so. You're never placed into a situation you would actually face in the multiplayer - mostly it's a case of go here, talk to this person, kill this guy, rinse and repeat (leaving out the occassional other trivial act). It doesn't help that the singleplayer is very frustrating at points and feels lazily done. To be honest, there's no real point in playing it.Now, the multiplayer. If you're reading this, I assume you understand the whole concept of the game. The concept does seem extremely entertaining. However, it's not executed as well as you would like. The maps are all too small for 24-32 players like the very few servers remaining are and you often find yourself cramped in rooms, getting blocked in corridors etc. The inclusion of security is poorly done - guards, cameras and witnesses seem to be just about everywhere meaning you rarely ever find a good opportunity to take out your quarry. You look to take out your target, only to realise there's a camera watching and you're arrested for pulling out your weapon. The needs system becomes tedious quickly - I can't be bothered going to the toilet or sleeping when I'm avoiding my hunter and searching for my quarry. You also only have 90 seconds for each round to kill your quarry, which is nowhere nearly enough time. The jail system is another major flaw in the game also - if you kill your quarry, you can deliberately get yourself arrested so as to be protected from the person hunting you. This can then also be undermined by your hunter deliberately putting themselves into jail and seeing if they can get the shank to take you out. There are plenty of other examples of things like this that just make you think ""That could have been done so much better"".It doesn't help that quite a number of people who play the game run around like headless chickens killing on sight as they are suspicious of anyone around them. Your enjoyment of this game is almost entirely based around other people and how they act - and when they act like they often do, it ruins it.And I still haven't mentioned the obvious yet - the game is pretty much dead. Servers are mainly filled with bots rather than players. The developers, Outerlight, don't even exist anymore so hopes of changes are nonexistent. However, there's a sequel on Greenlight that looks like it could be very good. Perhaps I'm not giving the game enough credit - it is relatively fun...for 15 to 20 minute periods. Then the same old flaws appear again and again and you just want to go and play something else. It's a real shame, because if this game had been much, much more polished and it had an active community these days I would have tons of fun with it. I got it for 70p on Bundlestars, and I don't really mind at that price. Let's hope for more in the sequel.			"

												The Ship is a very good game, don't get me wrong. It's a very good concept and it was executed well. However it gets boring after about an hour or so of gameplay, and after that point it really loses it's re-play factor. Yes, it is multiplayer and through that each game you play will be different, but at the same time it's basically all the same things. Everyone rushes around for the best weapons and then chaos ensues.If you're looking for a good game to screw around with friends on for a night, then if this is on sale pick it up. Otherwise I wouldn't spend money on it.			"

												Enjoyable... with a disclaimer.This game is very enjoyable, with a great art style and a fun concept: a bunch of people on a cruise-ship together must get weapons and battle each other to the death for a huge cash-prize.Sadly this game is not all roses and tommy-guns.One of the biggest flaws with this game is the 'mood' system, which feels like it was copy-pasted from 'The Sims', and shoehorned horribly into this game. The problem with it is that you must constantly maintain numerous personal issues like hunger, thirst, bladder, tiredness, etc... or else you will fall over dead. The big problem with this though is that it's so easy to cause these issues to spike, like how killing people makes you nervous and you need to talk to people to feel better, which is smart... but if you're in the middle of a cluster♥♥♥♥ of gunfire, and you kill too many people, your anxiety will skyrocket, you'll be frozen in place while your character has themselves a little crying break, leaving you open to any and all attacks for at least ten seconds.Overall the game is enjoyable, but it certainly has problems, and I mean MAJOR problems. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone on the basis that it takes a specific kind of person to enjoy it, so be sure you don't waste money on this game and instead find a friend who has it, and play their copy for a while.

Why would i die if i didnt socilize it makes no sense and all the camera make it very hard to kill which alone is fun but mixed in with all the other problems that occur to fast to even enjoy. The simple fun in killing someone is removed along with slow movement causes for length unneeded play time just dragging out the pain further dear developers speed up the people remove the socilize death and you have a ok game also add maps its hard to lear the areas			"

												The game is fun itself but I keep getting bored of it too quickly. Also, there are no multiplayer servers on the list, so the game devs decided to just forget about the list and make you go on websites to get server IP addresses to play. I'm not saying it's hard to do so, but still it would be a lot more convenient if we could use the server list that they put in the game.			"

												The Ship is like a more cartoony version of Assassins Creed multiplayer where you are assigned a target to kill, and certain weapons give you more money when used to kill your target. The gameplay is slow, tedious and otherwise quite dull. Nothing really happens. It's mildly better when played with friends but still wouldn't recommend it as it gets boring quickly.			"

												If you are actively trying to play this game in multiplayer, you are going to be immensely let down. The object is to  find and kill your target, all while evading your own pursuer; however, because this game is multiplayer, you are quite often going to walk into a room and get murdered because these are other people you are playing against and don't actually feel like playing a game. Essentially what this game comes down to is if you find a gun, you win the game because you can back away into an unobserved corner and kill anyone that even walks into the same area as you, or you are going to get murdered by someone who is neither your target nor your pursuer. This game has potential, but because this being played by other people, the entire fun and novelty is destroyed.			"

												Me and my friends enjoyed the game at first, but eventually, seeing as we're the only people on board besides dumb NPCs, noticed how easy it was to figure out who was going after who and how. The game gets boring quickly in single and multi-player. It could use some intelligent NPCs that you can hide amongest and plan differently is the biggest thing I can say about it. It was fun, but it needs more work.			"

												(This review was updated from its initial version to indicate that the game can be played via the Steam server browser. I still would not recommend the game right now because it's just too difficult to find a good server populated by humans instead of bots.)The Ship's core gameplay is interesting and fun for short bursts (now that I got it to work), but sadly the multiplayer community is almost nonexistent. This is probably because the in-game server browser is completely dead, and apparently the developers can't update their game at all because of licensing restrictions.A workaround using Steam's server browser is available (Steam Client > View > Servers > set filters for The Ship)) but it is clunky, unreliable, and has to be reset each time you start Steam.But even using that, there are barely any servers populated by real humans. Most are filled with bots. Of the 3 populated servers I could find, there were 10 total humans online. I've joined games where after a few rounds, all the people had left and I was left with all bots again. It's a sad state of affirs.I also didn't realize how old the game was (2006) when I bought it on a Steam sale in late 2014. It probably would've been a lot more fun in its heyday, with a fuller and more vibrant community.As it is, it might be worth it the pick the title up on sale for a few online rounds (if you're lucky), or if you have a few friends who are for sure into it, but otherwise I wouldn't bother unless they fix the multiplayer. It's fun, just not worth the headaches, IMO.			"

I still would not recommend the game right now because it's just too difficult to find a good server populated by humans instead of bots.)The Ship's core gameplay is interesting and fun for short bursts (now that I got it to work), but sadly the multiplayer community is almost nonexistent. This is probably because the in-game server browser is completely dead, and apparently the developers can't update their game at all because of licensing restrictions.A workaround using Steam's server browser is available (Steam Client > View > Servers > set filters for The Ship)) but it is clunky, unreliable, and has to be reset each time you start Steam.But even using that, there are barely any servers populated by real humans. Most are filled with bots. Of the 3 populated servers I could find, there were 10 total humans online. I've joined games where after a few rounds, all the people had left and I was left with all bots again. It's a sad state of affirs.I also didn't realize how old the game was (2006) when I bought it on a Steam sale in late 2014. It probably would've been a lot more fun in its heyday, with a fuller and more vibrant community.As it is, it might be worth it the pick the title up on sale for a few online rounds (if you're lucky), or if you have a few friends who are for sure into it, but otherwise I wouldn't bother unless they fix the multiplayer. It's fun, just not worth the headaches, IMO.			"

												So my friend saw this game on sale and it looked really awesome, the concept of the game sounded really cool.We even rushed to get Steam Wallet money when the sale of the game was supposed to end (Saturday) cause we were that exited to get it.We bought 4 copies of the game, and gifted the other 2 to our other friends.That's another thing to add to my list of regrets..The game's dead, bland, and boring.I imagined it was fun before, like a few months ago when it was apperently big.But now it basically feels lifelless.- Servers are practically empty- The game feels lifeless.- With friends it might be fun, but only for a really short period of time- I cannot imagine anyone playing this game for more than an hour.- To go online (Since the devs are done with the game) you have to go through Steam > View > Servers. which is way too much of a hassle.- It's not worth it, even on sale- IT WILL DISSAPOINT YOU, I can promise thatThankfully there's Steam Refunds :D~ Got all 4 games refunded :D~ But the time wasted... that's forever gone.

												The ship is unique in how many titles have taken from it in recent years. The gist is you have to assassinate another player on the map. The trick is that every character (including you) look very similar to all the NPCs on the map. Your also avoiding assassination yourself from another player.One of the recent Assassins Creed games took this concept almost verbatim, and it's likely more will follow suite. However while comparing The Ship on it's own merts it doesn't stand up any longer. The game hasn't aged well and it's community is long since extinct. It stands a curious piece of history from a bygon age of modding.			"

												This game is okay if you have some friends to play it with....here's a recipe for pancakes, enjoy!Ingredients:1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour3 tablespoons sugar1 tablespoon baking powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg2 large eggs, at room temperature1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as neededNow to make it1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.

												Don't let the hours I have spent on this game fool you. My account freaked out and no matter what I did, it just said I was in game for 60 hours straight. I really only spent about an hour in single player mode in this game, mostly because my multiplayer won't work for this game, which is a bummer. Multiplayer might be quite fun for this game, but this isn't multiplayer. This is single player.It's not that interesting. Kill people on a boat, and try to not get killed by someone else that's going after you. It'd be great for 10 bucks, but for 20?! That's just too much for this game. Again, the multiplayer seems like it would work, but if you're playing with NPC's while the story limps around while passing out from alchohol poisoning every couple minutes, then it's simply not worth it. The music gets repetitive, and the characters are cardboard cutouts of a vauge stereotype, or typical character. ""The Bad Guy"", ""The Bartender"", and ""That French Guy"" are all you really get from these people.Don't buy this game, unless your friend want's to play it against you on multiplayer, because like I've said so many times already in this review: I can see the concept and gameplay being very entertaining when playing it against your friends. I wish I could delete it from my hours played, but now people now think I'm an expert at ""The Ship"", when I really don't like it.Don't buy it if you have no other friends that have it is my final choice. If it was 10, then I'd say go for it, the multiplyer seems fun from videos i've seen online, and it might be worth it! But, there are so many other great games for 20 on Steam. Go buy Portal 2,  or get a fancy hat in TF2 or something instead.			"

												I really do love the concept of this game. Pretty sure playing this game with friends would be awesome, but playing it on your own (as I do) is not much fun.When you buy this game, you get three files in your library:The first one is a tutorial, which consists out of the player standing in a bedroom and getting instructions. Nothing more.The second one is The Ship Single Player, which I really liked at first, but the lack of checkpoints make it rather tedious to complete.And last but certainly not least; The Ship, for your arcade and multiplayer desires. Arcade is pretty nice, though filled with AIs. I was expecting a real challenge when I started up my first multiplayer game, but I won it easily.Besides all of that, there are two more things I'd like to address.Firstly, I bought the game during a sale, and I think the price I paid was good. Looking at it off-sale and seeing it costing €20 (or €19,99 but cmon) kinda irks me. It's not a bad game, but not worth that much in my opinion.Secondly, if you buy the game, you get an extra 2 copies to gift to friends. If you gift a copy to a friend, said friend gets another copy to gift, thus creating a seeminly endless stream of copies, making it rather silly to buy the game for any price. Cheapskates unite ;DSo yeah, if you're looking for a fun game to play, I'd say get somebody to gift it to you give it a try! However, if you're looking for a challenge, you might want to keep looking.			"

												First off, this ♥♥♥♥ing game is broken. I don't care that there are guides to getting into servers. This game came out in 2006. For ♥♥♥♥s sake please fix this ♥♥♥♥ing server♥♥♥♥♥♥ I want to be able to play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game without having to lead my friends through a maze of links and Steam guides. It's not as fun as you would think. Second, this game is frustrating. Everything about this game wants you to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off. The map is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible. I cannot count the amount of times I have looked at it trying to find my quarry only to go the opposite direction. Your needs are annoying. The time in which you have to hunt your quarry is too short. And I'm not talking about custom servers. I mean the default settings. The combat is awkward. It comes down to clicking the attack button as fast as you can and pray ♥♥♥♥ING PRAY it doesn’t turn into an awkward affair. Getting more than three kills is unlikely.  The A.I is ♥♥♥♥ing abysmal (don't even consider single player). If you aren’t smart with your killing there is no way of winning. Oftentimes it is the player who kills the smartest that rules the map. Not the one with the most kills. The penalties for doing♥♥♥♥♥♥wrong are steep. Your quarry becomes unkillable if the ♥♥♥♥er decides to stand next to a guard. If you do try you are sent to jail for a minute or so giving you ample time to deal with your needs.  If you aren’t a retard with killing there are times in between rounds where you're doing ♥♥♥♥ing nothing waiting for the next round. The atmosphere is bland. It's like they were too lazy to go all the way with this roaring twenties aesthetic. Or they retextured normal ship interiors. That's the only explanation I can come up with for the fact that there are security cameras.  Animations are stiff but the models themselves succeed in their goal of being cartoonish. On the up side it's certainly different than a lot of other♥♥♥♥♥♥out there. It’s a good game concept wise. A murder dinner party game where you must take care of your needs while hunting your prey while being hunted yourself. Unfortunately it didn’t quite come together so well. A Steampunk themed sequel titled The Ship: Full Steam Ahead is listed on Steam Greenlight. Maybe it will be better whenever it comes out.			"

												This game is alright. It provides a solid [online] experience with well implemented mechanics and generally fun gameplay. But that's it. Expect nothing more than a very simple stealth/crime game that you play with your friends on occassion. On top of the meh gameplay experience, it seems the developers of this game have no idea what they're doing. It's highly overpriced at 20 dollars, and the only reason me and many other people even have this is because other people gave copies to us. If you want a simply basic fun game to play with friends then this is for you, but PLEASE only buy this during a sale.			"

												I can't recommend this game. I can get past the outdated graphics, the glitchy gameplay, and the boring combat, but on top of that multiplayer is also far too challenging to set up. You have to set up your own servers, and there isn't really such a thing as queueing for a random game. This game was an utter disappointment, only buy this if you have the patience of a god.			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												This game sucks, a waste of time and money especially on the multiplayer one (murder party the servers don't even work). I feel bad for recommending this game to my friend I feel even more bad because my friend actually bought the game thinking it was good. If I knew that this game wasn't even going to work I would've never bought it let alone recommend it. If I could I would ask for a refund but sadly steam doesn't allow refunds(which really sucks a$$).~Sincerely a gamer who wasted money on this game and a YouTuber who will never be able to do gameplays on it with friends.P.S buy this game at your own risk, you've been warned. (I know that this is a very harsh and brutal review on it, but I honestly think this game needs some brutal honesty and criticism, like come on now, everyone needs that every now and then...)			"

												F.E.A.R. First Encounter Assault Recon is a survival horror first-person shooter developed by Monolith Productions and published by Sierra Entertainment. It was released on October 17, 2005, for Microsoft Windows,[1] and ported by Day 1 Studios to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[4] Timegate Studios has released two expansion packs, F.E.A.R. Extraction Point in October 2006,[5] and F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate in November 2007. A direct sequel titled F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin, was released in February 2009, and a second sequel, F.3.A.R., was released in June 2011, though it was developed by Day 1 Studios (now known as Wargaming Chicago-Baltimore), not by Monolith Productions.The game's story revolves around a supernatural phenomenon, which F.E.A.R.—a fictional special forces team—is called to contain. The player assumes the role of F.E.A.R.'s Point Man, who possesses superhuman reflexes, and must uncover the secrets of a paranormal menace in the form of a little girl.F.E.A.R. was well received by critics, scoring 89% on Game Rankings,[6] and The New York Times calling it ""as thrilling and involving as Half-Life.""[7] A ""Director's Edition"" DVD version of the game was also released. The DVD included a ""Making of"" documentary, a director's commentary, a short live-action prequel and the exclusive first episode of the promotional P.A.N.I.C.S. machinima. A related Dark Horse comic book was also packaged with the DVD. Along with the Director's Edition, F.E.A.R. Gold Edition was released. Gold Edition included the Director's Edition and Extraction Point. F.E.A.R. Platinum Edition features the original game and two expansion packs.			"

												The Ship's only flaw is the fact that so few people play it online anymore. But with the single player and arcade modes just as fun as multiplayer, that is a small qualm. Definitely one of the most innovative and orginal games out there, The Ship will show you what it really means to be hunter and hunted.			"

												Great game for all silent assassins, who are willing to assasinate their shipmates with a large variety of different weapons, without being detected! You must also take a good care of your own character, since he/she needs to sleep, take a shower, eat, drink, take a pee, and every other elements that are common from The Sims -games.			"

												The Ship is an amazingly ambitious game that is half clue, half sims, and full on fun.  The object is to hunt your target while you yourself is also hunted, killing your target with a weapon out of view from prying eyes.  Expect mass paranoia and hillarity, best played with friends or on a lan.			"

Should I buy it?In short? YesThis game is largely a multiplayer PvP game, it has a single-player mode, but I haven't touched it. The premise of the game is pretty simple, you're a passenger on a boat, and you're engaging in a hunt. You've got a mark on your head, and you've got a target. Your goal? Kill your target before you're killed.There are many additional mechanics that hinder your progress. Certain weapons give more reward money, while others give less, these prices fluctuate. You can't be seen with your weapon out, or you'll get fined and incarcerated.On top of all this you'll also have to find your target, knowing only their last-seen location, and micro-manage your needs.The game is easy to pick up and play, but highly enjoyable and quite challenging. You definitely ought to pick it up.			"

												the reason I wouldn't reccomend this game is because it's too much a hastle to have to find the correct hamachi site, get things set up with frineds (which can take forever) such as IP, joining groups, getting the server to appear on their computer.. ect.The only reason I wouple play this is to enjoy a game with my friends, but that is a long shot at this rate. GREAT GAME once it's able t be played online though.			"

												Have you played GMod Murder? Ever wish it was on a boat and EVERYONE was the killer? Then The Ship is the game for you! All in all this game is really good fun, perfect for a group of friends, or you could always just find a normal server to play on. It's got a bit of a learning curve to it, but a tutorial (which unfortunately is a standalone program) is included to help get you playing without too much confusion.			"

												The Ship should be simply called The Sims in First Person and with Weapons.You got needs, such as drinking and eating and sleeping but also washing yourself and so on.Surrounded by that you're also a Killer, while getting hunted by someone who wants to kill you aswell.I for myself know that this Game can and is a lot of fun, but I refused to buy it before a second time because I thought the Servers are dead, which is not the case.Just hook up your Steamserver browser instead of going ingame and you find plenty of people still playing this Game.Go buy it, its worth the reduced 6,79€ more then most of the triple A titles currently.

												A fun murder game with a unique take on murder games (if any others exist.)My favorite mode is you are given the name of someone else to hunt, and you must track them down and kill them without arousing suspicion from them. At the same time, everyone else has been given someone else to hunt down (it could be you!) An optional system in the game is needs, which you must balance hunger, thirst, and other human needs with hunting.Overall, this game is extremely fun with other people, and buying the game includes two giftable copies to hand out to friends as well!

												Great game don't know why people don't think this game good. It's really fun and new way to learn some tracking skills. Only reason why most people think game dead is because they never learn to check the forum and find out that only way to find servers is to do it from Steam > View > Servers and filter to the ship. The problem may not get fix at all because Dev that made this game are gone and only way get to any server is from the filter. But over Great game I can recommend to anyone that into hide and seek to be hunter and/or hunted.			"

												set sail for adventure with the ship, the game where you assassinate george bush for money. the object of this game is to kill your perp before time runs out. its also a sims game with guns because your character apparently has to eat a bag of chips before they brutally murder someone with an umbrella or they need to wash their hands before the bash someone on the head with a lead pipe or even take a♥♥♥♥♥♥before they gun someone down with a tommy gun. its gets very tedious to make your person happy before you kill someone. however, you cant just grab any weapon. you gotta use the most expensive weapon, and when you do, the more money you get, the more you get closer to winning. all you have to do is find an expensive weapon, sit on a chair, then follow your perp and kill them. but its not that easy either, you gotta be elusive ans stuff and gets hard because everyone is suspicious. also another thing is that the servers do not work at all, so you gotta go into steam and do all that manual server search. nobody ever plays anyway. and most of the servers have killers who dont even care who they kill. toot oot			"

												The live action role playing game ""Assassin"" in video game form!It's tonnes of fun and worth a play- BUT!!!!!! Theres a few things you need to know.1. The master servers are down and the company that currently own the rights don't want to fix it (they legally can't either). So to join online games, you're going to have to start sharing IP addresses or just have this at a LAN party. Better yet, just skip that and go LAN with this. That where this game shines best.2. Including your copy complete with Single Player (shithouse) and Tutorial (which is worth a look before you start playing) you get 2 additional copies of the game to send to your friends and then they each get 1 additional copy to give to their friends. So all in all you're paying $20USD for 5 copies of the game, which sounds alright if you want all 5 copies in the one LAN session but on it's own is pathetic.It's worth checking out if you're one of those gamers who wants to try something unique.

												The Ship takes place on a cruise ship some time in the 1920s, where a number of unsuspecting passangers are forced to partake in Mr. Xs twisted game for his amusement.Players will be given a 'Quarry' Whom they must hunt down and  murder . But while you're hunting down your quarry, Someone else is hunting  YOU  down. But you can't simply shoot, shank, and bludgeon every last person who crosses path, because every kill that isn't your quarry or your hunter will incur a hefty cash penalty.Speaking of cash, there are plenty of shops, from clothing stores to food bars, and not only is cash going to be used in shops, but it's usually your goal to attain a certain amount of money in the ATM. How do you obtain this money you need? By murdering your quarry of course!But you're not just some main character who does what they like, you have needs! Hunger thirst, sleep, toiletry, cleanliness, entertainment, and social interaction are all obstacles for you to overcome whilst you try to murder people. If oyu don't know how to take care of these basic needs, then you MAY have failed as a human being.There are plenty of weapons, but if you think using the same weapon over and over is a good idea, you're wrong, for once a weapon is used, it goes to the bottom of the weapon list, and the longer a weapon goes unused, the more cash a quarry kill with it generates.The singleplayer sucks though, this is where it's at.

												Somewhat amusing for a while, but quickly turns dull after about an hour or so. A rather imaginative premise that has a short lifespan and gets repetitive very soon. This should have stayed a Half-Life mod. Finally, it has price tag about three times higher than what it should be, Honestly, save your money and buy something decent like Half-Life or Portal or something. Oh and the single player is a complete joke.			"

												I bought this a while ago through the ""Ship Compete Pack"" and was pleasently suprised that it came with extra copies. Those were promptly sent to my friends and before long we were engaging in all sorts of wonderfully nailbiting hunts aboard Mr. X's shipThe legit ""single player"" version is ok, serving as more a tutorial than any real purpose. The real fun comes when you play The Ship against Bots, or better yet your friends in LAN Connectionthen the error came (and apparently im unique in this complaint)For some reason or another it decided that it doesnt even like THINKING about multiplayer, and will crash HARD whenever I tried to do so. So naturally I contacted publisher with a generic ""WTF"" email. The publisher took 3 weeks and only said words to the effect of ""No clue whats going on, talk to steam"". Then i contacted steam and was promptly advised to contact the publisherEven after uninstalling it, reinstalling it, CCcleaning it, reinstalling it 5 total times... it has yet to fix the crippling bugSo while the game provides unending fun in both bot mode and multiplayer mode, the issue i experienced (and its decided lack of help) makes me regretfully unable to reccomend this game			"

												This is a very hard ""yes"" to say. When the game works, it's so damn fun! The thing is getting it to work. I have been playing this for little more than one hour and already experienced a rich array of the most varied bugs. Crash on loading, crash during the game, crash on exiting, freezes that makes you force close the application, the steam-can't-connect-to-master-server bug, every other time I launch the game I hear a splash screen (yes, you understood that right, I open the application and goes directly to the main menu, then I open again and I HEAR the splash screen but never see anything). The list goes on and on.So take my recommendation with that in mind.			"

												This is a ton of fun to play, especially with a bunch of friends in the same room. Never since the old days of LAN parties has there been so much taunting and trolling. The needs system adds an interesting dynamic to the game. Not only do you have to take care of yourself, but you can stalk your target until they need to satisfy their needs. This leads to a lot of murders while they're on the toilet. I never thought I'd say this, but murdering your friends is hilariously fun.			"

												I am very satisfied with the gameplay. If you like assasination and murder games, this is for you! Try and kill your quarry, but don't get caught! Also be careful your quarry doesn't kill you before you kill them. Don't kill anyone else but them, but remember, you're being hunted too! The only people you can kill besides your target are random noobs that attack you for absolutely no reason, and your hunter. This game is also hilarious when it comes to killing with all the interesting weapons! Whoever gains the most money in the end wins the hunt. But besides hunting, you have to take care of yourself too. You're only human. Eat, drink, bathe, entertain yourself, and do pretty much everything you would need to do in real life. It's like a combination of The Sims and murder games. Also, with your purchase you get TWO extra gifts to send to your Steam friends! Also, each friend who gets it will get yet another gift to send, but only one, not two. This game spreads like a plague! :P10/10Example of how this game gives you a smashin' good time from my own experience: I set fire to a man and finished him with an axe. While he was peeing.			"

												A who's-the-killer game that largely goes unnoticed, and has very few active servers.  Despite this, just getting a copy of the game gives you TWO FREE copies to share with your friends.  For $1 and three keys (when the game is on sale), you can't go wrong with a purchase. Now go hunt down your target, stab them with a poisoned syringe and make them throw up.  Shoot your intended murder in the face with a Winchester.  Then blow up the next guy you see with a purse bomb, and start a group of people on fire with a flare gun.  Then to celebrate your victory you can pee and take a bath in the game.			"

Really boring, but online gameplay is something special. When you are hunting someone you never met before, while being hunted by anon, it makes you adrenaline level rise, though, there is a problem with main server and you must acess public online servers via console, but still... Online experience does worth the money you will pay for this game. I do reccomend you to play it with a friend.			"

You have a decent arsenal of weapons to find throughout the environment in which to off your mark and the graphics, although dated, are surprisingly smooth given that the game was released in 2006. I have had ours of fun with this game and don't see myself getting bored anytime soon. Unfortunately the game isn't being updated any longer because the original devs (Outerlight) have disbanded, but there is a company that has bought the rights to the IP and plan on making a sequel from the ground up. So, good game; play it.			"

												The Ship is a combination of Assassin's Creed Multiplayer and The Sims. You need to hunt down and kill your given target, all the while not getting detected, or killed by another player and at the same time tend to your needs. This game can be pretty tense as you only have so much time to kill your target. You also need to bag as much money as possible; so you need to search for high money weapons. The amount of money you get for killing someone with a certain weapon varies. Some areas of a map are under surveillance so if you get caught you lose money, all your weapons and opportunities to kill your target. Other people will be out to get you too so keep watch, otherwise you lose everything in your inventory. Tending to your needs can be difficult as well; as you will spend a lot of time trying to find and kill your target. All of these gameplay mechanics make the game fairly tricky, but it is a good challenge and a very enjoyable game that I highly recommend.			"

I find myself a classy lady wearing the finest of dresses and swapping inbetween bathrooms, to hide that I secretly want to kill every man with glasses. I enter the mens restroom, unsure if this is a smart choice, I wonder into a stall, find a lead pipe, and bludgeon every person in the bathroom to death.

												'The Ship' might be one of the most unique and fun multiplayer experiences yet. Want to know where Assasin's Creed's excellent multiplayer came from? Step right up. (Also, the servers DO work. Look up online how to connect to them. Although, the A.I is actually pretty good, so you'll still have fun playing with bots) Perplexingly, the game is split into three seperate games. One is the tutotial, one is the singleplayer, and the other is the multiplayer. Why these can't just be lumped into one baffles me, but it doesn't really matter. Play the tutorial first, uninstall it, play the singleplayer, uninstall it, then just play the multiplayer from then on. The tutorial is straightforward enough, and the singleplayer is occasionally funny, yet mostly underwhelming. It's useful as an extended tutorial however, as it helps you work out how to manage your 'needs' and seek your target. The multiplayer is where it's at. Anyone who's ever been on a cruise-ship knows it's the most boring place in the world and you'll most likely develop utter contempt for anyone who's stuck on this tiny floating hellhole with you. So turning the whole thing into a cartoonish Agathe Christie 'stab-em-up' is curiously delightful. The 'Deathmatch' mode might be the most civilised deathmatch in gaming, as you take a break from murdering everyone with an umbrella to sip some tea at the cocktail bar whilst classical music blares; barely drowning the sound of utter carnage. The graphics are basic yet effective. The level-design is surprisingly excellent, with there being many hidey-holes and secret passages. The game also utilises the Source Engine - which is one of the reasons why this game has aged so well, along with the unique gameplay. If you keep checking on BundleStars.com, this game often goes for 70p (about a dollar) and it's more than worth it.			"
