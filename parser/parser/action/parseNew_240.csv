												why does this cost more than csgo?normal review: this is counter-strike.. you srsly need a review for counter-strike? this is an HD version of CS 1.6 sort of.. meanwhile CSGO is an HD version of CSS.. you can figure out how that works on your own because I have no idea. of course each version has their own differences, some of my classmates say that css is easier to play than cs 1.6 others say that cs 1.6 is better than this and csgo is probably just literally a cosmetic counter-strike..

												If you came here looking for a review, you have come to the wrong place, but if you want some bomb♥♥♥♥♥brownies, you have come to the right place. You're welcome for an actual recipe, not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ copy and paste pie recipe. Trust me nothing goes wrong with nutella.INGREDIENTS:1 c. unsalted butter2 c. sugar1/2 tsp. salt1 c. flour1 c. cocoa powder4 eggs1 (13-oz.) jar Nutella5 Ferrero Rocher candies, unwrapped and crumbledDIRECTIONS:1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.2. Melt butter in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Add sugar, stirring until combined. 3. Remove from heat and add salt, flour, and cocoa powder, stirring to combine. Whisk in eggs, stirring just until the mixture is combined into a batter. Set aside.4. Spray an 8""-x-8"" pan with cooking spray. Pour half of the batter into the pan. Spoon or lightly drizzle most of the Nutella on top of the batter, forming an even layer over the brownie batter. 5. 5. Use a spoon or silicone spatula to cover the Nutella with the remaining brownie batter. (If you pour the batter straight on top of the Nutella, it will sink into the Nutella and combine into one marbled—yet delicious—mess.)6. Bake until the top layer of brownies has browned and set, 28 to 30 minutes. It shouldn’t jiggle when you remove it from the oven. (The toothpick test doesn’t work here, since the toothpick will hit the Nutella layer, making the brownies seem uncooked.)7. Let cool for 15 to 20 minutes, then top with a drizzle of Nutella and crumbled Ferrero Rocher chocolates. Cut into squares and serve.Credits: ★ Billy			"

												If you like FPS a lot, this is a good game for you. I personally can't enjoy it too much as I'm a bad aimer, but there's still other gamemodes out there (Gun game, for example, but those are pretty aim-based as well). I can, however, definitely see what so much people like about this game.So, the conclusion, if you like FPS, are good at it, and don't mind some rage when you die, definitely get this.

												VOLVO, price this game 11$, dont be a b**ch! It will bring new players to communities and you still make money...BTW folks, CSS is much better then CSGO and more FUN! VOLVO is so affraid ppl will play it again [css $20 | csgo $15].What can I say but a big bloody L O LGuys seriously, this game is better then csgo, headshotting feels good actually in this game and it is more fun. It is more comic-like game, retro...decent graphics and great gameplay, also communities are relaxed...in csgo everyhting is so serious like omfg i deranked, who cares...it is just a videogame and should be played for fun. Thats why i stick with css, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥et, i dont spend money on skins...i install them for free from gamebanana.com. More over half of the csgo skins are just same thing different colors...in css you have different rifles and 1000s of skins that are custom made and each unique in its own way. Not to say that 60% csgo community servers are cancerous/racist places where you dont make any friends, only butthurt players that spent all their money on gambling skins and feel frustrated....in css you make lots of friends and you actually have fun.If you search good place to play css, check out my servers, www.awpclan.com   we kick azz ;)			"

I've played 1.6 and Source a lot when I was younger and I really wish I could put more hours into this, alas the future of Counter Strike is shaping to omething different. However when I wake up at 2 am in the morning without any sleeping. I'll get out of bed, power my pc, put on my headset and open up Counter Strike: Source. Just like when I was younger, and meet new people, play competitively, and love every bit of it. This game... aswell as 1.6 will forever hold a special place in my heart.			"

												The best game ever made. Period.Released in 2004Still playing in 2017I have so many hours in this game, so the 189.1 hours doesn't even do justice, because Steam didn't even track time back when I played a ton. When I started playing, I'm pretty sure Steam was only for Valve games at the time. Crazy to think now it is basically a central hub for almost all PC gaming.Cheers to this game and shaping my life through high school, college, and even till this day. I can't even count the amount of lan parties or keyboard funerals I attended.			"

												Ahh CS:Source.One of my personal faves ever since I was a child.First time I played it was around 2005 but didn't like it that much mostly because everyone was still playing 1.6.Which was at that time at least in my country, at the peak of its glory.Neverless all of that, this game still holds a special place in my heart.Playing many surf maps,zombie maps,deathruns with friends and many more.The body physics were the biggest attraction to CS:S for me.Source's graphics at that time were insane and people were surprised with it.Compared to CS:GO today it's very underrated but what can you do,people change through the years and so does their taste.As I said Source holds a very special place because of many memories I have of it.It already has enough reviews but this one is written purely for respect for this game.Thanks for the memories Valve.Final verdict 10/10 - Extremely recommended			"

												Obama had reformed the elite group Feel Team Six to track down and kill Barracka Bin Bama that had recently assassinated The President's dog (Dog's name here because im too lazy to look that♥♥♥♥♥♥up). Feel Team Six embarks on a journey all across Iraq, and Afghanistan to find the assassin Barrack Bin Bama. The search soon ends when Feel Team Six discovers Bin Bama has fled to the wasteland Australia otherwise known has ""Nope land"". At that point Feel Team Six had realized that Bin Bama had literally entered hell and decided to launch several nuclear strikes against the country because ""That place is worse than hell...and have you ever been kicked by a kangaroo? That's right, because everyone who has is dead!"" With the nukes Feel Team Six had effectively killed an estimated 23.3 million people. Feel Team Six could only assume Bin Bama had died in the nuclear blast and called it a day.			"

												Hello, cheeky chaps! For starters, what's the first thing that comes to mind when you saw this game? That's right, this isn't Call of Duty! This game is Country-Steak: Sauce and yes, it's a dank one, mate. Tesco's finest said so right on the package.First time playing, you're going to get mega wrecked and question yourself, ''How do I quickscope?''. If you're feeling down like the little, fedora wearing scrub that you are, why not get your noob butt popped with a solid, mint-condition bag of Doritos and to cool off your edgy skills with some Mountain Dew? Don't forget to even add in that inaudible dubstep that just adds passion and flare to your MLG gaming experience. If you repeat all of these actions, you just might have the chance to receive a granted entry into FaZe clan or a casting audition for the next special episode of EastEnders. Damn son, how does that sound and where'd you find this? You'll be the face of the MLG jubilee. Scrubs and hackers alike will all be wrecked by your hands, and may just in fact denote you as a cheeky Illuminati ninja, or possibly even a stupid autistic camper. As you can see, you're definitely around the corner from a notorious OpTiC application and a B&Q. By the way, check out my mate, Derrick on YouTube, if he reaches twenty subscribers, he'll do a dank giveaway. But if you don't, I'm afraid you will be eaten by the spooky scary skeletons and brought down to the depths of an Aldi's public urinal.This game has many different servers of I don't bloody know, ducky darling. So, be sure to check them out, mate, or not, I don't give a damn. But please, do not ever lie about what happens to you when you play this game, if you're caught hacking, lose all your weed and fedora and get a VAC ban, it's your fault, you dirty, dragon eating, little s-p-a-s-t-i-c. On a related note, be careful of hackers, not only are they noobs, but they will definitely steal your fresh swag and obey cap in the process.Make sure that there are no snipers creeping behind you, so you can easily deck them in their heads, with your mighty yet cheeky, 360 no' handscope, pimp slap, as you're followed by the blinding lense flare. The mechanics, noscopes, hardscopes and of course, the precious quickscopes in this game are so amazing, that it'll leave you screaming, ''Mum, get the camera!'' with joy, enthusiasm and adrenaline, as you easily hook all your opponents in their puny little gabbers. You're now the star with the inevitable saying, ''Watch this, lads.'' followed by only the kills a CoD global elite sniper could pull off. with every euphoric game that passes by, be sure to treat yourself to a quick blaze of a dank blunt, right around 4:20pm, with a wee giggle, typing in the Doritos, crust-infested keyboard, ''gg lads no re.'' never leave it as, ''sample text.'' As it will only just make them more edgy and make them beg for your Steam login as well as full access to your memes. Poopy hackers, don't talk crap to me online, or I'll ban you, my dad works for Colgate toothpaste.By the way, did I mention this game is great?This was brought to you by Tesco's everyday value tomato soup, with special thanks to Kelloggs' cereal for the weed flakes to help me write this review. They're so great, mate, only 20p each. Haha, Asda once tried to bribe me to not write my reviews, what a packet of Hob-knobs. Subscribe to my flaming channel, old chap, for Pete's sake and remember to give this review a like so my Nan's dead soul can finally rest in pepperoni, after getting shanked outside Sainsbury's.On a final ending note, got any crisps?

												Counter-Strike: Source is one of those classic games that don't go away that easily. This game is like the CLIMAX of the CS series since CS 1.4. I bet that most people knew about Counter-Strike because of this game. This game is well-polished, it did have bugs and glitches back then but it's gone after several updates. Even playing with just bots is fun to play (especially putting them on the highest difficulty. Aimbot and all).I still remember those early times of CS:S where you can't choose a ""soldier/mercenary"" to use, like just getting into the game with the same ""outfit"", which is the Phoenix and I think the ST6 (if I'm not mistaken). Also, this game had a shield once. It was fun to use but it was removed from the game.Well, this game might last for decades, I hope. Overall, it's a GREAT game. I can't even like make a minimalistic or a wide review for this game since it's just that good and memorable. Definitely will be played for years.NOTE: Yes, currently I have few hours of this game but I actually played the ""cracked/pirated"" version of it when I was 7, so if I add up all the hours back then and sum it all up with my current hours. I probably have a thousand hours (or almost) of game time (including offline times).If I have wrong grammars and comprehensions or any reactions, feel free to comment on my review. Thanks for reading.			"

												Even after 5000 hours I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite game. I started playing the game 2013 on a Zombie mod Server (Elite HunterZ) the best Zombie mod Server I've ever been playing on and since then I only played Zombie mod.After a short time I got interested in Bunnyhopping since it's needed and an advantage as Zombie. So I learned Bunnyhopping on Bunnyhop Servers, really fun and relaxing tho. Else than that I played some surf, joined AWP Servers and Deagle only.  There's actually one thing I really dislike when it comes up to the hitboxes..they just suck. And at least and last my opinion: Counter Strike Source is more dead since CS:GO got out. But just in return, players in CS:S ain't as much toxic as in CS:GO.I met less Cheaters in CS:S than CS:GO and I only played CS:GO for 300 hours at all. Plus you're not going to spend your money for Skins in CS:S. If you want custom weapon skins, get them from Gamebanana.  "

												Counter-Strike: SourceStory - It doesn't have one, but it has tons of servers with different gamemodes and if you play with bots, it's the normal hostage rescure or bomb defuse. I love it. 10/10Storyline Length - As long as you want, but each match shouldn't take you more than 4 minutes.AI - Ruthless. But they can't throw grenades for♥♥♥♥♥♥ 9/10Experience - You'll laugh, you'll rage, you'll yell ""SHUT UP"" at people playing bad music through the ingame voice chat. 10/10Graphics - It's from 2003 or 2004 (i don't remember) so I can't really say anything. But they're pretty good. 9/10Sounds / Voice Acting - You can choose. Between normal radio. And the bot's custom radio. The guns are bloody loud. And at the very end. You'll always hear the glorious ""(Counter) Terrorists Win!"" 10/10Controls - Just. Easy. You can learn them in literally 10 seconds. 10/10Overall - 10/10It's kinda hard to play multiplayer because everyone's either cheating or are just elites. If you want to go up against noobs, go play CS:GO. Regardless, you'll have a great time playing this game, playing with bots or with real people.

												Counter-Srike: SourceWell first of all, I played this first time ever just recently, I know I missed the old good CS:S times, better later than never, right? Everyone who has played Counter-Srike games knows how this game works, but something I have to say. This is a bit easier than Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and a lot easier than Counter-Strike 1.6. The community in this game is pretty nice towards others, I have to say that. Playing this on community servers like zombie hunting etc is really fun. This game is just so good, it has no over rated skins etc. It's made just to be played. I can not say anything negative about this, it is so perfect. My grade for this game is 9,5/10			"

												Counter-Strike has come a long way and to see this game really brings out how much it has come. I feel as this game is not just a time waster but a reason to still be on the Internet. But In 1999, I crawled out of Counter-Strike’s wretched ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to become the man I am today. And, now, I’m tasked with rating the game. How does one even rate his mother?In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other.In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class.

												Counter-Strike: Source did me wrong. Lost my life to this game, there was never a situation where I wasn't happy playing this game. You'll meet people on here that are better friends then the ones you have been friends with for your whole damn life. You won't be able to maintain any contact with the outside world you will lose everyone, and yet. You. Will. Not. Give. A. Single. FiretrUCK. You will lose your virginity to this game and no one can give you a better gift then having a video game as your first for everything. Because hell everybody knows you're not ever going to get the chance to 'do it' again. You will think of this game every moment of your life from the time you start playing it when you're sleeping, when you're eating, when you're brushing you're teeth, when you're taking a doozie, and especially when you're masturbating. In fact it will be the primary reason that you masturbate. This game is so damn good its wankable, FiretUCKable, and vegetable. Good s**t man. Good s**t. Remember to be healthy so you can continue playing this game for years to come and be sure to drink your  ovaltine!			"

I use it to get textures for Garry's Mod and Sometimes i play this game.Some good stuff about this game:-It has good sounds-Has very good bot AI-Is cheapBad things:-no ranks (makes it harded for new players)That's all i can say.The game is better than CS:GO in my opinion. You don't have ranks so you can play with players that are better than you. When you see a smurf it's not a smurf in this game it's a normal player, because there are no ranks. There are less hackers in this game and it's just perfect.I hope this review found helpful, or not.			"

												Its hard for me to review this game, becouse i really dont know if this is better than 1.6. They are both amazing games that allows the players to continue changing their experiences. Custom maps, skins, mods, i had so much fun playing this game... zombie,surf, jail, fy maps, the classics, i have tons of memories in this game. Global Offensive will never be better than this, trust me. The gameplay here is much more ""Counter Strike"" than GO. The graphics are obvsiouly oudated, but they are still good using the Source engine. If you read my GO review, you will see why i dont like Global Offensive : Valve. Yep, in my opinion Valve is ruining this franchise with the whole ""pay the game then pay more for skins"" to fully ""enjoy"" the experience. Thats why 1.6 and Source were more enjoyable than GO, becouse you buy the game and you dont have to pay more. If you want skins, download for free it or just build one yourself with the right tools. Source praises criativity, while GO praises CASH. While the ""Competitive"" mode introduced in GO make people think that the game is more serious now, it really isnt. There were professional championships in Source and 1.6 also. Therefore, Counter Strike became a classic that continues to shine everyday and will keep shining forever ;)			"

												Counter-Stike: Source is a game made by Valve and is a remake of the original Counter-Strike. I got this game on sale with the Source Multiplayer pack. This was my first game into the legendary Counter-Strike series.Pros:+ADDICTING Gameplay - This is what makes all CS games so fun. From the pluse pounding seconds of defusing a bomb with Terrorists hot on your tail, or the intensity of being the last man standing outnumbered by the opposite team where every move you make will determine whether you will clutch or be kicked.+Well Balanced guns - All the guns in this game are well balanced. Guns like the AWP or DEagle give you power but reduce your speed or mag size. All guns are good, you just need to master them+Fun Maps - All the maps in CS are fun. All maps are well balanced and don't really give one team an advantage over the other. +Community Maps - The Community maps are easy to access and a lot of fun.Cons:-...Overall, (10/10) CS: Source is a really fun game. This game will give you endless hours of fun, love, pain, and glory. Also, the game runs smoothly on my PC. If your PC can't run CS GO, then this is a great alternative.			"

												★ ★ ★ ★ -One of the greatest online multiplayer FPS games of the old and also most of the current generations, there is a single player mode to do a standard match with bots but the true value in this game is freely mod-able community servers, which has kept the game alive and feeling fresh to players for ages, i'd give it 5 stars but the only thing is its lacking in value if you dont have an internet connection all the time.            You can spend hours and days on end looking through the list of servers running all kinds of game modes, Jail Break, Gun Game, Zombie Escape, Zombie Riot, Surf, to name a few and even some servers that dont have anything to do with shooting, like MiniGames servers where its a course you have to maneuver through without falling.           Garrys Mod is an adaptation to CSS mixed with a little HL2 so if you like the other Source Engine games then CSS is for you, CS:GO has community servers as well but with all the hype of the ""matchmaking"" modes nobody even looks at the Mod servers, so if you like the gameplay change of community servers then CSS is for you, but if you like the standard style multiplayer matches like in Call of Duty then you probably wanna go for CS:Global Offensive.           I used to run an old laptop with a 2.14 Ghz single core AMD Sempron CPU and an AMD Radeon 4200 with 320MB with a 2x2 ft box fan on my table to cool the laptop, so if your systems a little better you should run things fine on all low settings as long as your system doesnt get too hot, and remember that with laptops and gaming heat is always your enemy.

												Counter Strike Source is a first person shooter game  that simply everyone should had played  its the basic *Easy Version of counter strike global offensive *  In Counter strike source the recoil is less and easier to hit and the deagle is just amazing  had much fun playing on zombie servers surf servers and some pcw   this is a game that was worth to buy  no money lost in the game, so if counter strike global offensive was to hard for you Counter strike source is the game for you =)Its still alot of servers to play on even if the game starting to be *Old*Decent hit detections  much better then cs go =)			"

												Ok, here are your options. You can buy this package and get three multiplayer games. Or you can buy the retail version of Half Life 2 and get Counter Strike:Source, Half Life 2 Deathmatch, and the story version of HL2. Basically, with this package versus HL2 retail, you will be trading the story version of HL2 for the multiplayer game Day of Defeat and whatever price difference there is.Now with that out of the way, I'd assume you are looking at this page because you are interested in Counter Strike: Source. Good choice. There is a reason CS:S is the number one online game in the world. The game is amazing......it's that simple.The game is set up around the premise of Terrorists vs. Counter-Terrorists. When you first join a server you choose which side you want to be on, the main difference being the weapons you will have access to. During the game each team has a different goal. One some levels the Terrorists have to plant a bomb while the Counter-Terrorists try to stop them. On other levels the Counter-Terrorists try to rescue some hostages while the Terrorists try to stop them. During each round you get 1 life. That's it! This means if you die you have to sit around and wait until the round is over. It's not a big deal though, the levels are generally small and well designed, and rounds don't usually last very long. Some of the positives of this system are that it discourages ""Rambo"" type play where people will just run around with guns blazing, of course some people still do that, but most people are more concerned about being careful with their life.The graphics in this game are amazing! All the particle, smoke and water effects are extremely well done. There is a reason the Source graphics engine is so popular and it shows in this game. If you don't have an up-to-date computer you may have to sacrifice some visuals for performance, but the Source engine scales quite well, so as long as you aren't years behind you should be able to find settings that work.A heads up to any parents up there, there is a good amount of blood in this game and obviously it is centered around shooting other people, so you may want to keep that in mind if you are purchasing for a kid.Now we move on to the actual gameplay. I already touched on the one life per round aspect of this game, but as a new player you should be prepared to die...... a lot! You will die over and over and you will never kill anyone. That is a fact, and if you are going to buy this game it would serve you well to just accept that right now. Having played First Person Shooters in the past will help a bit, but you will still be nothing but a bullet absorber when you first start out. The learning curve on this game is a bit steep, and there are many people out there who have been playing this game for years. They have the aiming system down to a science and know every level like the back of their hand. There is also a little weapon called the AWP, which is a sniper rifle you will get to know very well. Mainly by the amount of times you are killed by it. This is a one shot one kill weapon and there are some players out there who simply don't miss with it. Suffice to say it can be quit frustrating when you are constantly killed from 200 yards while you barely get a chance to even see who shot you.The point of all this is that it will require a bit of patience to learn this game and get to a skill level where you can be competitive. There is a neat little option where you can start your own server and fill it with ""bots"", which are computer controlled characters, and use this as practice. You can even set the difficulty level of the bots. While no AI can compete with human intelligence this is a good way to get better at the game and learn the levels if you are getting frustrated on real servers.Overall, it's a great game that is being updated constantly with new levels and features. If you can get past the learning curve you will be rewarded with a satisfying online shooter that you will be playing for years to come. If you are easily frustrated and do not want to put in the time it takes to get good at this game you may want to pass on this and try something else.			"

												This game is pretty great. I saw the trailer for it a while back, and was very hyped for it's release. The first thing I noticed while in game, however, was the fact there wasn't horse stealth. However, I did like the guns in this game. The best one being the stick with a scope on it. I think the best way to play this game is by drinking an entire 12 pack of Bud Lite beers. I often like to play this game while making love to my friend's cat while it's eating food out of his♥♥♥♥♥In all, I'd give this game a .16/7.			"

												You may have read reviews other than mine. Hell, you may even skip mine. You might have done it just now. But, let me tell you something.This game is amazing.There is SO much more to this game then CS:GO.Community is great, there are some REALLY good servers, it is 100% moddable (sounds, gun skins, maps, textures, enbs, etc) Although ENB's are vac bannable it seems. This game feels like a REAL counter strike. No cases, no drops, no stress about finding keys to open that one case. Just shooting terrorists and having fun with your mates.And this is one of the games that I am so glad my friend gifted me.			"

												Most of Counter-Strike: Source players moved over to CS:GO when that got released cause of the superior graphics and the ongoing updates to the game, so css was being left in the dark, but there is still an active community for css. Even tho the game is old and there is a newer version, this one still holds it's charm. With various of game modes there is always something to do in this game. For a game that has been out for 11 years it still has really good graphics and gameplay. If you wan't to play some interesting game modes for Counter-strike i recommend CSS, it has everything basically. except a good matchmaking system to prove your skill. But it is still one of my favorite games of all time.			"

												One of the best MP PvP games. Tactical, team oriented but solo friendly. Play 5 vs 5 without any mods. This game will give you a portion of adrenaline if you play against players of similar to your skill. It will make you angry if you play against more skilled players. Would be good to have matchmaking to gather players of similar skill. But it was added into CS:GO only. Original Counter-Strike has some advantages, but worse graphics.			"

												Counter Strike: Source, when I first bought it I thought it would have more gun variety but instead I'm met with some pathetic guns that sound so unrealistic and look like plastic, I know this was made in 2010 but come on, we had the technology to import guns from real life or at least get some good model designers to make it.Another problem I had with this worthless game is that there is no Iron-Sights, this was one of the biggest things I expect from my first person shooter games but again I was met with disapointment that I am unable to make my 720 quick-scope. I was also horribly brutalized by the enemy because I couldn't hide behind a rock and wait for some strawberry jelly to slide off my screen as I got shot, my health didn't regenerate, I mean, what the hell is with that. I expect from modern shooters for my health to regenerate and clearly the developers who blatently are trying to make a bad Call Of Duty rip off couldn't even be bothered to do this. "

												Counter-Strike: Source retains its team-based objective-orientated first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, though this depends on which server people play on. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health. Damage is also affected by the distance, and if the target wears protection.			"

 What is Counter Strike: Source? It is a multiplayer first-person shooter which is a remake of the original Counter Strike that focuses on the teams of Counter-Terrorists against Terrorists, this game includes plenty of maps including some well known maps such as de_dust2 with the gamemode of Bomb defusal and cs_office having the gamemode of Hostage rescue. All of this is put into a competitive environment which involves team-work and skill, unlike other first-person shooters out there. How it Works This game takes quite a bit of skill as said previously, it requires knowledge and understanding of the game. This can mean learning the economics of the game, from nade usage to shooting and compnesating spray control. As you progress you will start to learn these things. Learning is what makes this game longer-lasting and more enjoyable than other first-person shooters. Popular Gamemodes  Bomb Defusal This is a gamemode with the main objective where the Counter-Terrorists try to prevent the Terrorists from planting at either Bomb sites A or B. There are 2 ways that will give you victory, as Counter-Terrorists you can eliminate the enemy team or defuse the bomb before it explodes. When playing as Terrorist you can win doing the same thing as the Counter-Terrorists which is eliminating the enemy team or planting the bomb and letting it explode. Hostage Rescue A gamemode which has hostages that are placed where the Terrorist spawn, same concept with the wiping out enemy team but instead of the Terrorists objective to plant the bomb, it is the Counter-Terrorist to rescue the hostages and take them back to where the Counter-Terrorists spawn. Custom Gamemodes Lastly in Counter Strike: Source you will be seeing a lot of custom maps and servers which make up majority of the servers nowadays. These gamemodes go from minigames to bhop and surf with plenty of other custom gamemodes to chose from. Custom gamemodes are especially fun to play when you are bored or just looking for something to play with your mates. Conclusion Well worth buying it if it goes on sale a little bit cheaper as it is a little old and not worth the $20 at the moment. Worth all the 200+ hours on this game however there aren't as much servers as they use to be because it is getting old and there are mods that are available which are a load of fun to play such as Jailbreak and Zombies. Hands down the best game for its time and maybe even today (at least for me). I do recommend this game to those who are thinking of purchasing it although you better purchase it soon as servers are getting wiped. Although if you are still wanting the Counter Strike Experience you can switch over to CS:GO (Counter Strike: Global Offensive). Its a good alternative but I still prefer Counter Strike: Source over it.9.5/10			"

												One of the oldest, most popular First Person Shooters to ever be created. Counter Strike Source has lived far beyond its projected life-time, and it's pretty easy to see why: A handful of game modes, a community that won't die, a plethora of mods/mod support, low system requirements along with a simple, solid formula for gameplay have all culminated together to help immortalize this game as one of the most successful First Person Shooters to be conceived. A fair warning though: The learning curve on this game is pretty high as those who still play, have been at it for years.			"

It runs in some slow pc's, well, try it out, the game is kinda dead already, but you can still find lots of servers to play in. Even some PUGs (Pick Up Games).			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is a first-person shooter from Valve. This is the next generation of Counter-Strike running on the new Source Engine.With same gameplay mechanic as the previous Counter-Strike, but with better engine. You get the old counter terrorist vs. terrorist gameplay in a round based match, buy weapons and equipments at the beginning of rounds and such with better experience with the new Source Engine.Graphics of Counter-Strike: Source has been greatly improved as the game now use Source Engine. From the textures, models and effects are all improved. The game also now has ragdoll physics that apply to weapons and characters dead body. Each time you kill an enemy, their dead animation will vary and not scripted. And if a grenades explode near a dead body, that body may flown away somewhere. The maps has also been updated to the new engine and look so much better.You'll definitely don't want to miss this one. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												CSS is still the best cs 4fun.Although the lack of players and servers make it feel the game is slowly dying it is still fun with some loyal community.This game posses what cs go lacks, the endless mods and casual 4fun servers.I miss the old days with css.			"

												Really classic old stye FPS , PVP game i remeber back when i was younger if i want shoot some gun and have fun the only opion i have is CS series i remeber spend thousand and thousand of hours on this game try to get few kill, i was pretty young and dont have that much skill so i know as the noob level player.What is Counter Strike (CS) all about well is team-based objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. This game used to be a mod back in 90s is than CS 1.6 come out and now they remake the game with Source engine and thats how this game born.Is not what you think like other game u hold down the trigger and aim at player easily get lots kill you need know how the gun work how to handle different kind of gun cos they all have different recoil damage and range. while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. The severity of damage induced by weaponry is dependent upon the specific locations of hits, with hits to the head being most lethal and shots which make contact elsewhere causing lesser loss of health.Now 2014 i dont play this game that much anymore,but sometime is nice when i get on the game with AK grad few kill have some fun and trust i have alot memory in this game :) "

												Hello guys,This is my review of Counter Strike:SourceI've been in love with the Counter Strike series since 1.6, i know the game for a long time and had to get it because its totally worth to get it and play it again.There are few pros but also cons in Source:Pros:Old sounds (Sound better)Your own sprays for free128 TickAlot of fun modes like Surf, Jailbreak and bhopBhopping is alot easier because of the 128 tick servers also goes for surfingStill alot of people are playing CSSKnock stuff like barrels or pallets around the mapBetter hitboxes (*Cough* CS GO *Cough*)Harder BotsAnd of course the old weapons like the MP5 (God i missed this gun)Now after the pros we go to the cons, which are:cons:Almost every server forbids to buy the AWP which is kinda sadServers allow mostly AWP if you buy premium on that serverBuying premium on that server can give you special things like: more HP/Abilities like vampirism and stuff (Talking about unfair play)I totally love CSS but i really think there should be servers with no premium stuff or anything at all.Not only that but servers allow alot of people to join on them and play 20 vs 20 or more which is cool, but you really need to get used to it if you are a CS GO player.20$ for this game is kinda alot but i would buy this game because its fun if you really love the Counter Strike series.I got the game myself from the sale for 6$ with a bundle with CS CZ and CS 1.6.Well hopefully i could give you a good review of the game that i really love to play.I got nothing more to say about it so have fun and have a awsome day.

												I prefer Counter-Strike: Source over Global Offensive anyday, mainly because of the fact that unlike CSGO, custom serverside sounds with stereo spatialization and half of the different entity types and modding/mapping features aren't completely and utterly broken.I'm a modder by nature, and I love tinkering with games, and there's so much stuff you can do with CS:Source as a server owner. Want to turn the game into a Left 4 Dead-style Zombie Apocalypse? You can! Want to make an awesome dismemberment mod with brain matter and♥♥♥♥♥♥flying everywhere on every headshot? You can. Want to have custom sound effects that make the players make goofy death noises? You can. Sprites? Yep. Screen Overlays/Hud Messages and Elements? Yep. None of this can be done with CSGO without either being half-broken, or crashing the game.If you want variety and a unique gameplay experience from server to server, get CSS. Want the same old♥♥♥♥♥♥everytime with only minor variation? Get CSGO. Oh, and after the Source 2013 updates for CSS, it has far better hit detection than CSGO.			"

												Counter-Strike’s beauty is its simplicity: You play as a terrorist or a counterterrorist on a variety of maps. Once a match begins, you have to either wipe out the other team, free or hold hostages, or defend or blow up bomb sites to win the round. In the six years since its release, Valve has loved and maintained the graphics, sound, and physics engine of its baby, even if it’s not bleeding-edge anymore. Textures are detailed, the vocal work remains strong, nearby bullet-impact sounds still seem as if they’re happening within inches of you, and rag-doll physics still make your character realistically tumble after being hit by a grenade.

This isn't a title that you can simply get on and expect to do well regardless of your playstyle, you need to become good at it. It's competitive, packed with classic maps, and does not reward you as most shooters would (leveling up, unlocking weapons, customization, etc). The reward you get for killing here is the sole feeling of doing something utterly satisfying. This is raw, and it takes guts to pull something like this off this well.

												First in English. My original text in Russian below (оригинал моего текста на русском ниже).A long time ago ... at the beginning of 2000s, in a country where there was a peaceful lived his century PC gaming clubs in which schoolchildren spent their leisure time playing CS and elders in Quake, – the forces of enthusiasts built local home networks and the broadband Internet became more accessible.By the year 2004, the computers became a daily device, and the Internet was dawning for service providers, where the internal CSS servers began to appear over time. The night gaming became a habit, and the day began to fall asleep with open eyes.And what do you think I did? Left! Then I bought! dumped it back! and started recently… Now, of course, skill not the one, but in DeathMatch still can.Now, about the cons… even one minus: it's PLAYERS, they disappoint. There was no command game, only hunting for gameme points in the Chuck Norris style: let me knife frag, and I don't give a sh-*t that your teammate dies in your hands, and you'll lose three times in a second. Recently, one player wrote a chat:  ""I play only on the *** server, I like the de*** map and I'm here first"" . Just go to the Classics, start with $800 and see how your ratings fall. Also the idiots yelling to their cheap microphones, so listen for two minutes and the ears will ring thirty. Sorry, boiling.And here's a PROS: for experienced players – lot of the mods, they're for any taste and color – zombies, prisoners, sliding ramps, parachutes, rocket packs, hats on the heads and so on. By choosing a game server from calculation the mode, whether or not there are any ""bells and whistles"", the adequacy of players and admins, as a result YOU GET A GOOD ONLINE SHOOTER without bugs, and for newbies – running bots, not shy dummies.I’m vote for the timeless game that is more DIVERSE, FUN and closest to THE WORLD'S # 1 ONLINE FPS GAME than the popular and monetized CS:GO.P.S. My guide to get “Valve Gift grab 2011” for 100 % achievements status!


How to get Valve Gift Grab 2011 achievement 
A Guide for Counter-Strike: Source

			Getting a ""broken"" Valve Gift Grab 2011 achievement. I think for achievements hunters would be useful.		


The original of my text in Russian here:Давным-давно… в начале 2000х в стране, где ещё мирно доживали свой век игровые компьютерные клубы, в которых школьники проводили свободное время, играя в контру, а деды в кваку – силами энтузиастов строились локальные сети и широкополосный интернет становился доступнее.К 2004 году всё созрело: компьютер стал повседневным устройством и наступил рассвет интернет провайдеров, на площадках которых со временем стали появляться внутренние сервера CSS. Ночное задроztво вошло в привычку, я днём стал засыпать чуть ли не с открытыми глазами.И что вы думаете я сделал?! Бросил! Потом купил, снова бросил и 3 месяца назад снова начал… пароль от аккаунта вспоминать пришлось! Сейчас конечно скилл не тот, но навалять школоте в deathmatch’e еще могу.О минусах, вернее даже об одном минусе: это – игроки, они разочаровывают. Нет той былой командной игры, осталась лишь охота за очками gameme в стиле Чака Норриса: надо сделать фраг ножом, ведь очков получу в два раза больше и грубо полюбить всех, что твой тиммейт погибает на твоих же руках, да сам через секунду потеряешь втрое больше. Недавно один игрок написал в чате:  «я играю только на *** сервере, мне нравится эта карта и я тут всегда первый» . Да иди ты сыграй в классику, стартани с $800, посмотрим как твои рейтинги упадут. И мать их! читеры, с которыми не борются ни админы, ни игроки. А еще идиоты, вопящие в свои дешевые микрофоны, таких послушаешь две минуты, а в ушах будет звенеть тридцать. Сорри, накипело.А вот вам плюсы: для опытных игроков – масса режимов, они тут на любой вкус и цвет: зомби, зэки, рампы для скольжения, парашюты, ракетные ранцы, кепки на голове и т.д. В итоге, выбрав сервер из расчета режима игры, наличия или отсутствия наворотов, адекватности игроков и админов, ты получаешь добротный безглючный онлайн шутер, а для новичков – работающие боты, а не застенчивые манекены.Я – за нестареющую игру, которая разнообразна, забавна и наиболее близка к шутеру НОМЕР ОДИН В МИРЕ, нежели ныне популярный и монетизированный cs:go.P.S. Мое рукоблудство по получению Valve Gift grab 2011 для 100 % достижений!

												What can I say, this game stands the test of time, it's a shooter of all shooter's.Hit detection, hit boxes and movement all solid.Buying weapons very easy to do unlike CSGO where you have this pizza wheel and your re-buy gets deleted but that's a whole other review.Re-buying weapons is easy.If you are new I do recommend playing versus bots because it takes skill, paying attention to radar and sound is a big thing in this game, if you do not you are sure to be dead.Weapons are balanced, people complain about the P90 a lot though if it had 30 rounds it still would be rockin.Maps are nice, people make maps and mods its a big community thing and I do recommend this game 100%Fun for all.  Just stay away from the christian server and TrueGrit, they get sore about anything you say and that ruins the experience.			"

												After a couple of hours I can definitely confirm that once you get addicted to this game, the notion of time just disappears. You launch it one time and then you wake up later thinking about how few years of your life just passed by...10/10, would launch it again.P.S. Actually I played this game for a quite longer time span than you can see since I started playing this game since 2006 and got it on Steam just 4 years later in 2010 so you can add few more thousands of hours of play time. :DThis game is fun to play by itself, but playing it casually doesn't give you the same pleasure and satisfaction (depends on how good you are at this game) as playing it competitively (5v5 matches on mix/pug servers), you just have to try it at least once if you didn't. It's so much more satisfying than doing this in CSGO (1700+ hrs there as well.. duh)...GL & HF!			"

												One of the best Counter-Strike games. Good sounds, good graphics, kinda strange physics, but whatever. You won't need to pay for the skins for your weapons, you won't need to suffer from the awful sounds which were invented in csgo. If you wanna play old, good Counter-Strike - you should get this game(Or you can also get yourself CS 1.6).			"

												If you are between the ages of three and eight, please read carefully. Owning Counter-Strike: Source is now the only proof that you are not a baby. If you don't have this game, People will think you wear diapers, and cry all the time. Everybody will think you sleep in a crib, and drink from a bottle, if you don't have Counter-Strike: Source. And whenever you speak, all people will hear is, ""Goo goo, Ga ga"". So tell your mum or dad to buy you Counter-Strike: Source. Because otherwise, as far as anyone's concerned, you're a baby.			"

												This game is awesome, it's an updated version of Counter-Strike 1.6. But better graphics and have physics. You can play as Terrorists or Counter-Terrorists.As Terrorists: You have to plant the bomb. Defend the bomb away from the hands of the CT.As Counter-Terrorists: You have to kill all Terrorists, or if the bomb is planted, try to find the bomb and defuse it.The community is great, they make mods to change the gamemode, so you can play such as Zombie Survival, Zombie Escape, Surf,..e.t.c..Rating: 11/10 - Best game ever for players want to try some thing new.

												 Valve has taken a large selection of the maps from Counter-Strike 1.6 - Office, Havana, Italy, Aztec, Chateau, Cobble, Piranesi and of course eternal favourites Dust and Dust 2, and recreated them for the source engine. This means all new textures and major aesthetic changes with more complex buildings and scenery. In addition, the levels are scattered with objects that react realistically with the Source engine's physics engine. A rather good game. Graphics and models are satisfactory and there aren't a lot of hackers in this game (as far as I know, but I could be wrong). This game really boosts teamwork abilities in people unlike other games. Personally, I prefer this to CSGO. Believe me, this is worth buying. "

												Still active playerbase, even if most players have moved to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.I think CS:S custom gun game mods are more enjoyable than CS:GO's official one. It has most of the stuff that CS:GO has, and is even easier to run. So if you have old PC, and can't run CS:GO, you might be able to run this. If not Original CS it is for you :)			"

												The Counter Strike series is well-known and beloved by millions of players. Even to this day, Counter-Strike: Source still has a large community on its shoulders and continues to expand with new game modes and mods produced by the community and is seen as the biggest most successful FPS franchise for the PC platform. A fantastic conversion of a timeless classic and it has stolen the hearts of the online community once again. An excellent game, huge variety of maps wonderfull physics, and fun if you can find flaws in the maps. This game has several gamemodes you can choose from. Counter-Strike: Source is a well polished, enhanced version of a great game, and anyone who owns a PC should have this game installed as you do not need a high end gaming rig to run it, that makes it a game for everyone who likes competitive first person shooter which involves thinking and good aiming skills instead of mindless slaying.  Buy it, download it, whatever; just get on board and enjoy it. Sure-fire fun for the online enthusiast. 10/10			"

												Hitman Squads, is a crime business game with RPG elements, developed by Infinity Ward and published by EA. It took over 5 years to make, so you know it's good. You play as your custom hitman in a hitman squad. By the way, the game rips of Saints Row: The Menace of Shrek with it's crazy character customization. Anyway, you and your hitman squad to various crimes while trying not to be killed by the police with Sam Fisher nightvision goggles. You'll be doing things like planting bombs in a nuclear plant, holding hostages in an office while holding off the police, and doing a neighborhood heist. The game has an economy system that rips off Payday 2 that lets you buy weapons before going in. For example, you start out with a pistol. By completing missions, you get money. You can spend that money on new weapons and equip- WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS. Just pay $35 in real life and get the raygun already. The game isn't without it's flaws though. Everytime I beat the mission, I get sent back from the start and I have to do it 12 times in order to progress. Other than that though, the campaign is one of the best I've played. The game is also very unrealistic. The game doesn't let you aim down sights, and when you press Shift to sprint, you WALK instead? What were they thinking? The multiplayer is one of the worst I have ever seen. It's basically the same thing as the single-player, but you get to play as the cops, and you have to buy guns during matches. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING. Why would you play as the cops? That's stupid. Also, the MP9 Silenced SMG is overpowered. YOU CAN STAY OFF THE MINI-MAP. WHAT? Even with all of it's flaws, it's still one of the best games I've ever played, if not the best. This game gets a 9001/10, get Call of Duty Ghosts 43 instead.			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is a great game to play solo or with a group of friends. Counter-Strike: Source provides countless hours of online fast pace FPS action. With custom maps, realistic weapons, custom photo sprays and the ability to have different game mods or styles is what makes CSS one of the best FPS game titles ever. Part of it's success is highly accredited to the original games prior to this verision of Counter-Strike.			"

												What can I say? This game is totally deserving of its reputation and status.It was, if not still is, one of the most popular multiplayer FPS games ever created. If you're a fan of Half-Life 2 and thought the gunplay was lacking, then you will find that Counter-Strike and its family doesn't fall short in the same respect. The game forces you to aim properly and not run around as fast as possible, spraying and praying like an idiot unlike some more ""modern"" FPS games.Quite possibly because the game (and thus, many of its players) has been around for long, the skill level required to successfully play this game is set very high compared to others. Make what you wish of this, but if you're used to hand-holding console FPS games with autoaim, you're going to get fragged a lot. I don't mean this as an insult to console gamers, just a warning.The variety of weapon categories is reasonable, though weapons in the same category can sometimes feel rather same-y, especially in the assault rifle category. You've got pistols, submachine guns, shotguns, assault rifles, battle rifles, sniper rifles and a singular machine gun, the M249. Each of them excel at different ranges and for their lack of significant variance, give a surprisingly different feel in context of accuracy and rate of fire.Although this version of Counter-Strike has been succeeded by Global Offensive, I'd still recommend this game. I haven't played GO so I can't give a properly informed opinion on it, but the overall feel of it looks to me like it isn't really Counter-Strike anymore. Again, just my 2c, you're welcome to disagree for your own reasons.If nothing else, Counter-Strike Source significantly surpasses the original in graphical fidelity. I can't really think of a reason to buy the original over this unless you want to save money or have a VERY old PC which isn't up to the task. Not that Counter-Strike doesn't have its own historical merit for being what I think should be regarded as revolutionary.Overall, if you're looking for a competitive multiplayer experience that will give you great potential to become a skillful FPS gamer, I'd definitely recommend CS:S - so long as you're willing to put in that effort - which unfortunately I'm not, but that doesn't mean I don't still enjoy the game. Even if you get bored of the vanilla game, there's gungame, jailbreak (I think..?), xtreme climb, zombie mod and other little modifications all of which alter the gameplay in surprisingly significant ways for how little of the core game they actually change.

												Valve's 3rd Counter-Strike game has negatives and positives. The community is still very active and you shouldn't have a hard time finding a server with players. I haven't encountered any major glitches or bugs, and hacking is pretty uncommon. It's easier to learn than CS:GO in my opinion, but you will face many more experienced players. There's no skin garbage either. Unfortunately, there are so many modded servers that it can be hard to find a normal game of CS. Also, there are a surprisingly large number of Russians in the community. This can make it hard to hear teammates since they talk so damn loud. Overall, probably the 2nd best Counter-Strike behind the original. It also includes a limited-time copy to send to a friend. I would reccomend, but keep in mind it is the priciest game in the series.			"

												There is nothing like Counter-Strike in the FPS world. Whether it deals with singleplayer campaigns, to multiplayer battles. Or even a whole war to deal with. Counter-Strike is an old series made by Valve and is currently still inclining with players. People from all around the globe have been wanting or playing this game. Counter-Strike takes FPS Shooters to a whole new level, not just by gunning down people. But to have very unique strategies and working as a team to win. Unlike Call of Duty, this game isn't a spray and run type game. With it's predecessors, counter-strike has grown so well. Let's not forget that it keeps getting more popular and popular. ~ GoddessReviews "

												Counter-Strike: Source is, once you've gained a knack for it, the most consistently rewarding and surprising team-based shoot-'em-up available on the PC.A technically and graphically stunning port of a game that was already pretty damn good, with the potential to deliver bigger and better things in future. And you can’t complain too much about that.It's fast-paced and a little goofy, but it's also very tactical and teamwork based. The learning curve is very steep (the maps are easy to learn, but the shooting system is hard to perfect). The Source engine gives the game a solid feel. And if playing the standard way is not your things, there is a wide variety of custom maps and game types (minigames, zombie mod, jail break, hide n seek, surfing, etc...). Also if you think Call of Duty is competitive don't even bother buying this game. This is for the die hard FPS fans.It will take a long time to hone your skills. This game is timeless and one of the most intense shooters ever released.			"

You need to get it, that's it.Still lots of servers and stuff up for playing on it, why? Because it's awesome!And yea, I know, I don't have so many hours in it, but just trust me anyway...This game gets 8/10.			"

												Fun, and with very fast-paced gameplay. Enjoyable regardless of how much time a day you have to play it. Graphics are very flexible (they can go from looking very realistic to looking like Quake), and overall the game is simply entertaining, it gives you good times. The only things that really annoy me are the default animations for each weapon, which look pretty...rough, as if they were taken straight from 1.6 without any editing (e.g smoothing the animations).However the game does make up for it with the fact that it's very easy to mod. Once you put in it custom skins or maps of your liking, you're golden! It can give you an even better experience. CS:S is not just a realistic FPS; it can be everything, and you are the one who decides what the game should become with all the kind of mods that exist for it. For example, I'm even using a mod that turns all of the grenades into Rubik's cubes!I recommend it.			"

												Seinfeld is an American sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on NBC, from 1989 to 1998. It was created by Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, the latter starring as a fictionalized version of himself. Set predominantly in an apartment building in Manhattan's Upper West Side in New York City (although taped entirely in Los Angeles), the show features a handful of Jerry's friends and acquaintances, particularly best friend George Costanza (Jason Alexander), former girlfriend Elaine Benes (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and neighbor across the hall Cosmo Kramer (Michael Richards). It is often described as being ""a show about nothing"", as many of its episodes are about the minutiae of daily life.			"

												This game is over-all a great choice for a fast-paced first-person shooter, And it features many great weapons and items to choose from while playing, such as the one-hitting AWP, or the high-capacity fast-firing P90.There are also many fan-made mods to play, such as Gun Game, Jailbreak, and more.Overall, I reccomend this game if you prefer fast-paced scenarios, in which if you don't act fast and thoughtfully, it could cost you your life.

												Whoo, CSS, my favorite of the series.I'll have to say, its gunplay is probably the best out of them. I know, I know, to some, it might feel like its too easy. But no, I think you still have to worry about recoil and such. Plus its just Counter-Strike with the Source engine, the only difference is that some maps from 1.6 didn't make it in and there are some new maps (that also happen to have not been carried over to GO.)Both the new ones and the old ones have great map design, however. Bot AI is alright. They're still kinda stupid even in Hard but I can't complain too much since I'm pretty sure the AI was carried over from CZ (Condition Zero). What makes them harder is their boosted reaction times, weapon preferences, etc.Speaking of bots, if you want to play with human players, there's no such thing as matchmaking or whatever, just a server browser which makes things...quite hard. Why? Oh, I dunno, could be UT2k4 sounds that are so repetitive that could stop you from playing on that server. Or maybe the fact that a server has 16k dollars whenever anyone spawns regardless of how many wins and losses. Basically, there is no tag for avoiding ""community"" servers. Which is exactly why I don't play this game online much. Also because literally every brazilian player is some kind of insane pro that once he snags an M4 or AK you're pretty much screwed.Sound design...eh...I mean, most of it was carried over from 1.6 and for its time, 1.6's sound design was actually pretty good. In 2004?...Not so much. I mean, it's still well-designed for detecting enemies and the like, but I mean the quality of the sounds. It all feels like someone just edited stock sounds to make it playable. I'm probably wrong on that matter, maybe, but looking back, it feels a lot that way.The design for the weapons, the least important thing ever, since you can also just download a skin that at least makes it  look better...For a Source remake, I'm actually impressed they managed to make the guns look like their real life selves in 2004! But if you're unhappy you can just do what I said above. Reloading animations are so wrong, though. Like pulling the bolt catch on the M4. That's just silly. Then again the animation was from the original CS and back then Valve didn't actually own the franchise. Ah, well. Skins also fix that.Hitboxes are actually spot-on, unlike GO. You have an AK and your crosshair's on someone's head. What happens? Exactly.That's why I love this game so much. I never complained about not having dealt enough damage, because I always did deal damage.Gameplay is balanced since its all carried over from 1.6.I won't cover the radio chatter since that's more for practical reasons rather than flavor. If you're wondering why the voice acting on them's so lame, it's exactly because it's one of the higher staff from the original CS dev team doing the acting.I'm also not going to criticize weapons I dislike despite them having a place in the game like everyone else. I hate the P90 and how overused it is, but if its in the game, its in the game. All of the weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, but the assault rifles by far have it all perfect, since, they don't have weaknesses and they're capable of doing what other weapons specialize in, best.Speaking of assault rifles, the 3-round burst is overpowered but I love it because of just that. It has pinpoint accuracy when firing, unlike 1.6 or literally every CS title as of yet, and it makes the AK seem like a donkey to use when you have the FAMAS' burst on someone's head. Literally 2 shots on one's head to get a headshot if they're wearing a helmet. You don't have to worry about the FAMAS missing one of those shots. The glock gets the same burst but it's not as effective, granted, as it is a starting pistol and doesn't have much in the way of armor penetration.Maybe for balance it breaks it a little what with the CTs having a much better cheap AR in comparison to the T's Galil. Oh well! People seem to enjoy buying deagles instead...I don't blame them.I think that's it. I hope I covered everything someone would need before purchasing this game. In my opinion, it is the best CS title as of yet. The only problem I have, personally, is the fact it lacks a filter for, well...filtering OUT the community servers. But if that's not a problem to you, you should totally get this one. If it is, well...you're probably better off getting GO. 1.6 is essentially the same as Source though, uses a server browser, too. Doesn't even have Source's Tags feature, either.Have fun playing it if ya do get it! :D			"

												Sprays all over the place, old maps and crazy custom-made maps that haven't made it to the CS:GO, surf/gg and other modes some of which became official in the CS:GO, no screaming kids (not anymore - they have all migrated to the newer and as they think, therefore, better version - CS:GO), relatively low PC requirements, <b>HUGE</b> 1st person AWP scope, objects flying all over the place during the combat (cs_office) and whole bunch of other nostalgious♥♥♥♥♥♥that ruined my adolescence. Now that there's CS:GO that replaced CS:S the latter can be rightfully called classic just like HL2:DM and other 2004 masterpieces made by Valve that modern kids will never get to enjoy. And don't get me wrong, CS 1.6 is still golden for me.			"

												Valve has done a sterling job of moving a flagship franchise over to a new engine.A technically and graphically stunning port of a game that was already pretty damn good, with the potential to deliver bigger and better things .once you've gained a knack for it is the most consistently rewarding shooter. It's a timeless classic. And you can’t complain too much about that.			"

												Whoo, CSS, my favorite of the series.I'll have to say, its gunplay is probably the best out of them. I know, I know, to some, it might feel like its too easy. But no, I think you still have to worry about recoil and such. Plus its just Counter-Strike with the Source engine, the only difference is that some maps from 1.6 didn't make it in and there are some new maps (that also happen to have not been carried over to GO.)Both the new ones and the old ones have great map design, however. Bot AI is alright. They're still kinda stupid even in Hard but I can't complain too much since I'm pretty sure the AI was carried over from CZ (Condition Zero). What makes them harder is their boosted reaction times, weapon preferences, etc.Speaking of bots, if you want to play with human players, there's no such thing as matchmaking or whatever, just a server browser which makes things...quite hard. Why? Oh, I dunno, could be UT2k4 sounds that are so repetitive that could stop you from playing on that server. Or maybe the fact that a server has 16k dollars whenever anyone spawns regardless of how many wins and losses. Basically, there is no tag for avoiding ""community"" servers. Which is exactly why I don't play this game online much. Also because literally every brazilian player is some kind of insane pro that once he snags an M4 or AK you're pretty much screwed.Sound design...eh...I mean, most of it was carried over from 1.6 and for its time, 1.6's sound design was actually pretty good. In 2004?...Not so much. I mean, it's still well-designed for detecting enemies and the like, but I mean the quality of the sounds. It all feels like someone just edited stock sounds to make it playable. I'm probably wrong on that matter, maybe, but looking back, it feels a lot that way.The design for the weapons, the least important thing ever, since you can also just download a skin that at least makes it  look better...For a Source remake, I'm actually impressed they managed to make the guns look like their real life selves in 2004! But if you're unhappy you can just do what I said above. Reloading animations are so wrong, though. Like pulling the bolt catch on the M4. That's just silly. Then again the animation was from the original CS and back then Valve didn't actually own the franchise. Ah, well. Skins also fix that.Hitboxes are actually spot-on, unlike GO. You have an AK and your crosshair's on someone's head. What happens? Exactly.That's why I love this game so much. I never complained about not having dealt enough damage, because I always did deal damage.Gameplay is balanced since its all carried over from 1.6.I won't cover the radio chatter since that's more for practical reasons rather than flavor. If you're wondering why the voice acting on them's so lame, it's exactly because it's one of the higher staff from the original CS dev team doing the acting.I'm also not going to criticize weapons I dislike despite them having a place in the game like everyone else. I hate the P90 and how overused it is, but if its in the game, its in the game. All of the weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, but the assault rifles by far have it all perfect, since, they don't have weaknesses and they're capable of doing what other weapons specialize in, best.Speaking of assault rifles, the 3-round burst is overpowered but I love it because of just that. It has pinpoint accuracy when firing, unlike 1.6 or literally every CS title as of yet, and it makes the AK seem like a donkey to use when you have the FAMAS' burst on someone's head. Literally 2 shots on one's head to get a headshot if they're wearing a helmet. You don't have to worry about the FAMAS missing one of those shots. The glock gets the same burst but it's not as effective, granted, as it is a starting pistol and doesn't have much in the way of armor penetration.Maybe for balance it breaks it a little what with the CTs having a much better cheap AR in comparison to the T's Galil. Oh well! People seem to enjoy buying deagles instead...I don't blame them.I think that's it. I hope I covered everything someone would need before purchasing this game. In my opinion, it is the best CS title as of yet. The only problem I have, personally, is the fact it lacks a filter for, well...filtering OUT the community servers. But if that's not a problem to you, you should totally get this one. If it is, well...you're probably better off getting GO. 1.6 is essentially the same as Source though, uses a server browser, too. Doesn't even have Source's Tags feature, either.Have fun playing it if ya do get it! :D			"

With unique gameplay that combines precision and patience, beautiful maps and graphics that hold up excellently, CS: Source is a timeless game that aged like a fine wine. Its maps can be played for hours upon end, with each match being its own entertaining showdown between two opposing sides of players. Its competitive, but still casual and welcoming to new players. Compared to CS: GO, Source has better maps, servers, balancing, and overall superior gameplay. It's a masterpiece, making a FPS an artform.			"

For all you GMod (Garry's Mod) players out there I would recommend buying the two-pack of Garry's Mod and Counter-Strike: Source, not only for the fact of getting two amazing games cheap, but Counter-Strike: Source gives an amazing resolution for when playing multiplayer, and takes away annoying screen bugs. Thank you, and I hope my review was helpful -LokiSmokey			"

												I love this game. CSS > 1.6 >>>>>> CS:GO. No questionsI met my best friends on Source. We made a team, played for years, went to local tournaments and actually made money playing a game I LOVE. Paid for a server for years, played scrims everyday and went through CAL-O, CAL-I, and CEVO. Those were the best days...Changes from CSS to CS:GO:Hey, 90% of players love the AK because the first shot is pinpoint accurate. Let's change that!Hey, 90% of players using the M4 used the silencer, so lets make a different M4 and give it a 20 round mag with no recoil!Hey, 100% of players recommended STARTING WITH THE MP5 TO GET USED TO RECOIL, SPREAD, AND GENERAL MECHANICS. Let's get rid of that!Hey, literally no one liked the P90. LET'S CHANGE THAT, wait... that's still the same.I could go on but I feel people that entered this series first started with CS:GO and have no idea what I'm talking about. The Deagle was the best gun in the game, as shown in the youtube video ""CSS | Deagle Clip by skiTeL"". I think every single person needs to see this video.Anyways, TL:DR - This game is and always will be the best shooter IMO			"

												The 2004 sequel to Counter-Strike featuring their then new source engine, this is much of the same from the previous version although missing a few of the less popular additions to 1.6. Other than that, it's basically the same although a lot of people called it too newb friendly since the hitboxes for headshots were bigger in source than in previous versions, but overall the maps and gameplay are pretty much the same, it just has much better graphics.

												Aside from some camping(which happens in every FPS unfortunately), this is an excellent shooter game. Time seems to fly away when you are playing. It can probably ruin your ♥♥♥♥ing life if you get hooked on the game. Plus, I played mainly in cs_office. I still have other maps to play which is great. The best part of this game is the gameplay of course. I don't really give a ♥♥♥♥ about the graphics, the porn posted by the other users make up for it :D. Overall, it is an excellent game that you can play for a long time and still enjoy it because there are many modded servers to play(zombies, hunger games, something about surfing,etc).			"

												This Source-updated version of the classic online shooter Counter-Strike has been going strong ever since it was released back in 2004. Decent balancing, solid map designs, and simple gameplay all work for it. Of course, it's become extremely stale now, and Valve acknowledged this with the update to the Orange Box engine and Team Fortress 2-style arcadey additions (which weren't well-received by the community, mind you). Overall, I'd say avoid it now, but back in the day it wasn't bad.			"

												A real classic, simple, easy to play, easy to set up, easy to customise, but hard to master.CS:S Is basically the spirit of Counterstrike, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like skins, and crates, just pure, simple fun. Due the the game's smaller popularity than its massively-popular successor, the community is less toxic, more mature, and more interested in playing the game than collecting skins.This game also runs well on toasters, waffle-irons, microwaves, and blenders. Mods, and modded servers also allow for more replayability if you somehow become bored.In my opinion, better than CS:G., I reccomend this to everyone, whether you want to play competitively, or just casually with friends.

												What can be said about this game that has yet to be spoken? It is truly the hypest of all PC games. Your enjoyment of shooters or not is irrelevant! Kneel before the master PC game of the superior master console race! But seriously its an amazing game, its not simply TDM or hostage rescue. The countless user generated content keeps the game timeless, even with the release of global offensive I still find my self coming back to this game time and time again. Those who have not played this game at all, should not count them self's as a 'True' PC gamer. I know that's quite a bold statement to make but I'm making it. Im not saying you have to be a source fan girl like me, but you should give it a shot. The graphics are as extreme or as simple as you want it, On my X51 (with a few modifications) I can get about 300FPS in game on maxed settings. While the last Update I recall did put an end to extreme bunny hopping, changes are few and far between for this game, and why shouldn't they be? You wouldn't go putting neon lights on the Mona Lisa would you? The community again is like the graphics... They can be as extreme and vulgar as you want, or a sweet and innocent. Anyway that's enough of me fan girl'ing over my wifu game. I hope this encourages a certain sexy voice actor/ musician to give this game a try, heck ill even buy it for you. If you guys haven't bought it, buy it!			"

												Counter- Strike : Source is by far one of the best games I have ever played on pc/ mac. Although some community made maps are unable to download, I can still play on other maps that are created by valve (i hope i got that right XD)that are just as amazing as community made maps. There are only a few minor issues on css, but most won't affect your gameplay. From playing css on both pc and mac, I am going to rate this game 10 out of 10.			"

												CS:Source was like a breath of fresh air when it got released even though it had the same concept as CS, it felt refreshing. Once again being a CS game, there isn't much to say about it.+ Nice graphics+ Support for imported maps, skins etc.+ Good gameplayForget the CS:Zero crap, this game should've came after CS 1.6. That would've made the entire wait worth it.			"

												One of the best games i've ever played. CS:S is the most addicting shooter you will ever play (much better than CoD and other modern FPS games). The best part is seeing that this game was released in 2004 and is still one of the most played games on steam which is showcasing the very strong community dedication and that the game players are still very active. This is a must have for every steam player and I highly recommend taking a look at the zombie mod gamemode.			"

												If you don't like mods, buy Counter-Strike Global Offensive instead. But CS:GO, like all Counter-Strike updates, is mostly just a cosmetic upgrade (with the exception of a matchmaking system and fancy weapon skins!). But if you don't mind that, and if you don't mind modding, get Counter-Strike Source. Why? It is much better in terms of modding than CS:GO, the majority of servers will support mods so don't worry about that. You can replace all of those crappy default weapon models with HD models far better than CS:GO's with fancy animations. Get a custom HUD and a fancy ENB series to top it off, and you have something far better than CS:GO that costs less!			"

												What hasn't been said about Counter Strike? It is heavily moddable, has an extensive community, and has quick gameplay with sharp controls and low system requirements. Some of the best things about Counter Strike lie in it's community, and the content they make. Zombie Escape, for example, is the gamemode I play most on, with close-knit groups of players and a fairly large variety of maps to play on.I would dare argue that ALL Counter Strike games are worth buying for these very reasons, especially Counter Strike: Source.

												I have close to 3k hours in-game, And I will always continue to play this game, I take a break from time to time and go nostalgia and play some 1.6.But in my honest opinion the price of this game need to be reduced in order to stay competitive with cs:go. cs:go is a good game, But not as good as 1.6/ or css imo.  Maybe valve/steam need to lower the price and they will see an increase in css players.			"

												Counter- Strike : Source is by far one of the best games I have ever played on pc/ mac. Although some community made maps are unable to download, I can still play on other maps that are created by valve (i hope i got that right XD)that are just as amazing as community made maps. There are only a few minor issues on css, but most won't affect your gameplay. From playing css on both pc and mac, I am going to rate this game 10 out of 10.			"

It has something special which makes you want to play it again and again and again. The more you play, the better you will be. Personally for training, I prefer and suggest you to play on Deathmatch servers. Have fun :)			"

												This really is a no brainer. This is the definitive multiplayer FPS. The tactical possibilities alone in a single map are nearly limitless. The weapon choices are fun and span a broad arsenal, giving the player tactical choice. The weapons are modeled correctly, and ""feel"" like their real world counterparts. Teamwork is optional, and generally speaking, good teamwork leads to wins. This game is fast paced, brutal, and has an infinite learning curve.It is immortal. Counter-Strike.9/10			"

												It is ok if you like and good at first person shooters.  A classic Valve game.  You can buy guns and gear with money that you earn per match.You can create your own server on your computer and play on it with bots, still counts for achievements.  Plenty of CS servers online, some have modded maps and bots.for more info:


YouTube™ Video: A Critical Review - Counter Strike Source 

			Views: 39,716		

			Some things in life can be taken for granted, but none more so than the beauty of simplicity. Counter Strike Source is one of the few games out there that sticks to this philosophy.

			This is my review of CSS. I don't like this game very much, I prefer the origional. That might have something to do with the total score of 7.5/10.

												Counter-Strike: Source is definitely one of my favorite FPS's of all time. It excels in places current FPS's even fails, despite the voice acting and graphics, had it been released today it would certainly make it. It also holds up today.    [/tr]    [/tr] Category Score Notes  Graphics 9 Although it isn't as good as say Global Offense, it still holds up.   Voice Acting 9 I'll be fair. Its CS's voice acting, in the Source engine. So its not that great, but it gets a pass due to age.    Controls 10 Never had a problem, always has felt right.   Maps 10 Damn I love cs_office. Most maps are great and fits the mood of the game.  Mechanics 8 Admittedly some cheap shots, but still solid. The Magnum Sniper Rifle/AWP is broken. And that's why I love it.  Multiplayer 10 Multiplayer is the only way to play and its great. I tend to enjoy deathmatchs the best but normal plant the bomb/stop them from planting the bomb is great too. Final verdict is 8. I prefer Team Fortress 2, but if I ever have a chance to play this I will. The annoyances are too severe to give it a 9-10 but its not enough to give it anything less than an 8.			"

												If you don't like mods, buy Counter-Strike Global Offensive instead. But CS:GO, like all Counter-Strike updates, is mostly just a cosmetic upgrade (with the exception of a matchmaking system and fancy weapon skins!). But if you don't mind that, and if you don't mind modding, get Counter-Strike Source. Why? It is much better in terms of modding than CS:GO, the majority of servers will support mods so don't worry about that. You can replace all of those crappy default weapon models with HD models far better than CS:GO's with fancy animations. Get a custom HUD and a fancy ENB series to top it off, and you have something far better than CS:GO that costs less!			"

												Sometimes it feels good gettting that nostalgia that I recieved from Counter-Strike: Source. I bought the game just for the memories that I have from it. I found a PUG group and started playing 5v5s with the guys there, it's really fun and entertaining, knowing that you won't lose or win anything and you do it only for the game. One of the greatest feelings ever!			"

												The Counter-Strike series[en.wikipedia.org] has always been a childhood game right from the day I first endured my experience on the PC. Counter-Strike: Condition Zero was the first one I ever played, the campaign remains in my mind today even though I no longer have it (I think?). When I saw that Source was available with Garry's Mod for all but a shilling, I had to grab it and give it a test run. Safe to say, I haven't been disappointed.With a complete graphical overhaul, I was paying close attention to the detail of the weapons and smaller geometries around the world in addition to the character texturing/meshes. Valve pulled it off, and they did it well. I played this game for hours with a friend, jumping from server to server experiencing what I had never done before. Playing online at such a young age during Condition Zero was just something I never did. In my own personal opinion, Source is better than even the more modern day Call of Duty's, and it is from the same category (First-Person Shooter). I even think the sounds got some looking after as they seem to be much clearer then they did back in 2004. However, all good things must come to an end as I stopped my CS experience here: Global Offensive just does not appeal to me, at all. Onto the pros and cons!Pros:» Graphical overhaul has mentioned, a real step-up from Condition Zero.» Sound also seems to be a big factor. I noticed that even the running sounds were revamped for the release.» Animations were reworked as far as I can tell. One thing that stood out to me was the idle animation for the knife.» Many online gamemods, great fun to play!» Although this is a Valve product, it has great integration with Garry's Mod which is nice to see.Cons:» Considering this game is ten years old (I can't believe it!) it's absolutely magnificent. I just wish there had been a campaign like CZ.My rating for CSS is 8/10. I took into account the length the game has been released and some of the technical factors in regards to the game engine and blockages that may have come up. The only thing that stopped it reaching a nine was the no campaign. I wish they had that!			"

												It's good old Counter-Strike. Think of it as a cross between CS 1.6 and Global Offensive; looks better than 1.6, runs better than GO, and it has achievements and stat tracking. If I had to say which of the two classics (Source and 1.6), I'd say this one.			"

												What hasn't been said about Counter Strike? It is heavily moddable, has an extensive community, and has quick gameplay with sharp controls and low system requirements. Some of the best things about Counter Strike lie in it's community, and the content they make. Zombie Escape, for example, is the gamemode I play most on, with close-knit groups of players and a fairly large variety of maps to play on.I would dare argue that ALL Counter Strike games are worth buying for these very reasons, especially Counter Strike: Source.

												Is this game in a few good bundles? Check. Does is faithfully bring back the original counter strike in a warmly crafted source remake? Check. Is it better than CoD. Check. Is it still going strong even with CSGO towering over it? Check. Long story short, this is a great game that does all of the above and more. If you want to get a taste of the original counter strike but don't want to boot up the old game to do it, then this game is for you. Also, it can come in handy in Gmod. My Final Thought?..... Buy this game. "

												Well here is something I must say about the game right away. This game is just the remake of the old CS 1.6 but in source. But just because Valve remakes an IP that does not mean that it is a bad game in fact it is quite good although the game is quite abandoned due to the CSGO comunity. This game has most of the content NEEDED to play and enjoy GMOD though so I do recomend it for that. Also THIS GAME HAS NO R8 REVOLVER YAAAASSSSS anyways I suggest this game if you want to upgrade the graphics of CS 1.6 so yeah. My final rating for this game is an 8/10.			"

												This really is a no brainer. This is the definitive multiplayer FPS. The tactical possibilities alone in a single map are nearly limitless. The weapon choices are fun and span a broad arsenal, giving the player tactical choice. The weapons are modeled correctly, and ""feel"" like their real world counterparts. Teamwork is optional, and generally speaking, good teamwork leads to wins. This game is fast paced, brutal, and has an infinite learning curve.It is immortal. Counter-Strike.9/10			"

Quick SummaryThe second installment in the CS franchise.Purchase Verdict:  Yes (and often goes on decent sales)Points of Interest-Still extremely popular, even though it may be a tad older than other games.-Plenty of gamemodes and modded servers to keep you interested-Like the other games in the series, this game is a different type of FPS that denies you the usage of scopes or iron sights (other than the sniper rifles). This will require a lot of practicing and patience to get the science of using these guns down.			"

												CS:S is a wonderful FPS. Anyone who enjoys CS:GO or CS should get this game. Of course this game plays differently from both of those so it will take a bit of time to get used to its feel. CS:S is probably the best FPS ever in my opinion. CS:GO is way more competitive and attracts a bigger audience. To new players, CS is no easy game. It will take atleast 40 hours of gameplay to get anywhere. CS:S is a fun fast paced FPS and I think everyone on steam should have this game. Oh... And one more thing, Dont just buy this game for Gary's Mod Textures. PLEASE!!!! "

												Whats great about Counter Strike, is that its a simple FPS with lots of variety in maps and mods. Maps: planting bombs, rescuing hostages, running from zombies, knife only, scoutknivez, awp only, Warcraft 3 RPG mod, Gungame mod, etc. You have the ability to make your own maps and mods as well. Looking for servers is easy, and simple unlike some games that dont even show you ping! (Left 4 Dead cough). Rounds are usually pretty quick and you can play as long as little as you want. Used to play this game a lot back in the day, and have recently been getting into it a lot. If you like adrenaline rushes and shooting people in real time, then this game is for you :)			"

												This game is amazing. To start off if you're like me and you have a low end pc this game will still run really well. Plus for only 20 US dollars you get so much. You get the classic counter strike formula and maps with the thousands of free community maps and gamemodes. After 9 years there are still many gaming communitys to get into aswell. What im trying to say is that this game is defenitly worth the money and time. Get this game now.			"

												CS:S is a wonderful FPS. Anyone who enjoys CS:GO or CS should get this game. Of course this game plays differently from both of those so it will take a bit of time to get used to its feel. CS:S is probably the best FPS ever in my opinion. CS:GO is way more competitive and attracts a bigger audience. To new players, CS is no easy game. It will take atleast 40 hours of gameplay to get anywhere. CS:S is a fun fast paced FPS and I think everyone on steam should have this game. Oh... And one more thing, Dont just buy this game for Gary's Mod Textures. PLEASE!!!! "

Counter-Strike: Source ReviewCounter-Strike ported over to the Source engine.Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of the first Counter-Strike game. This game, instead of the first one, uses the source engine, and is easier to play. Counter-Strike: Source contains a friendly community and lots of different servers. I would say that this game is a lot less serious than the new game in the series, Global Offensive. I think Counter-Strike: Source has more entertainming minigame, roleplay and surfing servers and also has more of a friendly community. I'm not saying there are no deathmatch servers, Counter-Strike: Source is still a great FPS shooter, but if you're looking for ranks, proffesionals and amazing guns, go and get Counter-Strike: Global Offensive! Recommend this game! Thanks for reading!			"

												It really surprises me that there's still tons of people that play this game, but it also confuses me at the same time because how old is this game? 10 years old or something like that. There are only two reasons why I bought this game and I'm going to be perfectly clear on that, 1) I got it for Gmod textures just like everybody else that's buying this game now and 2) I bought it out of curiosity to see what the game was like back when it was in its glory days. After playing it for about a few weeks I can easily say I didn't have the fun I expected, mainly because I can't. If you're new to this game franchise don't expect it to be anything like Call of duty or Battlefield, you will get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked pretty fast if you play thinking that.Now I wouldn't go off and say that this is the most tactical first person shooter ever, it's really not, but it requires a lot of teamwork, a lot of patience and good aiming, mostly headshots, so if you can't hit anyone in the head you're not going to get anywhere. I really like how this game encourages teamwork and that if you can't do that you're going to get steamrolled unless you're a complete badass, I also like how there was a long list of weapons that you could use to customize and suit your needs. I also really like playing on those servers that allow up to 40 people on them that make for some really good 20 versus 20 matches, those can be very chaotic but at the same time that's what makes it extremely fun to play.Unfortunately I'm already running out of good things to say about this game and I really hate the fact that I have to say that. Overall the biggest problems with this game is its community, it feels wrong to really dislike a game because of the people that play it but in counterstrike sources case that's the truth.  Just like you would expect the community is full of nothing but haters, spammers, trolls, screaming 11-year-olds and people who think they're on top of the world just because they can kill you with a sniper rifle and while there are some good people, the bad mostly outweighs it. It's not only that but most of the servers you will go on will have people that are only willing to play one map which is usually dust or office and to make it even worse some of these people have the most inappropriate sprays I have ever seen. To add the icing on the cake there are some people that of been playing counterstrike source for years and are completely relentless against new players. We all know who I'm talking about, the people that can take you down in an instant as soon as you round the corner or the people that know every perfect peeking spot that you never thought to look at, I can't tell you how frustrating it is to walk 20 feet away from spawn only to get headshot across the map by a desert eagle when everyone in existence would agree that it was an impossible shot to make, yet these ""veterans"" are able to do it on a regular basis. It's even more of an insult when you light them up with the entire magazine of your gun and they can take it like a champ and still kill you by shooting you once, by the way this all happens normally in casual servers.If you're out there looking for a new first person shooter to get behind it's hard for me to recommend counterstrike source unless you're extremely confident, a unnaturally perfect shot or can deal with some of the weird/annoying people that play this game or you need it for Gmod textures. Besides this is an old game, like a 12 year old game, I think there are a lot of other multiplayer shooters out there that are new and way more worth our time. Don't give me hate, I'm just one person with one opinion.			"

												Counterstrike. Whether it's the original 1.6, CS:S or CS:GO, it keeps you coming back. But what's the appeal? The completely inane ballistics? The kids on voice chat who scream incoherently? The same maps over and over and over (de_dust2 for life)? That one guy who accuses you of hacking no matter what?This is Counterstrike. No one knows, Just play it.			"

												This game is as good as it used to be. It's maybe not as competetive as Csgo. But css has something in it that made me pretty much rebuy it on my new account. On my old accout I got 800+hrs on the game and still love it to this day. There is just something that makes me always want to go back to this game and play it at least a hr or two a week :)			"

												If you got this game, it was most likely was because you needed it to get rid of Garry's Mod ERRORS. I will admit though, it is still an amazing game. The game is dying, but it still has a pretty good amount of players playing it. The game is easy to learn and hard to master. Despite being a game that has lots of pro and older players, it feels easy for newer players to fight more experienced players. The weapons are all balanced and each one has its on feel to it. In a nutshell, it's like CS:GO but older, with less players, and with faster gameplay.			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is and will allways be one of the best fps games that were ever created, even though it is already out for years it still looks good and most important than that, it plays well. Gameplay is simple and well designed and the game grew for years with one of the biggest game communities and is right now looking better than ever. If you're looking for a great multiplayer game this one is a great choice, but right now if you're starting to play shooters online and you're looking for something to play with friends or even to help you make some friends I would go with Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, it has the same essence and you have better graphics, new games modes, new maps and a lot of new people that are changing communities and I'm sure the game will also grow in the next years.

												Therez suttin' ta be holla'd fo' dis game, n' by extension dis entire series. Put ya mutha♥♥♥♥in choppers up if ya feel dis! It aint nuthin but a game thatz part of tha oldschool breed dat has survived tha decade n' has mostly retained its visceral, gunfighter esque, snappy gameplay wit a underlyin competitve element dat forces tha playa ta outthink hos opponent first n' outreact themt ta a lesser degree. Everyone be a crewplayer, n' if you not, tha magic of dis game is dat it forces you to, fo' a lack of mo' betta lyrics, git phat at it, n' cuz of dat it propels tha user ta try n' stand toe ta toe wit veterans n' freshly smoked up blood alike on a almost punishingly level ground. Y'all KNOW dat♥♥♥♥♥♥ mutha♥♥♥♥a! Counter Strike Source is by far da most thugged-out ghettofab varaint of tha Counter Strike series, fo' tha phat reason dat past tha core elementz of tha game from rescuin hostages ta defusin (or planting) bombs, there be a much mo' user pimped content dat dis game owes its engine like a mutha♥♥♥♥a. This game be a must have, cuz if not fo' tha forever relevent competitizzle scene, itz fo' tha bhop maps, zombie escapes, jail breaks, mini games, n' fo' tha mobilitizzle ta git a game wit hthe Source Engine SDK.It aint nuthin but not a game dat has aethestically kept wit time yo, but its forumla has, n' I bet dat it will outlive even tha juggernautz of tha younger Call of Duty n' Battlefield titles. This be a game of not reqardin tha playa wit trinkets like ♥♥♥♥in freshly smoked up glocks or freshly smoked up faces ta wear yo, but of self satisfaction of whoopin up a entire enemy crew up in a cold♥♥♥♥♥lil clutch move n' brangin down tha hurt wit a well gots AWP. That runs deep, n' dis game aint NEVER gonna make you forget dat tha only thang seperatin you from acin wit a Deagle n' viewin yo' crew fro ma spectators seat is yo' own skill.ORIGINAL REVIEW BY        FlyAwayNow        http://steamcommunity.com//id/FlyAwayNow/ "

												Looking at Source and CS: GO, i would say source is the last classic cs. This does not mean source or GO are bad or whatever negative thing you can think of. Source is a modern take on classic 1.6 cs. Improvements in graphics and gameplay but strongly stuck to the same vibe and feels that 1.6 has. While GO is still very similar (its still cs...) it definetly took CS to a more intense and strategic direction, which makes sense taking into account the era of competitive games we are on. However, if you didnt experience 1.6 and all that classic cs, i do recommend taking a look at source... It doesnt have all the flashy (sometimes confusing) apparel GO has and offers that classic nostalgic plays of Lan days.  "

 A Solid Shooter	Counter-Strike is one of the most iconic FPS games out there and source is a great part of a good series of games. if you are familiar with it's sequel Counter-Strike Global Offensive then its pretty much the same experience but with a less up to date experience. the graphics and the mechanics are from 2004 but of course since then updated a bit, but nothing bad or clumsy in any way it just doesnt look like some next gen game. Counter-Strike and especially source is a really great game because of its many ways of playing it. Since the game isn't really played competitively anymore there is so many different ways to play the game. Counter-Strike has always been known for its many gamemodes and creative ways to play the game because of the many possibilitïes the game offers. The game is of course primarily focused around shooting but you can play more movement based ways of playing like surfing where you obtain immense speed by running on angled walls and flying around trying to avoid obstacles and play races. Or maybe some more RPG based gamemodes like jail where you are either an officer or a prisoner and tries to make sure everything stays in order or trying to escape. there is no end to what you can do is counter-strike and that is what makes the game so great. so if you are looking for a lot of possibilites for what you want to play or just a good shooter are counter-strike definitely worth a shot			"

												Counter-Strike: Source was one of the first games I had on Steam, basically all I had was Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch besides it.I never played the original Counter-Strike before Source, and the only FPS game I played was Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.Needles to say I got HOOKED.Especially when you play the game competitively with friends, or in a team/clan.Nowadays CS:Source seems a mess to me, since the orange box update a lot of things aren't how they were used to be. Luckily CS:GO fills in the gap, I'd recommend that game above CS:Source since it's slowly dying.			"

Comparison with nowadays AAA shooters of course cs:go wins!But true patriot prefer stay on 1.6 we used to call them counter life purist. If Valve didn't ♥♥♥♥ed up CS:S back in 2010 i would easily say that pimp my gun simulator wasn't needed.

Sadly nowadays the only way to replay the authentic CS:S version (CSS V34 // pre-orange box update) is to install Plan of Attack: Source a mod running on Source SDK Base 2013. But anyway everybody knows than the best CS sequel is tactical intervention..

												Counter-Strike: Source is an awesome FPS. I got this game instead of Day of Defeat when this and Garry's Mod went on sale for £3.74. Hell, this is worth so much more. Singleplayer, LAN and multiplayer are all included, LAN being my favourite as then I could play with my lil' bro. Graphics aren't so great, but the game was released on 1 November 2004 so I didn't expect them to be amazing. Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is the newer one, and has more to do and better graphics, but if you are going to buy Garry's Mod, BUY THIS GAME. Many textures need it.			"

												Counter-Strike: Source was one of the first games I had on Steam, basically all I had was Half-Life 2, and Half-Life 2 Deathmatch besides it.I never played the original Counter-Strike before Source, and the only FPS game I played was Medal of Honor: Allied Assault.Needles to say I got HOOKED.Especially when you play the game competitively with friends, or in a team/clan.Nowadays CS:Source seems a mess to me, since the orange box update a lot of things aren't how they were used to be. Luckily CS:GO fills in the gap, I'd recommend that game above CS:Source since it's slowly dying.			"

Comparison with nowadays AAA shooters of course cs:go wins!But true patriot prefer stay on 1.6 we used to call them counter life purist. If Valve didn't ♥♥♥♥ed up CS:S back in 2010 i would easily say that pimp my gun simulator wasn't needed.

Sadly nowadays the only way to replay the authentic CS:S version (CSS V34 // pre-orange box update) is to install Plan of Attack: Source a mod running on Source SDK Base 2013. But anyway everybody knows than the best CS sequel is tactical intervention..

												Геймплей остался верен старым добрым традициям “контры” – все те же две противоборствующие команды, выбираем одну из них, закупаемся и бежим уничтожать неприятелей. Игровой процесс происходит динамично, частенько все зависит от вашей реакции и секундный промах может решить исход схватки. Что еще порадовало, так это мгновенное переключение между оружием (дань реализму – прим. ред.), которое отсутствовало в предыдущих версиях, что является еще одним приятным нововведением. Достойное продолжение отличной игры – продвинутая графика, динамичный захватывающий геймплей, подборка хороших карт – истинный подарок для настоящего ценителя Counter-Strike			"

												First played CS while I was in highschool. This was a while back and it was awesome back then. So many years later, it is still probably the best shooter game out there to play with your friends. We play it with the guys at work almost on a daily basis. Yes it does have a few glitches every now and then, but to be honest, that is also part of the awesomeness... those glitches just make it more fun and frustrating at the same time. Lots of laughs are had while playing this game!			"

												As others have said, a lot of people buy Counter Strike: Source to get Garry's Mod working. That goes for me. I had the game in my library then one day decided to play it. It's tons of fun and easy to get into. While it doesn't have a lot of players like CSGO has, Counter Strike Source is still fun. There's still Surf, Gun Game, and more. There aren't any skins or knifes, it's just simple CT Vs T. Yes, it is more expensive than CSGO, but if you have a low-end computer and you can't run CSGO, then Counter Strike: Source is for you.  "

												If you are good at clicking your mouse and are capable of movement in your left hand, maybe you will like this. Otherwise, it's probably not worth your time. Having said that if your feet are particularly dextrous you might just get away with using them, probably not. Eyesight is also helpful, along with ears. However, you really need both to enjoy the game properly imo.			"

												Сама по себе игра не внушает интерес на 1-й взгляд . Но стоит порубать в неё хотябы пол часа , и вас будет за уши не оттащить .Что можно сказать о графе . Текстуры конечно малость не проработаны , до Battlefild конечно ей далеко . Восновном графон это не самое важное в игре . Важен процесс самой игры , который кстати сделан очень удобно и приятно . Плюс ко всему если у вас не комп а , гм ... ( воздержался ) , то это не конец света . Counter Strike Sourse весит около 4 гб и пойдёт с самыми мелкими лагами даже на ноутбуке со старой Windows .			"

												Counter-Strike, as pure as an online FPS can be.Yes. It is now an old game. With outdated graphics. Simple static environments. No fancy explosions. No vehicles. No fuzz.But that is exactly this game's strength. That purity and focus on realistic weapon mechanics and online multiplayer only. Pure skill, pure FPS love.And when you become an old impatient gamer like me and you only need that quick fix of pure FPS online action now and again. You don't want to wait for the game round to end when you die. You don't want to worry about team play...That's when you start to play The Mod within The Mod. Gungame of course.Evolving from the round based one-weapon-upgrade-per-round and respawn-next-round, to Gungame Turbo and then to the current Gungame Turbo Deathmatch. Instant weapon upgrade and instant respawn. It has become The Ultimate Fix. Super intense, forcing everyone to play with all the weapons in the game, competing against players in your own team as much as the opposite team. It has truly become one of the best deathmatch games out there, hands down.			"

												Counter-Strike: Source is a remake of Counter-Strike, and retains its team-based objective-oriented first-person shooter style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective: defusing the bomb, rescuing all hostages, or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round on most servers. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil. Shot damage depends upon where the bullet hits, with hits to the head often being lethal.			"

												There was a time, when this game was new. Graphics revealing, handling strange for the veterans. It was when a lot of people would say: ""bah, you play Source? 1.6 or Condition Zero is way better, it's a classic!""Now this game has become old itself. And I feel old, having this realization. That CS:GO is already out there, with a growing fanbase.But why do I keep coming back to CS:Source? Every once in a while I will start this game and play a few rounds and it will make me feel good. I just think Source has extremely satisfying movements, weapon feeling and the graphics are just good enough. For a competing shooter I don't need anything else. Source keeps the perfect balance between the old, a-bit clunky feeling of 1.6 and the over-heavy, much slower and more realistic handling of CS:GO. I don't need too much realism, I don't need  bullet-spraying weapons, that don't hit, when they're supposed to!For me, Counter Strike Source will always be the best shooter, because I grew on it. And I think there are a lot of people out there, that feel the same way. If you are below the age of 20, go for something else, otherwise this is the best dope you ever need for a quick and casual round. And there are also some nice mods out there, gungame, surfing, zombiemods, rpg, jumping, bunnyhopping maps, etc.... Man, I hope the servers will stay alive for some more years...Now I have to call my friends and ask for a LAN, in remembrance of good ol' times			"

												I rediscovered this gem when my video card kicked the bucket, and I was on an ancient 7800GT trying to find something it could still play in 2013.  Fortunately I stumbled upon the wonderful sFa server and became a part of their community.  Fun gameplay, awesome people... what's not to love?If you're unfamiliar with the gameplay of Counter-Strike, it's a round-based team elimination first-person shooter with slightly asymetrical objectives.  The most common mode has the terrorists trying to plant a bomb, and the counter-terrorists trying to defuse it if that happens.  Another popular mode requires the counter-terrorists to rescue hostages that the terrorists are guarding.  Frequently, the two teams will simply fight each other until only one is left standing.  There's an in-game money system that allows you to buy better equipment if you survive and do well, but many servers give free money at the start; this allows everyone to pick whatever guns they want.Why choose Source instead of Global Offensive?  Well, as new generations of gamers have moved on to CS:GO or Call of Duty, CS:S has retained a generally more adult crowd and relaxed atmosphere.  It's like hanging out in a pub after work, except you're all shooting at each other.  Another advantage of playing a game that was top-of-the-line 9 years ago is that it still looks alright today, but it will run buttery smooth on just about any hardware.			"

												There was a time, when this game was new. Graphics revealing, handling strange for the veterans. It was when a lot of people would say: ""bah, you play Source? 1.6 or Condition Zero is way better, it's a classic!""Now this game has become old itself. And I feel old, having this realization. That CS:GO is already out there, with a growing fanbase.But why do I keep coming back to CS:Source? Every once in a while I will start this game and play a few rounds and it will make me feel good. I just think Source has extremely satisfying movements, weapon feeling and the graphics are just good enough. For a competing shooter I don't need anything else. Source keeps the perfect balance between the old, a-bit clunky feeling of 1.6 and the over-heavy, much slower and more realistic handling of CS:GO. I don't need too much realism, I don't need  bullet-spraying weapons, that don't hit, when they're supposed to!For me, Counter Strike Source will always be the best shooter, because I grew on it. And I think there are a lot of people out there, that feel the same way. If you are below the age of 20, go for something else, otherwise this is the best dope you ever need for a quick and casual round. And there are also some nice mods out there, gungame, surfing, zombiemods, rpg, jumping, bunnyhopping maps, etc.... Man, I hope the servers will stay alive for some more years...Now I have to call my friends and ask for a LAN, in remembrance of good ol' times			"

												Counter-Strike, as pure as an online FPS can be.Yes. It is now an old game. With outdated graphics. Simple static environments. No fancy explosions. No vehicles. No fuzz.But that is exactly this game's strength. That purity and focus on realistic weapon mechanics and online multiplayer only. Pure skill, pure FPS love.And when you become an old impatient gamer like me and you only need that quick fix of pure FPS online action now and again. You don't want to wait for the game round to end when you die. You don't want to worry about team play...That's when you start to play The Mod within The Mod. Gungame of course.Evolving from the round based one-weapon-upgrade-per-round and respawn-next-round, to Gungame Turbo and then to the current Gungame Turbo Deathmatch. Instant weapon upgrade and instant respawn. It has become The Ultimate Fix. Super intense, forcing everyone to play with all the weapons in the game, competing against players in your own team as much as the opposite team. It has truly become one of the best deathmatch games out there, hands down.			"

												The FPS. Every Steam gamer ought to have this one at some point. It's a classic LAN party game. The game is simple, complehensible and quick yet challenging. There's a newer CS:Go with prettier graphics and friendlier controls. But This CS:Source runs on almost all the computers since 1995-ish and much more mods are available which can not run on CS:Go. Some of them are crazy fun. "

												Difficult. It is pretty hard to play the game well, but once you do, and it won't take TOO long, you won't want to stop. Very good FPS, could use a few more players but really if you want to play with more people CS:GO is probably the game for you. Would reccomend.			"

												At first I had no interest to play this game, I only brought it for the Garys Mod textures but while I waited for servers to load, I tried out the game and I was hooked. It's my favorite game for numerous reasons:                        1.Unlike more know shooters[COD]which have a horrible community, most players here are here to have fun, not to scream like baby's each time they die2.Never once have I come across a hacker, all servers I'm on are hacker free and so I have a great experience.3.Unlike games that have microtransactions for guns or gun skins or use a pay to win system, CS Source has zero transactions and I heard the newer CS has those types of transactions.4.The game has a more exciting and risky feeling to it. It doesn't have respawns until the round is over or rewards for killstreaks since knowing you have stopped someone from causing your team trouble is reward enough.I feel this game is better than the newer CS which has more hackers, transaction and screaming kids.CS Source has a more realistic feel to it and I think the extra 5 dollars are worth it.
