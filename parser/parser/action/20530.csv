												Oh no. A door I can't get past. Well I could go and backtrack for 3 hours and fight enemies that have respawned again, looking for that keycard... or I could just blow a hole in the wall and go around it. Like literally anyone carrying explosives would do.THIS IS WHY RED FACTION IS ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER MADE. WHY IS THIS THE ONLY GAME WHERE THAT'S A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OPTION.			"

Pros-Good story-Fun mechanics-Variety of weapons.Cons-No auto save feature, only manual saves.-The sneaking around missions are tediousNeutral-People talking to you can be drowned by the action around.Tips-Use the purefaction patch to be able to play in widescreen and at an higher resolution than the game allows (make sure to dowload the beta, this is the only version that works with steam. Check out the guide in the community section for more info)-Lock the framerate to 60. Anything higher and it will cause some game breaking bugs.Still a classic. Grab it and have fun.			"

												A great game despite its age . And this maybe, I guess is the first game to introduce, destructive buildings and objects. Although, I started playing new games I got addicted to the game until I finished it, if you dont mind dated graphics, you must try it and the gameplay and mechanics are awesome for its age. In this game you can drive submarines and jeep at some points which was a surprise as I didnt expect it. The story is good but , not great, The protagonist seems a bit hot-headed guy at some points who only wants revenge  . The AI could act foolish sometimes, but that dosent matter much to me. The enemies get harder to kill as you progress through the story, and new and overpowered Weapons are unlocked and  its always fun to blow walls and things up with the rocket launcher.And the music of the game is also great, really matches the mood of the game. And the great part is the multiplayer is still alive after all these years, although only 10-11 players , but after getting the pure faction mod you can get more players and more new maps to join. Now my conclusion is: Its a must play for those who like old-school FPS games , and I would also recommend others to give it a shot , A great game overall . I give it a 9/10.			"

												It's a rainy thursday evening, and Summer-Rainhas a thermometer sticking out of her mouthas she curls up in bed, shifting underneath thecovers. You feel her forehead tenderly with yourhand's exterior before checking her temperature.""Seems like it's going down..."" You tell her, whileshe pulls a long face. You open your laptop andengage the Steam client, looking for a game toplay together, a simple one, to take her mind offof the fever. Suddenly she grabs your arm, andorders you to stop scrolling in your library.""What's that one? I've heard of it, but it doesn'tseem familiar."" Summer-Rain points at a gameyou remembered buying on the franchise sale.RED FACTION.You tell Summer-Rain about how you were tenyears old when the game came out and you hadto play as a miner named Parker who started asa disenfranchised worker on Mars before leadingan entire Revolution against his evil company,Ultor. Summer-Rain pulls the sheets up to her nose and says she wants ice cream while she watches you play Red Faction. After a short trip to the kitchenand fetching her a bowl of vanilla ice cream, theintroductory cutscene plays as Parker narrateshis down-on-his-luck life as a miner on Mars.The introductory level opens quickly enough. Afellow miner is provoked into assault with theguards, and all hell breaks loose, with you quicklyobtaining a stun baton to bludgeon guards withand a 9mm pistol as a basic firearm. Remote charges that stick to targets and grenades round out your arsenal in this starting stage, and Summer-Rain laughs while you latch remote charges to the oncoming Guards, their arms flailing wildly as they scream and run about before you detonate them.You encounter an APC amid a rocky bridge asSummer-Rain tells you to be careful, expectingyou to face the APC head-on with your RocketLauncher which has minimal ammo. You opt toblow up the two edges of the rock bridge, which sends the Guards and the APC falling to theirdeath down the ravine below.""How-?!"" Summer-Rain exclaims, before tellingher that this game has Geo-Mod technology, aprecursor to DICE's Frostbite engine and theirdestruction 2.0. ""Although this game is from2001, almost everything you see that isn't partof the preprogrammed story is fully destructable.""You are soon taking on Guards in drilling vehicles,travelling between sabotaged power plants inSubmarines and even taking to the skies in onelevel in one of Ultor's AESIR Fighters. By now, youhave obtained an Assault Rifle, a Shotgun, thedeadly Precision Rifle with 4x zoom scope andalmighty Sniper Rifle with 10x zoom scope.Through it all, Summer-Rain mindlessly munches ice cream in anticipation of what comes next, with Parker laying waste to everything before him in his quest to be free of Ultor and Mars.The villains of the game, Dr. Capek and later thecold, calculating mercenary Masako, prove to besome of the most difficult boss fights in the gamewith your meager health and zero modern-daymechanics a player takes for granted, such asshields and auto-save checkpoints. When you die and you had the unfortunate habit of not saving in a game like Red Faction, you find yourself at the beginning  of the Miner Uprising at the start of the game, having to do it all. over. again.The supporting characters of Red Faction areminimal, but they all compliment the story verywell. The hacker Hendrix is a non-annoyingversion of Otacon, Summer-Rain observes, whileshe likes the no-nonsense attitude of the RedFaction leader Eos, and her right-hand manOrion, who appears only a few times, but chewsup scenery well with his sincere voice acting.The enemies of Red Faction progress incrediblywell. First there are regular guards, then theOfficers, with their rough-and-tumble blackassault rifles, red visors, yellow trim and bitingattitudes to match. Later, armored Mercenaries take over the enemy role, armed with heavy machine guns, one-hit-kill Railguns (which can see and shoot through walls) and the dreaded Fusion Rocket Launcher.The end comes, and you have to disarm abomb that Eos is strapped to, but the controlsto disarm the bomb make no sense, and youswear to the High Lords of Valhalla that thetimer is rigged. Summer-Rain has long finishedher vanilla ice-cream, cowering under theblanket and hoping you can save Eos in time.The screen fades to white, and both of youfind yourselves at the main menu of the game,where you load your last save and find thatyou have to fight Masako in her AESIR Fighteragain before you can try to disarm the bombshe strapped to Eos. Summer-Rain heaves asmall sigh of disappointment.""I could never figure out the sequence in timeback then anyway."" You shrug, apologizingto Summer-Rain. She sets aside your laptopand draws you in for a hug. Summer-Rainthanks you for showing her a game fromyour childhood, and if anything, she enjoyedthe ride with you, watching you play asParker and try to take down the UltorCorporation has her feeling better thanthe fever that got her down.You smile and say that you have to goand prepare some things for tomorrow'sclass before you can join her for the night.""Go on, go on... hurry back so I don't gettoo cold without you!"" She says. You nod,and reach for your laptop, before her handcloses on yours. ""Leave the laptop."" Sheorders, and you shrug as you leave to packyour bags for the class tomorrow.As you leave her room, you hear the soundof swooshing doors of the main menu themeand a guard shouting the familiar words toa certain Parker...""HOLD IT, MINER!""You turn round and see Summer-Rainlooking away from you at the ceiling, hermouth in mock whistling. ""Better red than dead, huh Summer?"" She beams back at you.RED FACTION. "

												What happens when you mix the first Half-Life game with the original Total Recall movie (1990)? The first game on the Red Faction franchise featured a narrative and playable style very similar to Valve's first title and was set on a martian colony in a dystopian future like the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie.PROS:- Solid gameplay (very similar to the first Half-Life with a low gravity twist thanks to the martian surface).- Non-Stop levels (the maps doesn't count with a ""beginning"" or ""end"" per se, just like the first Half-Life game).- Multiple fully controllable aerial, marine and land vehicles (each one counts with a precise control and multiple weapons/modes of fire).- Lots of cool futuristic weapons (each one with its corresponding primary and secondary fire mode).- Multiple ways to reach an objetive or location (alternatives routes prevent the game to be fully lineal).- Destructible enviroments (the Geo-Mod Technology allows you to use this to your advantage for destroying enemy cover, finding secrets, create shortcuts, alternative routes, etc).- Some great graphical aspects for its age (dynamic lighting and water effects).- Despite its age, the Multiplayer game mode remains active with more than 30 servers with players (at the moment of writing this review).CONS:- Given the Non-Stop character of the maps, the game does not save your progress automatically (there is no Auto-Save, so you have to be very aware to Quick-Save from time to time. Also, you only have one Quick-Save slot, so you have to know when and where to do it).- some dialogue and characters are cliche and even generic (from my POV).- The IA tends to cheat towards the end of the game, firing weapons that pass through walls/cover out of your vision range (although some weapons allows you to do the same thing).- A little short.If you liked the first Half-Life game regarding narrative, design, shooting mechanics and adding that you can control several vehicles, plus the atmosphere of the original Total Recall movie (1990) you have a winner in here.There are Mods that allows you to play the game with widescreen and modern resolutions, in addition to correct some bugs (although i played the original Steam version).My Score: 7.6/10Note: Played it on Windows XP - SP3			"

												Really awesome game, amazing mechanics and graphics for its time, I mean it has a fully destructible map, most modern shooters don't have that, well worth the price, here are some guides you need to do if you're running this on a modern rig though. Use this guide if you're planning to play this game on a modern Windows 7 computer because the base game is a mess when it comes to that

												Good Story that has an interesting plot that makes you feel for the miners. I would say 2nd best of the Red Faction Series behind Red Faction Guerilla. One of the first games to introduce destructable enviroments. Good selection of weapons that are very fun to use on enemies and the enviroment. Fun and immersive gameplay. Is linear but not is a hindrance.			"

												Disclaimer: I feel the need to mention that I worked at Volition 5 years after Red Faction came out.  I worked on Red Faction Guerrilla and Armageddon both.   I no longer work at Volition and my employment there has only minimal effect on the review (I learned how hard it was to deliver Red Faction to the fans.)  However I feel that I'm able to write this review with out a bias. Red Faction is a very unique game.  Playing it 15 years after it came out, and the strongest feeling from playing the game is how gimmicky the famous Geomod destruction is.  At the same time, there's quite a bit to like about Red Faction, and even for a ""gimmick"" Geomod is really unparalleled as an accomplishment.  Even later games in the series never reach the same heights as the original. To get it out of the way, THE reason to play this game is the Geomod destruction models.  And honestly, it's one of the coolest features.  The player has the ability to use explosives to blow holes walls and buildings, and is able to use those holes to enter the building.   There are stalactites all over the game that can be knocked down with a simple explosion.  The world actually has physics on all these objects.   From a technical standpoint this really is a unique feat, especially for a game that came out around the time of the PS2, but from gameplay side.  Well there's the problem. Red Faction Guerilla (the third game in the series)  shows how cool destruction can look and feel during gameplay.  The issue is in Red Faction, the player never feels like he has a wealth of these weapons.  In addition explosions do huge damage the the player, so he tends not to use explosives.  in addition there's not many explosive barrels in this game as others, and when a computer explodes it appears to not to damage to the ground or building. Add to this the fact that a decent number of walls/ground and areas seem to be impervious, it makes it less likely the player is going to use geomod effectively  That's a real problem in my book, because it's a major feature.  A  major feature that the player doesn't use. As for the rest of the game.  Well if you excuse the old style of gameplay, you'll actually find a pretty good game.  I was wrapped up in the story.  In fact there was a good amount of the game where I just wanted to see what happens next. The story involves a miners' revolt on Mars, and a resistance.  The resistance though is a bit laughable because every time you meet someone from the resistance it seems they live just long enough for you to find them and then they die.  Luckily you are the great hero in the game.  Not one of prophecy but the one who actually can fight and not die (mostly).  The story is worth playing through, so I won't go over it, but honestly, there's not a ton of twists, just solid story telling.  I enjoyed the story more than I expected, and that's kind of impressive for such an old game.  There's almost constant discussion and interactions with people.  Again that's quite unique for the time. The one thing with the gameplay is the AI in this game is a little weak.  Granted most shooters at the time were weak, the AI in this game tends to zigzag all over the place.   Half life came out the year before and had slightly better AI (or at least different).  The thing is the enemies in this game are a bit hard to kill, so that's works.  It's just a bit silly looking at time.  Otherwise the gameplay is solid for it's time. The other thing to mention is that the game does take the player through enough areas with a lot of variety that they don't get tired of it.  The rock formations are dull brown, but this was before everything had to be brown.  There's office buildings, facilities for the planet. One thing that annoyed me is after about 70 percent of the game, the sound started cutting out.  now I had done a marathon gaming session, about 7 hours, maybe something ran out of memory and stopped talking, but it seemed pretty reproducible, so I missed some of the final area's dialog, and that annoyed me. The other thing is I had to use a cheat code.... on easy mode... for a boss.  Because that boss was... I'd call it broken.  I'm kind of shocked how hard he was so I cheated just so I can see the rest of the game and story.  It was really annoying, but that was the only place where the game had a huge difficulty spike.  As long as the player autosaves reasonably often they'll make it through the game with out a lot of problems.   But watch out for Capek's boss fight. Overall though Red Faction is a great game for 2001.  And playing it now, it's interesting.  I won't call it the best game ever, however it's an interesting technical feat, and the game and story is quite good.  The graphics have aged, very poorly, but overall the game is entertaining.  If you want to see something that's old but still works great, Red Faction is a good pick up.  Just don't expect anything like the later sequels, which took the destruction in a different direction.			"

												My thoughts about this game are mixed, so I'll shorten them down:Things I liked about the game:-Decent story-Fun gameplay-Cool guns-Decent voice acting-Semi-free roam gameplay-Almost everything was explodable-With enough RPG/Grenade/Satchel Charge ammo, you could make a tunnel in a wall-You can kill everyone (including ""innocent"" bystanders) except for vital charactersThings I didn't like about the game:-Game felt a little too long-Repetative enemies -Repetative enemy voices-The voice acting was decent, but writing, dialogue, and and cutscenes were awful-The cutscenes were REALLY awful. It's almost like they didn't even try-The conclusion/ending of the game felt void and unrewarding-The villains were boring-Some levels were way too big to enjoy-Vehicle controls were awful-The jumping felt a little too floatyFinal thought:The game was really fun to play through. However, as mentioned before, the game felt a little too long and the outcome was unrewarding. The story was okay, but wasn't oscar-worthy. I'm half and half about this game, which really makes me wish Steam had a ""Maybe"" option aobut recommending this game.P.S. (spoilers, kinda)There's a part in the game (that many have experienced) where a submarine you need to progress explodes for no reason. You can't get it back, either. There's another part similar when fighting a giant robot, you have to trick it into falling into a giant spinning fan. The robot sometimes glitches and refuses to move. This robot deals massive amounts of damage, making it extremely frustrating to deal with. In times like these, I recommend using the cheatcode ""vivalahelvig"" to get passed them. You can enter that cheatcode in-game by typing it into the ""~"" commands. It's the god-mode cheat, and you can turn it on and off as many times as you like by simply just typing ""vivalahelvig"" again. You should get a message on the lower center screen if it worked.			"

												A middling recommendation. If you like a twitch-shooter, you'll probably love it.(I started on RF Guerrilla and Armageddon and love them both, and played this one for some context.)You can view the game's opening here.Guns are great, and destructible terrain is fun. Game-play rewards tactical thinking and choosing the correct weapon for the right situation. Game-play and gun-play are smooth, and graphics are pretty good for a game from 2001; I never had my immersion broken b/c of low-res textures. Level design never felt boring, though it was sometimes mildly confusing. Some things are just outright frustrating, though. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent generation of games that have direction finders and maps (though I didn't have a problem in Max Payne or Max Payne 2), but lack of directions and small switches to press to proceed can equal many minutes of running around aimlessly, looking for the way forward. Health is at a premium on any difficulty. Story is meh. Voice acting (except for Hendrix) is sub-par. Music is annoying and repetitive. The final levels felt tacked on, making the game too long - though, at 6 hours for a run-through, the game is actually anything but long.And while I didn't have the bugs that other gamers have encountered (like the submarine exploding for no reason), I could only play an hour or so before the voices stopped sounding. I had to exit the game, and verify the file cache. There were usually 3 files that had to be re-acquired. Once done, the game proceeded normally - for another hour or so. Annoying, but not really game-breaking (I wasn't playing with any mods). Worth a look for for any Red Faction fan, or someone who enjoys old-school shooters. But there will be no hand-holding. Or clues. Or detailed directions.EDIT: Played with the Pure Faction mod installed, and the above problem with the voices disappeared.			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: Volition IncPublishers: THQ Nordic Initial release: Sept 2001Genre: FPS, Space #Worth/NotWorth: #WorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationRed Faction is one of my favorite shooters of all time so right up front this is going to be heavily biased. I can remember many a time experimenting with the Geo-Mod engine building my own tunnels in multiplayer with a rocket launcher and explosives for probably in retrospect far more time then I should have.You play as Parker, a miner that works in the mines on Mars for an overbearing company mistreating its workers for profit named Ultor. Parker unsuspectingly finds himself the unintentional leader of this inevitable revolution to lead his fellow minors off of Mars for retribution for the blatant negligence of the company charged with their protection and safe working environment. Given how old the game is the visuals still hold up, the geo-mod engine is still giving modern destructible environments a run for their money.Its fast paced and still twitchy. There is a very generous auto-aim likely akin to it being a console port but this can be turned off. The weapons are varied and features multiple types of vehicle sequences. Though over all the game is rather linear; the way you get down the proverbial “hallway” is up to you. The PC version does have a game breaking glitch that was never patched out however a fix can be found fairly easily with a search on the web. It glitch involves a door that will not open and conceals a button required to drop a sub into the bay to progress. The now defunct THQ will always hold as special place in my heart because of how many hours I spent in this game in my youth. For the sake of reference, brevity and hopefully a sense of reputability/relatedness and solidarity I was one year away from entering High School upon this games release. It was the quite impressionable game for me then and remains still. THE GISTThe series took a turn from it's roots favoring more destruction than the “je ne sais quoi” that the original wrought.Follow my curation for more "

This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend Red Faction skip to Results and read from there.Volition, Inc. provides an amazing action experience that brings you back through the ages. Red Faction is the start of an amazing series which provides a possibly reality to early space colonization.Story:You play Parker a man who travelled to Mars in order to work for Ultor Corporation and create himself a future. Ultor Corporation lures miners with the promise of a future. Little do they know the corporation is manipulating the media to show people a completely different light of what is really going on. Breaking basic Human Rights Ultor is essentially torturing miners forcing them to work in terrible conditions. But all is about to change as the Red Faction rises up from the dust and who is going to be unwittingly a part of the rebellion, but Parker. As you progress through the campaign you learn more about the horrible tortures that Ultor is actually conducting.Campaign:The campaign is broken up into 12 levels: Mines, Registration, Abandoned Mines, Gryphon, Canyon, Comm Center, Barracks, Docking Bay, Geothermal Plant, Capek, Subway, and Shuttle. The game takes you through the underground of mars, through canyons, and to space itself. Throughout the campaign you will be put against bosses, environmental hazards, and hordes of enemies. Gameplay:The game has an array of difficulty levels that allow you to enjoy a casual simple first person shooter to a hard-core gaming experience. Red faction has a variety of weapons: FCA-26 Rail Driver, UAR-42 Assault Rifle, F-1TL Fusion Rocket Launcher, URL-6T Rocket Launcher, UBS-4 Riot Shield, UFT-1 Flame Thrower, UCB-24 Control Baton, USP-16 Pistol, UAP-32/20 Sub Machine Gun, UAS-18 Shotgun, UHG-90 Offensive Hand Grenade, URC-15 Remote Charge, JF60 Heavy Suppression Machine Gun, MK/SG-1 Defender Pricision Rifle, and USG-50 Sniper Rifle. The massive combination of weapons provides a very deep gameplay experience allowing you to go for a close and personal combat all the way to a long-distant assassin. The scenery is highly destructible allowing you to blow holes into walls, destroy furniture, and even destroy parts of scenery making it fall onto enemies below. Results:Red Faction is an amazing first person shooter that offers amazing combat and a fantastic story. Red Faction may be an older title, but it offers features still not fully offered in games today. The campaign has pretty decent length and you will not be regretting the purchase. This game is a fantastic experience, and I would recommend getting it as part of the Red Faction Collection when it goes on sales. As the other titles of the series are definitely a great group of games. Pros:+Loads of weapons.+Destructible environment.+Great difficulty curve.+Boss fights+Fun vehicle scenes.+Great gameplay that varies throughout the campaign from full blown action to assassin style.Cons:-Audio levels make it hard to hear cinematic scenes when action is occurring.-Make sure to save a lot or when you die you will be wishing you did.-It is old, thus it has poor GFX (if you can't enjoy games for their content alone and you need them to be pretty you may want to avoid this).

												Red Faction 1 comes from the semi-awkward gaming era of the early 2000s. It has some really cool stuff for an aging FPS - vehicles to drive, lots of weapons with multiple firing modes, stealth tactics, destructible environments, and solid character animation. Fairly innovative.It was probably overshadowed by Halo at the time of its release, but if you can get this game cheap, it's a fun run-and-gun shooter. Story is pretty standard, ragtag rebellion of miners against the evil greedy corporation.It was definitely too short. And if you don't do your saves right, the last 10 minutes of the game can leave you stuck and you'd have to start a new game. Also, the game gets pretty repetitive when you start fighting tougher enemies who can only be properly killed with the top 4 weapons in the game.But since I love old-school fps action I recommend it.

												Red Faction is an entertaining FPS that doesn't stray too far from 1990's shooter conventions.It features a wide selection of weapons (most of which have an atrocious spread), some bullet-spongy enemies, levels with more than one way to traverse, a campy B-Movie style narrative and, what now seems to be a Volition staple, a huge spike on difficulty in the later levels.It's a shame that the destructible environments are not a very prominent aspect of the game, but it's understandable that it would break the game's scripting and so it ends up being just a gimmick.Parker, the protagonist, comes off as both a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a simpleton, some of his interactions with other characters are cringe-worthy but provide some chuckles, and you end up wishing someone would wipe off that stupid smirk of his face.As released on Steam, the game needs Pure Faction to work properly, prevent the bugs mentioned in other reviews and support widescreen resolutions.It's a fun ride, a bit rough around the edges, sometimes a bit frustrating, but works.

												Workers unite!  Our martian manpower will no longer be abused and neglected for corporate greed!That's right, we're taking some Irreverend Opinions into Red Faction!---The BlurbA first person shooter where you are the only one who can save the miners of Mars from oppression and effective slavery.  The exploitative and heavy-handed mining operation on Mars advertises itself as something very different to their workbase, and the corporation in charge seems happy to live up to the 'bad guy' template.  Spearhead the independence of the Red Planet!The GoodEnjoyable gameplay, though as of today (2015), it's a bit dated.  The AI is simple, but not unintelligent - giving yourself away means guards will track you down.  The plot is simple, but gives a good pace and leaves little doubt to who is deserving of the 'hero' title.The weapons have a decent variety to them, and let you choose your preferences for taking opponents out, with their own feel and method of play.  You also get the feel of the main character being a miner, not a professional soldier, with the way that accuracy is handled - even with the reticle dead on, your shots may spread.  It's easy to visualise that as being drift from an inexperienced shot.The BadThe sound quality was a bit average, even for the time, with some noticeably cheap voice acting and special effects more akin to an arcade game than a first person shooter.  It's not bad enough to be cringeworthy, but it does break immersion pretty badly at times.As said, the game's dated now, with graphics having been left well behind*.  The AI is a little predictable, running to you, shooting/hitting at you, and then running away if they get hurt, before returning to repeat the cycle.* The Pure Faction patch[www.purefaction.org] can fix many features for modern systems.The Ugly""Destroyable terrain"", huh?  For a game that made a big scene about this being so much of an important feature, they let the ball drop.  A handful of walls and floors can be broken through, but this amounts to a bit of padding around the rooms, and certainly doesn't carry into anything akin to walls collapsing, rockfalls, or anything else that this might engender, and certainly doesn't allow you to bypass set checkpoints arbitrarily strewn about.SuggestionsHonestly, use the ""Pure Faction"" patch (listed above) to quickly get a big improvement to your game.  NB: The PureFaction patch will not display you as playing according to Steam's tracking.The SummaryWas a good game in it's time, much worth the 8/10 I'd give it.  Tried to break the mold for shooters and left an imprint on the industry.  Today, I'd still give it that - but this is from someone who doesn't mind the graphics in Minecraft.---If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group "

												There is a lot to say about this game, both good and bad. This game has a lot of design elements that aren't seen any more in other shooter franchises, for better or for worse. Seeing this game's multiplayer years ago during the early days of Counter Strike, I was enthralled by its advanced destruction physics and somewhat detailed gibs. Playing through the single player again recently, I nociced how fresh and different the weapon behaviours were.The gameplay is fast and brutal, the enemies don't have a lot of health, and they have weapons that can rip you apart in an instant, encouraging players to play either carefully, or agressively. The weapons sound very meaty and are very satisfying to fire. There are also the inclusion of NPCs that react to your actions, either firing at them, pulling your weapon out, or approaching certain NPCs with an injury. In a way, there is a lot to be compared to Half-Life 1 with the fast, brutal encounters, the linearity with some tribute paid to exploration, the interactive NPCs, and the general Sci-Fi theme. What sets it apart though, are the advanced destruction physics which allows you to blow open walls and structures, sometimes revealing secret passages or shortcuts, giving players a feeling of agency.However, there are plenty of issues that hold this game back, the most noteable of which is the pathfinding AI, which frequently gets enemy NPCs stuck on geometry or simply shut-down, turning them into still statues until you start shooting at them. The stealth sections felt crowbared in as a very flimsy excuse to reset the player inventory for each act, and they are not very compelling or properly implemented as the enemy AI creates scenarios where stealthing through each section are nigh impossible. It is often better to just run through the enemies, as they're too inaccurate to land enough hits on you to kill you, or blow through them, as they provide more than enough supplies when they die. Not only that, the stealth sections are programmed so that you can never fall below 1 health. Another thing is that the weapons that the enemies use during the third act of the game pretty much makes it so that the best way to get through a section would be to save-scum after every encounter, since the snipers can shoot at you through walls with their Rail-Drivers and it's extremely random whether they would hit or not. There's also the weak major boss battles where the only weapon capable of defeating them is the flamethrower, and the ending which throws an arrow guessing game at you at random instead of an epic battle.  One more final thing that holds this game back is that, unlike Half Life 1, the graphics and model quality simply didn't age well.Despite its flaws though, there is a very good game underneath and I feel that had Volition had more time to polish and do QA testing, this game would be able to stand abreast of Half Life 1 as a landmark piece of gaming curios. Do I recommend this game? Definitely! There is a lot to like about this game, and for just $9.99 you can definitely do a worse than play this game. If you decide to pick this game up though, it is imperative that you download and install the Pure Faction 3.0 patch and the Pure Faction 3.0c beta update, as it adds a ton of fixes that improves the experience immensely, like widescreen resolution support and mouse raw input.

												A few years ago, I would have said to you: Red Faction? No way! And you would have probably told me: You never played it. Well, for once, you're wrong. Back then, I did try to play Red Faction. The problem is that I was already lost after a few seconds and my younger self didn't like open-world or games with multiple paths. And on a sale, months ago, I bought the four Red Faction games.Red Faction puts you in the shoes of a Martian miner, oppressed by the Ultor Corporation (who is also doing illegal stuff). One day, a guard triggers a riot in the mines and Parker (it's you), to survive, takes a weapon and begins to find his way while shooting the enemies. He knows about Red Faction, a rebellious group fighting Ultor. He becomes that day one of them and a hero. But Parker uncovers also nasty secrets...While the plot is basically common (the corporation doing illegal research and oppressing its employees), it's still interesting to see where it leads. To my big regret, I didn't really understand it. One moment, you're told about the plague, another one, it's about nanotechnology and the final one, it's about mercs. Anyway, the universe that was set seemed to have evolved into something more coherent but the fact is that the game isn't really answering some questions: Who is Eos? What's Masako background? And why are the guards so cruel? What about Parker? How come the Red Faction managed to infiltrate the Merc base? See, many questions, no answers.I know the gameplay: shoot, lock and load. But I must say that I really appreciate the passages where you can take control of a vehicle: submarine, helicopter, jeep, etc.. It was refreshing back then. Not even Half-Life had that diversity. Besides, when you consider the weapons, while they're the usual ones (rifles, pistols), some of them are just great to use... Too bad they arrived way late in the game. But still they're there. My only concern is the overpowered Merc. They can kill you quickly and sometimes, you don't know from where they're coming from, they're spawning endlessly (and you can see it actually). But put a Merc with a Railgun and you're dead immediately. Game over. Well, it's fair because if you use the weapon, it's the same result but sometimes, you're wondering how they can touch you when you're hidden. Or when the door is just opening. Also, the end of the game is pretty hard: so many enemies, so few health packs. Its result was that I was with 5 HP knowing that I had a Merc with a Fusion Rocket Launcher after the corner and that I couldn't run far enough before the explosion. I managed to survive. But after I don't know how many tries.And when I said that I was lost, it's true. I was often wondering what to do. I mean, I didn't have an objective put somewhere and given the Geo-Mod engine that will let you create your own path by destroying walls or floors, you can ask yourself where to go. And the developers made sure to make hesitate about the right way. For example, during your first stealth mission, Hendricks is only telling after a few minutes that you need to go on the third floor. So, the time I've wasted checking every office was frustrating me. And I didn't know where to go as some doors were guarded. That's an example of objectives not being precise enough.I can't really complain about the graphics: after all, the game was done at the end of the 90'. When you see graphics now, it's logic to think that they're ugly. However, I find them pretty good for the time. A little too brown for my taste but it's due to the time that the character spend in the underground, mines or other canyons. I really enjoyed the lab and the space station and part of the Merc base. What was also good was the fact that you could destroy nearly everything on your screen and kinda make your own path. It's something I didn't do apart if it was part of the story, because well, let's be honest: I'm not into explosive stuffs.Another good thing is the soundtrack. It's suiting the game well. And the voice acting of Hendricks and Eos is good. Parker, though, sounded like a spoiled angry kid. And there is something that may contributed to my confusion and my misunderstanding of the story: sometimes, sound (voice and music) weren't playing and dialogues in the cut scenes weren't in sync. I don't know if it's a problem of old game - new computer or if it was already the case back then.Anyway, I don't know if I should play it again or not. Yeah, there are several levels of difficulty. But given my experience at the end of the game, I don't know if I would able to do harder than I did.Red Faction was also a game including multiplayer. I didn't try it, so I can't say anything about it. But I suppose that it was involving Red Faction and Ultor and that the Geo-Mod Engine played its part in it.And this is it. I can't say much more about that game. What is staying is that you should at least try it. Get over the graphics, get over the weird plot and enjoy the experience. After all, who doesn't want to be the hero of a revolution?PS: yeah, I published that first on another site and forgot to paste it here.			"

												Red Faction, a game which I never heard of until I bought this game along with other 2 sequels for like 3-4 euros or something.At first it appeared to me as like one of those ""I try to be half life clone, but I fail miserably"", but at the same time I didn't really care because I got this game for cheap and who cares if it turns out to be a pile of dog turds.Boy was I wrongThis game is unique in alot of ways. The most famous feature of this game is it's engine, which would be the staple of all future Red Faction games. In short words, you can destroy everything, even walls. Yes even walls. This adds a whole new direction of gameplay, The story is... well let's be honest, the story is pretty mediocre, but this is one of those games where you don't care about the story, you only want to blow things up.Though I would recommend more Red Faction Guerilla if you want to blow MORE things into more tiny pieces, you should give this game a try, it's fun. Skip the Red Faction 2 though, that game isn't worth your time.			"

Loved soundtrack, ability to destroy environment, fast shooting, missions with vehicles, it felt somewhat like Half Life with that Mars interior crawling, especially with monster part. First parts were easy and You'd learn there how to fight, at the end though it becomes real challenge to survive. Must-play classic FPS.			"

Note:  You have to get something called purefaction for it to work on Win7 I believe.   It's been a while since I did it, but if I remember correctly, it doesn't run on newer windows without that patch/program. I loved the story and soundtrack to this game.			"

												I was pretty shocked that a game I picked up for 79p and had last played about 12 years ago turned out to be one of my most enjoyable gaming experiences in recent memory. Don't be fooled by the game's age - if you've never played Red Faction before, or, like me, had simply forgotten about it over time, it's immediately obvious that it's a surprisingly solid shooter, and a fantastic PC port to boot, given it's age. The controls are smooth and responsive, and whilst the default mapping is not entirely intuitive this can obviously be corrected quite easily. This smooth control scheme lays a solid base over which the rest of the game is very competently assembled. Visually, Red Faction is head and shoulders above many shooters of the time, offering varied locals (from claustrophobic mines, to sterile office environments, to sprawling underwater caverns), a good dose of atmosphere, and of particular note - fantastic lighting. The lighting in this game holds up so well that I often found myself just walking around the environment observing how the lighting effects the various surfaces around me. The levels are often non-linear, which can be confusing at times, but more often than not simply makes the environment feel like a more realistic, lived-in place. You can play multiple times and find new things every time, which for a game that is essentially a corridor shooter, is pretty cool, I think. Gameplay is quite varied with well-designed gunplay supplimented with stealth, driving, flying, and submarine sections. The stealth is passable, and if you follow the rules everything works. The flying and diving vehicles control beautifully and blowing up an enemy sub underwater results in some great underwater explosion effects which are imaginative and impressive even in hindsight. There's a raft of fun weapons to use as well, most of which have their own alternate fire, including the most fantastically OP flamethrower in video game history. The soundtrack is a standout, with wonderfully moody electronic tracks perfectly supplimenting the action, and giving the game an irreplacable personality. And of course I have to mention the environmental destruction. Whilst it isn't exactly a gameplay staple as much as it is a useful gimmick, it absolutely improves the experience when your battles dynamically scar the environment around you. Walking away from a gunfight with holes in the walls and scorch marks on all surfaces is a great feeling, and it's the moments when you forget about the mechanic, and then an enemy blows a hole in the wall you're hiding behind that you truly appreciate just how much this little touch does to improve the immersion. It's worth noting as well that this mechanic completely changes your multiplayer experience for the better, as you can strategically shatter your opponent's cover around them - I've never played more local VS. in my life than I did this game when I owned it on PS2. Now it's not perfect, of course - the voice acting for the NPCs is repetitive, and the quality of some of the character is often poor, but in saying that, it's not uniformly bad, so I can personally let it go. It's also a game that occasionally leaves you wondering where to go as there is no mission objective screen as far as I can tell. However, there's a number of problems that I solved by simply blowing giant holes in the wall until I made a path around the obstacle, and I'm still not sure if I did the right thing or not. I, for one, call that the mark of a pretty cool game. Other than that though, I'd have to nit-pick to name issues that really bugged me.Red Faction has single-handedly restored my faith in the quality of games released around the early 2000s - a time in which I feel a large number of developers' reach exceeded their grasp. Sure, it's not the most ground-breaking shooter, and it has its issues, most of which were somewhat characteristic of games at the time. But when it plays so well, and is so much fun, who cares? Given that I'd played it so much when I was younger, I expected nostalgia to be playing a large part in my judgements, but it's been so long that it was like playing it anew, and I just found myself genuinely excited by what the game offers.I'd highly recommend this to anyone looking for a fun, well-designed shooter, with a decent amount of variety and some neat gameplay mechanics.

It p1sses me the f**k off. The game doesn't show you the objectives much so you need to make sure to read the message log to know what you are doing.I'd recommend it to anyone who love to suffer through games with horrible shooting mechanics, no auto-save. No mission select so if you die and you forgot to save? Hell you can either load to whatever save you last made or... OR!!! Restart the whole game again!			"

There was a couple of levels that were frustrating because I was wandering the levels for a bit looking for the objective which I passed a few times because it was not obvious or displayed for some reason.

												So let’s jump right into it. Red Faction is a first person shooter that was released in 2001 for the PC and PS2. It eventually found its way to other platforms including Mac and the Ngage (of all things). Here’s the plot…which was obviously inspired by Total Recall. The year is 2075. The Ultor Corporation is running a mining operation on Mars. The living conditions for miners suck at best and other miners are getting taken out by an incurable disease known simply as “The Plague”. You follow Parker a miner drawn in by Ultor’s promises of a new life as a miner. Parker finds himself at the forefront of a revolution. So what can I say here; the story is actually quite good. The game itself is actually quite long; so there was several times that the story was what kept me from getting bored and quitting. The story is compelling there’s enough twists to keep things interesting….well until the very end at least. I found the ending to be a bit disappointing. But overall I dig it and for that I’m giving it an B. Red Faction is an older game. I mean it was originally released in 2001. I have to remind myself of that quite a bit because in my opinion the look has not aged well. The graphics have a jagged style typical of the time. I remember back when I first played it the games look was amazing. Things have changed. The game as it stands is displayed in a 4:3 format, but there’s a way around that. There is a community made patch called Pure Faction. Installing the patch opens up higher resolutions. And interesting thing to note is that playing this older title on newer hardware seems to have issues. I’m not sure if this is a problem with the game itself or with Pure Faction, but I encountered at least one glitch. In the sub bay before the underwater lab when you attempt to launch the sub; the sub just explodes. Why does this happen? Well it’s all about frame rates apparently if the games framerate goes above 200 frames per second the game glitches out causing the sub to explode. Fortunately with the help of Pure Faction you can counter act this issue. All you have to do is use Pure Faction to adjust the frames per second. I’ve left a link to the moment I figured it out in the playthrough.  While it’s true that the graphics haven’t exactly aged well I certainly wouldn’t toss them into the junk pile. So…BThe Cinematics in the game do their job. They convey the story during the in-between-bits. The game used in-game graphics rather than pre-rendered cutscenes. I usually like it when games do this. The game also throws on these little communication cinematics (Hendrix talking to you, or Eos bossing you around). I find these to be nice touches, and it certainly helps keep the story moving. Interestingly enough the cutscenes are probably the times that I noticed the age of the graphics the most. Jagged character models and choppy frame rate are typical of what you’ll run into. It’s entirely possible that some of the choppy framerates were because of the screen capture software. The cinematics aren’t bad…but they certainly aren’t great, and tossing in a lackluster ending….meh C it is.The audio in the game is good but nothing to write home about. The only reason I say that is because there was nothing sound effects wise that ever really stuck out to me. Everything was pretty much what I would expect from a game of this type. As for the voice acting….well I’ve definitely heard better. The delivery seems off for me; all of the dialogue seems forced and unnatural. Once again…CThe soundtrack….holy crap the soundtrack…it’s cinematic…it’s huge…it’s well orchestrated. It’s awesome. The unfortunate fact is during the playthrough I muted all of the music. I had to. That is the nature of the Tubes. Just take my word for it….fantastic soundtrack. So the Music is an A all the way.Controls are typical for FPSs. Keyboard and mouse all the way. This is where the age old argument continues. Keyboard/Mouse vs gamepad. Console gamer vs elite PC Master race. I’ll say this I have both the PC and PS2 version. And I have to say the PC control scheme is much more ideal. Honestly I get quite frustrated playing this with the pad. But that’s just me and that’s a personal preference; I’ve always preferred playing FPS titles on a PC with a mouse and keyboard. That being said there are ways to use a controller with the PC release of Red Faction, but I haven’t explored it. Using classic and what I feel the most ideal control scheme for a PC….that deserves an A.All right let’s hit the gameplay. Overall you’re looking at some pretty standard point shoot bang bang action. However, the Geo Mod engine does add another layer of gameplay dynamic. The Geo Mod engine allows the user to modify the level. You can blast your own tunnels circumvent doors by going through walls….the world is your oyster.  When I first found this game way back when; I fell absolutely in love with the Geo Mod engine. I was obsessed with burrowing my own tunnels. But here’s the deal with Geo Mod it starts out really cool….and YES I will readily admit that it is a very cool idea…the thing is you end up using it less and less. To be entirely honest I barely used it after the first few stages. To kind of go with Geo Mod the game has included some pretty nice weapons…a healthy chunk of them are explosive in nature…that brings us to the fun of sticking mines to your enemies….good times….good good times. There are some other great weapons…sniper rifles, precision rifles…heck even the pistol is great. I have to recommend that you stick with the precision weapons. Like the precision rifle, sniper rifle or the rail driver….if you’re feeling crazy go with a rocket launcher. I had a tendency to steer clear of automatic weapons because the shot grouping for all of the automatic weapons is ridiculous. It’s nearly impossible to hit a target without using dang near all of your ammunition. My personal favorite weapon would have to be the Rail Driver. You see the Rail Driver allows you to 1. See through walls 2. Fire through said walls to take out enemies. The Rail Driver is even strong enough to take out hover crafts….I guess that’s what they are. Heck I even shot one through a wall without seeing it….probably one of the coolest accidental shots I’ve ever done. So, gameplay is pretty standard, Geo Mod is awesome but it wears thin…and the weapons are great (with the exception of the automatic weapons). Gameplay is good just not great…BThe final thing I wanted to discuss is the multiplayer mode. When I first got this game I think I ended up playing multiplayer mode more than the solo campaign. Playing it today really takes me back to the Good Ole Days of multiplayer gaming. No voice chat….it’s like heaven. The game is pretty old but I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is still a bit of a community playing the game. It’s funny because you’ll run into a lot of the same players quite a bit. As best I can tell there are still folks creating custom maps. This is pretty impressive in my opinion. It bears mentioning that it’s really in multiplayer mode that Geo Mod shines bright. In the course of a match a map will start out pristine and end up completely trashed. Sometimes it’s by design there will be hidden paths and powerups that are only accessible by blowing holes through stuff. So much fun. Multiplayer mode is awesome well worth playing… ASo let’s look at the report card. After looking at the arbitrary grades I gave the aspects I’ve discussed and assigning them a numeric value….and then calculating an average. Red Faction gets an overall B. Red Faction isn’t the greatest game in the world, but it has some nice aspects. Gameplay is solid, the soundtrack is excellent, and the multiplayer mode is still a boat load of fun. Overall it gets my recommendation. "

												Overview: Run and Gun First Person ShooterI completed this game for my first time so I'm not looking at this game through nostalgic glasses.  The Good:+The game seems to have the atmosphere from total recall and the level design similar to half life. The game is linear however the level design is good enough to carry the game all the way through. +The game provides a good sense of pacing so I never really felt bored throughout the journey.  + Lots of different weapons+Old school run and gun first person shooter+Obviously the graphics are outdated but I felt they were good enough to hold up 14 years later+Great soundtrack+Well polished game, no bugs or glitches.The Average:Voice ActingMovement and jumping feels a bit weird. Enemies move like they are on ice skatesThe Bad-The story is one of the weaker points, you are constantly getting new objectives without much thought or care. It doesn't really provide much to the overall experience and is very forgettable after you complete the game. - Very forgettable characters and bossesConclusion:A very enjoyable game given its age.

												By the time Red Faction launched in 2001, a little game called ""Half Life"" was already released for almost 3 years, so Volition Inc. really needed to come up with something special.Red Faction is a FPS set on Mars. you're a miner who works in one of the mines for Ultor Corporation. The miners are treated like slaves and are not allowed to leave. One day you attack one of the guards and accidently kill him and have to escape to survive and eventually start an uprise. Red Faction's story is nothing special, the weapons and gameplay are pretty standard and the environment is pretty dull for the most time even back in 2001. Even though the game doesn't get even close to Half Life, I'd still recommend this game if you like old school shooters. The current price tag (10 euro) is way to steep but it's well worth if discounted.			"

												Half-Life meets Paul Verhoeven.A chance of a new future working on Mars turns into a dystopian hell as you discover the entire opporunity was a scam, the megacorporation Ultor is actually using miners as slave workers. Subjugating the population, and beating or even killing any who step out of line or resist. It's time to revolt.The weapons are fairly diverse but stick strongly to the FPS trend of 'Pistol, SMG, Rifle, Shotgun, Rocket Launcher, Sniper', and the gunplay is pretty fun. Better than Half-Life 1's for sure. The enemies also react well to them, setting them on fire or sticking explosive charges on their faces and watching them panic has a sadistic pleasure that never really fades.Oh, and also you can blow tunnels through the level and burrow up under your enemy's feet, thanks to the innovative - if gimmicky - GeoMod technology. Later games replaced this with the ability to take down structures in a neat-looking and dynamic way... but I do miss this terrain deformation. Hopefully if there's ever another Red Faction game we'll get both systems together.This is a pretty good game, at a pretty good price, and the multiplayer is still active.			"

												I was playing this earlier and realized that the trams on Mars in Mass Effect 3 are almost certainly a reference to the trams level in Red Faction! This game is a classic of the scifi fps subgenre, so while its linear gameplay and ancient graphics may not be particularly inspiring, it's a worthy pick for fans of the genre and certainly historically important.I do wish the game had given more information about the game's broader setting, and that it had taken time to explore the social commentary that characterizes good science fiction. As is, it seems shallow to the point of incompleteness and the protagonist is irritatingly child-like, despite committing acts of extreme violence throughout the game.tl;dr This game is a good FPS for its time but it's not very thought-provoking.

												Red Faction is a FPS released in 2002.  You play as Parker, a average man that decided to go to mars to work in the mines to make money for his family. Its not that easy. The working conditions are horrible. There is a plague killing the workers, the miners are mistreated and there is no way to leave, since Ultor (your epmloyers, also the same ultor from saints row) controls all the transport between earth and mars. The story is ok. The cutscenes are just bad, with bad animations and the worst lip syncing I have ever seen. The gameplay on the other hand is excellent. The difficulty is spot on, except for the bossfights. The guns are varied and fun to use. The game mostly consists of shooting enemies, but there are a few stealth sections and vehicle sections to spice things up. Red Factions real claim to fame is the GeoMod engine. It allows for destructible environments. This is heavily under used. This is probably due to the techical limitations of 2002. There are areas where the environment is destructible. Its really impressive to see buildings crumble in a realistic manner. The biggest problem for me is the games length. I played it two times and each time the game took me about 3-4 hours to complete. Give this game a try, but if you don't like old games wait for a sale.P.S. The first time was cheat free. The second one was with cheats. the cheats are :""bighugmug"" and ""vivalahelvig"". bighugmug gives you all the weapons with max ammo and vivalahelvig activates godmode.P.S.S. the best parts of the game was the two times a random gaurd yelled at me and said ""Stop right there rebel scum"". This was worth the price alone for me. Seriously. it was great.			"

												Just finished Red Faction -  Awesome Classic FPS - This is a must play for me.  Excellent Old School shooter with cool story.  Great variety of weapons to choose from and excellent blasting effects.  I remember when this was first out and it was 'ground-breaking' ... pun intended.  Graphics are decent and the gameplay is pretty smooth.  I used JoytoKey to rig up a controller and sometimes switched to mouse for precision headshots and a few random parts.  You can get the whole series for about $12 on sale, so totally worth it.  I'm a completionist, so I'm playing games from beginning to end, the Red Faction series being one of them, so off to Red Faction II.  (also doing Tomb Raider this way... slogging through Tomb Raider II as well...)  Anyway, if you are trying to decide on this series I'd say definitely give it a shot.			"

												I heard about this game just about a year ago and I can not believe how nobody I know came across it in the past. I just finished it and enjoyed most of the time. The variety of weapons is great, destructible terrain in so old game blew my mind. The story was ok but there is still reason to replay it because of the different routes you can take, or even make yourself new ones :).I did not like the really unnatural fast ""walk"" of the opponents and frustrating battles where you can be killed just by one shot with 100HP and 100Arm.The Alt+Tab did not work for me in the basic install, but you can find solutions to that and even modes improving the graphics. If you know what to do, it can be finished in less than 3 hours, but it was about 3x as much for my first walkthrough.If you went through HL numerous times and want to try something similarly nostalgic, I can definitely recommend Red Faction.

												A very fun game with a good story, a great selection of weapons and vehicles and of course the Geomod engine, which allows you to deform and mutilate the terrain in any way you desire, from blowing up a bridge to stop enemy reinforcements arriving if you don't feel like fighting them, to blasting tunnels through the rock with any explosives you find (or blasting a bit further in any existing tunnels to reveal hidden weapons and equipment).The boss fights are challenging but not frustrating, and although you don't really talk to other characters, some of them, like Eos, are quite fun anyway.It brought back the nostalgia playing this game again (I bought the RF bundle and am currently playing through them all sequentially on Hard mode), and it is noticeably better than the sequel.

												I got video games banned in the school library beacue of this game. I had a copy on my flash drive so i could play multiplayer with a couple of my friends. Eventually a couple other people asked if they could join, so i let them copy it off my flash drive. That was my biggest mistake. Soon everyone in the school seemed like they had MY copy of a game I payed for. Everyone was playing it, the library filled up with people wanting a turn on the computers to play this game. I tried deleting it from all the computers, but that stopped nobody. It was out of control. Eventually the next school year, library computers were no longer able to be used for video games. Im kinda glad that we can finally use the library computers for work again.Now that thats over, time for my review.This game's single player camaign is kinda dated, but still worth playing. It gets difficult at times and i actually had some difficulty at times, but it was all fun.The multiplayer is what i really use it for now. With just one copy of the game i can download it to my friend's computers and we all have a great time messing around and blowing stuff up.If you need a multiplayer game that works well even on the lowest of PCs, this is the perfect choice.

												A classic FPS with a minimalist plot that is basically an excuse to blow holes in anything you want. This is not a bad thing. The GeoMod ""blow up whatever"" concept is great and works out wonderfully. The game itself is fairly long, reasonably satisfying start to finish, although towards the end you wind up doing less GeoModding and more shooty-shooting. Still, the whole thing is pretty entertaining, and unlike many corridor shooters of the era (and even some other games in the series) there's a little exploring to be done and/or alternate routes to find in nearly every level.It's a great game, and you should play it if you haven't already. For the best experience on modern equipment be sure to grab the Pure Faction mod/compatibility program.			"

												Red Faction is worth a buy if you're a fan of the later games in the series, and maybe haven't played the earlier ones.This is the first installment in the RF series, and having played the later games I am glad to have played this and seen the origins of ""Parker"" and ""Eos"". The story is pretty good, although the game can make it a little hard to follow at times.I have found that it can be easy to miss certain buttons that you need to properly complete the game, but overall the layout of levels and such is very good. The AI for enemies is pretty terrible, and increaing/decreasing the difficulty will basically speed up the strafe rate of enemies. You've probably experienced this before if you've ever played an old game.Played using keyboard & mouse. No issues with controlling throughout the game.Graphics are ok for the age of the game. Everything is ok until you start blowing the environment up, then things start to get a bit wierd.Some of the parts of the OST are a bit too overly dramatic and loud, but most of it is pretty good. Very dramatic when needed and the base ambiance music is very nice. The sound quality is ok considering how old the game is.Surprisingly, there are still some multiplayer servers out there running.This game is a ngihtmare to get running initially (If you don't have DX8), but once you have everything set up it will work fine. The URL ""purefaction.org"" will come in handy, and check out the forums & guides for more detail on how to get everything set up if you have issues.To reiterate, definitely worth it if you are a fan of the series, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend getting it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------For an old game this has aged well and still holds up as a terrific fast paced first person shooter. As I was playing I couldn't help finding Similarities to half-life (although not quite as good or long) which when you think this was released in 2001 and half-life in 1998 it actually shows how great half-life is and was for the time.A massive arsenal of weapons and unlike Half-Life there are destructible sections where you can basically blow holes in to your surroundings. It never feels as linear as it is, as you can often take two or more routes to your destination which I liked a lot and found myself wanting to explore all routes and even go back to kill the enemies on the other route.Quite challenging at times and had to retry some sections after dying and changing different weapons for different enemies. Also near the end there aren't many health packs available so make sure you don't auto save like I did with 3 health! Vehicles are fun to drive and you get the chance to pilot a submarine, flying ship, armoured vehicle which all have guns attached as well as using turrets on the backs of vehicles and stand alone ones too. The game has a lot of everything youd expect from a shooter including lots of explosives (C4 remote charges, rocket launches although the grenades sucked).There is a small stealth section in the game where you have to holster your weapons and navigate the section without being seen/recognised which I didn't like, but this is only a small part. It just didn't seem to work very well and slowed down the pace of the game.Without Half-Life this would get 10/10 but sadly for Red Faction there is and due to the length in story as well and that bad stealth section It cant quite be the game that beats the king but still deserves a respectable 8/10.I bought the Red Faction Collection for £3.99 so this cost less than a quid which for a game of this callibre is great and well worth it.

												Good old Red Faction. Destructible environment (closed door? blow up the wall!), good controls, vast arsenal of weapons and a good challange, even at medium difficulty. Some parts of the game require infiltration or driving vehicles, and it adds a little variety to the gameplay. You can finish it in about 10 hours and it hasn't a high replay value, the multiplayer is scarcely populated. Also, it's just a tiny detail, but I liked how the developers portrayed different gravity on Mars' surface and orbit. Grab it when it's on sale.			"

												If you've played this on the PS2, than you'll find that it's almost entirely identical except for the menu and added maps.More importantly, any difficulty that isn't easy or normal is actually playable, because you CAN AIM CLEARLY with a mouse. Which comes much in handy since the AI enemies can hit you with preciseness that made the higher difficulties impossible.If you haven't played the game, then Red faction is pretty much Half life without the aliens. The game itself is rather dated graphically, the audio isn't particularily superb, and the gameplay is a bit dodgy, but if you can look past all that, it's a farely competent shooter you can waste a few hours on. The difficulties get pretty extreme if you'd like a challenge, as they range from easy, to butt♥♥♥♥ ridiculous. The game itself I beat in under two hours on the medium difficulty, but that is more likely a me-problem since I know every inch of the game from repeated playthroughs on the PS2 Version.I haven't played any of the latest Red faction games, so I do not know for certain how much they relate to this game. But if you are interested, this game is a good pick even when not on sale.The story is kinda ♥♥♥♥ though. "

With First person shooters there is probably such a variety out there that everyone will have their favourites.Personally I don't think this title lives up to titles such as half-life, however, it doesn't miss by much.That said it has some hours of entertainment to be had and if your looking for a shooter for nostalgia of the original half-life era I would recommend it.Again this is just a personal preference, I know friends who prefer this to half-life.  All in all decent shooter decent story, as I didn't play it when it first came out perhaps it didn't have the same impact on me as others, I can imagine it was very good for it's day.			"

												Really awesome, really traditional, really well balanced shooter, with the exception of the rail driver.It has one of the best storylines of any game of its time. Seriously, games in 2001 are pretty bad a lot of the time.Frankly, the voice acting leaves plenty to be desired, the graphics are pretty dated, even for back then, and the gameplay can be confusing, but it's really satisfying when you finish this game.If you like traditional style FPS games, drop the $10 and get Red Faction already!

												As somebody whom has never played the Red Faction franchise until this year, I have to say I am pleasantly surprised at how well it plays and how enjoyable it turned out to be after almost 15 years after it's original release. Red Faction is often compared to Half-Life, and after completing the first game in the series, it is easy to see why. They are indeed very similar in terms of gameplay and atmosphere, but even though Half-Life definitely remains the better game overall, Red Faction definitely has it's perks and charms that no other game I have played is yet to match, though also a fair amount of flaws too.One of the main selling-point features in this game is the geo-mod mechanic, which was pretty awesome for it's time and is still a feature that some games could learn from today. The geo-mod mechanic for those of you that don't know is the ability to alter the terrain and environment surrounding you, in Red Faction for example: If you can't get through a certain door, you may very well be able to blow holes in the wall to get through it instead of backtracking for hours to find a key. This alone makes this game stand out amongst the crowd of FPS games from the early 2000's.With the geo-mod mechanic aside, Red Faction is still a fun FPS game to play despite it's age, the gameplay is nice and varied, the singleplayer campaign is lengthy and there are a nice variety of weapons to use (despite the fact that the shotgun is easily the worst one in FPS history!), as said before, very similar to Half-Life in terms of it's gameplay.This version of the game comes with a share of bugs that you should be aware of though, particularly later on in the campaign which can prove to be game-breaking in some cases (the scene with the giant robot for example sometimes glitches out), there is also no auto-save or checkpoint feature so be sure to utilize quick-saves very frequently.All in all, if you're a fan of retro FPS games, I'd suggest adding Red Faction to your collection. I'm glad I took the time to play it and am happy to say that it holds up well for an old title, despite some bugs that seem to have found their way into the Steam version.			"

												I had this game for the PS2 when it first came out. This game along with Ace combat were the only two games I played and must have beat well over 5 or 6 times. I would go thru the game and assassinate every person just to see if I could do it or not. I had a good time playing this then and even now it still holds up as well FPS. Beating this game again To my joy I still zipped thru the levels with ease and remembered alot of the hidden weapon stashes along the way. I love the rail gun in this game , it gives you the ability to see thru walls and gives you a good advantage aginst ambushes or enemys on the other side of a the door. The final boss is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. One shot with the rail gun and she's done. 7/10			"

												Oh man, Red Faction. So a little bit of previous knowledge will help here. I got this with Red Faction 2 and 3 but I played 3 first because it was new and recent.. (at the time at least). So basically what's so great about Red Faction? Its basically just another Half Life ish game... though with its own unique stuff. Its hard to really say what makes it great but I honestly really enjoy it. Its not long or hard but its fun. Its fun for its time and even fun for now. Its old yes but I think it has charm. It tackles the FPS genre from a cool angle.. what if everything was destructable? You need to get past a laser grid.. just blow up the wall next to it and walk around it. Need to go to the basement.. just blow up the floor and drop down. Its about mining so the vehicles are diggers and drillers which althrough maybe terrible to drive due to games not having figured out vehicles in FPS games yet.. they are cool. Its hard to really review this.. but it is good.. and if you liked some of the new Red Faction games you might end up liking this one.			"

												For a game of its time, this Red Faction is truly impressive. What impressed me the most is the destructible enviroments this game has to offer. You can break or destroy virtually anything; rock walls, metal walls, etc., and make a sort of ""cave"" out of the destruction. The only con that I can come up with is that there is only manual saves and no auto-save feature. This game is worth the money, even when it isn't on sale. Later when I play more of it, I'll review for the story.So far, I really recommend this game. I can't wait to play the following games. ""-/10"" coming after I beat the game. SUGGESTION: I would recommend getting the Pure Faction 3.0 mod for this game and installing the ""beta"" patch. It includes mainly a new launcher, widescreen options including 1080p resolutions, and enhanced graphics options including better polygon models. There is a community guide explaining how to properly install the mod.			"

												As a modern gamer (someone who is used to good graphics) this game didn't look bad at all. You have to remember the graphics are from 2001 and keeping that in mind the game was great, although it did have a few downfalls. Some good things were the fully destructible environments; the story was easy to follow, although simplistic. The guns felt unique and different, with lots of creativity put into them. And the levels felt big, and somewhat open. Not to mention the voice acting wasn't bad either. But some of the bad things come from the voice syncing itself. Sometimes it would get so bad that characters lips would move and 5 seconds later they would talk. I’m not sure if this is just a problem on modern systems, or if it’s just a bug in the game itself. Also some parts feel more cheap that difficult, but that can be remedied quickly by trial and error and LOTS of quick saving (F6). And the two main bosses are pretty much the same, repetitive shoot until they fall, then shoot them until they die. The worst part about this game though is probably the ending; I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this so I’ll just say it’s a completely random puzzle. All that aside this game turned out to be great, and holds up today. I had a blast playing it and was pretty much glued to my computer while playing it. I would recommend this game with a solid 8.5/10~Hobo With A Shotgun(Agent 13) "

												GAME WON'T AUTOSAVE NORE QUICKSAVE!!!! D:<Ok so after letting this out of my chest, I gotta say I enjoyed that long walk on (underground) Mars.The game feels very nice for its time, it has a very nice set weapons selection and some very good elements regarding destroyable environments. The story is not reaaaaaally that interesting, but it has its twists and 2 good hard boss battles to take care of. What bothered me is that it just throughs you right down in the pit of action not really knowing what is going on and why everything is going on. The story lacks to explain to you why the red fanction even exists at the very beginning. On the very first minute of the gameplay you are just left to rush your @ss into a riot against your employers. Why? ""because life is hard being a miner on Mars with those evil @ss employers that's why!!"" which is barelly a reason enough to motivate you join the battle moral-wise. Later on, the story gets a bit better and the action feels satisfying as your guns get better, you get to ride some vehicles, your enemies get harder to kill and you even get to visit a huge-@ss spaaaace statiooon! Story-wise, provided that the riot has already happened for its own reasons (hard way of living as a miner there), the script gets some interesting plot twists as you slowly get to witness a series of experiments done on the people who work there by the EVIL CORPORATIOOooOON!!. .In addition I was surprised there was such a good job done over voice acting in this game. Your main character is cool too.There's nothing else to say really. If you find this on a special offer you got one more reason to join this cool franshise!! Just grab a gun and start shooting at stuff and blow some ♥♥♥♥♥ up! :P			"

												I needed pure faction to play this game properly, and it works exceptionally on win7. My real playtime is 6 hours.  Even tho it is 6 hours it felt like 20. Why? Because I had to do whole levels from the beginning before i learned that i have to save the game almost before every door to prevent dying. And i was on hard difficulty not impossible ( which is the last ).For a 2001 game it is damn good. The story makes sense, and the fact that you can destroy pretty much everything adds reality to it. You got lots of weapons and a multiplayer mode which is still played by ppl and it's fun a lot.  This game respects old fps conditions : Hard , lots of weapons, levels where you are depending on your luck because you don't even have time to aim ( such good enemies out there ) and long playtime. For 6 hours i have to say again they felt like a lot more. Spoilers ( story )You are Parker, not the hero, a young miner, who went to Mars believing this mining company, named ULTOR, will change his life ( at least that's what propaganda say ) but he discovers a corupt world where he is like a salve, until one day when the red faction aka rebels fight back. And you fight your way to stop ULTOR destroying evidence against the company. That sums the story pretty much.			"

												As close to a first person shooter Minecraft that could quite easily accomodate a certain Governator as the protaganist.If you love the original Total Recall staring Arnold Schwarzeneggar get this game.  If not get this game anyway! It was possibly my FAVOURITE first person shooter on the PS2.The ability to blow up most walls was very interesting as you could sometimes progress through areas of the game differently each time with a little exploration and some explosives, of course not forgetting the huge drill tank!The graphics may be dated but as you get older you start to care less about these things when they are old favourites. The music is decent and not half bad. The Weapons are pretty interesting and not crazy concept weapons, the assualt rifle is still one of my favourite designs of all time. One moment that always stuck in my mind was using the Rocket Launcher to ambush an APC by taking out the bridge he was on which subsequently dropped him into a deep chasm.This game is worth the £4.99. I can almost guarantee you that you will get your money's worth. The sequal, Red Faction 2, also has Jason Statham in!10/10 with a Thumbs Up and a well hearted recommendation. Happy Gaming.			"

												A good piece of monkey turd from 2001People are saying that Red Faction is a decent shooter at that time. But i had to say that Red Faction is s-hit, and its not a decent shooter. But don't forget that Chaser is also a s-hit too. Both games are on mutual agreement of a long time running competition of s-hitty games world championships. In b4, all games that are related with mars s-hitty cliche stories are sheet at that time. And I think that you're the one to blame for, Total f-ucking Recall. Dont get me wrong, Total Recall is a good movie, but it inspires s-hitty devs to make tons s-hitty games.""Give it excuse will ya its from 2001, what do you expect?"".f-uck no. Quake 2 and Half Life has already out at that time. There's no excuse, you wanna make a good shooter games?  Then make a shooter like Quake 2 and Half Life. Otherwise make a game about something else. Maybe a game for stupid kids to play? Or make a game about s-hitting in a restroom where the walls are actually mirrors that can be seen from outside (people can see you taking a s-hit). Just stay the f-uck off from shooter genre if you can't make it as good as Quake 2 and Half Life. Yes, if you're saying there's a decent shooter from early 2000's, then I expect it to be as good as Quake 2 and Half Life. Everything about this game is bad. Stay the f-uck away unless it comes from a bundle.TL;DRIt's a short game, I finished it under 3 hours. And I hope the devs dies from a horrible death.			"

												Note: I played this using the Pure Faction Mod to increase the resolution to widescreen 1080p, which is why Steam shows no plat time.I originally played this game when the demo was released before the game went on sale. I thought it was amazing, blowing holes through terrain to create other paths through the mines and gameplay in the Half Life vein. I never got to play past the mines and for some reason never bought the game even though I loved the demo. Playing it now I can see what a missed opportunity the game was. After the mines the game takes a turn for the worst, with the destructability and improvisation of the mines replaced by static office environments with no destructabilty or walls that can be destroyed looking the same as walls that can't. The levels turn into box shaped rooms with hardly any detail and just feel empty by design. The weapons for the most part are pretty good except for the weak feeling pistol but it still takes a lot of ammo to put down the enemies even with the bigger weapons and so can make them feel weak.The acting in the game is also terrible, back when the game was released it may have been acceptable and I'm just spoiled by todays voice work in games but it's bordering on Resident Evil quality.I'm still recommending this game to anyone who wants to get into the Red Faction series because there are plot points continued through the sequel it would be useful to know but don't expect it to be a good experience because the game has not aged well.

												Big nostalgia hit for me, having played it on the PS2 back in the day.Working schlub in oppressive ""company town"" mining community on Mars, only instead of unleashing demons from Hell, you see a fellow worker getting beat on by a company heavy.So you proceed to beat the bully out of the guy, and start a massive revolt.Slowly escalates into a plot of intrigue about a virus killing miners, and escalating military response.Also, GOD BY THE JESUS DAMN mandatory stealth sections in videogames. Twice!! With no real stealth mechanics of course.Compatibility Issues:Fun enough, but it is a ""early 2000s FPS title"" with all the problems that entails. I didn't use the Pure RF mod that others recommend for compatibility use. I figure you probably should. It ran out of the box on Win10, but not without issues.Biggest issue - FRAMERATES. In the setup menu, enable VSYNC to lock the framerate. The game system actually runs computations, including AI routines, based on framerate. The AI is absolutely manic (to the point of unfair in the late game - high health, fast reactions, moves at 80mph) when uncapped and there's a common glitch that I didn't experience and others did - a submarine that must be dropped into the water, will explode and basically end your game at framerates of over 110fps.Also, I keep having problems with screens. TVs, computer screens, weapon LCD screens and mirrors all have vertical yellow lines obscuring the image.Again - I don't use compatibility mode in Windows, nor have I tried the Pure RF mod that's recommended. You probably should.			"

												This used to be one of my favorite games back in highschool. I mainly only played the multiplayer demo of it back in the days, and I used to pretty much own everyone (I used to be pretty good in this game) on multiplayer. But in the end, even though I did see the game in the shop that I used to go to, I did not really buy the game in the end. Eventually I did buy my copy but did not really play it that much. And now I got it on Steam, even though I most likely can not play the multiplayer (Have to say, the multiplayer was just epic), I guess I still get to play the singleplayer. The real unique thing about this game is that the walls and such can be destroyed. Even though Battlefield franchise now sort of does it, this was quite a revolutionary idea back in the days, as no other games had done it. It just feels good to see one of my favorites in my Steam game collection now. 8/10			"

It is difficult and requires some strategy but the best games needs your brain to turn out awesome.Play style and flow - 10/10    No recoil, no headbob, no delay when you aim, no freakout when you get hit.Environment - 6/10   A bit big and takes time to walk...so much walking, but they make it feel like you get somewhereAwesomeness & nostalgia - 13/10  Enjoyed it more for the memories and enjoyment than the actual critical gameplay.SUMMARYLong walksVery easily playstyleVery difficult situationsGreat fun if games like COD bore you			"

												The biggest diffrentiator between this and many other games of the time is the Geomod technology. Unfortunately the actual in game usage of this really cool tech is extremely limited. I really liked it at first, using this tech to dig around locked doors was cool....but I only got to do that once along with blowing up a bridge and then the game turned into another sub par shooter of the time. A couple of the biggest issues are how innacurate guns are regardless of how you use them, there is always a ridiculously sized cone of fire which is espeicially terrible when your shooting long distances as often as you have to. The AI is ♥♥♥♥ing bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy and will strafe all over the place and run back and forth like theres something wrong with them. They will rarely attempt any sort of tactics or sample any sort of intelligence. Most the time you can just leave the room they are in and they will be unable to follow you because they are so stupid. They arn\'t fun to play against, combine the poor accuracey with their movement and its like shooting squireels on crack from a hundred yards away with a .22lr.The bossbattles that are here suffer from really bad AI and really bad scripting. Theres a point where you have to lure a robot into a garbage disposer which is really terrible because the AI just don't want to follow you unless you really try your best to bait them. Even then its sheer luck if they decide to follow you. Which made a condition where I had to just try the same thing many times over trying to bait this stupid robot only to die and then load the save and try again before he jankily ended up above the burning pit of garbage disposing. At which point I opened the doors to it and he slid slowly down the wall of the pit then dissappeared. Completely anti-climatic and what I thought was a fun set peice turned out to be a huge ♥♥♥♥ing waste of time.And in general the game isn\'t really at all interesting or fun. Alot of the time the voice mixing will be so bad you don\'t know where your supposed to go or the game will downright not tell you what in gods name your supposed to do next so your forced to waste time backtracking and guessing.Difficulty is very poorly balanced. Medium/Normal can be ridiculously hard bordering on nigh impossible while easy is so easy that you don\'t have to worry about getting shot or dying at all unless you let the enemies kill you. Its either climbing everest or walking up a small hill. I don\'t even want to try impossible.In summary its just not very fun. They offer a decent amount of variety but at its core the shooting gameplay just isn\'t fun. It isn\'t fun to play against spazzing NPCs and its not fun to have a game be overly easy or overly difficult.Half Life 1 was released 3 years prior to this game and it feels like they were still behind in every way but physics and technology in general. I would rather play \""On a Rail\"" than continue playing this game. It would have been an okay game at the time I would imagine but the base gameplay here just isn\'t very fun and theres little actual variation. Its just not fun or satisfying to kill anything in this game. Thats all I can really say, at the end of the day the core gameplay of an FPS is more important than anything to me at this point and Red Faction just isn\'t a very fun game to play in alot of ways similiar to the later game RF Gureilla which the shooting and AI were also very poor and not fun.I also found plenty of forum posts detailing the same issues they had with the game that I did that were dated around the time the game came out. This isn't an issue of entiltled modern consumer whining but rather the game was always ♥♥♥♥.			"

												First, make sure to use PureFaction in order to get the game to work on modern systems and to get widescreen resolutions, see the Steam Guide on how to set it up. Red Faction is an OK game - it has a unique Geo-Mod technology where the player can blow up walls and the environment, however it is severely under-utilized by giving minimal explosives and weapons to blow things up. Furthermore, there are a lot of walls and other environments where you simply cannot blow up. When you take away the Geo-Mod features you are left with a plain and ordinary shooter that does not really excel in any category. The AI is odd, sometimes enemies will just stand in one spot or on the other hand they will run around and shoot chaotically. There are also some gimcky weapons that often take the player out in 1 shot which leads to frustrating areas near the end of the game, also the boss fights seem to be really overpowered in favor of the boss. The areas are all the same dull brown Martian color and the interiors are all the same dull and washed out colors and area after area (level after level) feels the same which gets really boring fast and the game sometimes is vague on what is the next objective leaving the player sometimes wondering what they need to do next. Lastly, the game tries to mix the pace up by throwing in some stealth missions where you go undercover and are stripped of all your weapons - these levels do not really add anything but slow the game down for no necessary reason. The campaign story is okay, nothing too captivating and thankfully is not too long (~5-6 hours). Overall, I had fun in the beginning where you really got to utilize the Geo-Mod technology but after the first couple of levels the game became bland as an ordinary shooter and not fun any longer dealing with inaccurate weapons and seeing the same scenery over and over. Compared to Half-Life which came out around the same time, it feels that this game was lacking in every department and became underwhelming.			"

One of them is the submarine exploding in bay area glitch is so annoying. Just like the old games this is so difficult to finish even in normal difficulty. The story line is okay. Not worth buying if its not on sale at least 90% sale. I will never play this game again.			"

												It's a special game that you can pick up 10 years after it's release and still enjoy it without having that ""ehrmagherd this is sooo oooold"" feeling.  Just remember it hasn't benefitted from the last decade of trial and error in FPS shooters so there are some frustrations with it.  As the game progresses you and enemies become more and more like glass cannons which makes certain areas a chore to get through even on medium difficulty.  At a certain point it goes from challenging to tedius, and that happened in a few places for me.  Also, IT DOES NOT SAVE AT CHECKPOINTS!  I want to stress that point as that's a  feature we take for granted now, and I paid for that assumption about an hour into the game when I died for the first time for a stupid reason and had to start all over.I also used the Pure Faction mod others talked about and it worked really well.  I don't think it's a requirement to use it to enjoy the game but if you don't mind taking a bit to set it up, it doesn't hurt anything.			"

												(not a multiplayer review)Pros -* Guns feel really meaty.* Destructible terrain.* Neat storyline that makes me think of ""Total Recall"".* The Vehicle content while simple, is smooth and enjoyable.Cons -* Repetitive * Awful 'stealth' elements that are mostly down to pure luck (""YOU'RE THAT MINER!"").* Dull boss fights with gimped mechanics (The Capek fight is a real stinker)* Voice acting is so-so.* You die, you have to start again - no starting at checkpoints or at the start of the level. You have to use saves, which feels cheap.* Inferior to even older FPS games such as Half-Life in almost every metric.* Hit markers are terrible - bullets just vanish sometimes* Important characters bug out or die very easily, instantly making you lose the game.4/10. Playable and enjoyable to a degree, but very frustrating. Purists be damned – some of these games should be fixed before going on sale. Not worth paying more than a fiver for.			"

												Red faction is an amazing game and certaintly better than a lot of shooters in it's time( half life/ turok/ medal of honor)While the animations don't hold up, the textures are pretty solid even at HD resolutions and the gun play is cozy as it gets.The game exploads with atmosphere from deep twisting coridoors and underground tunnels, to steep canyons and large grungy facilities always gives you a sense of progress. It's coupled with simple lighting/fog effects and the killer sound track that is unforgetable that fits situations and feelings perfectly.The geo mod was a pretty sweet feature back in the day, where sometimes instead of killing in death match, you just wanted to see how far and large you could dig maze like structures or go secret finding. There is a large varity of weapons with signature sound effects and some really neat level designs.What hasn't aged well is the cutscenes and multiplayer. Most the multiplayer is shooting across large maps with the infintly accurate sniper and precision rifle which with mouse aiming, makes it pretty boring.The characters are mostly forgetable and story somewhat hokey, but you won't care as you are immersed in blasting your way out of Ultor fighting for your freedom and an answer to the plague.9/10 easily "

												With the graphics and feel of Halo: Combat Evolved, but none of the iconic zest, Red Faction is a game where you shoot people, then you shoot aliens, and you run through the same cave networks incessantly. The bland atmosphere, lack of compelling story, and limited replayability gives one the sense of playing one of the old games that isn't terrible, but that wasn't good enough to be called a classic, nor a must-play. It's not a terrible game, but it's not really worth the time to play it, and it gets really boring very quickly.You don't need to play this one. I haven't played Red Faction II, but i heard it's worse. Guerrilla and Armageddon are alright, so stick with those. I only got RF1 because it was part of the full pack; so if you absolutely want this game, buy it in the pack and get the good games.6/10			"

												A dated FPS with some bizarre design decisions even by standards of the time. The guns are admittedly fun to use, but the goals of the game are communicated poorly, and it's ultimately not particularly challenging as a game.The one stand out feature of the game, the ability to blast holes in walls is certainly interesting, but outside of the first level (And a couple of specific points required by the game later on), it never really fleshes out into an interesting mechanic.The pacing of the story also feels rather off, and there's a definite disconnect between what you do ingame and the way characters react to you. The final ""boss"" in the game is also incredibly tedious and relies on a combination of trial and error and just pure luck.If you want to play an older FPS, pick up something like Half Life instead.

												I really want to say i like the game, i really do, of course im not going to.But there are some things with this game that just really get on my nerves.I like the combat of this game, feels like a awkward combination of Half-life and System shock 2's gunplay. Yet it feels right either way. Other than that thats where i begin to dislike the game.For one, lets just start with dialog of the guards, Either every other guard is bipolar, or just cant make up their mnd because they go from being overly-cocky saying they'll kill you, then running away saying they surrender, and then go back to shooting you, saying more cocky things.Then there is the voice acting, Hardly any of the voices in the game could be really considered good. Most are at most, annoying.After that there are parts of the game that make little to no sense. Such as getting to use a Submarine for the first time; You were told to grab a submarine, Well, Its connected to a magnet on a ceiling, and there is a control room nearby. The door is locked, and the guy inside isnt doing anything. So you blow down the wall with a rocket launcher or some other explosive and press the button. The magnet lowers towards the water. and then out of nowhere, the Submarine explodes for little to no reason. As i found out, the Submarine was required, since you end up having to fight other submarines, which is kind of hard to do since not many weapons work underwater, and the torpedos they fire seek into you. So just to proceed, I was forced to cheat just to get on to the next area. Which brought me to a stealth section of the game.Dont get me started on how stupid stealth sections are.Edit: Some other things about this game i dont like i forgot to mention;For one, the lack of autosaves. This really bugs me whenever i die and have to go back at least 10 minutes or more. It gets really tedious and frustrating at times. Especially during some fights. However once mercs are introduced, so is the Rail Driver; The other thing i hate with this game.No seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that thing. Its a one hit kill. So many time i forget to save and im punished by being ripped a new one for going too fast or not focusing down the guy with the rail driver.			"

												Got stuck on the sub level and apparently it's not uncommon. Red Faction has a lot of good, unique ideas, but none implemented very well. Poor voice acting, poor gameplay, poor map design, plenty of rough work all around. It doesn't surprise me that the first Halo game overshadowed RF, since RF looks like it came out of 1998. The later Red Faction games are great, but you can skip this steam release to save yourself headaches... unless you absolutely want to know more about the RF universe and backstory.			"

												Was too young really to play this around the time it came out, so the nostalgia factor is missing. But honestly a very mediocre game. Positives-Gun Variety-Weapons and explosions sound good.-Geomod Engine-Vehicle controls top notch-Soundtrack pretty goodNegatives-Story extremely dry, especially towards the end with new main characters being introduced more than halfway through the game.  The main character is completely unlikeable and the other characters who I assume you are meant to care about are very 2D with almost no personality. The guards all have some hatred towards miners for a reason that is never explained. You are reminded of this with them saying 'Miner scum!' every 5 seconds. There is no incentive to go anywhere and it feels like the reasons to go from one place to the next are just made up on the spot.-Voice acting and cutscenes are alright at the best of times and ususally cringe inducing. -Graphics are bad even for a game that came out in 2001.-Landscape is boring and levels are often the same corridors/red caves OVER AND OVER. There is almost no variety in the level design and the levels are often stuck together very badly e.g. when you are in a mining/disposal area and you take a 5 second pipe journey to the science labs.-Enemies are overpowered for the majority of the game (when playing on normal) mainly the railgun guys who ONE SHOT you whenever you turn a corner, forcing you to save the game before almost every corner at the end of the game.-Geomod Engine used about 5 times throughout the game in very scripted formats.-Online seems impossible to use for a new player as the servers all say that my level is not high enough when I try to join. It doesnt even display what level I am.-Endgame was awful with a recycled boss fight and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ timed puzzle as the last thing you do. One of the most unsatisfying endgames ever.-So much more to say e.g stealth missions, useless companions, npc glitches, those aliens in the caves that were almost impossible to hit, things like monitors which seemed like they were going to be useful but didnt get used at all properly.In conclusion this game seems very dated and a lot of the game seems rushed and copied from half life. Just buy half life instead.			"

 Mediocre Half-Life Clone I didn't know what to make of Red Faction going into it but I went out of it as fast as my heels could carry me out. The game is a ""Half-Life clone"" in the same way a lot ""realistic"" games in this era attempted to be but ended up inferior to Half-Life. I found this game to be very annoying and a lot of elements to be arbitrary form many reasons in both story and gameplay. Note; This review is done with someone who has already played this in mind. Reading won't ruin the experience however. No multi-player review, only single-player campaign.   Story The voice acting is hilariously bad although I can't blame it considering the time. Hendrix's motivations are never explained  So I don't feel the least bit symapathetic when he dies Plot feels like its being made as you go along with no clear goal. Things like mercenaries and space stations are thrown at you out of no where. A clear example is that there is no clear villian and new enemies are constantly introduced (Ultor, Capek, Masako)Plot doesn't get to much in the way of gameplay Cutscenes are kept to a minimal but are unskippable (which gets annoying when your replaying the same section for the fiftieth ♥♥♥♥ing time that day)  Graphics/Sound/Technical Graphics haven't aged well, but then again barely anything from this time did.Enemies possess the wizardry to be able to see and shoot at you through walls. It it sometimes unclear what environments are destructableSound design is fine. NPC dialouge and soundtrack get repeatative. There is a glitch/bug in the middle of the game that stops progression by exploding a submarine you need just because you have a high framerate. I was forced to install external mods to fix it. The section can be passed without it but it is a major inconveniance. Levels become increasingly dull with the exclusive color palette of red, brown, and grey corridors/caves take about 75% of the game.  GAME HAS NO AUTO SAVE. IF YOU DIE WITH NO SAVE/QUICK SAVE FILE, YOU HAVE TO START FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE DAMN GAME. Would've been nice to warn me before my first death.  Gameplay An FPS clearly inspired by Half-Life but fails to capture the elegance in design and story. Various nitpicks I have which pile up to get annoying. The melee weapon takes way to long to activate which defeats the purpose of a melee weapon in the first place which is something to whip out when in close range and in a pinch. Some weapons become virtually useless in the later parts of the game (shotgun, pistol, grenades, flamethrower). Speaking of grenades I almost never used them because of their wierd detonation timing, throwing and pitiful range. Most of these problems occur because enemies tend to stay afar and fire from medium to long range, whereas in Half-Life there would be aliens that required close ranged and flanked based combat. Enemies lack variety with their guns being the only varient. Geo-Mod technology is pretty pointless. It can be used to find secrets and stuff but the game never actually encourages it use and it doesn't have to be used for the whole game. Rocket launchers have pitiful splash damage and terrible accuracy.Vehicles are clunky and awkward to controlButtons are necessary to progress and are tiny, easy-missed things that are put in stupid locationsGames gets relentlessly difficult at some points. I was at the point of frustration where I had to turn on God Mode. This will no doubt give demoters of the review so-far the impression that I suck at the game. But I was at one point forced to face 3 combat vehicles and a hallway of about 20 enemies near the end of the game with 3 health. I was going down a tram when I stopped to a group with enemies that carried one-hit kill weapons. The fight with Capek is not won by skill with weapons aquired so far or through clever use of the Geo-Mod technology, but with hitting him with the flamethrower one time, a boss fight being a test of the skills you learned up to that point. That is not good game design. I liked some parts like the pseudo-stealth sections where you pretend to be someone else, and the times when the game gets more fast paced with good old fashoined shooting using cover and such. There also multiple paths sometimes which can get you different results.  Overall, I don't recommend for $10. Get it for $2 or less on sale and only play if you are excrementally bored. "

												this is a really long review. So please, bare with me.i got this game and it's terrible. But at the same time there is something intriguing about it that kept my playing until the Gryphon pseudo stealth part. Which was absolute nonsense. I am surprised people have good things to say about this game. but i have to say otherwise.to start off i don't understand the comparison to half life at all. the only kind of resemblance it shares is that it takes place in a facility. Thats it. there is nothing that comes even close to half life . From the puzzles to the enemies or intriguing storyline. i think it's kind of insulting to compare this garbage to a classic first person shooter. call me neckbeard or an elitist for it but lets face it this game doesn't hold a candle to half life. as far as story goes,you play as some guy, who has a name but i didn't bother to remember, going through this facility blasting ♥♥♥♥ on behalf of some rebellion and that's truly it. There is no other challenge other than maybe a stealth section or figuring out where the hell you are supposed to go. i made progress not because of interesting level design, but because out of pure accidental luck. there was so little variety in environment that i m surprised i got to where i am now. it's monotonous to say the least. enemy variety is limited. they really aren't tactile enemies. their main tactics include and are limited to: running straight at you. standing in one place, shoot. cower or not even notice you until after you have taken out at least half a gang of mindless cronies. the only time they pose a threat is on higher difficulty settings. But that's purely artificial. You take more damage and they take more shots to kill. Also. there might be something wrong with hitboxes in this game. Since you can shoot an enemy at point blank with a shotgun and they will still take three shots to kill. And i'm not talking about the slightly armored ones i'm talking about the regular dummies that are supposed to be a threat.the controls aren't exactly a benefactor. It feels so light and floaty. There is a lack of weight behind certain actions. Like reloading a gun, recoil or even things like jumping and character interaction. it feels hollow and it makes the game lacking in any sort of feeling.the graphics are outdated to say the least. that's all there can be said about the graphics. But they aren't ashamed of the fact that a lot of elements were copy/pasted which lend to the games boring feel. You'll run into countless clones on both sides of the fight. and yeah, that's not to say Half life wasn't guilty of the same thing. But in that game there was creative level design that used the visual assets to good use. and also a plethora of enemies, characters and assets that kept the game from becoming a repetitive snoozefest. But this isn't supposed to be me talking about half life. I'm supposed to talk about this game. this game is so bad that i'm talking about other, more better games in this review. the character concepts in this game are as vanilla as bad guys can get. The only interesting thing i ran into was a ♥♥♥♥ing fish out of all things.the sound design is awful. Voice acting is okay, but nothing outstanding or worthy of praise. Guns sound stupid or generic. The enemy punchlines are hilarious in the worst way. and the supporting cast of allies come across as whiny or ♥♥♥♥♥y. There is no reason to feel sympathetic towards the people telling you what to do or where to go. Because all they do is nag. i just wonder if they have enough cheese to go with all that whine. also everybody sounds the same. There is no variety in voice actors. you know what i mean with that.Some shooters survive the test of time. Games like half life, halo, duke nukem, doom, wolfenstein, etc... are all games that till this day are still a blast to play through from beginning to end. Red faction is not one of those games. This game aged very poorly. And it's just sort of sad that people give it praise because of it's ""revolutionary"" engine or just for pure nostalgia's sake. But we're (mostly) grown ups here. And it's time to move on. If you still have red fever. Just play red faction guerrilla. Sure, it's not an FPS, more like a free roaming game in space. But that game is fun. Albeit not great. It's still a million fold better than this game. and even then. You are doing yourself a big disservice just getting his game for nostalgia. Spend that money on something better. Wether it be a classic or something new. But by all means. Let this game be forgotten. It's for the better.short version: this game is a boring pile of garbage and you are better off paying 10 bucks on a better game.			"

												 This version is littered with bugs, the worst offender being a game-breaking one for the single-player campaign. Despite my best efforts to perservere past a certain stage, a new game breaking bug would arrise and stymie any chance at progessing any further.  In short, this version isn't worth the aggravation it'll most likely cause you. If you really wish to have a go at it, get the PS2 version.			"

												My first exeperience with this game was on the PS2. I bought it for a buck and heard it was really good. However on the PS2 the only thing I could seem to concentrate on were the really inaccurate controls that were so bad that the auto aim system simply made the game playable. Without the auto aim the game was impossible to play. So when I got into PC gaming I decided to pick this version up for 2 bucks because of mouse and keyboard controls. Well, mouse and keyboard didn't help me out as much as I thought they would which brings me to my first issue with this game. The enemies move abnormally fast which would be ok if they didn't take an absolute ton of bullets. They will take less if you shoot them in the head all the time but if you hit them anywhere else they are like sponges and alot of times your ammo supply does not allow for tons of sloppy shooting or body shots. Then there is this amazing story and unparalleled humor that everyone raves about in this game. It might have been something back in it's day, but it dramatically pales in comparison to a game like Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon. I played through the entire game and never had any laugh out loud moments.Fortunately the game was not a complete waste. Halfway through the game you do get some much better and very well deserved weaponry that makes the already difficult game much more enjoyable as you are not horribly underpowered anymore. The game is still very challenging and you will die, but it will actually be fun instead of feeling so one sided. The end boss fight made you feel helpless and bored at the same time as you would get your ♥♥♥ handed to you until you discovered where to run and hide. Then it was so easy it was almost insulting. Overall if the first half of the game had been as balanced as the second half it may have been worth while. Just when I started having fun with the game it ended.			"

												I remember this game being at best average when it was new. The story is dumb. The parts where you can drive vehicles are linear and easy. The fact that this game has a destructible environment was used only on a few select and very obvious places in the game. Also it has two frustrating stealth missions in the campaign.This game has definitely lost a lot of it's value in time. The graphics don't hold up, gameplay doesn't have anything original to offer and there just isn't any reason to play Red Faction 1 today. "

												Went i brought this game, i was expecting a fair challenge, but i was dissapointed and annoyed.The Game is full of annoying instant Kills, it doenst have a checkpoint system and looks horrible.The opening starts very slow as you start only using the handgun for atmost three hours in the game and later instead of getting better, it get worse, some weapons can take 30% of your life with one hit and the Railgun can kill you instanly, the worse thing is when the enemy spot you, they immediately shoots you non-stop.The Railgun Guys are hard to kill and they shoot you with extreme accuracy with an instant kill shot.It pretty obvious that this game dint have the correct Testing, especially in the final levels against the Mercs as the RailGun Mercs are sometimes placed in places were they arent supposed to spot you but they do, ending in your death with an very accurate shot in your head.If you want to die a lot, this is your game.Pros> Tons of WeaponsCons>Frecuent Instant Kills>Outdated Graphics>No autosave & checkpoint system>Weak Multiplayer>The Geo engine is atmost unused			"

												Not as good as you remember. Simply put: first person shooters aren't as timeless as other types of games. Fun for about 1 hour, after this first shooting section you'll find yourself lost and really without direction. Sneeking in red fraction is NOT fun in fact by my 2nd or 3rd hour I was running past these these moments hopeing to live long enough to make it to the other side I did this for about an hour till finally I entered a scripted cut scene talking to what I belive is the boss of the game talking to me about things I had no idea about. It was at this point I gave up on Red Faction. I'm sure some people will be able to muscle there way through this games downsides, I however was not strong enough.Recommendation: Do not buy it, It's not fun.			"

												I wish I could say this is worth it, but the one mechanic shown off several times early on (terrain deformation) doesn't get used as much as you would want the game to, and the rest of the game is a really generic feeling FPS with a few Descent-like vehicle segments (this game was meant to be Descent 4). There are some really bad issues with AI pathfinding like in one section where you need to escort a guy out of an office and a section with a rocket-wielding robot you need to lure into an incinerator (have fun with that). The plot is hardly interesting and I've never tried multiplayer because it's probably dead. Guerilla and Armageddon are probably the highest points of the franchise and that's not really saying much.			"

												My rating in short: go to bottom line.Only reason why I got this game was because the 4- part series was worth $11. Being the chonologically obsessive guy I am, I had to start rom the beginning. I was surprised that this game was originally released in the first month or so of the PS2's release. I was even more surprised on how absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game was. The overall story is pretty simple. It's your basic FPS with a variety of weapons killing the same guards over and over as you try to escape Mars from the oppressive mining organization Ultor. Later, you realize Ultor has been experimenting on the miners for some undisclosed reason. Must be a new evil pasttime. As soon as you dispatch the evil cyborg scientist, who evidently is also a magic user somehow, you continue your quest. However, then you have mercenaries drop in on you, along with their ruthless commander, who ALSO has unexplained magic powers.Graphics seem like they belong in the old Quake games, characters forgetable, and the voice acting is laughable. Gameplay is as simple as it gets; go from point A to point B while shooting down anyone and anything within sight. I do applaud the little bits that break the linear paths. Every so often, there's an alternate path in which you can traverse, and end up completely skipping a wave of enemies you'd normally face if you went the obvious route.The biggest problem I had was the enemy AI. At the beginning, the evil guards are laughable, the way they seem to dance all over the place and shout at you in a very cartoonish manner. ""Miner scum!"" ""Where do you think YOU'RE going, miner trash?"". For those who enjoy sneaking behind a group of enemies and catching them unawares will be repeatedly disappointed, as the enemy seems to have eyes in the back of their head. And as soon as ONE guard notices you, everyone and their mother unloades on you. It gets even more difficult in the second half of the game when the guards take many more shots (and multiple headshots) to kill, and your still as weak as ever. These armored up baddies also can blast you with one-shot killing rail guns, which they tend to fire just as soon as you pass around the corner. Sometimes, they don't even have to see you; their rail gun shots go through walls. Many rage moments were had. This game has so many glitches in it that I could go on and on about all of which that I've encountered...but I think you get the overall message.Don't. Just don't.			"

												Red Faction’s big feature was that you could destroy the walls in the game. It’s a damn shame they almost forgot to use that feature at all. You’ll get few spots here and there where you can blow stuff up and it’s mostly cosmetic. The game looks way worse than Unreal which was released three years earlier. It is also a lot emptier and the enemies are more boring. It’s weird that unlike in Crysis shooting the aliens in Unreal feels a lot more satisfying than shooting the soldiers in Red Faction. There’s just no feel to it at all. At first I was a bit intrigued by the levels since there were some interesting little bases on the red planet but then it just turns literally into running through corridors and shooting everything. The story might’ve been interesting if not for the horrible writing. Over all the game is just boring with no real identity.			"

												Red Faction recieved higher praise on PS2 than it did on PC. I believe part of this is due to the save features, which can screw you over in certain parts of the game. I could be wrong; I don't exactly remember my play-through of the PS2 version. All I know is, you can doom yourself in the exploding space shuttle stage if you save without enough time to possibly escape and you've neglected to keep older saves to back you up. The PS2 version also featured only a few of the PC multiplayer maps, which mainly included ones that were small enough for 1 on 1 fights. Considering the game only supports two players, this made the experience faster than on the PC, where players would be lacking and large maps would quickly become boring hunts for players to kill. The single player is relatively easy and trite, not to mention that it only lasts about, what, four hours? I could be wrong, but I swear I beat it that fast. Not sure I'll play through it again. Still to the PS2 version maybe? It's only good for playing with friends in the same room.			"

												The Good - Weapons are accurate and easy to aimMultiplayer is still alive... barelyYou can blow up terrainYou can drive vehicles (though it's possible to do so in other FPS)The Bad -Campy AI make for some frustrating gameplayHealth packs become scarce at many points in the game forcing you to death crawl through many partsStory isn't motivating, you're just a miner trying to escape from your enemies yet your so called allies ring you to do their dirty work in stopping the enemy instead of uh... i don't know... rescuing you? You also spend half the game not knowing what to do next and just wanting to get out of the firefight for one second to get a real incentive to actually kill the baddies rather than their silly miner prejudice which is never really explainedSome areas are just really drab, i know it's mars and all but everything is just red brown and gray the entire game. Occasionally you'll see a white. As a result, every single area feels the same and none of them are really memorable.Enemies have way too much health and since they like to camp behind doors, corners, rocks, they're really hard to kill.Music cuts off during load times.Some areas limit movement preventing you from strafing enemy fire.Medium difficulty is misleading, it should have been hard.Weapon balancing could be better, rocket launchers kinda suck against the mercs late game as they strafe around them, sniper rifles on the other hand are extremely powerful as are railguns. Then theres weapons such as the SMG which you'll only use when you have nothing else.The end game is pretty awful, rushed and requires a lot of trial and error too.I bought this on sale so i didn't waste too much on this thankfully, still there are far better shooters out there, only get this if you find it cheap and have played every other shooter out there, even then you may come to find it frustrating and annoying with too mnay ridiculous difficulty spike everywhere. Overall i say avoid it as it is an experience better off missing out on.			"

												An ambitious game that does not deliver.  It's full of half-baked features that other games from the same era did better.  The destructable environments are a throwaway gimmick, not a game changer.  Basically you can waste ammo making holes in featureless rock walls.  It rarely if ever opens new strategies.  Once in a while, you have to blast a wall next to a door that won't open, but for the most part, environments are indestructable, and when you find a dead end, you need to backtrack.  For something that was a major selling point for this game, the implementation was quite disappointing.  Also, Mechwarrior 3 did it better, sooner.  I only played long enough to do one stealth mission.  It was basically just like normal gameplay, except you only have a pistol, and you have to avoid walking too close to enemies.  It was very unpolished compared to any stealth focused game you can think of, and I felt it hurt the pacing of the game.The enemies sort of zig-zag back and forth, while randomly firing at you.  Compared to Half Life's enemies who used squad based tactics, it was disappointing.  If you shoot an enemy in one of their extremities, they'll stop and clutch that body part, for a moment, and then go right back to their previous behavior.  It's amusing for a moment, but doesn't really open up any new strategies.  Every weapon has two firing modes, but only one of them is useful.  A supressor for the pistol that doesn't actually change how enemies react to it being fired.  A shotgun firing mode that massively slows your rate of fire.  Stuff like that.What I saw of the storyline seemed really generic.  Imagine Total Recall with none of its quirky charm, or just watch the 2012 remake.  I admit I couldn't bring myself to finish the game.There's game stopping bugs like the exploding submarine, Gryphon won't follow, the combot won't move.  Sometimes you get stuck while climbing ladders, or crawling through ventilation.  Rockets sometimes glitch harmlessly through enemies. I quit playing after the combot.  tl;dr Get Red Faction: Guerrilla instead.  It delivers where this game makes empty promises.  Also it aged a lot better.			"

But the Red Faction attacks the mining base and it gives you a chance to make a break for it. You join up with the Red Faction to fight the Ultor corporation and taking them out of business. The game has a couple of glitches here and but it's worth a try, especially if you want to see the Geomod version 1 that they improved on over the later installments.			"

												To listen to people talk, you'd think the ability to blast holes in dirt was the main point of this game. But it's really only a small part. What you get with Red Faction is a solid shooter that tries a few different things all at once. The story's mostly just an excuse for action, but it's at least an interesting one that motivates you to commit your typical FPS acts of violence. A lot of places have multiple routes, some hidden. You've got tunneling, a couple stealth sections that aren't all that bad as far as stealth sections go, and land, air, and water vehicles. Red Faction is definitely packed with a respectable amount of gameplay. Now, I should say that halfway through, you'll fight Capek, a boss with a two-hit-kill homing attack that passes through walls. If you beat him, you are faced with the rest of the game, which replaces the typical enemies with beefed up, armored, highly accurate enemies who are Wild West-quick on the draw and often have one-hit-kill weapons. Save often.			"

												red faction was forgotten back so how is it now. the story  is about miners rebelling against the ultor corporation becuz they are being treated like trash. the gameplay is pretty standar but its hella fun because of geo mod physics cuz it adds destructable enviorments so it can make the game less linear. the weapons are standard shotgun, pistol, stun stick, machines guns, flame thrower,  shield , sniper rifles, rail. gun, sub machine gun, giant rocket launcher, c4s, pipe bombs, heavy machine gun, and another sniper rifle. so yeah its alot of fun weapons but some of them are used for small puzzles or find other weapons. the original red faction was underapprieciated back then and i havent played the sequels but i want to9.5/10 a fun game with a great gimick			"

												This game is kinda like a mix between Half-Life and those 1990's sci fi fighter games, like Fury 3. Its interesting to go back and play this game. I remember that what had impressed me years ago was that the environments had destructable portions, there were stealth moments, vehicles, and a lot of weapons compaired to other games I had been playing at the time. Also there were several times that i thought ""ok I beat the game"" and then it continued.Looking at this game now I realizing that the character dialogue, actions, and behavior seem off at times; sometimes its the pacing of action and dialogue. Lets just say that Half-Life has a MUCH better story that explains the who, what, when, why in a logical way.But back to this game; if you have a discount or its on sale then get it. Its another old game that influenced present gaming in some way. The last thing you do in the game will annoy you. You just have to be a good guesser because the sequence on the thing is random.

												Red Faction was an amazing game for it's time. The highlight being the destructible environments in both singleplayer and multiplayer. An example from multiplayer would be a map with two buildings three stories high. What strategy will you choose? Blow up the walls protecting your opponent? Shoot through them with a rail driver? Use a rocket launcher to tunnel to their base? Sadly singleplayer doesn't manage to fully capatalize on it. It's used in a few sections but isn't as prevalent as you may think. Despite that flaw the singleplayer remains entertaining and fast-paced. The story is passable although not amazing, and the voice acting is somewhat mediocre by todays standards. The music is pretty good and the majority of the sound effects are good to boot. If you enjoy FPS games that try a few new things I would recommend you give this game a shot.			"

												Old-ish (2001) THQ game, but the first of a series, and a great FPS. I recall Red Faction 2 being awful.. Guerilla had its moments as far as 3PS' go. This game, however, has a nice plot, fair graphics (and hardly needs a top GPU), decent voice acting, non-stop action, and strange yet not totally distasteful music. Takes about 7-10 hours to complete, and for the low price, is worth it. Tip: manually save often, because when you die, there are no set restart points, it goes right back to the start of the game regardless of how far in you were. Saving gives a ""Load last save"" option and makes life easier. There are plenty of guns, no melee, vehicles, and set to Hard or Impossible should make a fair and enjoyable challenge for veteran gamers. Been a long time since I played this.. but have enjoyed the replay; a very nostalgic game!			"

												The original Red Faction is a fun FPS set on Mars. You play as a miner who has had enough of his oppressive employers and has joined a general rebellion against them. This game is a classic FPS, with some really well designed levels and enemies that still hold their own today. It is also a difficult FPS, with certain bosses that require not only skill and strategy, but luck to take down. It is quite a short campaign, unfortunately, but is well worth the inexpensive price for a bit of FPS fun, and definetly worth a look during a sale. The game runs fairly well on modern systems, but I have had problems with save files disappearing. The solution is to not rename your save file in game. Other than that, it was a surprisingly smooth ride for an older game such as this. I would recommend this as a bit of classic FPS fun, with some great level designs, but be warned of the short playing time and potentially difficult points in the game.			"

												The first FPS where I was blown away that you could distruct enviroments. Was amazing during its timeFrom the creators of the award-winning FreeSpace series comes Red Faction. Every fps gamer has wondered what it would be like to unleash his weapons not just on unworthy opponents, but on the very walls that constrain them. With that in mind, Red Faction introduces Geo-Mod technology - real-time, arbitrary geometry modification that drastically enhances realism and diversity of gameplay. Framed by impressive features including an astonishing physics engine, controllable vehicles, intense graphics, kick-♥♥♥ weapons, unique natural environments and a hugely involving storyline, Red Faction is the next must-have title for serious gamers.

												An excellent old shooter. The destructible world was a great feature the game has (a feature that seemed to be toned down in Red Faction 2). Despite showing age with its graphics, the gameplay is excellent and challenging. The plot, while at times seems to go on and on is good in general.There are countless levels which span from martian terrain to indoor office like spaces. There are also times when the game slows down and you have to use stealth as opposed to going in guns blazing.One thing which a lot of modern games seem to lack is that it's CHALLENGING towards the end, the AI and the scenarios just get absolutely ridiculous and the devs seem to throw everything against you. Sometimes you end up fighting against AI that have a gun that can literally kill you in one shot.One bad thing - NO AUTOSAVE. If you get the game you have to remember to save, because it doesn't save for you, sometimes I lost a lot of progress because I'm used to autosave being a feature in the game.			"

There are numerous vehicles (tanks, spaceships, submarines) and a varitey of weapons. In Red Factions the attention to detail is awesome, you can see yourself in the mirrors as well as look at security camera monitors and see what the camera is looking at. This game also teaches you to use your weapons instead of saving the ammo because you might find yourself in a situation where you dont have all of your weapons anymore. 10/10			"

The story might not be as interesting as the later games such as Red Faction 2 and guerilla, and the grahpics aint anything to come by but looking at the time this game was released, competeing with games such as gta 3 the graphics to look too bad, plus the amazing Geo-Mod Engine which allowed for some deep world deformation such as blowing huge craters to use as cover or making holes in walls to create alternate passage points. The game is a direct ps2 port, and the controlls aint too bad for a port, no multiplayer support though. The oversaturation of the dull color palet of mars makes the game look worse than it is.Would recommend 9/10 - good gameplay and setting			"

												This is a good game. It feels kind of dated and has glitches but it does have some redeeming factors. The mechanic that lets you go many different places and paths by exploding the walls is cool but in all the later parts it is linear without that ability. This can cause gameplay to be kind of generic. Plus, the stealth sections kind of suck. It's not that they are overly conveluted and hard like other games that incorporate stealth when they shouldn't have (Time Splitters 2 comes to mind) but they are just kind of boring. There is good weapon variety and good controls it is still pretty fun overall and I would still reccomend picking up on a sale.			"

HERE'S YOUR ANSWER!I remember having endless fun with this game when I was just about 10 years old and my god, it has aged well. This game has an awesome story, solid voice acting, fantastic variety in weapons*, damn near completely destructable environments, boss battles, space ships and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ martian fish monsters.*Don't even get me started on that railgun man, just firing that thing will tear a hole in the ♥♥♥♥ing space-time continuum The only thing that I would have to say didn't age well in this game is the apparent fact that the graphics are a little dated. If you like any of the things above, I urge you to spend a little bit of your cash on this and enjoy blasting through doors and abusive security staff alike so that you can free mars from Cohaagen Ultor.

												This is a solid FPS.  I love the Martian revolution story breaking free of the oppression of Earth (potential future of humanity in real life?).  There are some interesting mechanics too with mining demolition charges allowing you to alter the environment or blow through obstacles.  In a series that had its ups and downs, the original is a high point.			"

												I vaguely recall playing Red Faction in the PS2 days, and it's still a lot of fun, albeit a bit dated.  Punchy weapons, cool (if limited) terrain destruction, and a great soundtrack reminiscent of Half Life and Unreal.  Just be prepared for the mother of all difficulty spikes nearing the end.  I had to check the options menu just to confirm I didn't accidentally crank the difficulty.  Thankfully these were the days when quicksave was the standard, so keep that button handy.			"

												A little piece of history - (I played this through many times before Steam even existed).Become a hero of the rebellion against the evil management of the Mars mines.Find out what is causing ""the plegg"".Seriously though, this game has not aged well.  If you like retro action games, this is gold-standard - the first game to include fully-destructible environments.  Can't find your way to your objective?  Blow a tunnel clean through the rockface.The highlights of the game are the (relatively rare, but not too rare) moments of vehicle combat, and an excellent ""undercover"" mission.Out of ammo for your gun?  Throw a sticky explosive on those annoying enemies and watch them drop their weapon and run around in panic while you take your time choosing the moment to depress the detonator!Fun times.			"

												My #1 favorite FPS from the PS2 era. Fantastic story, combined with great weapons and environments. 15 years later, and I still have many fond memories of this game. And very detailed memories of multiplayer matches with friends, and story points. The same cant be said with alot of games over such a long period of time.When I think of this game, its in the category of the highest quality fps games, the likes of Bioshock, early Medal Of Honor games.

What I liked about the game •	Good story, I liked the idea of the miners having a rebellion against the mining company Utah.•	I liked the science/industrial setting of the game. •	You can cause lots of destruction to the environment.  •	A good selection of weapons. I liked using the heavy machine gun. I also liked using the rocket launcher and the explosives, especially in the first part of the game, where you can cause lots of destruction to the environment.•	You can drive vehicles in the game. The Sub and the Aesir Fighter were awesome to use. •	I liked the soundtrack.  What I disliked or was disappointed with•	When you start to take on mercenaries in the game, the game switches from easy to very hard. The mercenaries carry a weapon called the Rail Driver, which can kill you in one shot, even if you have a 100% health and armour. The rail driver can also shot through walls and doors. The game becomes very frustrating. •	The cut-scenes in the game aren't very good and they are out of sync. •	I didn't like the stealth aspects in the game; it could have done without them. If you want to kill an enemy silently you have to be extremely quick and accurate, because the enemy can reach the alarm in seconds. •	The game is too short. •	I did encounter some bugs in the game. When I was using a mounted machine gun on an ATV in the Canyon, there were no sound affects from the weapons. (fix)I restarted the game and everything went back to normal. •	You have to save frequently, or else you'll have to start the level all over again. There isn't really an autosave system.    Conclusion A good game, a bit short and I didn't like the stealth parts, but overall I had an enjoyable experience. I liked the idea of the environment being destructible; blowing a hole through the wall was fun. If you like half-life I highly recommend you buy this. 81/100 "

												This is one of the best FPS of all time. Games are not made like this anymore. Great story, carry all weapons at once, health pack system, long diverse single player mode and most important its fun. I came back to this game just to check it out again and got sucked in for 4 hours. I played this first on Playstation 2 when it came out and I loved it. Now that I have seen how FPS games are being made now (multiplayer first and the rest is rushed), Im glad I got RF on Steam. I use Pure Faction to make the resolution right and I'm set. Red Faction is a true gem and should never be passed up.			"

												The first in the series of my personal favorite Playstation 2 series Red Faction, the first game is about the oppression of Minors by a mining company named Ultor on mars, several brutal events transpire before the minors begin to revolt againsts Ultor. My only complaints are that the AI is still spastic, and that Multiplayer games no longer have music playing. Now the games music sounds fresh, a new main menu is now available, and you are now able to play multiplayer with online friends, and the difficulty is what still keeps the game going. I would strongly recommend this game.			"

												I would recommend this game to people interested in FPS's and Geomod descructuin.This game is decent but it could have used some improvingPros:+Stealth missions add a interesting element into the gameplay+Geomod tech allowing you to destroy walls and carve paths in the enviornment+Story is actually original (some might say it is a rip off of Half-life 2 but look at the dates)+Variety of weapons to choose from (e.g. rocket launcher, SMG, assault rifle, explosive charge, sniper rifle, e.c.)+The concept of the SMG using two types of ammo is a interesting idea (can switch between machine pistol and submachine gun) Cons:-In stealth missions you only get a silenced pistol 2 mag's (including the one loaded in the gun) and if your caught your most likely done for (fortunatly stealth missions only happen twice)-The games graphics are outdated-The mercs are extremly hard to kill -Geomod is very limited in what you can destroy (It's mainly walls).In all I would give this game 8/10It's a good game and the time you play it will be well worth your money.

												I've been playing a bunch of old games, such as all the original half lifes, and this game kinda had a half life feel to it, it was very long, a wide interesting arsenal of weapons, and the destruction element was really cool. I'm gonna list a bunch fo goods and bads.Pros-Destruction of terrain -Wide array of weapons-Pretty fun-Really good music-Interesting bosses throughoutCons-Parker is literally the only reason the red faction survives, the rebels are literally worthless.-Friendly story NPC's are killed fairly easily, which will cause you to restart.-Literal no auto-save. You have to save as much as possible, if you forget and something ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ happens, have fun restarting.-Rail guns kill you in one hit.-Your rockets just flop on the ground after a while.-Submarines, fighter ships, APC's, they all instantly lock on you and are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to fight.-A HATED the part where you were in the water, all you had that can work is your pistol and charges, and the submarines missiles ALWAYS HITTED YOU.-Not going to spoil the ending, let's just say it involves a code. If you mess up, the code is restarted. If you fail, next round it's a whole new code. -Some parts were VERY hard. I play games to have fun, so some parts I had to cheat. Especially the submarine part, or when a NPC gets killed..or the ending. And I forgot to save, so I'm like ""screw it.""-Wish destruction played more of a role. I give this game 3/5 stars. I would recommend.			"

												Red Faction is an incredible game that introduced the game engine that brought about destruction to the world around you. This is the first game in the series and is a really great one. The graphics seemed old school to be playing it in these days but it makes up for it with it's gameplay and story as it unfolds. The mutliplayer portion of the game is still active but with a marginal community that is fun to play with. The story is well done and keeps you wondering ""what's going to happen next?"" The overall game is a steal for the price. You get your monies worth with this one. The story take awhile to beat and will give you alot to do while playing. There is a wide variety of weapons to shoots and enemies to kill. This is one First person shooter that keeps on giving. This is a great game for it's time and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story and fun gameplay.			"

												Red Faction, yes please. The first game to have a geomod. and quite frankly has an awesome story too. Basic story is miners from earth come to mars for the fortune and become slaves, then alec said no more and began the red faction revolution. This was the one of the Great Sci-FI FPS' of the yester-year, that u didnt have to go in striaght line, thanks to the geo-mod , I let me ammo do the walking for me, dig a hole in the wall to u find a secret exit, room or even sometimes buidling complex. U didnt have to listen to security saying not through this imprenatrable door. u just blew a hole in the wall around it and give it the words of ""yeah right"". This game I played when I was a wee lad and I can still go back to it and say ""yeah those were the days"" I loved this game then, now and probably for a lot longer, so what do u say want to join me of the nastolgia jump in time :D			"

												I still can't decide if it was good or bad. Graphics especially Geo-Mod tech is really good especially for 2001. Some minor problems like mirrors and missing widescreen support (use PureFaction).Gameplay, atmosphere reminds a vast Half-Life somehow. Mostly level designs are nearly perfect. BGMs are mediocre, always repeating itself and melody never connect if they loop. A sound effect taken from Quake 3 and changed a little bit, another one from MechWarrior 4. Funny.Game is unnecessarily long. After a while you'd murmur ""when will it over?"" with huff and puff effect.Also its multiplayer is still alive.

												Definitely a great throwback FPS; if you find it on sale, go get it. The story is so outrageous, you can really see Volition's knack for crazyness here. Besides the outrageousness that it shares with Saints Row, it also shares the same Ultor Corporation (and thus is set in the same universe).Gameplay is definitely fantastic, they just don't make games like this anymore. There is a difficulty curve about halfway through the game (right when you unlock the Precision Rifle) where you just get bombarded with enemies that are accurate and health drops become less common, so be warned if you aren't used to older FPS games and game mechanics.The story on normal takes about 9 hrs to complete, and there is multiplayer, although outside of the RF hardcore, I doubt there's many people still playing (last I heard, around 9-16 people still play).TL;DR go pick it up for a decently fun and cheesy campaign, as well as stellar FPS gameplay.

Its not just in obvious spots, actually 99% of the board can be reshaped! And it is encouraged! Awesomeness.I like how in some instances there are slightly different paths to get different reactions.

												Red Faction is a game I've wanted since 2010 when my dad told me about these kind of old fps games. I thought it would be like COD (when it was good and not a joke like Ghosts) on mars with C&C: Renegade graphics. I was 75% correct. The gameplay was nothing like COD, which I actually really liked because it was a new type of fps that I've never played before. Nowadays It's all about regenerative health, but this game has a health and armor bar. The guns were really cool looking. The assault rifle reminded me of a mix between an M-16 and the Pulse Rifle from Aliens (a good sci-fi space marine movie released in 1986). I liked the idea that there are no gunsights used in the whole game except for the sniper rifle. Summary:Red Faction is about a miner (forgot his name) who traveled to Mars with promise of a better life and better pay than jobs anywhere else from a profiting corporation called Ultor and the miners star a revolution against the Ultor Corporation for not treating them as human workers who need rest, but as drones or robots that don't need rest.Graphics: Exactly like C&C: Renegade, funny how RF came out in 2001 and Renegad came out in 2002.Spoiler (jk, it's not really a spoiler):In the beginning, the miners start a Communist UprisingFinal Verdict:10/10 - Vasili Zheitzev (for NOT being COD)0/10 - IGN (for not being COD)			"

												Great game. I remember playing it back in the day, but don't think that I ever finished the story - was more interested in the environmental destruction at the time.Anyways, RF has a decent story (no where near Deus Ex, of course, even though it is a more recent game), does not look as good as well (definitely better than the garbage called Red Faction 2), but the gameplay is really good (especially considering it's age), it has decent environmental variety, plenty of guns and the enemies don't get boring (even though there's not a lot of different ones) as the game does not throw then in droves (like in RF2) and they seem to have personalities.You need to get Pure Faction mod to be able to play this on a modern system (16:9 and 16:10 resolutions, Win7/8.1). The original install kept crashing for the without the mod, hence the crap Steam play time, as it does not recognise the separate launcher of Pure Faction.			"

The story is what will literally catch you up and set the rhytm you will play this dystopia, something you'll be running along as the combat model makes for fast movements and shooting, and you'll happen to literally run for your life.

												Old-ish (2001) THQ game, but the first of a series, and a great FPS. I recall Red Faction 2 being awful.. Guerilla had its moments as far as 3PS' go. This game, however, has a nice plot, fair graphics (and hardly needs a top GPU), decent voice acting, non-stop action, and strange yet not totally distasteful music. Takes about 7-10 hours to complete, and for the low price, is worth it. Tip: manually save often, because when you die, there are no set restart points, it goes right back to the start of the game regardless of how far in you were. Saving gives a ""Load last save"" option and makes life easier. There are plenty of guns, no melee, vehicles, and set to Hard or Impossible should make a fair and enjoyable challenge for veteran gamers. Been a long time since I played this.. but have enjoyed the replay; a very nostalgic game!			"

												Hmmm.... Never played this back in the day. The graphics have held up somewhat nicely. You can force a ton of AA on them, and it's ok. About Deus Ex 1 level.Overall, I was a bit let down. It didn't really cash in on the potential I saw in it. I feel this could have been so much better. A six hour campaign is too short for me, and the plot was in a no man's land between so-bad-it's-funny and just plain bad. They flirted with going over the top, but didn't really do it. The difficulty is off, too. It's a bit too easy at first, and then perfect for a while, and a bit too dicky in the end, And the changes are instant and jarring.The most wasted potential was with the engine itself. As far as I can tell, the whole point of the game is the fully destructible environment, and I don't think they milked it nearly enough. I really wish they'd had more time and money, to give this engine, and this world, and this story, the delivery they deserved.I'm almost 50/50 with this one, on whether to recommend it or not, but because I did have fun, it's thumbs up, barely.

												Red Faction Review (Spoiler Free)""A year in the Ultor mines seemed like a great way to straighten myself out. Man, was I a fool"".(Story)The year is 2075.  Earth's resources are dwindling forcing the colonization and resource mining of other planets.  The Ultor Mining Corporation has set up shop on Mars and regularly brings work and security personnel to the planet via shuttles from Earth.  Aimless protagonist Parker decides to spend a year working in the mines in an attempt to figure out what he wants to do with his life.  Upon arriving on Mars however, he sees a very different picture than the one Ultor's recruitment campaign painted on Earth.  Forced to work in terrible conditions, miners live under the authority of Ultor's private military.  Making matters worse is the mysterious ""plague"" spreading among the miners and Ultor's restriction of flight's back to Earth.  The flash point is reached on a seemingly routine day and Parker soon finds himself in the midst of a revolution.(Gameplay)Played in first person, gameplay is mostly shooting and exploration, with a few stealth levels thrown in for variety.  Red Faction is very akin to Half Life, requiring you to solve puzzles and defeat bosses/enemies in special ways without too much hand-holding.  Levels load as you play and string together much as they did in Half Life.  What made Red Faction unique was the Geo-Mod technology.  Using explosives or drills, Parker can blast his way through rock, concrete, and other materials, giving Red Faction a degree of player freedom.  Enemies driving over a rock chasm?  Destroy the bridge they are on and watch them fall.  Can't find a way to open that door?  Use C4 to make a tunnel next to it.  There are several vehicle segments in the game, where Parker may pilot drilling equipment, submarines, tanks, or fighter craft.  On foot, Parker has a vast arsenal of weapons from shotguns and assualt rifles to rocket launchers and even a flamethrower (hilarious to use).  The stealth levels require Parker to use a disguise, silenced weapons and to hide bodies.  These segments are my least favorite and can be aggravating at times.  Boss fights are occasional, though some are more memorable/innovative than others.  Ammunition can get scarce at times, even requiring you to go into a fight with a few rounds in each weapon.  Make no mistake, this can be a difficult game if you do not play it a certain way.(Design)Ultor's underground facilities and mines feel vast thanks to good environment design.  Mine tunnels, vast caverns, underwater bases, executive offices, military installations, and the Martian surface are all different in sight and sound.  Guns have a nice sharpness to them and exlosions create debris and balst marks.  Voice acting is good though at times the characters sound a little mono-tone.  (Final Comments)Half Life with vehicles and destructible environments is a good metaphor for Red Faction.  Parker's story is different than Freeman's but if you enjoyed the journey through Black Mesa, you will likely enjoy traversing the mines of Mars.  Challenging yet oddly satisfying, Red Faction will slick your thirst for destructible landscapes and a decent stroy in retro fashion. Just don't forget to quicksave!             "

												*Important Notice*(For some PC's you may encounter a gamebreaking bug due to compatibility issues with newer machines. The fix is pretty easy but will require you to have some basic technical skills. If you don't have that you might want to stay away from this one or pick up the PS2 version which is just as good if you can find it.)I can discribe this game with one word, wow! This game is magnificant. It's an adventure across Mars worth taking. It's strikingly similar to the first Half Life. You carry one of each weapon in the game and can blow open some walls to reveal shortcuts or flank your enemy. The story is pretty simple yet it will hook you after the first couple of levels.

												Red Faction is in many ways your average ""90s"" shooter, the common example is half-life. In other words lots of fast paced running through maps blowing enemies away. What made it special was the one of a kind destruction system, not only does it look cool but it can be used to blow through walls and make a quick getaway or catch enemies by suprise, over-all though it just looks really cool. If you like blowing stuff up and you like fast-paced fps gameplay you'll love this game. Who doesnt like that though!			"

This is the game that got me into FPS's in the first place.  Its just one of those games that you have to play. The PS2 version is far better htan the PC version but it still doesn't stop it from being an awesome game. The enemies, the characters, the weapons. Its a very well done game and its well worth a play through once or twice and play against some bots and explore / dink around in versus maps.

Just smash the wall with a rocket launcher. But... now it's pretty old. The plot is somehow nice, but I would recommend some newer editions like Guerilla. Also keep in mind, the RF and RF2 may not work on your computer or will in low resolution. You'll have to install some 3rd party additional patch to make it run on a newer PCs in high resolution.

												Red Faction was an amazing game for it's time. The highlight being the destructible environments in both singleplayer and multiplayer. An example from multiplayer would be a map with two buildings three stories high. What strategy will you choose? Blow up the walls protecting your opponent? Shoot through them with a rail driver? Use a rocket launcher to tunnel to their base? Sadly singleplayer doesn't manage to fully capatalize on it. It's used in a few sections but isn't as prevalent as you may think. Despite that flaw the singleplayer remains entertaining and fast-paced. The story is passable although not amazing, and the voice acting is somewhat mediocre by todays standards. The music is pretty good and the majority of the sound effects are good to boot. If you enjoy FPS games that try a few new things I would recommend you give this game a shot.			"

												The original Red Faction is a fun FPS set on Mars. You play as a miner who has had enough of his oppressive employers and has joined a general rebellion against them. This game is a classic FPS, with some really well designed levels and enemies that still hold their own today. It is also a difficult FPS, with certain bosses that require not only skill and strategy, but luck to take down. It is quite a short campaign, unfortunately, but is well worth the inexpensive price for a bit of FPS fun, and definetly worth a look during a sale. The game runs fairly well on modern systems, but I have had problems with save files disappearing. The solution is to not rename your save file in game. Other than that, it was a surprisingly smooth ride for an older game such as this. I would recommend this as a bit of classic FPS fun, with some great level designs, but be warned of the short playing time and potentially difficult points in the game.			"

												The first FPS where I was blown away that you could distruct enviroments. Was amazing during its timeFrom the creators of the award-winning FreeSpace series comes Red Faction. Every fps gamer has wondered what it would be like to unleash his weapons not just on unworthy opponents, but on the very walls that constrain them. With that in mind, Red Faction introduces Geo-Mod technology - real-time, arbitrary geometry modification that drastically enhances realism and diversity of gameplay. Framed by impressive features including an astonishing physics engine, controllable vehicles, intense graphics, kick-♥♥♥ weapons, unique natural environments and a hugely involving storyline, Red Faction is the next must-have title for serious gamers.

												An excellent old shooter. The destructible world was a great feature the game has (a feature that seemed to be toned down in Red Faction 2). Despite showing age with its graphics, the gameplay is excellent and challenging. The plot, while at times seems to go on and on is good in general.There are countless levels which span from martian terrain to indoor office like spaces. There are also times when the game slows down and you have to use stealth as opposed to going in guns blazing.One thing which a lot of modern games seem to lack is that it's CHALLENGING towards the end, the AI and the scenarios just get absolutely ridiculous and the devs seem to throw everything against you. Sometimes you end up fighting against AI that have a gun that can literally kill you in one shot.One bad thing - NO AUTOSAVE. If you get the game you have to remember to save, because it doesn't save for you, sometimes I lost a lot of progress because I'm used to autosave being a feature in the game.			"

												This... This game is.... just amazing for when it was made. You can break walls with C4, dive underwater with submarines and shoot people. Though there may be some glitches, areas that you need to search up how to do and crashing it is still a great game. 9.5/10			"

												To listen to people talk, you'd think the ability to blast holes in dirt was the main point of this game. But it's really only a small part. What you get with Red Faction is a solid shooter that tries a few different things all at once. The story's mostly just an excuse for action, but it's at least an interesting one that motivates you to commit your typical FPS acts of violence. A lot of places have multiple routes, some hidden. You've got tunneling, a couple stealth sections that aren't all that bad as far as stealth sections go, and land, air, and water vehicles. Red Faction is definitely packed with a respectable amount of gameplay. Now, I should say that halfway through, you'll fight Capek, a boss with a two-hit-kill homing attack that passes through walls. If you beat him, you are faced with the rest of the game, which replaces the typical enemies with beefed up, armored, highly accurate enemies who are Wild West-quick on the draw and often have one-hit-kill weapons. Save often.			"

												Red Faction is just plain fun!!!! A classic FPS that not only about killing hordes of enemys! The ombat system is good and easy to pick up! The weapons are fun to use and there is a great variety. There are some problems with the game though : the graphics are ok for the time (for PC) and the cutscenes are awefull. Also you have to constanly save over and over again! no autosave. Even with the cons this game lives on as a great atmospheric FPS 8/10			"

												A classic! Even though it's already over a decade old, it is still very fun to play. I spent countless hours playing multiplayer with friends on the PS2 back in the days. There is a lot rage potential since there are a lot explosive weapons as well as a railgun that allows you to see and shoot through walls.The weapons are definitely a plus in this game. We have the usual stuff such as shotguns, sniper rifles and machine guns, but also flamethrowers, railguns and rocket launchers. There really isn't any weapon which you don't need at some point or in some situation (unlike in other games).			"

												My review of Red Faction,At the start of the game you have the option to do a tutorial to learn all the controls, and I have to say it was one of the best tutorials I have ever played through. The game gives a fair amount of background to the setting, you play as Parker a miner on the planet Mars and a member of the Red Faction, a rebal group. From what the game tells you the conditons of the mines are horrible and everone is worked to death and the guards don't give a rats ♥♥♥, there is also a plague going around in the mine that is killings hundreds of miners. The goal of the game is to overthrow the Ultor. I played through the entire game in about 3 hours and 15 minutes, so yes this is a very short game. I can not stress enough this game is short but very hard, It's been a long time since I have considered a game to be ""hard""  but this game delivers! There are really only a few things I didn't like about the game the main thing was the MASSIVE difficulty curve about half way through the game, your just running around with your handgun and assult rifle killing guards easy as pie, then all of a sudden a new enemy type is brought up called ""Mercenaries"" a LOT of them carry a gun most of us know as a Gauss Rifle which will kill you in one hit no matter what, oh also the enemys can shot it through objects. The final thing I don't like is that it lacks in originality, IMO, if you have played Half-Life a game that came out around 3 years before Red Faction you will notice a unsettling amount of similarities, the game feels the same to play, the textures are similar the doctors have the exact same animation when healing you. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS that none of that bad stuff matters, it doesn't take away from the game at all, like I said before the game is very short but it is a fair story that for once makes sense. I had a large amount of fun playing this game and I recomend it to anyone who likes a FPS with a good challenge.My final rating of the game is a 88/100 Mined alien rocks, would do it agian.			"

												This game is an excellent simulation of Communism and it's ups and downs. The game puts the player in the role of Peter Roy Alkovich, a Russian man living a normal life in the U.S.S.R. He must survive the dark times of the near collapse of the country as he avoids mobsters, gangsters and thugs. Throughout the game, you are supplied with the moral options or Fight or Flight. If you play the game as a fighter, the game ends with you being screwing a giant portugese man in a bathroom stall. If you play as a runner, the game ends with you forcibly shoving a danish down Daniel Tosh's throat and making him choke to death.So yes. Very excellent game.			"

												Old-ish (2001) THQ game, but the first of a series, and a great FPS. I recall Red Faction 2 being awful.. Guerilla had its moments as far as 3PS' go. This game, however, has a nice plot, fair graphics (and hardly needs a top GPU), decent voice acting, non-stop action, and strange yet not totally distasteful music. Takes about 7-10 hours to complete, and for the low price, is worth it. Tip: manually save often, because when you die, there are no set restart points, it goes right back to the start of the game regardless of how far in you were. Saving gives a ""Load last save"" option and makes life easier. There are plenty of guns, no melee, vehicles, and set to Hard or Impossible should make a fair and enjoyable challenge for veteran gamers. Been a long time since I played this.. but have enjoyed the replay; a very nostalgic game!			"

I wanted to give it another go just to get that good old nostagic feel again. needless to say it got the job done.this game is a lot like half life in its fps type puzzle game however the reason this one sticks out from the other fps's in this time period is the sand box feel to it. it was one of the first action games to allow the player to blow an actual hole in the wall when you hit it with something explosive. it was revolutionaly for its time and thats what gained so much fame for the title at the time. it is also amazing with its ability to allow you to choose youre own path (for better or for worse) when fighting your way through mars. there are a few bugs however. glitches happen often and the graphics make minecraft look like crysis 3 in comparison. put that with laughable voice acting and you have a game that would be agonizing if it wasnt for the game play. over all, the story is good. the gameplay is great and its a decent nostagic fps with just enough challenge to make you want to play it over and over again.

												A very advanced game for its age, with a truely uniqe engine, that puts modern shooter games to shame, and make them feel inferior. The music was repetitive, but at least the sounds were nice and clean. The AI felt a bit clumsy/dumb, not to mention that they had the bad habit of spawning in you'r back.A bit bleak, but nice big maps to wreak havoc on, under or above them. I personally thought the ""supression combot part"" was hard, until i've reached the end game, which was simply unfair, with every second enemy running around with a rail driver A.K.A instant death machine. I've sadly never had the chance to play it online, so i can't say much about the multiplayer, only that it exists, with a few servers running.But overall, pleasant surprise from a game that aged well.7.5/10 "

												Red Faction is a game I've wanted since 2010 when my dad told me about these kind of old fps games. I thought it would be like COD (when it was good and not a joke like Ghosts) on mars with C&C: Renegade graphics. I was 75% correct. The gameplay was nothing like COD, which I actually really liked because it was a new type of fps that I've never played before. Nowadays It's all about regenerative health, but this game has a health and armor bar. The guns were really cool looking. The assault rifle reminded me of a mix between an M-16 and the Pulse Rifle from Aliens (a good sci-fi space marine movie released in 1986). I liked the idea that there are no gunsights used in the whole game except for the sniper rifle. Summary:Red Faction is about a miner (forgot his name) who traveled to Mars with promise of a better life and better pay than jobs anywhere else from a profiting corporation called Ultor and the miners star a revolution against the Ultor Corporation for not treating them as human workers who need rest, but as drones or robots that don't need rest.Graphics: Exactly like C&C: Renegade, funny how RF came out in 2001 and Renegad came out in 2002.Spoiler (jk, it's not really a spoiler):In the beginning, the miners start a Communist UprisingFinal Verdict:10/10 - Vasili Zheitzev (for NOT being COD)0/10 - IGN (for not being COD)			"

												A classic! Even though it's already over a decade old, it is still very fun to play. I spent countless hours playing multiplayer with friends on the PS2 back in the days. There is a lot rage potential since there are a lot explosive weapons as well as a railgun that allows you to see and shoot through walls.The weapons are definitely a plus in this game. We have the usual stuff such as shotguns, sniper rifles and machine guns, but also flamethrowers, railguns and rocket launchers. There really isn't any weapon which you don't need at some point or in some situation (unlike in other games).			"

												My review of Red Faction,At the start of the game you have the option to do a tutorial to learn all the controls, and I have to say it was one of the best tutorials I have ever played through. The game gives a fair amount of background to the setting, you play as Parker a miner on the planet Mars and a member of the Red Faction, a rebal group. From what the game tells you the conditons of the mines are horrible and everone is worked to death and the guards don't give a rats ♥♥♥, there is also a plague going around in the mine that is killings hundreds of miners. The goal of the game is to overthrow the Ultor. I played through the entire game in about 3 hours and 15 minutes, so yes this is a very short game. I can not stress enough this game is short but very hard, It's been a long time since I have considered a game to be ""hard""  but this game delivers! There are really only a few things I didn't like about the game the main thing was the MASSIVE difficulty curve about half way through the game, your just running around with your handgun and assult rifle killing guards easy as pie, then all of a sudden a new enemy type is brought up called ""Mercenaries"" a LOT of them carry a gun most of us know as a Gauss Rifle which will kill you in one hit no matter what, oh also the enemys can shot it through objects. The final thing I don't like is that it lacks in originality, IMO, if you have played Half-Life a game that came out around 3 years before Red Faction you will notice a unsettling amount of similarities, the game feels the same to play, the textures are similar the doctors have the exact same animation when healing you. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS that none of that bad stuff matters, it doesn't take away from the game at all, like I said before the game is very short but it is a fair story that for once makes sense. I had a large amount of fun playing this game and I recomend it to anyone who likes a FPS with a good challenge.My final rating of the game is a 88/100 Mined alien rocks, would do it agian.			"

												The first part of the Red Faction-series is a quite amusing game. It has a cool story, contains a lot of guns (most of them with a secondary firing mode) and environment is destroyable. However some graphical bugs appear, it is an absolutely recommended shooter for FPS-fans. Multiplayer is still alive thanks fans. It runs well on Win 7 32-bit with an integrated graphic card.			"

												Amazing story driven FPS that in my opinion nearly equals Half Life 1 in terms of sheer amazing. You follow the role of Parker, a miner working at the Ultor facility on Mars. Ultor is a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and treats everyone like crap. Eventually, the miners revolt. Your job is to aid the revolution as best as you can, and call in the Earth Defense Force to free the miners permanently from their slavery. The journey takes you all over the surface (and under it) of Mars. From old dilapidated mines to secret plague generating labs, to a space station in orbit around Mars, you will have a blast with this game. For $2.50 there's no reason to not buy this.			"

												This is a nice game. It feels like Half-Life 1 but instead of being a renegade soldier, you are a renegade miner with lots of futuristic mining equipment. Some things that make this game stand out from the rest is the ability to change the shape of the board using bombs and large drilling tank tractors. Its not just in obvious spots, actually 99% of the board can be reshaped! And it is encouraged! Awesomeness.I like how in some instances there are slightly different paths to get different reactions. Like going through a window instead of a door so the alarm does not go off. I say it very vague as to not give away a tiny bit during the first hour of play.			"

												Red Faction, one of the great classics of its time. It held so much fun with destructable enviroment, vehicles, smarter ai that gun 'n' run and a multitude of things. This is the game that got me into FPS's in the first place.  Its just one of those games that you have to play. The PS2 version is far better htan the PC version but it still doesn't stop it from being an awesome game. The enemies, the characters, the weapons. Its a very well done game and its well worth a play through once or twice and play against some bots and explore / dink around in versus maps. So if you're looking for an older game to play, this is one of them. Remember REEEEINFORRRRRRRRRCEMENTS.			"

												Without the nostalgia, I can't see recommending this game for modern audiences. It's not bad, but not exactly enthralling either if your dipping into the game for the first time. The multiplayer is mostly gone but it does seem as though it would have been interesting. I find it a reach to call it a ""great"" storyline, like some reviews. There are very few games I'd allow that adjective, and when I do, it is mostly for pacing, overall plot, and atmosphere than dialogue or character development. This definitely does not possess the latter two. It is a nice place to start in the Red Faction universe, certainly, but not a must.			"

												This game... It is enjoyable for most part. The two guns, Assault Rifle and Precision Rifle are the most fun to shoot with. More so than the sniper and rocket launcher. The destructible environments are superficial and wish they could have integrated it better. The problem is you give perfect aim mobs a one shot kill rail gun and sprinkle them around the game to snipe you as soon as you turn a corner. That rail gun is supposed to shoot through walls but never does. Overall, super frustrating. 2/5			"

												Red Faction is a series that I originally started playing on the Playstation 2. I fell in love with the story of miners on Mars, rising up against thier corporate overlords and towards a peaceful and free Mars society. Genre: FPSStory: Miners rise up against corporate overlords and you're their only hope.Story length : 10-12 hours, more if you mess with Geo tech. Multiplayer: KIAPros; Beginning story starts off fast and intresting. Geography destruction is cool and can lead to some cool goodies. Guns pack a punch and usually have a secondary use, alot like the Half Life series weapons. Can run on almost anything.Cons: Stealth sections are horrendous. Some mission objectives can be very unclear. Ally and enemy AI are lackluster, to say the least. Graphics aren't the best, but detract hardly at all from the overall expirence. Lack of enemy of variety. Overall, a very fun a cheap game (price wise) that doesn't destroy your PC in the performance department and is mostly a title to play to say that you've played it and get to expirence the awesome, though limited use of, Geo tech.

												I would recommend this game to people interested in FPS's and Geomod descructuin.This game is decent but it could have used some improvingPros:+Stealth missions add a interesting element into the gameplay+Geomod tech allowing you to destroy walls and carve paths in the enviornment+Story is actually original (some might say it is a rip off of Half-life 2 but look at the dates)+Variety of weapons to choose from (e.g. rocket launcher, SMG, assault rifle, explosive charge, sniper rifle, e.c.)+The concept of the SMG using two types of ammo is a interesting idea (can switch between machine pistol and submachine gun) Cons:-In stealth missions you only get a silenced pistol 2 mag's (including the one loaded in the gun) and if your caught your most likely done for (fortunatly stealth missions only happen twice)-The games graphics are outdated-The mercs are extremly hard to kill -Geomod is very limited in what you can destroy (It's mainly walls).In all I would give this game 8/10It's a good game and the time you play it will be well worth your money.

Until that point, I was heavily into the Half-Life series and was quickly becoming bored with it (at the time).  The first entry of the Red Faction series was truly amazing for its time.  The GeoMod (realtime destructible world geometry) was quite innovative for the time of this game's release.			"

That wasn't very fun either. Also have to watch out for little glitches that may get you stuck, i found myself stuck on one level (reactor level) and had to reload a previous save (since quicksave overwrites).

												This is a good game. It feels kind of dated and has glitches but it does have some redeeming factors. The mechanic that lets you go many different places and paths by exploding the walls is cool but in all the later parts it is linear without that ability. This can cause gameplay to be kind of generic. Plus, the stealth sections kind of suck. It's not that they are overly conveluted and hard like other games that incorporate stealth when they shouldn't have (Time Splitters 2 comes to mind) but they are just kind of boring. There is good weapon variety and good controls it is still pretty fun overall and I would still reccomend picking up on a sale.			"

												Good game, hard like those PS2 games that even in normal it seemed that were impossible to pass, not like some modern games that is formated to everyone to pass. The game has some bugs and some errors in the making like there is no save automatically and no checkpoint so if u loose you go to the begining of the game if you do not save. The history of the game is just meh, could be better. Has a lot of weapons and some parts of the environment are distructable and thats one of the main characteristics of the series. The graphics fit well in the time the game were created. Overal I recommend this game, even more if its in sale.			"

												A very advanced game for its age, with a truely uniqe engine, that puts modern shooter games to shame, and make them feel inferior. The music was repetitive, but at least the sounds were nice and clean. The AI felt a bit clumsy/dumb, not to mention that they had the bad habit of spawning in you'r back.A bit bleak, but nice big maps to wreak havoc on, under or above them. I personally thought the ""supression combot part"" was hard, until i've reached the end game, which was simply unfair, with every second enemy running around with a rail driver A.K.A instant death machine. I've sadly never had the chance to play it online, so i can't say much about the multiplayer, only that it exists, with a few servers running.But overall, pleasant surprise from a game that aged well.7.5/10 "

Now this is the plan, Get your ♥♥♥ to marsEver wonder what TOTAL RECALL (1990) would be like as a game? HERE'S YOUR ANSWER!I remember having endless fun with this game when I was just about 10 years old and my god, it has aged well. This game has an awesome story, solid voice acting, fantastic variety in weapons*, damn near completely destructable environments, boss battles, space ships and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ martian fish monsters.*Don't even get me started on that railgun man, just firing that thing will tear a hole in the ♥♥♥♥ing space-time continuum The only thing that I would have to say didn't age well in this game is the apparent fact that the graphics are a little dated. If you like any of the things above, I urge you to spend a little bit of your cash on this and enjoy blasting through doors and abusive security staff alike so that you can free mars from Cohaagen Ultor. I guarantee you'll never hear the word Miner the same ever again.TWO WEEKS/10

												This is one of the best FPS of all time. Games are not made like this anymore. Great story, carry all weapons at once, health pack system, long diverse single player mode and most important its fun. I came back to this game just to check it out again and got sucked in for 4 hours. I played this first on Playstation 2 when it came out and I loved it. Now that I have seen how FPS games are being made now (multiplayer first and the rest is rushed), Im glad I got RF on Steam. I use Pure Faction to make the resolution right and I'm set.

												To listen to people talk, you'd think the ability to blast holes in dirt was the main point of this game. But it's really only a small part. What you get with Red Faction is a solid shooter that tries a few different things all at once. The story's mostly just an excuse for action, but it's at least an interesting one that motivates you to commit your typical FPS acts of violence. A lot of places have multiple routes, some hidden. You've got tunneling, a couple stealth sections that aren't all that bad as far as stealth sections go, and land, air, and water vehicles. Red Faction is definitely packed with a respectable amount of gameplay. Now, I should say that halfway through, you'll fight Capek, a boss with a two-hit-kill homing attack that passes through walls. If you beat him, you are faced with the rest of the game, which replaces the typical enemies with beefed up, armored, highly accurate enemies who are Wild West-quick on the draw and often have one-hit-kill weapons. Save often.			"

												red faction was forgotten back so how is it now. the story  is about miners rebelling against the ultor corporation becuz they are being treated like trash. the gameplay is pretty standar but its hella fun because of geo mod physics cuz it adds destructable enviorments so it can make the game less linear. the weapons are standard shotgun, pistol, stun stick, machines guns, flame thrower,  shield , sniper rifles, rail. gun, sub machine gun, giant rocket launcher, c4s, pipe bombs, heavy machine gun, and another sniper rifle. so yeah its alot of fun weapons but some of them are used for small puzzles or find other weapons. the original red faction was underapprieciated back then and i havent played the sequels but i want to9.5/10 a fun game with a great gimick			"

												Red Faction is an incredible game that introduced the game engine that brought about destruction to the world around you. This is the first game in the series and is a really great one. The graphics seemed old school to be playing it in these days but it makes up for it with it's gameplay and story as it unfolds. The mutliplayer portion of the game is still active but with a marginal community that is fun to play with. The story is well done and keeps you wondering ""what's going to happen next?"" The overall game is a steal for the price. You get your monies worth with this one. The story take awhile to beat and will give you alot to do while playing. There is a wide variety of weapons to shoots and enemies to kill. This is one First person shooter that keeps on giving. This is a great game for it's time and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good story and fun gameplay.			"

												Red Faction, yes please. The first game to have a geomod. and quite frankly has an awesome story too. Basic story is miners from earth come to mars for the fortune and become slaves, then alec said no more and began the red faction revolution. This was the one of the Great Sci-FI FPS' of the yester-year, that u didnt have to go in striaght line, thanks to the geo-mod , I let me ammo do the walking for me, dig a hole in the wall to u find a secret exit, room or even sometimes buidling complex. U didnt have to listen to security saying not through this imprenatrable door. u just blew a hole in the wall around it and give it the words of ""yeah right"". This game I played when I was a wee lad and I can still go back to it and say ""yeah those were the days"" I loved this game then, now and probably for a lot longer, so what do u say want to join me of the nastolgia jump in time :D			"

												I still can't decide if it was good or bad. Graphics especially Geo-Mod tech is really good especially for 2001. Some minor problems like mirrors and missing widescreen support (use PureFaction).Gameplay, atmosphere reminds a vast Half-Life somehow. Mostly level designs are nearly perfect. BGMs are mediocre, always repeating itself and melody never connect if they loop. A sound effect taken from Quake 3 and changed a little bit, another one from MechWarrior 4. Funny.Game is unnecessarily long. After a while you'd murmur ""when will it over?"" with huff and puff effect.Also its multiplayer is still alive.

												Red Faction was an amazing game for it's time. The highlight being the destructible environments in both singleplayer and multiplayer. An example from multiplayer would be a map with two buildings three stories high. What strategy will you choose? Blow up the walls protecting your opponent? Shoot through them with a rail driver? Use a rocket launcher to tunnel to their base? Sadly singleplayer doesn't manage to fully capatalize on it. It's used in a few sections but isn't as prevalent as you may think. Despite that flaw the singleplayer remains entertaining and fast-paced. The story is passable although not amazing, and the voice acting is somewhat mediocre by todays standards. The music is pretty good and the majority of the sound effects are good to boot. If you enjoy FPS games that try a few new things I would recommend you give this game a shot.			"

The enviroments are a bit stiff, because the metal coridor theme, so popular back then. The destruction is very advanced for its time, but u barely need to destroy anything at all. The game has a cool overall feel. The story isn't that awesome, but won't affect the game. SPOILER KIND OF ALERT Don't even bother to disarm the bomb in the end, because there is nothing more after it, just credits. I don't know about anybody else, but it was a great deal at 1,50 euros.

												Great game. I remember playing it back in the day, but don't think that I ever finished the story - was more interested in the environmental destruction at the time.Anyways, RF has a decent story (no where near Deus Ex, of course, even though it is a more recent game), does not look as good as well (definitely better than the garbage called Red Faction 2), but the gameplay is really good (especially considering it's age), it has decent environmental variety, plenty of guns and the enemies don't get boring (even though there's not a lot of different ones) as the game does not throw then in droves (like in RF2) and they seem to have personalities.You need to get Pure Faction mod to be able to play this on a modern system (16:9 and 16:10 resolutions, Win7/8.1). The original install kept crashing for the without the mod, hence the crap Steam play time, as it does not recognise the separate launcher of Pure Faction.			"

												The original Red Faction is a fun FPS set on Mars. You play as a miner who has had enough of his oppressive employers and has joined a general rebellion against them. This game is a classic FPS, with some really well designed levels and enemies that still hold their own today. It is also a difficult FPS, with certain bosses that require not only skill and strategy, but luck to take down. It is quite a short campaign, unfortunately, but is well worth the inexpensive price for a bit of FPS fun, and definetly worth a look during a sale. The game runs fairly well on modern systems, but I have had problems with save files disappearing. The solution is to not rename your save file in game. Other than that, it was a surprisingly smooth ride for an older game such as this. I would recommend this as a bit of classic FPS fun, with some great level designs, but be warned of the short playing time and potentially difficult points in the game.			"

The story might not be as interesting as the later games such as Red Faction 2 and guerilla, and the grahpics aint anything to come by but looking at the time this game was released, competeing with games such as gta 3 the graphics to look too bad, plus the amazing Geo-Mod Engine which allowed for some deep world deformation such as blowing huge craters to use as cover or making holes in walls to create alternate passage points. The game is a direct ps2 port, and the controlls aint too bad for a port, no multiplayer support though. The oversaturation of the dull color palet of mars makes the game look worse than it is.Would recommend 9/10 - good gameplay and setting			"

Blow a tunnel clean through the rockface.The highlights of the game are the (relatively rare, but not too rare) moments of vehicle combat, and an excellent ""undercover"" mission.Out of ammo for your gun?  Throw a sticky explosive on those annoying enemies and watch them drop their weapon and run around in panic while you take your time choosing the moment to depress the detonator!Fun times.			"
