												We set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush. Johannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly. Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before. I was in the middle with Peters and his trusty sniper rifle, carrying the M2 Browning. And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.The others had been glancing uncertainly at the MG I held in my hands, but I quickly dismissed the growing fear as they were undoubtly only nervous about a rookie with such a powerful weapon.It was quiet. Too quiet.The bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.The sound started as a low rumble. We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking. It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling. We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.But nothing could prepare us for what happened next.A giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.We opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.Stewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson. He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels. One of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind. They never saw it coming.By now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his sniper rifle with reckless abandon.  Running out of ammo, Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.I was cornered, MG propped up against an overturned cart while I mowed down soldier after soldier, spent casings flying everywhere.  From out of nowhere, a fist collided with my face and I blacked out.Waking up, I found I was tied down to a chair in a pitch black room.  The only thing visible was a glowing box directly in front of me with words written on it.  Squinting my eyes, I barely made out the small, black letters.The box read:Kicked from server.  Reason: lol dont use MG skrub  "

												Bloody frusterating as all hell.Why?Walking through an ally way with team mates, at least fourIm at the front, theres a machine gun at the exit and I can't get out.Suddenly, team mates all decide the best course of action is to throw their grenades out of the exit in an effortless hope to kill the gunner.They all miss horribly. Allyway is filled with grenades, I turn around and start screamingmaniacally while the rest of the team says ""GO FORWARD DUMBASS""I sprint out of the allyway at mach speed, get gunned down, the restof the team gets blown out of the allyway by the force of a thousand suns into one big pile of clipping corpses in front of this mortifiedmachine gunner who just witnissed the first friendly fire inducedholocaust. The gunner siezes this fnck-up and takes advantage of ourmajor failure. He pushes up into the allyway where all of us, again, try to have another go at it. This time, im not first. someone else is.The first guy sprints into the allyway and is gunned down. I decide to throw a grenade which promptly kills the machine gunner and I run into the ally. My♥♥♥♥♥backwards sorry sh!t-for-brain team mates don't read the bloody kill feed and throw grenades at me, thinking the machine gunner is still there. I scream ""GUYS WHAT THE HELL,IT'S CLEAR, DON'T THROW GRENADES"" but apparently all they heardwas ""IT'S CLEAR"", because they all came sprinting into the allywaypractically slipping on their own grenades like mario kart banana peels,and the grenades vaporize our asses clean off. The game is pretty good. 10/10			"

												I've played DoD longer than just about anyone, since I ran the largest Counter-Strike community at the time of the first beta. The creative young'guns teens who introduced the game were pretty immature at the time, but they figured out how I can lay down, whereas cliffie and goose never figured that one out in CS :) It could have ended up a better game than it stands today, but it still is a fun game to play.The development team didn't listen much to us [CoFR]Crusty old Fossil Rockers, and the weapons balance ended up off-kilter. That said, I am a life-long gamer who plays lots of other games, but I return to DoD and the HL1 engine because I have a few friends I've played DoD with for a long time, and I like the net-code for the most part.I recommend this game, especially to the new gamer who wants to learn how to use teamwork as part of a small squad. Servers now are few and far between, so I thought I'd write a review before its demise. heheh			"

My Personal All-Time Favorite GameHello All :) Yeah ive played this game from Beta days as a Half-Life Mod on the old WON days. This game is like the grandfather of WW2 games , Before COD and all other WW2 games there was Day of Defeat. I have a major love for this game. I also made alot of good friends amongst my battles along the way :) {""We few, we happy few, we band of brothers""}The game play is a bit older and slower then its predecessor of the day Counter-Strike.The Capture the Flag gameplay and Objective Play inforce strong team work and communication game play. The game has aged a bit of course but the key gameplay is still relevant today.It may not have had as a big following as did CS did but the community it has , has kept this game alive and well even today. I would highly recommed this game to anyone that loves WW2 games and Loves the old school game play and who also would like to see what we played back in the day,before the flood of WW2 games saw the light of day.I will say there are not as many servers today as there were back in the day, but there are a few good ones still alive and kicking today.Some with bots and others packed we people {At certain times}. I myself am still very active to this day in this game.So give it a try and see you on the Battlefield Soldier !!!!			"

												One of the best skill-based and highly technical WW2 shooters out there. Bullets kill people if you hit, the automatics need solid mouse control and grenades are very very precise. Also far more classes, weapons and an extra faction compared to the watered-down source version. It's also really fun to mod.			"

It is a great first person shooter were you capture the flags on some maps, and others were you plant bombs to destory your objectives it is a dying game sadly... but if you find a good server that you or your friends can play in I garantee you all will have a blast playing this game its even funner if you have your own server.- Bloodwolf			"

Same scenario as my Deathmatch Classic review, I was on my Dad's old Steam account and I saw Day of Defeat on it and when I was really little I used love The Military and World War II so this game was so fun to play when I was young. Now I'm not into the army anymore but this game is still very fun to play plus it brings me back to when I was a young chap.			"

 Day of Defeat is the last skill-based FPS game made. Per-pixel accuracy, anticipation, map awareness, reflexes, it had it all without being a complete spas fest like Quake. The added ""realistic"" nuances of modern FPS such as larger maps, larger player matches, movement penalties, class/archetype dependencies have only taken away from the pure competitive FPS experience. Unfortunately, this style of FPS is an end of an era, encapsulated in its time. Games that try to fuse this with modern elements such as the latest Counter Strike releases feel dated. The last attempt to revive this title (Source) also tried fusing modern elements to gameplay but compromised what made DOD unique and great in the first place.			"

												At first I was sceptical of day of defeat, but then I started the story. It instantly sucks you in with deep characters, varied dialoge options and real consiquences. Your thrust into a rich retro WWII world torn by war, with nothing but your standard arsenal of guns and bullets. The drab uniforms and faces of all the characters really gets you in the mood for defeat. And the voice actors are simpky stunning, xXSniper1337Xx's line ""♥♥♥♥ you n00b♥♥♥♥♥♥you scrub"" as he dies to my landmine really pulls at the heart strings, and I stillhear his worlds echoing in my ear to this day. Definatley recomend for any fan of call of duty  or battlefield fan.			"

												Despite it's age, ''Day of Defeat'' is still alive and doing well. A lot of the players are non-Steam, so the charts are only correct for the Steam users. It's a WW2 shooter with realism. It is very hard to get into this game since it has a big learning curve and pretty much everyone is extremely good. Most of the maps are very well made and balanced. There are a few narrow maps which are a slaughterhouse if there are too many players though. I believe that there are things you should know before playing this game, so here are a few words of advice: - Grenades are very powerful- Grenades are detonated quicker if you pull the pin and do not throw it for a while - Most Grenadier and Sniper shots will be a one shot kill - In narrow maps it will be very frustrating, so play on larger maps first - Automatic weapons have recoil which is very hard to handle, so take your time to learn the basics of each weapon - Constantly check the map to see if you have teammates around, so you know if it's safe to push - You will die. A LOT.That's pretty much it. Things like spots, weapons, maps and tricks you will learn along the way of playing it. First few hours will be very frustrating, especially for someone who hasn't played realistic shooters, but you will find yourself scoring more and more kills over time and it will be very satisfying. So, give this game a shot even if at first glance you think that the game is bad or everyone is too good or cheating. It is one of the best WW2/Realism games I've played for sure.			"

												AHH what to say. Well i started playing this game years and years ago...... There are a few servers up that have non-bots in them, (id say usualy around 5 at a time) the players nowdays when i login seem to be the same players from back in the day, so its nice to be able to login and see all of the old players :D i keep trying to get them to buy newer games with me, but DOD players are usualy hard core DOD players. alot of the players, are older, and dont have ""gaming computers"" so they cant really buy anything better at the moment. BUT with that being said, there are older players here. i dont run across many squeakers that end up annoying you. ALSO the popular servers are usualy being populated around 10pm pacific time to early morning. So this is a great game if you just want some good talk, with no bull♥♥♥♥♥♥people. I usualy login around midnight when i play it, just to chat and shoot. For $5 id say its worth it for that aspect. ALSO- Day of defeat has no single player. so if you plan to buy it, dont be angry if in a few years you cant find any way to play it, because of no servers. but who cares really its only $5i guess i got lucky, i bought counterstrike and got dod free when dod was popular and being played competatively (cal and other comp systems) with realism and things back in the day, and playing for money this game was ALOT different for me then it will be for you guys. the best you can get now is logging in, shooting things and chatting.

												Hell yes, this game is amazing, its pretty fun with friends, or by your lonesome, as long as you good with an MG or a sniper. I'd say that this games only downfall is the low player count, and the constant hackers in the already low count of players, but other than that its pretty good!So yeah get this only when its on sale, cause it doesnt have bots so your gonna have to play online with only like 50 - 100 players.

												Sure, this game is outdated, but I don't feel the decay as much as I do in TFC. The gun combat is still rather fluent, and all in all, I feel like this game definitely aged the best out of all the gold source games, yes, even more than 1.6 in my opinion. Sadly, people rarely play this game anymore. I'm lucky to find 2 full servers and a couple with less than 10 players. The rest? Empty. And in those with players still in it, well....They have been playing this game for ages, so you might have to get good almost instantly or go home. I still enjoy this game, and it's yet another piece of Valve's history.			"

												 For a new starter like me, it was helpful that some of the maps were those you already know. Dust, Aztec, and maybe there's more. Yes, maps from Counter Strike. For this reason, I was able to get used to this game easier than I thought. I was surprised to  see that there were still many people playing this game. Without them I might have never had the chance to enjoy Day of Defeat. Gear up, It's time for classic gunfire wars.+) Easy and straightforward game play. Shoot on sight and Capture the flag.+) Various types of soldiers. Each of them deals with different type of weapons like Team Fortress.-) Grenades' graphic is poor. They look like some rocks, fragments or some kind, so It's hard to notice it at first. It takes longer time to blow up than you would expect so at first you might be killed by your own.			"

												Picture this: A counterstrike style game that the quickscoping f4gs cant play because you actually have to use a sniper the CORRECT way: A game that you have to use tactics and cant run out like Rambo, a World War 2 Counterstrike: Thats the way to describe this game. This game is old, yet still active today. For a first time player like me, i wanted to quit at first because it seemed like everyone was just way too good. The players that are still on this game are mostly veteran players with countless hours logged in knowing every single map, every single hiding spot, glitch, you name it. The community for the most part is pretty nice and there arent any hackers that ive ran into just yet in the time ive spent playing. The best part of this game is the fact that there arent any quickscopers: the sniper rifle takes time to shoulder your rifle and zoom into the scope, something that every other game somehow misses. I dont want to offend any of the quickscoping f4ggots or anything (actually, i do) but its a really great game just for that reason alone in my opinion. I heard that when it was first made it was free, but steam decided to put a price of 5 bucks on it. Thats kinda stupid. But anyway, its still a pretty decent game and even though its old, it still shines today.			"

												This is one of the best shooters I have played in a long time, I really like the WW2 setting, a nice departure of our CoDs and Halo's of our time (I do like Halo though). The maps are all unique and fun, if a bit unbalanced towards the Axis forces in most instanses. The graphics are a little outdated but have that charm that all GoldSource games seem to have. It isn't dead, I thought it would be, but it wasn't and there are still plenty of servers to choose, I would advise [FULL METAL JACKET]  for a great server to play on with a great range of maps and there are always players playing, it's how you should play DoD. For the price of three pounds nintey-nine pence, no that isn't American currency - deal with it - it is a great shooter and definatley worth every penny.			"

Day of DefeatCommonly abbreviated as DOD, Day of Defeat is a tactical shooter taking place in WWII, where you, the player, take control of a soldier. The classes are abundant, as you can go from rifleman to sergeant. The faction's classes are accurate, but that is not all.MechanicsThe game has great balance. Just like it's brother, DOD:S. Although snipers and grenade spam rarely is a problem, hidden LMGs that have been tactically placed are really annoying or useful. A grenade can take said camping LMG soldier out.MapsThe maps are creative and fun, some being the prior versions of the DOD:S maps. There is also a vibrant modding community that loves to produce new maps. These maps all have tactical points that require being taken. There is also a rush gamemode (I think) and a few others.CommunityThe community is full of veteran players that will provide challenge for you. The community is also vibarant. I'd suggest you hop on and check them out. They can be really nice teachers and friends.9.7/10			"

												This is the game that really got me into online gaming.  Granted that was a couple decades ago, this game was epic in those days.  Maps and player types that could balance eachother out.  I cannot tell you the number of hours I spent on this game, but it was a hell of a lot more than the 50 that steam shows.  This game taught me many of the basics, and it is a shame that I rarely get to play it, because most of the servers are bot ridden, and the player base is practically extinct.  However on occasion a few of my old friends and I hop into the time machine and revel in the days of old.This game holds a 5/5 in my book, even if it doesn't hold up to modern standards.			"

												Day of Defeat is a WW2 themed multiplayer team and class-based game of capturing and holding off points. Capturing points is not the only gamemode, but most played, if not only one, around. You could get betas of the game for free as mods for Half-Life 1, but the final versions were released as paid Retail product by Valve. And as you can see, it got on Steam too.First thing first, since it's a multiplayer title... How is community of this old game? It's doing well! It may not have overwhelming amount of players, but you will always find few almost-full servers. And while dod_avalanche map appears to be favourite among the community, you still will get to enjoy some maps variety on various servers. Not so much on game type variety though, capturing the flags points is most played.As said, Day of Defeat is a WW2 shooter. Team and class based. A mix between arcade and realism. Weapons are as deadly as in many such shooters, just having single person rush forward will do no good, should do that in team. Many weapons also have big recoil, which depends on your stance: moving, standing, crouching or prone. Being prone is the slowest and clunkiest, easy to hit from above, but harder from long distances, also giving character almost no recoil when shooting. Yes, camping is a viable strategy here, but I feel that I have more chance to break through camping than in, say, Counter-strike. Players can respawn any time, so putting yourself to risk isn't bad idea. Each character also have a stamina, which is used when you spring and jump, slowly recovering afterwards. The slowing effect after using it is quite punishing, so you should sprint from cover to cover. Don't use sprint when moving to the front from the spawn point.Maps are designed to be more of pipes, like classic maps, not open fields, providing a main path and few flanking routes. Even more curious, the maps are assymetrical, which may possibly provide some inbalance (I think that Nazis in Avalanche map have height advantage). Breaks the usual symmetry monotony though, more interesting. Some maps even feature British forces instead of American ones. (they have less classes though)No, this one doesn't have vehicles, it is not Battlefield after all. Each team has up to 10 classes. The only difference most have is primary weapon and whether they have or not grenades to spam at corners and choke points. None have ironsight, if you wonder, aside from scope for sniper rifles. And most of primary weapons tend to be quite similiar to each other, which I don't like, as I prefer classes to be more diverce... something what Day Of Defeat Source did. Classes can be divided into:1) Close Range Assault classes - have guns with light recoil, good for running and gunning, and then getting one-hit killed by another rushing rifleman.2) Assault Support classes - more recoil, medium range, they better occasionally crouch or stand to be able to litter enemies with bullets at close range.Close range and Support get mixed a bit together, making other classes.3) Riflemans - Killing mens with one bullet per few seconds, medium-long range class. Well, and short one too. Only bad when rushed by few mens. Just crouch occasionally4) Machine Gunners - limited, they can deploy their machine gun on sandbags or while prone. Their machine gun allows them to give your team control over area. Just watch out for snipers and grenade spam. No grenades.5) Snipers - not really much of different from Rifleman, just got scope and more accurate while scoped. No grenades though.6) Bazooka - You got rocket launcher. And if you imagine infantry going ""whee"" from rocket - too bad. It's a utility weapon, which only very few maps have use for, like blowing tank in some map (that I didn't get to play in public servers yet). Very annoying whenever Random keeps giving you this class.The graphics technically are quite outdated, but still provide it's own quirk. The music is almost non-existing. Only main theme and victory tunes are there.So, nice game, especially when measured with other HL1 mods. Still fun and still has active multiplayer. But the people who don't like hitscan weapons and who like to get right into action, it's not for them.			"

												A true classic from the days when half a dozen guys in their basements could work together to produce the best game they could because they wanted to play the best.  The simple, predictable mechanics of the GoldSource engine give you a level of fine control over movement that greatly contributes to the depth of the gameplay.  It's not without some bugginess and rough edges, all games of that era had that, but once you get past the dated graphics the gameplay stands up to any modern FPS out there.  I would argue it surpasses them.  Once you get passed the initial learning curve, you'll have some adrenaline-pumping moments, sneaking behind enemy lines, going on fast-paced rampages, chucking an enemy's grenade right back into his face.  The community is quite mature and friendly and has a relatively high proportion of female gamers.  There are still some very good servers going, and at the right time of day you can still play on a couple of full servers.  There are hundreds of custom maps, many of them every bit as good or better than the official maps. It's great to play a game knowing that you're helping the other people playing be able to enjoy themselves.It's cheap, buy it, stick with it for a bit, and help keep this awesome community alive.

												War has cometh!  Do you want to be spawn camped? DO you enjoy getting killed in 1 to 2 shots from an unknown position?  Do you fantasize about being pinned down by german machine gun fire like the opening scene in Saving Private Ryan, only to scream ""SHOW ME SOME FIRE DISCPLINE JACKSON!"" (Tom Hanks to the sniper dude who took at the mg nest).Then this is the game for you.  Gameplay is FPS, but instead of objective based win conditions, most are point capture objectives (i.e you respawn multiple times in a round, until the timer runs out or all points are capture).Any WWII enthusiasiest would enjoy the variety of guns in the guns from both sides.  I have to say, that MG42 is my favorite, until the enemy throws some cooked grenades up my rear.			"

												There is still many players out there. A lot of ole timers and quite a few new players. Of course the game has died down some.... just a bit since it came out. You know times change and so does the playing fields. However, I still see quite a few players throughout the week that are committed to playing this classic ""Broken Valve Mod"", But we still love it. There are hundreds of maps that the community was able to build and supply players to keep the games alive. I still see maps I never heard of being played on servers. I mean honestly, I see more maps for these old games than any of the new ones I play..... Plus I do not have to buy the maps. You just go to a server and download the map, then play time, game on. User Contributed Files RULE!			"

												Day of defeat was orignaly a multiplayer mod for Half Life 1, the mod was based in europe in ww2. After 2 years of being in beat the mod moved to a standalone game, it was called Day Of Defeat 1.3 ((2003)).Day of Defeat is a multiplayer first-person shooter that simulates squad-level infantry combat between the adversaries of World War II's European Theatre; the Allies and the Axis Powers. Players can choose to join either the Allied or Axis armies, with the Allies including both America and Britain, of whom the player can choose one to represent.The multiplayer is very balanced and all the diffrent guns are balanced out to diffrent teams, there are over 15 maps to play on and then probally over 20000 thousand community based maps that are great.The gameplay is pretty easy to get used to, it will just take a bit to get used to the recoil of the guns .10/10 Great game, still very popular in 2015 .

												One of the very best shooters because no bells and whistles, just infantry - run and gun, but intelligently.   Pure skill using weapons and knowing maps wins.  Very high degree of control over player movement - seemless integration, feels like it is YOU playing, not some clumpsy computer image.   Been around a dozen years, hardcore player base, most of players currently (2013) playing are pretty good and experienced.  Still worthwhile to learn as a novice.  More mature player base generally than a lot of shooters.			"

												This game has no bells and whistles. It is all straight forward first-person shooter online action. Just player model and weapon - single shot rifles, semi-auto machine guns, sniper, machine gun, bazooka, and knife (or bayonet and trench shovel). What makes this game excellent? The player control of the models and guns is tight - extremely tight. It feels seamless between ones choice of movement and the actual gameplay. In this sense one feels in complete control, and thus the behaviour of your players feels like a true extention of oneself. The game lends itself well to teamplay with excellent voice over microphone. The sound in the game is very good, and listening is a critical part of playing well. The Day of Defeat community is extensive and skilled and has produced an enormous amount of modified material. There are tons and tons of player created custom maps which are equal in quality to the core of 20 stock maps which come with the game. Half-Life is the greatest shooter game ever. So is it any doubt that this ww2-based modification of Half-Life is the greatest WW2 shooter? It has been around for 13 years now, so the skill level of the player base is fairly high. However, DOD players are usually well-helpful to new players. If you like running and gunning in a WW2 environment, you gotta give this game a try. You can also play it off-line by installing free bots (Sturmbots) to learn with.			"

You can run around as a Nazi, and Beat people to death with a Spade. There's so much to do in this game, and Plus not to mention the Maps People Make. There's Gun Game, and Domination and Stuff. I definitely Recommend this for People with Low-End PCs. My Rating: 8.5/10			"

												I know I'm gonna get a lot of flak for this, but This game reminds me of the first 3 Call of Duty games.  Let me explain.Try to imagine CoD3 (or World at War, even), take out the pretentious campaign and simplify the gunplay, and you get a fun game.  Now imagine that same concept with an♥♥♥♥♥/span>load of fun maps (my favorite being dod_charlie), a thriving multiplayer community, and slap it all together in the GOLDSRC Engine, and you get Day of Defeat.Pros:The graphics are fairly realistic (as realistic as you can expect in a game from 2003)Each selectable ""class"" provides new ways to dominate your opponents, assuming you know how to use them.Realistic damage and recoil systems, because you'd probably need a chiropractor after firing a machine gun for more than 5 seconds without mounting it.Notably better than the Source remake.Cons:Fairly primitive compared to newer games in the genre.While people DO still play it, you'll be hard-pressed to find a full server.While the Stamina mechanic IS realistic, it gets annoying during the final few minutes of a match.Overall, Day of Defeat is a fun game to play when you've got nothing to do, or are looking to check out something new, or if you're trying to prove that classic FPS multiplayer games aren't dead yet.  I rate eight out of eight, mate.  This game is really great. "

												I absolutely love this game! I only bought it a few weeks ago but is has already become one of my favourite games of all time. It is so much fun and I'm still amazed that so many people play it still- every time I go on there is at least one server with 20 or so people on it. There are loads of things you can do on it that I wouldn't expect for a 2003 game- you can pick up weapons (G) and use mortars (E) and the class system is amazing, allowing you to instantly change class or teams at any time (, to change class; . to change team). It is just like an older version of Tactical Intervention- but much better!			"

												A World War II FPS, A Half-Life mod, the weapon mechanics flow at times better than FPS of todays games (Call of Duty and Battlefield). With zooming only when you have a weapon with a scope. Modellic graphics are expected. I would still play this today. There are several different servers still up as well as dedicated players. Hacking is pretty nonexistant, although its always best to be in the right servers (this happens to many games).			"

												Personally I think that DoD 1.3 is the best first person shooter created to date. Here are the reasons why.#1: The players head does not bounce up and down while they move so your vision stays level and still.#2: The game runs very smoothly because its old and doesn't require a high end system to kill quickly and accurately.#3: The developers allow a highly visible colored sprite for the crosshair so aiming is very easy.#4: You can easily customize your game server using AMX MODX with a ton of really cool plugins.#5:  Most of the other FPS games today are trying to make the game to real. I personally do not want to sit in a tank, or on a boat and use artillery, or call in air strikes or shoot people from a helicopter. I'm a soldier, a (Grunt) and I want to get down into the trenches and use good old fashioned rifles, SMG's, grenades and Melee weapons. keep it simple. Less will always be more in FPS games. :)			"

PROS:+ fun gameplay+ active community+ nice choice of weapons+ many modsCONS:- the community has a lot of toxic, rude and mean playersComment:Unlike many other old Valve multiplayer games this game has enough active players to have plenty of servers to join. The gameplay is fun, gun damage accurate and maps are cool. I got this game for free with Counter Strike 1.6 so that is always a plus. This game is set in the World War 2 setting and so the maps, teams and guns match this theme. Not really special but for sure cool multiplayer with a variety of WW2 weapons. Though I haven't played that much this seems like a cool old-school type of multiplayer game and I'd recommend it.			"

												For a $5, 2004 game, this has to be some of the most genuine fun I have ever had in a FPS. Once you have looked past the graphics you get a great game with so much structure. Choose either the Axis or the Allies and from there you have a wide range of classes for different weapon types. This game is so well structured because of its community. If someone sees someone in an assult class then they will go long ranged to co-operate with the assult class instead of your average, load-out based FPS where people choose weapons because they like them. I highly reccomended Day of Defeat for these reasons and if you are still tossing and turning, wait until it is on sale when it goes down to $2.50.			"

												Day of Defeat is a WW2 themed multiplayer team and class-based game of capturing and holding off points. Capturing points is not the only gamemode, but most played, if not only one, around. You could get betas of the game for free as mods for Half-Life 1, but the final versions were released as paid Retail product by Valve. And as you can see, it got on Steam too.First thing first, since it's a multiplayer title... How is community of this old game? It's doing well! It may not have overwhelming amount of players, but you will always find few almost-full servers. And while dod_avalanche map appears to be favourite among the community, you still will get to enjoy some maps variety on various servers. Not so much on game type variety though, capturing the flags points is most played.As said, Day of Defeat is a WW2 shooter. Team and class based. A mix between arcade and realism. Weapons are as deadly as in many such shooters, just having single person rush forward will do no good, should do that in team. Many weapons also have big recoil, which depends on your stance: moving, standing, crouching or prone. Being prone is the slowest and clunkiest, easy to hit from above, but harder from long distances, also giving character almost no recoil when shooting. Yes, camping is a viable strategy here, but I feel that I have more chance to break through camping than in, say, Counter-strike. Players can respawn any time, so putting yourself to risk isn't bad idea. Each character also have a stamina, which is used when you spring and jump, slowly recovering afterwards. The slowing effect after using it is quite punishing, so you should sprint from cover to cover. Don't use sprint when moving to the front from the spawn point.Maps are designed to be more of pipes, like classic maps, not open fields, providing a main path and few flanking routes. Even more curious, the maps are assymetrical, which may possibly provide some inbalance (I think that Nazis in Avalanche map have height advantage). Breaks the usual symmetry monotony though, more interesting. Some maps even feature British forces instead of American ones. (they have less classes though)No, this one doesn't have vehicles, it is not Battlefield after all. Each team has up to 10 classes. The only difference most have is primary weapon and whether they have or not grenades to spam at corners and choke points. None have ironsight, if you wonder, aside from scope for sniper rifles. And most of primary weapons tend to be quite similiar to each other, which I don't like, as I prefer classes to be more diverce... something what Day Of Defeat Source did. Classes can be divided into:1) Close Range Assault classes - have guns with light recoil, good for running and gunning, and then getting one-hit killed by another rushing rifleman.2) Assault Support classes - more recoil, medium range, they better occasionally crouch or stand to be able to litter enemies with bullets at close range.Close range and Support get mixed a bit together, making other classes.3) Riflemans - Killing mens with one bullet per few seconds, medium-long range class. Well, and short one too. Only bad when rushed by few mens. Just crouch occasionally4) Machine Gunners - limited, they can deploy their machine gun on sandbags or while prone. Their machine gun allows them to give your team control over area. Just watch out for snipers and grenade spam. No grenades.5) Snipers - not really much of different from Rifleman, just got scope and more accurate while scoped. No grenades though.6) Bazooka - You got rocket launcher. And if you imagine infantry going ""whee"" from rocket - too bad. It's a utility weapon, which only very few maps have use for, like blowing tank in some map (that I didn't get to play in public servers yet). Very annoying whenever Random keeps giving you this class.The graphics technically are quite outdated, but still provide it's own quirk. The music is almost non-existing. Only main theme and victory tunes are there.So, nice game, especially when measured with other HL1 mods. Still fun and still has active multiplayer. But the people who don't like hitscan weapons and who like to get right into action, it's not for them.			"

												Day of Defeat is the last skill-based FPS game made. Per-pixel accuracy, anticipation, map awareness, reflexes, it had it all without being a complete spas fest like Quake. The added ""realistic"" nuances of modern FPS such as larger maps, larger player matches, movement penalties, class/archetype dependencies have only taken away from the pure competitive FPS experience. Unfortunately, this style of FPS is an end of an era, encapsulated in its time. Games that try to fuse this with modern elements such as the latest Counter Strike releases feel dated. The last attempt to revive this title (Source) also tried fusing modern elements to gameplay but compromised what made DOD unique and great in the first place.			"

												Day of Defeat is a game where there are two teams : Axis's and Alies. The game is set in WWII and there are different classes you can choose from, ranging from rifleman to machine-gunners. The game is great, it has a great community, and the people playing always try to make your experience as best as possible. Pros :- Mostly everything.Cons : - Make sprint time last longer- Actually include less amunition for rifles, because it is a 1 hit kill semi - automatic weapon that can be too overpowered. The ammunition is too much.Overall, 8.5 / 10. Great game.			"

												During steam summer sale i got this game for  a dollor.This game features amazing weapones and gameplay.The community is very friendly and enjoyable to play with, i sometimes like to go away from the toxic csgo community to play this game!Good graphics for a game that old.This game has 2 sides which is the axis and allies and is set in the ww2 times featuring some amazing weapons and both sides have different weapons for you to use. ( what is also great about this is that it doesn't require you to rank up or unlock anything)Overall thoughts and ratings:Gameplay - 9-10 features fun maps and weapons to play withGraphics - 8-10 i like games that look very good and have hd quality but this game has good graphics for it's time and still i don't mind the quality. ( before buying the game i kept on thinking that i will hate this game due to lack of graphics/quality in the game but after playing it i'm more than okay with it)Weapons - Weapons are a big thing in this game and they made it very realistic due to the recoil of guns and the ammount of weapons for you to use from snipers to machine guns and the overpowered rifles What i also like about the game is that it features things such as laying down, spriting and crouching.Overall product rate 9.5/10			"

												Its old...the grafix are really showing there agebut the above means nothing when your totaly absorbed into its gameplay, its perfect... no other FPS has pulled off what DOD does.. its pacing is spot on!, its slower than the likes of cod/dod:s but believe me thats not a bad thing.. its a more realistic pace, but dont be thingking is slow.... because its not, without question my best firefights have been on dod... its hard to explain but the pacing has a lot to do with it... also most of its maps are well designed and make for som interesting battles....ive played dod since it was released years ago and its stll my fav fps.... not many games especialy fps'ers actually promote teamplay.. but this does..and finally the comunity is 2nd to none,, even now... just get it.... give it couple of hours and u will be hooked....

												I bought this game because I had a little bit of money which I didn't know what to spend it on, and I can say it was a great £3.49 I have spent. It is sort of like Red Orchestra 2, but less buggy. You can be in a great amount of teams, and there are lots of guns etc to choose from.Teams:BritainGermanyAmericaI only played a few games, but it was enjoyable. It certainly isn't the best game I have played, but it deffinetly isn't the worst either. I would recommend this game, it's worth the price and good to mess around in.			"

												Whether looking for an old game to play to remember the days before steam, or because nothing else will work on your computer, this is an ok buy, but only if on sale.The original Day of Defeat, graphics wise, looks like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Half life, CS 1.6 and TFC look far better than this, and they are much older. Trees, Barbed wire, and various vegetation textures are glitched, and will somtimes not be transparent as they should be. effects are also, unreasonably crappy, as grenades do not show an actual explosion, unlike most older HL games (keep in mind this game runs on another engine, though), and gun fire creates and unjustifiably large, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥light effect.Gameplay is not terrible, though certain effects form jumping, running, and going prone can be annoying. There are many diverse classes with unique weapons, and sometimes even map specific weapons and gamemodes. Most maps are conquest, while some are search and destroy. Unlike CS there is respawning, but on wave timers. Controls are ok on default, but I would recommend some custumization, as some keys, like flashlight, are stupidly placed (it's ""n""). Some maps are poorly lit, quite a few are unnecessarily large, and most are designed so that the battles of WW2 end up more like WW1. A bloody stalemate in the middle of the map that shifts forward occaisionally, only to be stopped by someone in a bottleneck with an MG.While there is still a community, there are alot of empty servers, so lukily there are mods for bots. While playing can be pretty frustrating at times, it's still a fun game to play, and is far better than it's source counterpart. Get it during a sale.			"

												Day of Defeat non-source better knowm as DOD is $5 but is it better than x2 the price DOD source.  Here are reasons to buy DOD non-source: You don't own or do own and just don't want the textures for gmod, you want an addictive game, you don't go crazy if graphics arent perfect.  Here is why you should buy DOD source: You own and do want the textures for gmod, you want a more serious experience, and you want better graphics.  All in all buy either one and you'll be happy but if you only got $5 but DOD non-source			"

												I really like this game, like really. First got into it when a PCGamer Magazine featured beta 1.3 in one of their CDRoms that came with the magazine, back in 2001 I think. Stopped playing for a while in the middle of the decade, picked it up again a few years ago, and have been playing pretty regularly.For new players, a little advice, please change your name before entering your first game. Communication is key, don't get sniped and neglect to tell your team where the sniper is.Do not sit in one spot for too long. Some of these guys have been playing since before you were born and can hit any spot on the map. Crouch and shoot unless you're caught unawares, then make yourself a moving target and aim for the head. Stay in cover, but if you kill someone move your position, good teams communicate. Don't take the mg to the top of the bank on Caen or to either sniper loft, you will die very fast. Learn to snipe on your feet, laying down and sniping is the worst. Try to vary your routine, if you choose the same route too often, experienced players will learn to anticipate you. When sniping an exit from the side, place your crosshair a few feet in front of the exit to give yourself enough space to shoot a streaking opposing player exiting. Throw your nades on the ground and pick them up, hold them for a sec and then throw them [holding time will vary]. If you use an automatic weapon, aim at center mass and quickly streak up to the head. When walking let your crosshairs naturally rest in a slightly elevated position, that way if you suddenly come upon an enemy, you will likely already be aiming at his head [beware, pros will crouch to avoid this very thing [ofc they'll also jump to avoid your shot, idk do your best]]. Fire in short bursts. Change your crosshairs to dynamic instead of static. Have fun. This game is great, there is a core community left that is mostly polite and old. But there is still some young blood, like me and others. Try out the Merrill's Marauder's 24/7 Caen and Avalanche servers. They are consistently full and well administrated. I'm usually on in the afternoon/night. GG.			"

												Not sure why I have not already written a review for this game. Better late than never, especially with Day of Defeat!This game is like wine! It's a bit old, it may even be a little ugly in some areas, but Day of Defeat is still one of the best online FPS games on Steam. Unlike other Gold Source games like CS 1.6 and Half-Life, DoD is a realistic and terrifyingly ambient take on the close quarters combat scenarios of the second World War. The game is dark and somewhat nerve-wracking; buildings are smothered to rubble, the cities are dark and shaded, and the sounds of the war are all around. The realism of the weaponry gives the player a greater sense of responsibility as each class has a specific role. Things such as muzzle flashes, footsteps, reloading, squad commands, and changing weapons makes a sound that must be considered when operating on the battlefield. Needless to say, Day of Defeat is a game everyone needs in their library! DoD is not so realistic as to have an almost ""cheesy"" outward appearance (like Red Orchestra), but it is not your average FPS online shooter - no ""jump shotting"", ""quick scoping"", ""'nade spamming"", etc. - Day of Defeat relies on the seriousness of the player, and the cohesiveness of the team. If you are used to playing Day of Defeat: Source, I would suggest buying DoD Original as there are a lot of things this game has that DoD:S does not: more weaponry, ambient maps, gameplay opportunities, and the ability to play as the Royal Army.

												Please ignore all the reviews saying 'this game is dead'. That is simply not true. DOD 1.3 has a thriving, though comparatively small, community as of 2015. You will always find populated servers and the clans/communities running those servers have been around for years. They know how to run them well. I have noticed that each server tends to have a busy time of day and everybody plays on everybody else's servers. Play this game for a few weeks and you will notice the same people popping up everywhere you play. That is a wonderful thing to say about a community, and this one is as friendly and welcoming to new players as you are likely to find. According to steam stats the game has ~200 players (30 day average). Source has around three to four times that number at time of writing. Whilst that doesn't sound like a lot it is definitely enough to sustain this game with many different servers utilising different setups and mods giving some nice variation in gameplay. There is even still competitive play and a league still in existence. The only thing you will not find is realism, the last unit having died a few years ago. In conclusion, this is a GREAT game which deserves to go on being played. Try it. It's cheap and can run on a calculator. You may play it for two minutes and think 'the nades are ridiculously overpowered'. That would be my one major criticism of this game. You may, however, love it.			"

												I don't know what to say about this game, so here is a recipe for pancakes, Ingredients:4tbsp plain flour (about 100g)1 large free range egg½ pint semi-skimmed milk + water (about 300ml - ¾ milk ¼ water)Pinch of saltButter for fryingHow to make pancakes:Sieve the flour and salt into a large bowl and make a well in the mixture.Break in the egg and stir to make a breadcrumby mix.In a jug add 1/3 of a pint of milk and top up with water to make 1/2 a pint (200ml milk, 100ml water) - this makes a lovely light batter.Add the milk and the water mix bit by bit, beating constantly to avoid lumps.Tip:*If you have a food processor just throw all the ingredients in and zap until smooth!Pop a large frying pan over a medium heat.Add a large knob of butter (roughly 50g) and melt.Pour the excess butter into a small bowl and reserve it for later.Using a ladle pour a spoonful of the pancake batter into the hot pan and swirl to get a full covering - cook for about 1 min each side (it's ready when it's easy to flip over).Serve immediately with sugar and lemon or other exciting toppings. We love cheese and Marmite for an extra British twist! Delicious!! "

												Please ignore all the reviews saying 'this game is dead'. That is simply not true. DOD 1.3 has a thriving, though comparatively small, community as of 2015. You will always find populated servers and the clans/communities running those servers have been around for years. They know how to run them well. I have noticed that each server tends to have a busy time of day and everybody plays on everybody else's servers. Play this game for a few weeks and you will notice the same people popping up everywhere you play. That is a wonderful thing to say about a community, and this one is as friendly and welcoming to new players as you are likely to find. According to steam stats the game has ~200 players (30 day average). Source has around three to four times that number at time of writing. Whilst that doesn't sound like a lot it is definitely enough to sustain this game with many different servers utilising different setups and mods giving some nice variation in gameplay. There is even still competitive play and a league still in existence. The only thing you will not find is realism, the last unit having died a few years ago. In conclusion, this is a GREAT game which deserves to go on being played. Try it. It's cheap and can run on a calculator. You may play it for two minutes and think 'the nades are ridiculously overpowered'. That would be my one major criticism of this game. You may, however, love it.			"

												too be honest, before i bought the Counter-Strike anthology pack, I've never even heard of this gem of a game. The wole game is exhillerating.The bullet impacts sound so real, that you heart begins to race with both exhilleration of excitement and fear of not knowing where the shots are coming from.Then there's the pleasure of killing 5 dudes who are aware of you all by yourself.Not to mention, all of the custom maps. I got to experience a WWII game in Aztec from Counter-Strike! Also, if you wanna know on how to be a killing machine in this game, you gotta figure out on how certain weapons work. Tip: If you wanna play with a machine gun, then crouch, or fire in single round bursts.10/10			"

												Day of Defeat is great fun, it's a underated gem with not a huge community left but there are some servers that have quiet a bit of people on daily. It doesn't run on valves current source engine but instead valves previous engine goldsrc witch is a modified version of the quake engine. But if you would like this game with the source engine I suggest getting day of defeat source but that one has less people on. (Just sayin') You can play as the Germany, Allies and British. You use all the weapons from World War 2. This game is a lot more fun with friends. (Just sayin again) All and all my own personal would be 8.5/10			"

												Highly Recommend this game (BETTER THAN SOURCE!!!)Great FPS with a small but dedicated community that is for grown up players (since most of the players that still log on nightly have been playing since the presteam days). One of the best WW2 games out there. **WARNING** CS:GO and COD 12yr old style xbox rants will most likely get you used/abused/banned from most servers.			"

												Yes. If you're considering buying DoD:Source over this one; Don't.I've played DoD since it's early mod days, this is it's superior form.Forget the graphics, forget a lot of fancy new features. This game's simply the better choice.As far as a Multiplayer game goes if you've never played, it's good if you have some friends who also are interested in psuedo-realistic fast paced respawn fps, especially set durring WW2. Two teams fight over control points to win each round. Both teams have a variety of weapons with different pro's/con's to choose from, stats are visable for weapons. There are NO VEHICLES, There are lots of WW2 military vehicles props that populate the map to be used as cover, for HL1 mods that was sort of rare. It is pretty easy to die, respawning isn't random, set locations. Team work and expenditur of ammo is promoted with the general gameplay / map flow and most base classes (Rifleman spawn with 11 clips or so, to promote suppressive fire). Team work in this game generally means; just sticking together, noticing what type of firepower and directions your team mates generally check or cover / filling in those gaps, if theres no support/machine gunners on your team, taking that class and trying to fill the roll to the best of your general knowledge.The Con's;-Not a lot of populated servers these days, this version does support many different bot scripts though (cant say if Source does or not).-Does get tiring after awhile, it's repititve but simple.-If you use a CRT monitor (LoL I'm so sorry for you) then stop right now, this game is probably too dark on your monitor to play. Since most people don't have CRT monitors any more, you can probably look past this issue, newer LCD's or brighter LCD's have no worry.-Doesn't really play as a 'lone wolf' kind of game, more team work or support of one another in some caring way is needed to progress and not end up sucking all the time. -Maps are almost all urban or city, some openess to them but going back to an older FPS, they don't really feel that 'expansive' of distances, one issue the source port fixed directly I feel.

												Day of Defeat is a really nice but outdated WWII graphics game based on multiplayer and teamwork. You have to help your teammates find the enemy depending on location and how to complete your objectives. Yeah the graphics on this game are a little outdated but nevertheless, I was entertained and had a great time playing this game. On this game you either play as the Allies or the Axis team then depending on the type of gamemode that the server chooses (So far I've only played Team Deathmatch and Capture The Flag). You fight each other till the bitter end of the time limit or game limit. All in all, this game is pretty fun to play if you're not easily bothered by the outdated graphics. So to wrap this review all up, I only recommend this game if you're into WWII FPS games and if you're not highly bothered by outdated graphics. :)			"

												I don't know what the developers were thinking with this game but it's so historically inaccurate that the entire experience is ruined. Here are just a FEW of the many massive flaws:- The MG-34s barrel overheats far too quickly. German Maschinengewehr 34s could fire on average 25 seconds before the barrel would warp, and of course no gun could fire that long without a clip much large than the meager drum barrel depicted in this game.- The Garand could easily be reloaded by soldiers before being emptied, simply by manually ejecting the clip or even inserting single rounds into the partially filled clip, although this risked jamming the weapon and was not commonly done (although of course it should be an option).- Important objectives were never marked with flags that changed to represent which side controlled the objective.- Soldiers in World War II did not respawn.- The Germans did not always speak German. Often they communicated through barks and whistles.			"

												Day of Defeat was so out-dated by the time I first tried it, that it felt like sitting down infront a playstation one right after turning off my playstation 3. Day of defeat is however a very praised game, and I can see why. I won't bother rating this classic. I doubt anyone is ever going to look for this game on steam without fully being aware what this is, and no one is going to read reviews for it ever. Why am I writing this?			"

												Another fun FPS game that takes place during WWII. You get to play as either Allied or Axis, and you have to capture all the areas of a point in order to win a round, similar to a type of gameplay found in Team Fortress 2.Pros:Ability to play both sidesGreat graphics, love the scenery in some levels, like the train station levelTeams are balancedCombat is goodGameplay is addictingCons:The aiming for machine guns are kinda awkward as the gun moves upward when you fire, and you have to quickly reorient yourself and/or you could get killed while doing so.The game is really hard when you first play it, but it becomes really fun and enjoyable once you get used to it and keep playing it; I guarantee ones who start to play it will want to keep playing.I recommend this great game :D "

												Day of Defeat(or DoD) is a very fun and enjoyab  FPS. The graphics are excelent for the time, which might turn some people off due to it being outdated. Its not very in depth, only having about one gamemde, but it does have aspects that are very enjoyable, such as the multiple classes for each team.They all are basically the same weapons from different sides. But the best part of that is that both teams play very differently. The sad part is that there is basically only one english server, the Neo God server. Its always full of people. There are about 3 or 4 japanese servers and one spanish server. I really wish more people would play this game, Its great, and definatly worth your time. This game, gets an  8/10			"

												Day of Defeat was my ultimate competitive multiplayer experience in my early teens. It's a class-based WWII shooter where different classes have different weapon loadouts. Unlike modern FPS games, guns have a kickback YOU have to actively compensate for, and grenades (your own and your enemy's) can be picked up and thrown after the pin has been pulled, making grenades much more versitile and strategic, something that even Day of Defeat: Source lost by replacing traditional grenades with grenade launchers. You can also legitimately focus on stealth and melee.			"

												Think about it this way:  At the time of writing this review, i have 34 hours in the game.  At least 32 of those hours have some from the same server which runs the same map 24/7. that means there is bound to be plenty more playtime within the 30 servers that are running.If 34 hours of good content isn't worth $5, you probably aren't very smart.

												Very good game. Everyone can have the same weapons ALWAYS, and even, you can take your ennemies weapon! That means you can find a german with a Thompson. I recommend it a lot, just the graphics are not the best, but still, the game is pretty good. Also, if you are looking for the same game mechanic but with better graphics, Day of Defeat (DoD) Source is the right one, not this one. But I still love it and play it, less than before, but still love it.			"

It beats most all games in this category, CS:GO is a peice of crap compared to this, CS:GO doesn't even have prone for goodness sake! There are classes you get to choose, and tons of them, so you don't have to worry about the class selection being crap, and the classes (similar to TF2) have specific jobs that they are great for. 10/10 would recommend, need a copy, talk to my friend Ice Kuld!

												One of the first games to feature features that have killed the FPS industry.Its not that interesting really or fun. I never played it much and never over playing CS. It was always an inferior game both in terms of mod support and map support but also actual gameplay aswell. You just die to fast to twitch shooting reflexes. The Source remake is somewhat better but its still nothing anyone has ever really cared about aside from the communities who circle around said games.It was a mod that got picked up and sold by Valve, it holds all the jankiness of community mods and offers little. The real gameplay diffrence between this and TFC arn't that big. Both games are games you pretty much die in a hurry and have really annoying metagame.  Nostalgia aside, as I have none anyway, I think it sucks. I occasionally try it now and then but in the face of COD 1 to 3 this game was just not good or worth playing. It adds nothing to the table and has nothing interesting to say about it. Its just another shooter you shouldn't waste money on.			"

												One of the first games to feature features that have killed the FPS industry.Its not that interesting really or fun. I never played it much and never over playing CS. It was always an inferior game both in terms of mod support and map support but also actual gameplay aswell. You just die to fast to twitch shooting reflexes. The Source remake is somewhat better but its still nothing anyone has ever really cared about aside from the communities who circle around said games.It was a mod that got picked up and sold by Valve, it holds all the jankiness of community mods and offers little. The real gameplay diffrence between this and TFC arn't that big. Both games are games you pretty much die in a hurry and have really annoying metagame. Nostalgia aside, as I have none anyway, I think it sucks. I occasionally try it now and then but in the face of COD 1 to 3 this game was just not good or worth playing. It adds nothing to the table and has nothing interesting to say about it. Its just another shooter you shouldn't waste money on.			"

												This game is a first person shooter, like all other Valve titles. You can tell it's dated by how it plays, and the mouse moves a bit weirdly, but it's no big deal.Day of Defeat is one of those games where you play it for a very long time the first time, and then leave it forever. It becomes very repetitive. The choice of weapons is short, and the maps on most servers are few and far between. The gameplay is a bit awkward, where everything feels clunky, and dodging flying grenades is difficult.One thing I will mention is the Community. Man, if there were no community, there would be no game. Peopel are always communicating. About their personal lives, about the game, about strategy, about what to do next and how to work together. The community is truly one of the game's strongest points, and it made me enjoy the heck out of talking with people.The soundtrack is another big point. I really enjoyed listening to the victory themes for both sides, as well as the front page. It has this interesting antique WW2 feeling to it, and I really liked it.All in all, I do not recommend this game. Just get Day of Defeat: Source if you were really thinking of buying a Day of Defeat title. It has more people and servers on it anyways.			"

												It bacicly has the same mechanics of CS and COD.Every gun is killing u instantly(besides a rifle that need 5 hits to kill and smgs and assault rifles),like COD,to be more accurate u need to strand still or crouch or go prone,like CS,LMGs are OP as ♥♥♥♥,and to make it worse,going prone and deploying the bipod will make it have no recoil and be accurate as ♥♥♥♥.The only weapons people will use is the rifleman,the sniper,and gunner (LMG).Rocket launcher is really hard to use,that is the only main weap u have,other than the pistol and melee weapon,u need to ""ready"" ur launcher to fire,which would make u really slow and move ur aim super slow.And most if the time,u wont even hit enemys,becuase they are so fast,and with combination with slow aim,u miss all the time,the only thing u can use it for is for killing snipers,which is still hard,because they just shoot people with the sniper rifle anywhere and ur dead.The COD one was better,and i dont even like COD,i used to play it but then i quit but anyway,the reason it was better is that not all rocket launchers had to aim to shoot,just shoot.Another thing is that you cant get health unless you are on a server that allows you to say in the chat /medic and get healed slowly.They also dont have offical servers,it is annoying if u want to play a normal game and then you end up playing some game mode with lots of add ons that i dont want.I mean,really?Valve cant make a offical server?Even people who dont know how to program can make servers.You also cant say in the server search of where you are in the region,meaning you can potentioly join a server in Russsia (And i dont have anything againts Russians,but i know lots of people dont like them)and lag as ♥♥♥♥.Another bad thing is that you cant have a ""quick swich"",so if you scroll ur mouse up,it stays on that icon untill you select it.Yea,sure this is an old game,but so many things can still be fixed at that time.

												Day Of Defeat is another of the free modifications for Half-Life that, with the help of Valve, got turned into a full fledged retail release. Often overshadowed by it's significantly more popular older brother, Counter-Strike, Day Of Defeat is a relatively unknown to many and while it doesn't quite live up to the standards set by similar retail games it does provide a decent World War II experience.Day Of Defeat pits the German Army against either the British or American forces, which one is chosen depends on the map being played, in relatively small surroundings. Although it is not a game that aims for any sort of uber realism it does feature a number of mechanics to encourage slower and more realistic behavior such as a stamina bar and significantly decreased accuracy when moving. Respawning into the battle happens in waves which keeps the action going and prevents too much downtime but unfortunately also encourages less entertaining behavior such as spawn camping.The class based system is fairly limited and only changes the weapons you use which creates a rather bland experience.Graphically it is clear that the old Half-Life engine has run it's course, Day Of Defeat is by no means a good looking game and the lack of detail can get distracting at times especially when considering that it's main rival is the stellar looking Battlefield 1942.All in all Day Of Defeat is a mod success. The people that played it before it turned retail are the people that's going to play it afterwards, it's not a game that's looking to pick up any new fans in the transition. Perhaps it is easier to understand if you view this, not as a game going from mod to retail. But as a team of developers going from amateurs to professionals. It is an astonishing accomplishment and I wish them all the best in their future endeavors, I am just not really sure I want to pay for their advancement.			"

												Day of Defeat is a mod that was released during Gulf War.  It was good for time but no more since release of Day of Defeat Sauce.  Ever since I never need Heinz.Only interesting if you want to see standard maps before edits.  Otherwise just play Day of Defeat Sauce.All that is missing from new Day of Defeat Sauce is you can kill British as well as GI Joes and Germanians.  To make it more realistic maybe US could call air strike in on British then say ""Oops sorry I thought you was Baghdad"".  Some servers start with French but as soon as you cap white flags they never take them back.			"

												Day of Defeat is the first game in the Day of Defeat series. It started out as a mod back in the day and then later became know as a ""full retail product."" At first glance, this game looks like a cash-in to get in on the WWII FPS craze during the early 2000's. You would be pretty much correct. This game looks like garbage, runs like garbage, doesn't have enough servers/players, has like one gamemode (which sucks, by the way), and is really hard to get into because of the 1-hit kills from like every weapon. You would be better off getting the free Battlefield 1942. I can't recommend this to anybody.			"

												This is a boring class based WWII game. It has standard graphic and generic gameplay that is far from special. The game has no real redeeming features unless you really love multiplayer only WWII games with a passion.The game has some amount of fun in there to be totally honest but not enough to make it worth playing.4/15 - ""Like World at War but rubbish""			"

												Hello Fellow Soldiers,Welcome to Day of Defeat. There's no real reason to purchase this game since the release of Day of Defeat: Source. This game is just outdated, although, I will say that it's fun to play the first version of the future great game. I can't in good knowledge recommend this game for the game that you should purchase because of the newer version. The two games are practically identical apart from some mechanics and graphics. I strongly recommend Day of Defeat: Source and between the two, don't buy this one. I'm not trashing on this one, but I can't recommend an outdated game where there is a new version that is pretty much the same concept.-Kyle James			"

												This mod, (Day of Defeat 1.0) as made by the Old HL1 Devs, surpasses any mod i've ever played in Finnesse, Detail, and Fine work. When you play Day of Defeat 1.0, you will feel the Fog of World War II, AND the spirit of the soldiers, never in my time has a mod been crafted this fine, and yes I have sound judgement because I've been around mods since they began, even made a couple myself. This game (HL1 Mod) SCREAMS the Fog of War in WWII. Do not underestimate this gem!! GET IT!!!I Play it for Singleplayer, you must download sturmbot 1.711 To play SP,http://www.dodbits.com/dods/index.php/half-life-1-games/60-sturmbot-versions-and-downloadsMakes the game kick♥♥♥♥♥for fun SP Skirmishes, Excellent realism and effects for the Half Life 1 Engine, Possibly best game on HL1.

												Easily the best Day of Defeat title, where it lacked on graphics it made up for in spades on gameplay mechanics.I really miss this game, before this version of steam I logged too many hours into this.DoD: Source is a nice graphical update but it holds none of the charms of the original.What started as a beloved mod turned into one of the best action WW2 FPS games.Perhaps if it hadn't been borne in a time where the market was saturated with WW2 titles maybe it would never have been so huge a hit. The international competitive crowd really loved this game, we loved it here in Australia just as much.Day of Defeat still holds  special place in my heart and always will. Now it's the hick cousin to CS and is treated as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child by Valve.I dislike how Valve allowed this game to wither on the vine. It was great and DoD Source is not good enough as it is. God knows how much I miss this game.			"

												Before Steam, I had at least 2500-3000 hours of Day of Defeat. It's a much better shooter than most modern games where both sides get identical guns and overpowered bonuses. Get shot with the German K98? You are dead. Sniped? Dead. Although there are far fewer servers now, it's still worth palying.			"

												Greatest WW2 shooter I've ever played whose sequal (DOD:S) was completely ruined by its own creators and forever split the community.I'd love to see another DOD come out, like what Valve did for CS in CS:GO, where the game is more like 1.3 than Source. The half-baked and terribly implemented iron-sights and the huge cone of fires in DoD:S took a very skillful, fun, very balanced shooter into a goofy arcade romp of dice rolling.			"

												Day of Defeat is an extremely fun and addicting multiplayer shooter. Many people may tell you that the game sucks, but that's probably because they're addicted to spray-and-pray games like Call of Duty. In Day of Defeat, it requires more strategy, and is by far more realistic. Anybody who enjoys studying WWII and playing games will find this a nice treat. Play and would recommend everyone to try who have not yet felt on his entire ""beauty"" of this game!			"

												Better than its Source version in some aspects, but not really any worse in others. A solid WW2 shooter that came out during a golden age of innovation in the industry. Definitely worth a buy if you like messing around with older shooters. If you don't, and are just looking for games with a particular style of gameplay, there's a lot of spiritual successors to this title that you'll likely enjoy far more - Day of Infamy and Days of War being the most notable examples.

												-These are my opinions your expirience may vary-oh Day of Defeat, much like Counter-Strike it was a mod made for Half-Life and Valve showed interest by hiring the team and went on to make Day of Defeat: source wich I will review once I get my hands on it. (now to the review.)=Graphics=Nothing great it looks old but still manages to hold up by my standards. that's about it.=Gameplay=The gameplays has two teams (Axis vs. American or British allies) fighting over points on the map and once all points have been captured that's when the round ends. When you die you have to wait for a rienforcement wave comes wich is usually a few seconds but the rienforcement wave timer can be adjusted. there are a few rifle, assault rifle, sub machine gun, and LMG classes to pick from wich all control different (i.e The LMGs have INSANE recoil so use that bipod.). It takes a hit or two to take someone out so you really need to work together and your stamina bar is used for sprinting, jumping, and withstanding LMG kick, it runs out pretty quikly so keep your eye on it.=My Verdict=I have yet to find a WWII shooter better than this, it feels so rewarding to kill other players and capping points and it should run fine on your PC seeing how it's kinda old but still very addicting. I give it a 9/10			"

You can play for fun and not get mad at anyone. But if you are weighing in on DOD or its Source engine remake. Get this if you want a friendly yet small community and overall better gameplay. Get source if you want a larger community fast pace gameplay. Finding a server is hard in DOD 1.5.Now, Gameplay. It's very fun and worth a little more than 4.99. Its  very different from TFC.Overall, buy it			"

												This is simply the best WWII FPS I have every played, which is a shame because it appears dead now. For me, it struck the perfect balance between realism and gameplay, which meant that it never felt like an arcade game, nor did the controls feel overly-complex to the point where it was a second enemy like many other ""realistic"" FPS games have.Unfortunately the source version was a total abomination and never came close to recapturing the greatness of this one. I really hope we get a new version of this in the future that stays true to the original, because we really, really need one.			"

												Better than its Source version in some aspects, but not really any worse in others. A solid WW2 shooter that came out during a golden age of innovation in the industry. Definitely worth a buy if you like messing around with older shooters. If you don't, and are just looking for games with a particular style of gameplay, there's a lot of spiritual successors to this title that you'll likely enjoy far more - Day of Infamy and Days of War being the most notable examples.

												Highly dated by todays standards, however there have been next to no WWII shooters that have matched the class based, asymmetric warfare DoD offered.  Machine gunners, snipers, riflemen, and assault troops had to work in unison cover each others' deficiencies in order to advance.  Unfortunately, like with many sucessful mod titles of the era, a lot of their magic when their distinct game mechanics polished through trial and error of the community, were scrapped and altered in exchange to appeal to the mass consumer.  8/10			"

But  it still is pretty cool. EDIT ♥♥♥♥ERS: also I rate 10/10 m8 you totally wont get kicked for ""having a ping over 200"" and ""yeah you know what ping is looser"" then getting repeatdly told to ""fix your ping"" when no one instructs you how to do that. Then you get banned from the only TWO SERVERS THAT HAVE PLAYERS AND ISNT JAPANESE. GG ♥♥♥♥ER, GG, ALSO, THX FOR THE TEAMKILLING, xXx_DankDarkAngel1337_xXx!

												My honest opinion of dod so this game is a odd one lets get the bad stuff out of the way first of all this has only one mode ONE MODE another bad thing is they dont have any custominzation for your classes so want a scope or a camo on your gun nope nada none i know the game is old but they should have at least put something. The good stuff the sniping is the best i have ever played and has a nice smooth feel. Second the maps are fun and its addictive. One good thing I have played the game for 11 hours have not encountered a single hacker. One bad thing tho is that the servers usually have high ping which ruins some maps and the maps are built around sniping which is what i like most score 6 out of 10			"

You can play for fun and not get mad at anyone. But if you are weighing in on DOD or its Source engine remake. Get this if you want a friendly yet small community and overall better gameplay. Get source if you want a larger community fast pace gameplay. Finding a server is hard in DOD 1.5.Now, Gameplay. It's very fun and worth a little more than 4.99. Its  very different from TFC.Overall, buy it			"

												Very fun game (so far). I was playing with Hitler, and he kept screaming, ""Ich möchte wie die Deutschen zu spielen, aber ich kann nicht. Die noobs füllen Sie alle Flecken!"" Because of this, we had to go on a new server in order to play as the Third Reich. Although, he continued to die and blamed it on lag. The bunker was not fun that day. Besides that though, I really enjoy the game and encourage people to try it out.			"

												I have played this game, since it came out. Of course there have been years in between when i did not. But I think its better than Source because it is slower. And has more maps, with different types of objectives. More classes. And the gameplay is a lot more comfortable. Source is version is just fun, but feels just wrong. I think i´ve played it so much that I base my assumptions on all later FPS games on this. 10/10!!!			"

												I love the bot servers!They usually go like this:Spawn and follow the others to where the action is, listening to the banter between regulars and clanmates.Get to the fight and witness a dozen grenades exploding at the same time as the others try to suppress the bots from flooding into the alleyway or courtyard.Watch in horror as a glut of bots spill into the area you and the others are.Spray the group with whatever gun you are holding.Still get gunned down by one of the deadeye bots.Repeat until victory.I love this game.

Whether you're playing on the official maps or community maps, online or offline with Sturmbot, you'll always get a fantastic action packed experience.11/10 better than Dota 2 by a longshot.			"

												Fourteen years later, this game still holds up as a great marriage of arcade action and realism, much like what makes CS 1.6 legendary and still one of Steam's top played games today. Very teamwork oriented, where barely anyone pays attention to KD ratio but rather to capturing the next objective. WW2 is a great theme as always, great selection of weapons, and graphics are decent enough (though a little dull) considering its age.The only flaw is that the game is mostly dead. There's 2-3 active servers, and everything else is either bot servers or being hosted on another continent. The community is small, but friendly. Despite this, I just started playing in January 2017 and am still having a blast.			"
