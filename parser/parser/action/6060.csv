												Star Wars Battlefront II is one of my favorite shooters I have played in my life. It trumps Call of Duty, and even Battlefield, in my opinion. It will evoke the classic feeling of Star Wars inside of you, whether you're a new fan or an old one. The game is hilariously unbalanced and the AI is very broken at times, but the childlike wonder of being a jedi or being a stormtrooper almost always shields that from my sight. The space dogfights are awesome once you get the hang of them as well, and it's also very fun to infiltrate enemy ships and blow them up from the inside.All in all, if I had to give it a rating I'd give this game a 9/10. It's definitely worth it's small pricetag.TO ANYONE WHO CAN NOT CONTACT KEY SERVER - I suggest opening a Steam support ticket. They should be able to help.			"

												I know you're reading this, EA and DICE. See this lovely game called Star Wars:Battlefront II? This should be an example of what you ought to do in Battlefront 2015. This doubled the content of Battlefront 1 and improved everything. THAT is what you must do. Give us more so we don't have to play Battlefront II again. Take all maps from this and Frostbite them. If you have to delay it to do it, fine. If we have to wait for more years, fine. And look EA, if you ever decide to pull half the maps and modes from the game and sell it to us as DLC, if you push the game to release too early and the game is a glitchfest, if you remove bots, then I'll just stick to the good ol' Battlefront II; we have graphic mods for it. And it still has online because of GameRanger.EDIT: Yes guys, you CAN still play online. Download GameRanger (I already said it). BTW, I didn't know how much attention this review is getting. Thanks?			"

  “When 900 years old, you reach… Look as good, you will not.” -Master YodaStar Wars Battlefront II, beginning as a mod for the acclaimed Battlefield series and later attaining its own featured release, has been, is, and always will be one of my favorite games. While writing this review, I was at a loss for words in regards to the overabundance of joy that this game has brought me through the years, and I can proudly say that I own every variance of this game, including the PC, Playstation 2, and Xbox versions. Overall, I have spent more time playing this game than any other game in my library, which includes a massive set of classics such as the Jak & Daxter series, 007 Goldeneye, the Sonic the Hedgehog collection, and even the Pokemon franchise, which I have solely worked over hundreds of hours of play! I apologize that this review may not be as professional, and will be more of a fan’s remembrance to this awesome game. Before I begin, I would like to give a special thanks to some good friends-one being Lime Dorito-that put up with pre-reading this review, as well as my brother, Matthew, for playing countless hours of this game with me on the other ports.Here are some things that I love about Star Wars Battlefront II:Gameplay - Star Wars Battlefront II is a war game, plain and simple. There are about six classes to choose from in each of the respective four armies, and playable Heroes such as Luke Skywalker and Boba Fett are available. This title also allows players to engage in vehicular combat, even hosting maps for dogfights in space against two rivalling fleets. Described earlier, there are several game modes similar to that of the Battlefield games, though Battlefront II has a unique game mode known as Assault, where Heroes from both the Good and Evil spectrums of the Star Wars films battle against each other. Overall, the game balances very well between aerial and ground combat, and evolves into a truly unique experience over multiplayer; unfortunately, the company that originally hosted the dedicated servers for Battlefront II, GameSpy is no longer operational, so other means of multiplayer are required on the PC port.Game Modes - In Campaign Mode, you mirror the Star Wars trilogy while playing as this group of soldiers as they influence the structure of the story that fans of only the movies know and love; this concept is similar to Star Wars Dark Forces in which the character Kyle Katarn is the one who was said to steal the Death Star plans for the Rebellion. Unlike the other Star Wars games such as Bounty Hunter and Dark Forces, Battlefront II maintains a focus on a specific group of Stormtroopers-rather than a single individual-infamously known by fans of the extended universe as the 501st, or Vader’s Fist. The Campaign introduces gameplay unique to the rest of the game in that it is objective-based, contrary to the usual skirmishes. For example, instead of a player dropping into a battlefield without an pretense as to what to do and why they’re fighting, the player is briefed on the purpose of the mission beforehand to perform a specific task such as protecting a Command Post for a given amount of time, or to locate a driver for a downed AT-AT that requires services.  ///  Galactic Conquest Mode is a change of pace, as players strategically maneuver battleships across a large map in an attempt to overtake all territories. This game mode features out-of-battle unit purchasing as well as upgrades that allow the player to determine how they want to progress in an all-out war  against a rivaling army; the opposing force depends on which era of the Star Wars universe you are in, and pits either the CIS against Clone Troopers or the Empire versus the Rebellion.  ///  Don’t want to worry about progressing through the story in Campaign Mode or strategically planning your way through Galactic Conquest? Give Instant Action Mode a go! Skirmish is exactly what it sounds like: you pick the game mode you want to play-between Conquest, Hunt, 1- and 2-Flag CTF, Space Assault, Assault, and Space 1-Flag CTF-and go from there. There are various settings for each, as well as playable Jedi/Heroes.Class System - Like Battlefield, this title has multiple unique classes that operate differently. Every class has their own unique appearance, primary and secondary weapons, statistics, and secondary equipment. For example, the Engineer class is much quicker due to his primary weapon being a shotgun. This class has a low rate of fire and a quick land speed, and is meant to splice into or repair vehicles with their Fusioncutters; it is played like a support class in most instances, but can easily clear singular enemies without a problem. The Engineer is also equipped with Detpacks-which are detonated remotely-and health and ammo dispensers.TL:DR - I had planned to write about weapon similarities between this game and the movies, as well as other topics, but if I had to talk about everything that is good about this game I would be typing for days. As you can tell from the above quote and through each of the screenshots, the Battlefront series does not look as polished in comparison to modern titles. However, this is just one of those games that stands the test of time with its amazing feel and fanatical impression. If you are a Star Wars fan, this title should not be passed up; if you are a Star Wars Battlefront fan, this installment to the series will not be forgotten.

												Re-releasing due to reviews not showing on page.Nonserious: Fell off the map as Grievous, he replied ""This battle bores me!""10/10Serious review being worked on!This absolutely a fantastic game. A great addition to the Star Wars franchise. Being more based off of Episode III, it adds Order 66, the Grievous era??, and it adds heroes to the scene.Star Wars is a really good franchise, and games like these are the kind it deserves.I was looking forward to 1313, but now? I want the sequel to this the most. Sadly, as I've heard that EA making it... It's doomed.Pros:+ A good storyline, sadly doesn't even finish the Emperor Strikes Back.+ Great music, but it's Star Wars music, so that was kinda obvious!+ Modding! You can mod the game! New maps, new classes, new weapons, NEW GRAPHICS. It still looks better than Watch_Dogs though. But what do I know, I'm jumping on the bandwagon.+ Storyline focuses on the clones, which is something we don't get much.+ The introduction of Hero characters, such as Jango Fett, Obi-Wan Kenboi, and my favorite, General Grievous! (Fear him you Jedi scum!)+SPACE BATTLES Cons:- As I said in the pros, the storyline doesn't go past the Battle of Hoth. That's dissapointing.- No more multiplayer other than Gameranger...So how about my final verdict?I really enjoy this game. It has a great campaign, great multiplayer, etc, etc. It's moddable too! Graphics outdated? Get a mod.I'm not good at explaining why I love it, but it gets a 9/10 from me.			"

Yes | NoSpace Battles? Yes | NoGalactic Conquest? Yes | NoInstant Action? Yes | NoModdable? Yes | NoVehicles? 37 | 11Maps? 33 on 16 planets | 8 on 4 planetsInfrantry Types? 51 | Customizable Loadouts# of Players? 64 on all modes | Up to 40 on certain modesPlayable Eras? Original and Prequels | OriginalPrice?

												It is easy to rip on the Star Wars prequels. You can picket and cry foul that Lucas betrayed your childhood and that he turned a once revolutionary film series into a sameless Disney style toy template (Oh the irony). However, you should consider all the good it has brought as well. Cool music from John Williams, double lightsabers, awesome new spacecraft and Video Games.Amongst the heaps of shovelware Lucasarts published during the prequel frenzy there were a bunch of amazing gems. Like Episode One Racer, Knights of the Old Republic, Battle for Naboo, Galactic Battlegrounds and eventually: Battlefront. Based off the Battlefield: 1942 concept, Battlefront allowed players to experience the battles of both the prequels and originals from the perspective of the ordinary stormtrooper or battledroid. It was amazing, but was not enough.Enter Battlefront 2, the bigger, better and more amazing version of an already amazing game. Fear the day when stormtroopers suddenly learn how to shoot, because that is when you're really playing this game. In general, the game is split in two different modes: Single and Mulitplayer. In singleplayer you play the tour of duty of the 501st Legion of the clone army, who after defeating the seperatist droid army become the elite troopers under the command of Darth Vader. The whole campaign is a short sequence with random objectives, but the whole is narrated by Temuera Morrison, the actor for Jango Fett and every Clone trooper ever. It adds some legitimacy to the whole romp. The other major single player mode is Galactic Conquest. It is a large scale turn based tactics game where you try to manouver your fleet with troops around the galaxy and subjugate (or liberate, if you're into that sort of thing; you tree sniffing hippie). You can employ bonusses, granted to you by owning certain planets.On the other hand of the spectum is multiplayer; and this is the reason why we're here. Allowing 64 peeps to take to the field at the same time...that's real warfare. This game was at the frontline of modern FPS development. You'll see many mainstays of modern shooters make their debut here, such as endurance rewards, killstreak rewards and other unlockable perks. Most destructive of the lot are the Jedi units. The ultimate streak reward gives you access one of the saga's heroes and elevates your lowly soldier rank to harbinger of death with a lightsaber. The sheer terror, characters like Darth Maul and Mace Windu inspire is amazing as they cut through swathes of troops. The real selling point though are the maps. The maps are open and wide to accomodate the massive amount of players. However, each map has a lot of secret passages and corridors that allow for exploration and experimentation. On top of that, the level of detail is amazing. Intricate care was taken to make all the maps look like they came right off the movie screen. You can run around the death star, from the hangar with the falcon, into the prison block, jump into the grabage shute, fight through the barracs, blow up the main laser, pace past the tractor beam generator, kick over the conference table where Vader expressed his opinion about a lack of faith and finally back to the hangar, all in one level.Along side are the space battle stages. These battles are big, point based levels where you take to the stars in fighters, bombers and boarding craft. You either earn points by shooting down other fighters in dogfights or bomb their capital ships to bits, or you board them and start sabotaging their internal systems. It's a sweet change of pace, although it can be hassle to fly without a gamepad. It's therefore a shame the game's description on the Steam store reads that all online functionality in dead as of this year's May. Which is pure bantha poodoo. You still get around with some trickery. Even better, at this pricepoint, you might just better off telling all your friends to just buy it and bring their laptop over (it's old enough to run on any potato at this point), and just host a massive LAN party to restore balance to Force once and for all.

												Even though it is a old game, it still remains as one of the best games. I've played this game on my PlayStation 2 for hundreds of hours, and I enjoyed every second of it. If you don't get this game, you'll regret it. If you are wanting to play multiplayer but can't, what you have to do is download GameRanger, and it will allow you to join/host games, including Star Wars Battlefront 2. Like this review so more people see this review, so more people can play multiplayer!			"

NOTE 1: The game is OLD, being released back in 2005 so most likely than not you will encounter compatibility issues. I feel the need to point this out since it is not the game's fault that its 9 years old. There are 3 possible solutions to this:1. Right Click Battlefront 2 on Steam > Properties > Local Files > Browse Local Files, this will open the Battlefront 2 folder, Open GameData > Right click 'Battlefront II.exe' > Properties > Compatibility > Check 'Run this program in Compatibility for: Windows XP SP2.2. Plug in a microphone to your microphone jack, people on the forums report that this actually (usually) work.3. 


YouTube™ Video: How to fix the star wars battlefront 2 crash!!! 

			Views: 81,332		

			this will fix the crash and allow sound aswell. Some other ways to fix the crash is by deleting the sound, but i found a way to do it by saving the sound :D.		

 (Follow the instructions on this video, this worked for me).NOTE 2: The game supports 1080p resolution. Only the main menu, loading screens and pre-rendered cinematic are low resolution. The game itself, once you get it running, runs at a pristine 1080p, 60fps.INTRODUCTION:Star Wars: Battefront 2 is a first / third-person shooter game by LucasArts involving Star Wars' (duh) different histories ranging from the start of the Clone Wars towards Empire Strikes Back. It features soldier classes, hero characters, galactic conquest and a particularly fun space battle.The campaign follows the rough history of the 501st Clone/Stormtrooper Legion, Darth Vader's personal bodyguards and elite fighting force. As already stated, this will involve the events of Episode II: Clone Wars, up until Episode V: Empire Strikes back.PROS:+ Graphics aged well: - The old Pandemic Zero Engine is showing it's age but is not about to go down without a fight. Animation Quality is fluid, character models are well made, texture quality are very good for its time.+ Relatively Strong Campaign: - Short but satisfying is what I would describe the campaign. Voiced by none other than Temuera Morrison (Jango Fett), it delivers the exploits of the 501st Legion in a very informative and fun experience. Unfortunately the maps are only multilayer maps with given objectives.+ Space Battle: - Nothing beats the excitement of piloting different kinds of fighters and bombers to attack key points on the enemy battleship or engage in open space dogfights. If that’s not your thing, then land your fighter (or a transport ship) in the enemy Hanger area and start wreaking havoc with the ship's internal systems. Or just steal an enemy fighter.CONS:- AI is too easy: - Way to easy once you get a hang of it even when fighting 'Elite' difficulty AI.- Campaign is too short: - Given that I already played it back in the day, it took me at least 4-5 hours to finish the story mode.- Hilariously Imbalanced in some places: - Not game-breaking by any stretch, but the game does lack the rock, paper, scissors element that usually balances out multiplayer games. Some of the maps tend to favor one particular faction than the other.- AI is annoyingly dumb: - Especially in space battles. I get that you're a Stormtrooper and can't shoot to save your life, but standing around the hanger just staring at the wall instead of boarding a fighter and helping me fend off the millions of rebel fighters bearing down on us is a whole new level of incompetence.CONCLUSION:GREAT GAME and lots of FUN. The PROS definitely outweigh the CONS and that it provides a cure for that need for a casual fast paced action game. The single player experience is enough to keep you satisfied if you lack the online capabilities or when GameSpy inevitably shuts down.We can just hope that EA handles the franchise with care as the sequel for this game is already way overdue.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												A synthesized battle droid voice comes over into your ears.Enemy units detected inside the command craft.Seconds later, the CIS battlecruiser bursts into chunks, wisps of fire dying in the vacuum of space as sunlight crests the nearby Republic planet.You chuckle and a ""Victory"" readout appears before you.And that's just a moment in Battlefront 2.- - -While Star Wars Battlefront 2 is, y'know, ancient at this point, it is still a beauty in gaming and the serious nostalgia trip for so many of us. I, being a late-comer to gaming and Battlefront 2 being one of the earlier console games I played (along with GUN and I believe Flatout), can quickly say that this game is gorgeous and sold the industry to me.It's massive, it's immersive, it's quick-to-play, and it's Star Wars! Who doesn't like Star Wars? Well, plenty of people, but... hey, you can't dislike the adorable Stormtroopers.You've got all the stuff other shooting games do. Guns, people to shoot guns, and some extra things like vehicles. Then there's the space battles, which make an entirely different challenge and one of the most glorious flying experiences in gaming, and then you've got the tactical 'Conquest' part where you put around a giant fleet of spacecraft for your favorite faction in the Star Wars movies.Rebels, Empire/Republic, CIS: You can play as any of them, which is great fun. Each have their own soldiers and classes, allowing different experiences for every team. It's especially cool to roll around as a droideka, then unfurl and be destroyed by a Jedi. At least you're the envy of your friends.The battles themselves are manic and titanic. Hoth a devoid planet? Not when you're in the middle of a 100+ person skirmish between Rebels and Imperials. AT-AT action is amazing, until you're taken down by some jerk in a cheap snowspeeder. Maybe it was SKYWALKER?No.There's also that option to play as a Jedi or Sith or melodramatic bounty hunter popping up every now-and-then, but they're lame and die too quickly. I don't suggest them. Well, MBH is alright, but who wants to get eaten by a sandpit monster?There's the few issues, like absurdly dumb AI and logical errors (downwards gravity in space?), but they're far and few compared to the joy this game brings.I couldn't recommend this enough. And it's only 10 bucks USD!			"

												My favorite Star Wars game. This, and Jedi Acadamey (also on Steam). If you didn't play this when you were a kid, I'm extremely sorry. This game was a massive part of my childhood. Everyone who came over played it with me. It was a law. This, and Halo. This one is much better than the new Battlefront. Absolutely, no doubt there. If you haven't bought the new one, I'd say don't and just get this one. It can get a bit repeptive but you can still play with a friend which makes it a lot more fun. Plus there's modes other than a basic campaign. Definitley a thumbs up from me.			"

												My favorite Star Wars game to date. ♥♥♥♥ EA and ♥♥♥♥ the 2015 Battlefront. I own the new one and just bought the Season Pass on sale...and it's STILL a major letdown. Battlefront II, along with the original 2004 Battlefront, is where it's at. Two essential (free) mods I'd recommend are ""Battlefront Evolved"" and the ""1.3 Patch"". Evolved updates the textures/particle effects/lighting and it truly looks beautiful afterward. The 1.3 Patch fixes bugs, but I recommend NOT installing the ""HUD 1.2"" that comes as an option within the Patch menu (just uncheck it). Otherwise, you get two giant blue rectangles in the HUD which block half the screen.To sum it up, Battlefront II is THE Star Wars game to get if you're only getting one. Whereas EA's Battlefront seems little more than a demo + a Multiplayer cluster♥♥♥♥....here you get a glorious Single Player Campaign. Plus, with free mods you can make it look visually stunning...granted it won't look as good as EA's version, but perfectly acceptable for 2016 standards.			"

												Returned my DICE copy of Battlefie- er front. I wish that EA had not become the monster that controls the gaming world. I wish we could go back in time when you would buy an entire game upfront for one price. Or when you could play alone and escape the competitive moshpit of DICE/CoD games.My heart was broken when I played BattlefieldDICE... Like when my dog died but with more anger and resentment, even a little depression cause I'm passionate about the gaming life and it seems that only corruption remains in the industry. How do we get people to pay us more for our game? If i wanted graphics I would watch a movie.BF2 is the last battlefront ever made in my eyes. It's a good game made by people who really put love into the game and considered what other people might think is fun. Pandemic Studios was defunct by EA in 2009 and I will never forget or forgive that mistake.			"

												This is a game I grew up with on my Playstation 2.After seeing this was on sale here, I had to pick it up, and needless to say, I was not disappointed.I had no idea back then as a kid that the FPS on a Playstation 2 was locked to a specific degree compared to the PC version, the game looks and feels like i'm playing an HD remix of it.The controls are highly responsive, just like the consoles, however this is not simply a port.All keys have been smoothly transferred over to the PC's keyboard/mouse and it feels great.The story/career mode is just as good as i remember it being, which was simply fantastic, it's a challenge, not just some fancy map making and voice acting (Even though both are REALLY GOOD)This is a First/Third Person shooter that you will not want to miss out on!

												I think the most efficient way to review this would be a non (slightly) biased comparison of this Battlefront (Lucas Arts / L.A) with EA's new Battlefront.-GAMEPLAYL.A take the lead with this one. Pretty easily to be honest. Much more game modes, maps, factions etc.. 1-0, to L.A.-GRAPHICSWhat do you expect. L.A's is 10 years old. 10 YEARS OLD. 1-1.-REPLAYABILITYWhile EA's multiplayer leveling system offer some replayability, L.A's wider range, and much larger density, of content give L.A the point. Also, and i will refer to this quite a bit, not everyone likes multiplayer. 2-1 to L.A.-SINGLEPLAYEREA doesn't really know how to create a good singleplayer. At all. In fact, it seems they've given up on the idea altogether. Rest in peace EA - post Battlefield 2 / Bad Company. The lack of singleplayer is a negative point for EA, and L.A's extremely well done singleplayer, including a campaign, critically acclaimed Galactic conquest, and instant action give L.A a well-deserved point. 3-0-MULTIPLAYEREA get a point by default, as L.A's multiplayer was decommisioned a while back. While i deducted a point from EA for not having a singleplayer, i will not do so with L.A for the lack of multiplayer as, a) there was once upon a time, and b) the expansive singleplayer more than makes up for it. There are dozens of singleplayer only games and L.A's Battlefront is one of the best. 3-1 to L.A.-MOD SUPPORTTime has been of L.A's side, with multitudes of mods being released, a lot of them can be considered as unofficial expansions. A conversion pack has been developed, adding the favourite instant action maps from L.A's 1st Battlefront. Who doesn't like free additional content. 4-1 to L.A.-PRICEL.A's Battlefront is $15 on steam (I got my copy on special for $5). Fair enough for an old game. EA's is around $80. L.A's has a LOT more content, + mods such as the conversion pack. 1/5 of the price for (in my opinion) a much better game. 5-1.-ACCESSABILITYI can run L.A's Battlefront with 128 bots, maxed settings, easily over 60 fps, on my laptop. While L.A's Battlefront is only available on steam, Xbox + Xbox 360, and PS2, EA's is only available on the newer platforms (so tough luck for fellow laptop users). Also, for console users, EA's is multiplayer only (effectively) so hooray for online costs. Close battle, but point to L.A. 6-1.OVERRALLIf this was a football match, L.A's Battlefront would be Barcelona, and EA's would be Norwich. EA has yet again disappointed with its money-mongering and lack of singleplayer ability. I'm pretty sure EA have just produced the 1st clickbait-like game, not sure why they didn't call it Battlefield: Star Wars and save the royalty costs. Congrats to L.A's Battlefront for beating a game 10 years newer,			"

												30 CIS troops, me as one of them. 50 clones, holding more control points than us. My droideka rolls forward and unfolds, shields up and running in seconds. 5 seconds later, 5 clones lay dead before me, and a yellow message appears. 'Darth Maul is ready to activate'.... 2 minutes later, Darth Maul dies, along with 35 clones troops. I quickly go back to my droideka, and head towards an enemy command post. All 4 clones stand there, one in a turret. I gun my way through 3 of them, and land a lucky headshot on the trooper inside the turret. A red flash appears on the mini map; the final enemy. I fold back up and race towards it. I hear gunfire, but not directed at me. I see the clone. But he's different. His helmet has a mask on. I zoom in using my enhanced optical sensors. It's a clone sharpshooter. And he's wearing a troll face mask. He shoots, killing a droid engineer in the far distance, before a DEFEAT screen appears in front of me. *raises blaster to head*10/10 would kill-self again.			"

												You can easily get online with GameRanger, and it works flawlessly. However, there is usually only one active server. It has on average 30-40 people online during the day and stays active till around 9-10PM (PST) I havent noticed any server lag, nor have i seen any cheaters. But you will encounter some of both, im sure.Pretty active for such an old game. Definitely worth playing for a little bit at least. If not just for the nostalgia factor, the game holds up well and is a lot of fun even for someone who hasnt played before			"

												Before getting the Steam version of SWBF2, I used to play it on PS2. I probably clocked around 1500+ hours, gotten most of the Legendary medals, and knew all the maps down to the detail. It was a game that I held very close to my heart, and I still do. SWBF2 stands the test of time, even if it doesn't get an award for it. The PC port is very good, and is almost console-like in how it operates and looks.If you want a good Star Wars game to play, then this is the one you're looking for.			"

												Quite frankly, this game was everything to me. It was fun, it had good gameplay, the story was alright, and the multiplayer was very fun. This was until June of 2014. That was when the multiplayer shut down, and I haven't played it since. Don't get me wrong, the game is still brilliant with all of its moddable content, but the multiplayer was the main focus from the get go. There are still servers on GameRangers and other places like that, but the connection and people just aren't the same, because the connection was never as good and there aren't as many people on the servers.. If you're willing to pay $10 and deal with the horrible pings from those companies, then go right ahead. If you want a good and fun campaign, you may want to go buy something like KOTOR.			"

												Want a game that's stupid fun AND an accurate representation of what large scale battles in the Star Wars universe are like? Well, this is your game.Pros:-Over a hundred troops per side!-Amazing, immersive space battles!-Massive, large scale land battles!-A class-based system requiring you to unlock better classes through points earned.-The ability to play as a Jedi (a feature the first game lacked, even though you ended up having to fight them).-A completely revamped ""Galactic Conquest"" mode.-A story demonstrating the fall of the 501st Legion, the army Anikin used to betray the Jedi, and the rise of the Empire.-Only $10!Cons:-Stormtrooper-esque AI-Balancing issues (Mainly with Super Battle Droids. Why were these guys changed from unlockable troops to footsoldiers? They start off with a rocket launcher... as an off-hand weapon!).-An annoying lack of space stages; only 6 in total.-The company in charge of running the online servers went out of business, so no online play.In my opinion, the pros absolutely outweight the cons. Plus, keep in mind I haven't tried playing at higher difficulties than ""Normal"" yet, so I don't know if their AI gets better. All and all, though, it is a fun game and I absolutely recommend it to any fan of the Star Wars franchise.			"

												Still a very fun game, no matter if you're a Star Wars fan or not. Play as a trooper on the ground, driving combat vehicles; or play as a pilot and dominate the space battles. I'm not a Star Wars fan, but I love the sound (light sabers, blasters, space fighters, etc) and music from those movies.Fun fact: Most non-Russians (or people that are not from the post-soviet states) don't know about my people, the Kalmyks, but little did they know that they actually heard the Kalmyk language before! Ewokese is largely based on the Kalmyk language http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ewokese

												Battlefront II was the first game I ever got that was all mine. I was 8 years old and it was Christmas 2005, my folks gave my this game for my Dad's Xbox. That christmas changed my life forever, It was the day I became a gamer. I didn't understand how to play very well at first. But I eventually figured it out and I must have spent atleast 200 hours  playing this game to a pulp. The Campaign, the Instant Action, The Space Battles. Everything was great. Now a decade later we finally have a new Battlefront game!.. and it sucks.. So much is gone from Battlefront 2015-Campaign (Gone)-Galactic Conquest (Gone)-Space Battles (NONE!)-Maps (Only 4 at launch)-Prequel Era content (Movies were kind of bad but it still had cool stuff)It was a discrage. So I urge you don't give EA a nickel on there crappy reboot that charged over $60 ($100 with season pass) for less then a third of what this masterpiece right here can give you for less then $10, not to mention this version has mods!9/10 one of the best Star Wars games.

												I'm sure I'm not the only one who remembers playing this on a console back when it first came out. For $9.99 this is a steal. There are a couple of great mods to spice gameplay up a bit. Multiplayer is quite fun but as far as I know you need gameranger to play online. Pick this up if you havn't already. You won't regret it.			"

												I originally had this game on the PS2(I still have it) and spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours on it.  I have played many Star Wars games on different consoles and the PC and trust me when I say that this game is fun.  It is best played with friends, because you will have a lot of fun fighting with them for control of whatever planet you are on.  The campaign is OK, not outstanding, but not bad.  The missions are a bit short, but they can be fun even if you have played them a bunch of times.  You are rewarded for your work on single player with various abilities and weapons if you can reach ""Legendary"" status, which means you have got the medal 64 times.  You can get way overpowered weapons once you get ""Legendary"" on some challenges, but remember these only apply to single player games, not online.  The AI on normal is a bit dumb at some points, but the Elite setting is more challenging, but not impossible.  I would say overall it is 8.5 out of 10, but I would buy this game over and over.			"

												Star Wars: Battlefront II is a 2005 first- and third-person shooter video game based on the Star Wars film franchise. Developed by Pandemic Studios and published by LucasArts it is a sequel to 2004's Star Wars: Battlefront and the second game in the Battlefront series.The game features new vehicles, characters, game mechanics, maps, and missions compared to the original Battlefront. Unlike its predecessor, Battlefront II features a more narrative-based campaign, retelling portions of the Star Wars story from the point of view of a veteran Imperial stormtrooper, reminiscing about his tour of duty in service of both the Galactic Republic and as part of the Galactic Empire. Gameplay additions over Battlefront include the use of Jedi, additional game modes such as hero assault, and objective-based space battles. The general objective in most missions is to eliminate the enemy faction. Like Star Wars Battlefront, the game is split into two eras, the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. You have the ability to choose between six classes during gameplay. Four class types are common to all factions; infantry, heavy weapon, sniper and engineer. In addition to the four standard classes, each faction has two unique classes which unlock by scoring a predetermined number of points.  For the Rebellion faction, the Bothan Spy and the Wookiee; for the Empire, The Officer and The Dark Trooper; for the Republic, the Commander and the Jet Trooper; and for the CIS, the Magnaguard and the Droideka.Battlefront II contains only one campaign, called Rise of the Empire. This set of missions is presented as the narration of a veteran of the 501st Legion, known as Vader's Fist, beginning with an attack on the planet Mygeeto during the Clone Wars and ending with the assault on Hoth as depicted in The Empire Strikes Back. There are a total of 18 missions, four of which are optional space missions.Overall I would give STAR WARS Battlefront II a score of 8/10, it is a fun and entertaining game that doesn't have very much problems and the instant action with the bots is just awesome. Having played DICE's new STAR WARS Battlefront, I decided to go back and try the originals and I realized how much better they were, no customization and ranks, just pure fun. So if you're looking for a fun STAR WARS game I would recommend this as it just beats any other!.			"

												This is the best Star Wars game of all time and I will tell you why.First, since the 7th movie was coming out soon, I decided to start playing this game again and I just beat the campaign and played a bunch of instant action. I also played some multiplayer with GameRanger. I now think I can wright a review for this game.We will start with the pros and consPros:-Surprisingly fun campaign: you play as the 501st clone division and soon become Vader's Fist. You play in a bunch of the iconic battles from the original series and the prequels.-All four armies: in this game you get to play as either the clones vs. the separatists (Robots) or the Rebels vs. the Empire-A lot of Heroes: you get to play as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, etc... There is almost a different hero for a different map.-Fluent controls: the controls in this game are smooth and it feels good when you shoot a rebel scum in the face with your E-11.-Space battles: The fact that this game had space battles where you can land on the other team’s ship and destroy it from the inside was ahead of its time and no other games captures space battles like this one. There are also different ships for different occasions like there is an x-wing for destroying regular enemies and y--wings to bomb their cruiser.-A lot of maps: There is a bunch of maps in this game like Endor, Hoth, Geonosis, and much more.-64 player battles: This is self explanatory-Modable: If you pair this game with mods you can have an even better time with this game and if add all the user made maps with the ones in this game, there are over 800 maps for this game!!!Cons:-Aging: This game is 10 years old and there aren't too many people playing this game on Game Ranger. The graphics are out of date and sadly Pandemic studios went out of business in 2009.That's about all the consOverall:Star Wars Battlefront 2 is one of the greatest Star Wars games ever made and in my opinion, It is one of the greatest games ever made.This game gets a 9/10. I highly recommend this game to any shooter fan and every Star Wars fan alike.I hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading!!!Game Ranger download for multiplayer: https://www.gameranger.com/ "

												This game is amazing. The graphics are quite old looking, so it's not as beautiful as the new Star Wars Battlefront, but everything else is so much better.Map design is really nice. There's everything from huge plains to cities to simple buildings like in the Coruscant map.My personal favorite maps are Mustafar, Mos Eisley, Coruscant and Jabba's Palace.Map design feels like it's made for Star Wars battles, unlike in the new 2015 Battlefront where they feel like reskinned Call of Duty maps.This game was a huge change from Battlefront I. In II, we have space battles, a far improved campaign and of course what I'd say it's most famous for... Jedi / Siths as playable characters.The game is very easy to run and was ported to PC amazingly. I can run it on a 1.4 ghz PC with an Intel HD 1000 graphics card.Go pick this game up if you like Star Wars.I've been playing it since 2010/11 on PS2 and I'm still not tired of it.P.S. Get the PC version, trust me. Xbox runs it okay but the PS2 version runs very poorly compared to Xbox / PC.			"

												Story: We all know the story.... what's most important is the gameplay and that they don't bomb the plot. Here you get a pretty bare bones campaign that follows the 501st. There's almost a great simplicity to this stuff. First of all I love that they didn't force this campaign into a corridor shooter. They keep the levels pretty free-roam and similar to the instant action (just with objectives). This probably made development easier, but it works, unlike modern multiplayer shooters where the campaign feels tacked on. The 501st is a great choice of perspective but not much is done with it. There is the potential for a lot of conflict and a kind of clone soul-searching. After watching the Clone Wars animated series, I really saw what could've been done with exploring the humanity of clones and their connection to the jedi. But then again this isn't really important to this game or what it's remember for.Gameplay: This game is straight forward action, not too fast, not too slow. This game is pretty easy to jump into. Its controls are intuitive and the third person camera makes it easy to understand and move around your environment. Starting out, you feel like an above-average soldier, you stick to your comrades, use similar weapons, and take cp's together. As you begin to master the combat, you begin to unlock weapon upgrades and once these are permanently unlocked you become a god on the battlefield. The gameplay is pretty shallow at this point and you'll find yourself hardly dying while taking every cp. I wish the game was a bit harder, but then again its not really why you play the game. You are rewarded often with the chance to play as a hero. Overall these moments are fun and rushed. The controls again are basic compared to something like jedi knight, but the heroes are really just there as a killing spree bonus. What adds depth to the game is the variety of maps and the ways to play the maps. When you develop some favorites you find there are a multitude of ways to win a game. Now probably the best part of the game and where it shines the most is when playing against friends. Playing against friends with bots creates such a fun dynamic. The moments where you run into your friend among a horde of bots and have to fight your way to each other then face-off in a tense duel is some serious fun! The unbalanced nature of different factions on different maps adds a realistic sense where someone's the underdog and if they win its quite embarrassing for the other player. I loved this aspect of the game also because it overshadowed the dumb AI which can reveal itself to be quite predictable after some time.Game Modes: The campaign I already discussed. The instant action mode was the place I spent most of my time, facing off against bots or friends. Lastly there's the galactic conquest mode. I really did appreciate this mode back in the day, but it has certainly aged. It is a lot of fun for the first time gamer as it makes a simplistic spin off of instant action mode and puts it in the context of conquering the galaxy. But after playing many other games and coming back, this mode just doesn't have the depth. I highly recommend downloading mods like the conversion pack to add even more variety in terms of maps, units, heroes, and vehicles. These breathed life into another play-through for me.Overall: I recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of star wars and wants to experience large scale battles in a simply fun way. Do not expect a deep combat system or revolutionary campaign, just find some friends and load up instant action!			"

												Battlefront II remains one of my most favorite Star Wars games. I used to play it a lot before it came to Steam. One of the most fun things I find about Battlefront II is that you can play as your favorite Star Wars hero, and control massive vehicles and starships. It has good single-player missions and the gameplay is also top notch!I really recommend this game if you like Star Wars (...and don't mind older graphics)   c:::::::::::::=ԅ╏ ˵ ⊚ ◡ ⊚ ˵ ╏┐			"

												READ THIS REVIEW IF HESITANT ON BUYING THIS GAME! I have been playing this game since it originally came out on ps2.I originally had this game on the PS2 (I still have it) and spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours on it. I got it 10 years ago the day it came out on PS2, now just got it on PC in the summer sale and still has to be the most fun and best game I ever played. I hope the new battlefront though is as good as this one, (2015) release date. The campaign is OK, not outstanding, but not bad. Though the campaign is roughly 6 hours long, Galactic Conquest is what most people will enjoy. This game is wonderful. The graphics are beautiful even to this day and the environments are very inspiring. Every Star Wars fan should check this one out. You can either do 1st or 3rd person shooting which is really nice and most shooter games don't give you that option, unfortunately. 3rd person is one its key characteristics and I hope Dice and EA implement it into the new game coming out along with the new movie. The difficulty of this game isn't really too bad at all, it only picks up in the last 3 or 4 missions. So frustrating, but again, it's amazing because I felt the struggles the Troopers felt going up against the rebel scum. It wasn't a walk in the park and the developers make you feel it. That's something I personally don't get from games like Halo or CoD. Though I have nothing against these games) If you are a fan of the way those shooters work, you will definitely enjoy this. Very well done and it's very compelling really. If you like Rogue Squadron, then you will like the way these ships fly, to say the least. This game is just a blast for any Star Wars fans, or FPS fans in general. It has a very nice story if you are a fan of Star Wars or just want to get deeper into the universe. I just really enjoy this game and truly can't find a downside unless a story line is a big deal to you. I was never really disappointed with this game, the Campaign was very enjoyable (and a bit challenging at times) but a little short and the maps are very fun to play on and has huge variety (From the snowy landscape of Hoth to the murky Swaps of Dagobah).This game is one of the best games I have ever played and the multiplayer is my favorite part which by the way is still there. I don't know why people are complaining about the online multiplayer, yes it was run by GAMESPY, and yes they did shutdown; but there is still DEDICATED SERVERS that you can go and play on if you want multiplayer action, and you can still HOST games and have friends join your server; you can also use Gameranger and join through there as well. The space combat is just how I remembered it fun and very unique in there being different ways to approach and destroy your opponent's ship. This game is a masterpiece of its time and deserves to be in your game library. (Hopefully with hours played on it :)I give it a 10/10 for being one of the best and really only good Star wars game out there.			"

												I very much suggest buying this game. Why? because this game is what pure childhood feels like. I remember my days as a lad back in 2005 probably cranking in around 200 hours playing this game. It still has great mechanics that you can see being used today that were first introduced into this franchise. the graphics are acceptable but the awesome gameplay makes up for it. I would also suggest buying this game so that you can really see how far the series has come when dice releases their battlefront. The only downside is that the multiplayer was shut down which really sucks. But the ai is good enough to satisfy. all in all I give this game a 9.5\10 and when you buy it you will see why.			"

												Fairly outdated at this point, but still a good game.  The AI is decently intelligent for the time of its release.  With a third installment seemingly never emerging, this is your best bet if you want a Battlefield-esque Star Wars game.  Although, sticking to single player is probably a better bet due to a decreasing support in multiplayer servers.			"

												An absolutely flawless game, every moment is enjoyable. I played the game a while back when I didn't have steam and put in 1000+ hours (Recorded on XFire which is down now) pretty much creating my childhood. Sadly the multiplayer is down but the singleplayer campgain is fantastic. The game has a huge selection of mods online that you can download and play. Since the game has been cut in half content wise the game is not as valueable but definitly worth a buy. It is unfortunate that this series will die with no second chance as the company went bankrupt (Even though they sold the best Star Wars Games). While this game dies we recieved the very disappointing Star Wars Battlefront EA which was a complete waste of my money. I would rather buy Battlefront 2 again for $60.			"

												Battlefront II gives you a great Star Wars experience. It lives up to the title. In huge battles, you can pick up from many types of troopers, after you picked a side. The variety makes the battles explosive, therefore you have the chance to play through the thrill you had while you saw the good action parts of the movies. Also, it's rewarding for fans and acknoledging for newcomers to play this game. Fun is the word I use to describe this game. No bugs, big battles, many troops, many weapons, and great heroes and villans are at your disposle. The graphics may be dated, but they are detailed enough for you to enjoy what it provides and at this price, it's a real bargain. All in all, Star Wars BattleFront 2 is a 8.4 that will take many hours from my life, and I won't regret it.			"

												You may wonder to yourself, ""Why should I buy a First Person Shooter that's this old?"" Well, let me answer you with the reasons SWBFII tends to be the only FPS game I will play with my friends on a regular basis. Let me start with the single player. As much as FPS games are not the best for their story, SWBFII takes it away with the story of the 501st throughout the Star Wars universe with objectives that can tend to be more than just ""Take this point"" or ""Kill this person"" as you would see in any other FPS. From the tutorial until the last mission in game, the story objectives will either frustrate you (*Cough* Order 66 *cough*) or make you beg for more. Then there's galactic conquest, which is outside the campaign itself. This lets you control the republic, CIS, rebel alliance or empire and go through different planets, taking them over to fuel your empire while you research upgrades and troops to use. Next, the troops you choose. Every class has the same equivalent on the opposing team EXCEPT for the special troops (Dark Trooper, Clone Commander, Imp Officer, Wookiee, Bothan, Jet Trooper, Magnaguard and the rolling droids, don't remember what they're called). Each side has a heavy-weapons guy, a medic/engineer, a soldier and a sniper as well as two specials which I listed. Next, multiplayer, it's much more organized and less of a cluster than CoD. Melee is non-existent and it's rather equal in terms of game-play... not in terms of skill. The modes are much more organized between CTF-1 (one flag both sides fight to capture), CTF-2 (Classic Capture the Flag), Regular (until reinforcements run out), assault (First to get certain score wins) and so on. Next thing I like are the heroes, If you have them enabled in multiplayer, you can easily destroy a team... if not focused... which always happens. Otherwise, great first-person shooter. That if you choose can be third-person as well. A buy well worth the money.			"

												For battlefront EA:""From yet another developper consumed by the unstoppable juggernaut that is EA, comes the series reboot that is Star Wars Battlefront. Lower your expectations for the series reboot that took all the stuff you loved about the original games and threw all that s*** out of the window to make a battlefield game with a star wars skin.""-Honest Game trailers, referencing Battlefront EASeriously, if you want a real star wars game, buy Battlefront II. I'm pretty sure that the only better things the new game has is decent graphics and sound effects. Other than that, it's battlefield : stars wars edition (I'm not saying that battlefield is bad nor Battlefront.). And if you want some good graphics, go watch the movies, I'm pretty sure that even the movies has more content than the new game. Now if you want to see the differences between the two, check this out.  Features Battlefront II Battlefront EA   Number of maps 33 8   Planets 16 4   Space Battles yes no   Custom Maps yes nope.   DLCs 1 ($5) 5 ($60)   Heroes 24? 6   Galactic Conquest yes maybe... no.   AI Players yes only in 1 gamemode   Playable Eras Classic and Prequel Classic   Price (USD) $5 $60 Finally, go get this one and don't buy the new Battlefront unless it costs $30 (USD) or less... And no, I'm not saying that the new game is bad, it's just missing a lot of features witch makes it way too expensive for the small amount of features is has.Also, for those who say that there is no more online features in Battlefront 2, you can download Gameranger for free to be able to join any server (private or public)!For the information, I have played more than 8 hours but is wasn't on steam so it didn't registered it...

												Over the decades so many star wars shooters/action games have come out that i have honestly lost track of all of them..really, on the whole they blur together like the identical legionaries of rome total war or slightly more accuratley the endless procession on transformers movies and in that vas ever growing ocean of same-ness, uninspired fraudulent copycats and zombified story telling there is a slightly less zomby esque gem free to embrace indviduality filled with uniqeness.Glowing adulation aside Star Wars battlefront 2 the sucessor ((although in my opiniion sucessor in name and not much else)) to the similarly named orgional takes the lessons learned by the first game and nearly throws them out of the window, no longer does the game play like a star wars themed call of duty rip off, no longer do are you constricted to narrow missions and goals, you can play a capmiagn of which theres one for every section of major star wars lore at the time this game came out in adition to the matching scenarios for Battlefront 2's most advertised  (( at the time )) galactic conquest..and thats its by the way simply saying galactic conquest sums up what you need to know about that game mode because it is literally nothing but dragging army and fleet icons around and fighting zoomed in empire at war style. But in the  end nearly no other shoooter and certainltn not a star wars shooter gives you the ability to play as a ground soildier or hero in a army assaulting a planets strongpoint, battlefron 2 will give you something however shallow at times that is uniuqe in the world of star wars shooters and still special in the world of gaming, catch it on any kin dof sale and you will be getting more than your moneys worth, buy it at full price and at least you will be getting what you paid for in full.

												What Battlefront II (2005) had at or around launch:Campaign20+ Awesome MapsGraphics that made Battlefield 2 cry in defeat (for its time)Average AI (better than Battlefield 2's bots, I guess)Awesome Battlefield-based gameplayFull-fledged (and awesome) Space BattlesMOD SUPPORT!!!!A strong and thriving community (even a decade after it was released)No DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tGalactic ConquestWhat Battlefront (2015) had at or around launch:♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Campaign""♥♥♥♥♥♥ bot matchesLess than 18 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps (even with the content updates)Average-to-completely-crap DLC packsGraphics that made Black Ops III and Halo 5 cry in defeatNo Galactic Conquest :(A small and dying toxic communityFighter Squadron (EA's attempt to convince the masses that BFII's space battles don't exist).No mod support :(Gameplay that's worse than Homefront: RevolutionSo I guess what I'm trying to say is, I bought Battlefront EA because I was an idiot.Don't be an idiot. In fact, if you already bought Battlefront EA and you hate it, see if you can get a refund, and use the money to get this game. Because EA doesn't derserve your money after cheating you with the content-to-cost ratio. Think about how they unfairly charge you $120 for their window dressing of a game, and that this game is on Steam for a cheap $10. ""OMFG, Tykylo!!!!!!!11!! U fokin wut m8? This trash heap lost itz multiplayer in 2014!!11!!! And it l00kz like vomitz today!!!1! No WAY dis iz better dan da musterpeece dat iz Battlefront by EA!!!11!!!1!"" First of all, HOW DARE you call this game a trash heap. It may cower in fear in the face of better games like Black Ops III and Battlefield: Bad Company 2, but back in 2005, this game was the ♥♥♥♥! And the graphics were high quality back in 2005. Multiplayer is still available through GameRanger, assuming you know how to Google. Also, may I remind you that multiplayer isn't everything? Campaign isn't all that stellar in this game, but it's certainly better than the ""Training Mode"" found in Battlefront EA. Not only that, this game came out with 24 maps AT LAUNCH, and brought with it full-on space combat, bot matches, and mod support, things we rarely see in modern gaming, ""Da space battlez weer shet doe! All you did waz hold doun da fire button!"" There was actually a lot more than that, buddy. In space battles, while they were point-based, involved a lot of tactics. If someone was leading a boarding party from a gunship, the people inside that tuna can in space had to make sure they didn't get blown up before they reached the hangar, and when they did get into the hangar, they had to take into account that other players are defending the ship's internals as well. If you were the leader, you truly felt like a badass. You could also take part in the dogfights around the ships, and try to blow up the ships that way. Bottom line; Battlefront II did (and still does) a great job at coercing players to work as a team without making it feel forced. ""Yeah, but I paid lotz o monee for Battlefront EA. And you just hurt my pride, so ♥♥♥♥ off, newb!1!"" Fair enough. Overall, this was, and still is, a great game. It gets a 9/10 from me.One gripe with it though; it's inaccurate.Stormtroopers couldn't aim for ♥♥♥♥ in the Death Star.Okay, now an actual review. Campaign You play as an anonymous 501st clone trooper, who has weathered every major Star Wars battle except Endor. And while clones do rapidly age, many clones were found alive after the Battle of Endor. We can guess that this clone died around 3 or 4 ABY, which would explain why the Battle of Endor was never featured in the campaign.The story isn't heavy like Call of Duty or Halo, but it provides an interesting perspective of the many Star Wars battles, and was more narrative-focused than its 2004 predecessor. It wasn't the stellar storytelling you'd expect from Crysis, but many people, like myself, enjoyed it regardless. It's neither terrible, nor stellar, but it's better than Battlefield 1's campaign (THAT overrated mess). Galactic Conquest Many people who helplessly defend EA's Battlefront, like the not-so-good and cringy-as-hell YouTuber BDobbinsFTW, start off by saying the Galactic Conquest modes in Battlefronts I and II were complete and utter trash. And apparently I'm a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot becuase I received nothing but death threats for saying I enjoyed the Galactic Conquest and that it actually was a good mode, but I wouldn't have it any other way. It plays a bit like RISK with some fun twists in it. It's certainly not the best mode, but it's enjoyable and playable. That mode was basically a teaser for Empire at War (which was an awesome game).  Graphics Many EA fanboys also attack this game's graphics without ever considering the fact that BFII was made in 2005. Yes, there were some amazing exceptions, like Halo 2, but I honestly found BFII's graphics better than it's competitor, Battlefield 2. And with the right tweaks (and mods), you can make it look absolutely stunning. Multiplayer Before I say anything else, two words: GameRanger and SWBFSpy.Many things about the multiplayer are just really good; the gameplay felt very smooth and fluid, Conquest mode was AMAZING (arguably better than Battlefield's Conquest mode), and the space maps were really well done. Keep in mind that all of that came from a mod group, Pandemic Studios.  Instant Action Basically offline multiplayer. The only problem you'll really run into are the mediocre bots. But hey, if you want worse AI, there's Battlefield and Halo. All in all, Star Wars: Battlefront II was, and still remains, one of the most highly cherished Star Wars games of all time. I'd highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good Star Wars shooter (an even better game than BFII goes by the name of Republic Commando). Make sure to get both this and the first Battlefront if you're interested; leave EA's Battlefront to rot.			"

												Star Wars Battlefront II is a shooter game from LucasArts, the Star Wars games publisher. It is a sequel to the previous game Star Wars Battlefront. In my opinion, the best Star Wars shooter game yet.Star Wars Battlefront II, almost similar to the previous game, share a similar game mechanic but with more improvement and many new features, such as the new space battle with Star Destroyer or Mon Calamari cruiser as a base and target. The campaign of Star Wars Battlefront II follows the story of the 501st Legion from the Rise of the Empire era into the beginning of Galactic Civil War era, jumping you into many planetary and space battles.Star Wars Battlefront II graphics has made quite improvement over the previous game, it may looks old, but it's and old game. Performance of the game is good, but some technical issues seems to happen on newer system with Windows 7 and above.Star Wars Battlefront II is a great sequel, the best Star Wars shooter game yet with many gameplay and features. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

I loved this game so much it was one of my favorite games of that generation, and likely one of my most played games of all time, I likely have 10,000+ hours on it alone!

Star Wars Battlefront II was a full scale galactic conflict that only a Jedi could master.It was also the first game I actually played online. It was the PS2 version, and I remember being blown away by what you could do in the game. Flying Tie fighters, riding a Tauntaun, delivery the force choke to lightsaber insta-kill with Darth Vader on Mos Eisley, and of course Hoth on conquest. If it was in the movies, you could do it in this game. What made this game so awesome was that every player could find a class, or role that worked for them. Everyone working towards the same goal of capturing the command posts. Support roles were important, not everyone had to be an all star FPS player to help the team. Well it's been 10 years, how has the game aged? Gamespy is no more, and playing online now requires VPN, or a third party solution for games over the internet. But this game still rocks the LAN party. The specs to run SWBF2 are so minimal it can run on almost any PC (not your grandmas Windows 95, but anything from 2010 and up should be fine). Its just as fun as it was back then, and even appeals to the younger audience as well. My son who is 7 will ask to play this more than any other game in our Steam library. The game also supports full controller. It's listed as partial controller support by Steam, but I was able to map all the functions I needed to play without using a keyboard or Xpadder. With the release of SWBF3 I have to admit I'm disappointed to hear the class system is gone, space battles are gone, the campaign is gone, and the only way to play with another human being is to use an EA server. So again did SWBF2 age well? The answer is yes, and one thing is certain. Long after EA kills the servers for SWBF3, you'll still find a dedicated group playing SWBF2  online.OLDER GAMER APPROVED

												The first time i played this was on the PS2. For being such an old game it's still a lot of fun, and i'm not such a fan of other older games i know. Many people say that the mods are really important (because the graphics aren't too good etc.) I don't think so personally. I have downloaded a few mods but it doesn't enhance the gameplay for me, vanilla already works fine in my case. The story isn't really a story, more like a lot of the same type of missions but on different maps. I still enjoy playing it sometimes, but because of the same gameplay all the time i don't play for long. The mode called ""Instant"" is my favourite. Here you can choose whatever map you'd like and which gamemode to play. A tip here is to download a/many mappacks, especially Space to Ground maps, they are the most fun because they let you fly in a spaceship and fire on ground units at the same time and a lot more :)I really recommend this game, both for the exploring parts and because Star Wars is epic overall and if you've seen the movies i really think this game is more appealing to you because you will notice many details and characters from the movies while playing.

												Given the choice between a copy of Call of Duty Ghosts and 5 copies of this game, I'd pick 5 copies of this game. Really old game, one of the games I played on my original XBox and enjoyed for years (until Star Wars Battlefront I + II were both scratched into unusableness). They play well and give you the option of 3rd and 1st player. Playing Vanilla is fun, but nowhere near as much fun as with mods, particularly the Battlefront Extreme (pretty sure it's Extreme) mod which adds a ton of new maps, classes and vehicles for all factions. Setting up a private game is super easy, taking only a GameSpy account and a few minutes, and bam, you have a highly customizable private (or public) game with maps and classes from mods (or a vanilla game should you so desire). You can have an hour long fight, where you can fight over a thousand enemies (changable before you launch your singleplayer or multiplayer game), or a quick 4v4 skirmish with less than a hundred reinforcements for both sides. You can also have a dog fight in space, using a range of Interceptor class fighters to Dropships, you can knock out your advesary's vital ship components or land your boarding party in their hangar and wipe them out from the inside. Because it's such an old game, you shouldn't expect much in terms of visuals but for how old it is, it's pretty good. The low price is also awesome, being only at $10. It may just be the fond memories I have of this game and it's predecessor, but I'd give it a 8.5/10.			"

												This game may be 9 years old but is still worth picking up! As of July 2014 Multi-player was removed from this title but the singleplayer still provides hours of entertainment. What Battlefront 2 lacks behind in graphics it makes up with stunning gameplay. There is a variety of singleplayer gamemodes such as Instant Action, Campaign Mode and Galactic Conquest. Galactic Conquest is by far my favourite with it being much like a Star Wars edition of risk in where you command your space fleet across the galaxy defeating your opponent in both space battles and invading or defending a planet from a wave of attacks. However the campaign of this game is very short, easy and not the most entertaining with it only being about 2 hours long at most.One of the best features about game is the ability to control your factions heroes from Mace Windu to Han Solo to Darth Vader. You can help your teammates on the battlefield (Droids, Stormtroopers, Rebels etc.) defeat their enemy with the power of a lightsaber or a scoundrel like Han (Who shot first!) The only bad thing about this game is the lack of multiplayer, the graphics of this game are not the greatest but the game is still perfectly playable and will still provide hours of entertainment. In conclusion this game is worth the £6.99 (Time of Review Price) and any Star Wars fan should pick this game up!			"

												every so often a game comes along, a game unlike any other,a game that can make you so happy that your eye balls explode from your head,Star Wars BattleFront II is this exact game.as a first look of the game on steam, i thought it looked pretty dull, and being the star wars fan i was, i didnt want to waste my money on a star wars game that would ruin things for the franchise. however being an expert yoloist i decided that you  have got to take some risks, and so i bought it.THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!! play as a clone and KICK THE S*IT out of droids, play as a jedi and 1 hit kill EVERYTHING, THE POSSIBILITIES!!! this game for me was based on the graphics and the gameplay, the graphics well, being made 10 years ago, are pretty good. and the gameplay is just so amazing i found myself in tons of positions where my heart is pounding out of its chest because i wanted to win so badly.all in all this game really won me over, and i mean this game is even a bargain at $10, if you are a star wars fan, GET THIS GAME! you will love it 9.5/10 BRING BACK THE MULTIPLAYERS!!!

												Part of me knows I should spend 2 hours thinking of and writing a full-length review for this game but honestly I don't think I really even need to say much. I've been playing Star Wars Battlefront II since I was just a little kid. I remember the first time I played the game, must've been back in '05 when it was freshly released. I was over at my aunts house and one of my cousins, Scott, took me too his room which was in the basement. We first spent about 2h on KOTOR I, and then moved onto BF2. I remember how much fun I had playing as a Phase 1 clone on Geonosis, getting my first ever droid kills...Honestly I don't feel I can do it justice by reviewing it. I'll give some pros off the top of my head and cut right to the chase:Said Pros:Endless replayability and modding possibilitiesStill has an active community despite the game being over 10 years old, and official Mulitplayer servers shut downEverything EA's Battlefront has minus the pretty graphicsGame can run on a toasterEndless hours of funIf you call yourself a Star Wars fan and can afford, but have never played this game, as well as the KOTOR games mind you, you don't deserve the title. If you don't have this game and can pick it up there's no excuse not to do so. With how cheap the game usually goes for, and how easy it is to mod and create with the game...it's honestly probably the most replayable Star Wars game out there. The game still has an online playerbase and cult following, so community is still plentiful if multiplayer is your thing.I also might as well include the Convo packs you need to mod the game for people who are fresh and new to it here. So here that is:Conversion Patch 2.0/2.2: Click hereConversion Patch 1.3: Click hereIf you liked EA's Battlefront you'll love BF2. Just buy the game.			"

												Amazing game but has many dissapointing features.We wanted to play as Heroes\Villain while on Battlefront 1, you were forced to fight jedis that won't die by explosive, blasters but only with road kill or enviroment which is frustrating but still fun.The cons are simple: -they removed many maps from battlefront 1 which, honestly, they were very nice. You won't see the famous dune sea of Tatooine or experience the green plains of Naboo, Rhen Var, Bespin, the chaotic arena of Yavin 4 and changed Kashyyk into the Ep3 version (making it only 1 map). You're forced to download as mod.-No more the ""yellow"" faction: As you've read before, the removal of the Dune Sea, there are no more 3rd faction such Tusken Raiders, Gungan and such. Although there's hunt mode, this doesn't change that the game has became quite restricted.-No additional factions:  It's the same thing, really. They added 1 special class and re assigned some weapons but the factions are the same: Republic with Clonetroopers (Added the Commando clone with a gatling gun as seen in Mygeeto cutscene), CSI with the droids (Added the MagnaGuard as seen as Grievous's bodyguards but instead of electric metal pole, they've given a rocket gun), Empire with stormtrooper (Added the Imperial Officer with a soundblast gun), Rebels with the Bothan Spy (As also mentioned in Episode VI, they carry incinerator, cloak device and timebomb).  You can all fix this by downloading mods provided by the community.You should play the campaign mode too! It has much of feels from the troopers of the 501stRegardless of all, it's a beautiful game worth to play. I've been playing it for years in my ps2 and now getting re addicted with pc version. Close to get all medals as Legendary.			"

												Star Wars is one of my favorite movies ever. The first time I played Star Wars Battlefront II I was amazed by everything it has to offer. The game offers various maps based mosty off the prequel movies, but their are still a few sequel maps to play on. The game allows the player to switch between the Clone Wars and the Galactic Rebelion for every map. Every map comes with the gamemode ""Conquest"". Conquest is a game mode when both sides are fighting for command post to dominate the other side's  reinforcments. After the player has reached a certain amount of points, he or she can play was various characters in the movie like Obi-Wan and Darth Maul. Although, if you are playing with all NPC's the game is almost very easy and it won't take long before you reach a special character. Luckily Star Wars Battlefront II adds multiplayer and a ton of server to join. Sadly the community isn't as big as it might have used to be. You'll still be able to find a server with a good amount of people though. I have played this game a lot of times with my friends online and we all enjoyed the experience. Another cool thing about the game is that also include space combat when two sides try to take down the other's defences. The graphics are now lacking to today's standards but it's still fits the atmosphere of Star Wars. If you are a fan of Star Wars, this is a must have.			"

												Until Team Fortress 2 came out, this was my absolute favorite FPS.  After Team Fortress 2, and dabbling in many other shooter games, it's still solidly second despite being nearly ten years old.  Its age does make it difficult to recommend to people who are both not Star Wars fans or have not played the game before, but if you are a Star Wars fan or have fond memories of playing this game in the past, you should definitely pick it up without hesitation.  It's aged tremendously well, and until (or to those of us who have heard about it being canceled and restarted numerous times, unless) the new Battlefront comes out, there is no other game like it.Oh, but before buying, you may want to make sure you have a good amount of friends to play alongside with, because multiplayer is where this game really shines (naturally).  And you especially want to make sure you have friends who are close by, since the online multiplayer's going down on May 31st, 2014.			"

												Nothing short of a fantastic improvement on the original. The addition of a proper story to the Single Player campaign is quite welcome, but also well thought out, and there are a few maps that you can only get to play by going through the single player. Space battles were added to the game, with air vehicles like xwings, etc being taken out of the land based levels as in the first one the levels just weren't quite big enough to allow for any strategic value to be gained by flying around. Unfortunately although it is a fun element, it quickly becomes repetitive and is probably the one glitchy point of the game, by glitchy I mean that its rather intermittent as to stationary turrets bothering to fire at you and next to impossible to dodge on some occasions, whereas other times you could shut your eyes and not get hit, even if you opened them and tried to fly into it. That aside it was still a step in the right direction. The other addition to the game is heroes characters ranging from Obi-Kenobi and Mace Windu, to Boba Fett and Han Solo, not to mention Yoda. The heroes are simple enough to use, but can easily turn the tide of battle, and in the hands of a master can mean total annihalation for a side. The only drawback to the heroes are that some seem to be a bit pathetic, but all in all its another step in the right direction for the Battlefront series. If you liked the first one, this is well worth the purchase. Ignore the bad reviews here people, if you like Star Wars this definately one of the good games in the franchise. Battlefield in the Star Wars Universe, who cares if its a ripoff, it makes for good gaming, not to mention the last good game in the battlefield series was the Desert Combat MOD for Battlefield 1942.

												This game was my childhood. Thanks god I can get it on steam :D But now I'm sad because I can't play multiplayer...oh well, bots are still fun to fight ^_^ 10/10. this game has amazingly satisfying and enticing gameplay, and can be picked up be even the most softcore shooter fans. Easy-to-learn controls and awesome music make for a lovely little Star Wars title that's been around for roughly a decade now. It still comes up to snuff with more modern tactical shooters like Battlefield and Team Fortress 2 in my eyes. A+ den-outta-den FIVE STARS			"

												Star Wars Battlefront II was a memorable experience during my childhood. From the year 2007 to present day, it continues to endure as one of my most memorable video game titles.  I had purchased it for the PS2 console, completed the well-written campaign, tinkered with galactic conquest, and enjoyed some multi-player a day after release. Subsequently, I had later discovered the instant action mode and its legendary unlocks.I remember that invincibility cheat code to this day.Up Up Up, Left, Down Down Down, Left, Up Up Up, Left, Right.

												This game is literally all I played when I was really, really small. Even if you're not into Star Wars - this game is really fun and recommended to play for family & friends. Although I didn't have this for Steam at the time, I soaked in thousands of hours in this game with It's modding capabilities.Lol, and yeah - about the new Star Wars Battlefront by EA/DICE - Although their game looks well done, there are very serious flaws. This old gem actually offers a WHOLE LOT more than their game with the cost of moderate graphics and It's old gameplay.Here in SWBFII, you have:- The Clone Wars (Seriously guys, the Clones are better than Stormtroopers...)- Space Battles- 64 players, 32v32 - Including Multiplayer- Playing as Wookies, Ewoks and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ inhabitants!- Modding capabilities! That itself is like a HUGE ♥♥♥ DLC that will extend your game time with this old gem. All of it ranges from Space to Ground Battles to all the way to Zombies!- TONS of Maps. With modding capabilities, that alone can crash your game due to It's massive content.Sounds awesome, right? Well, let's take a look at EA's new Star Wars Battlefront. I mean, I'm not saying I won't play it, I definitely will - however It is a big letdown.- 40 players only? You gotta be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me.- No Space Battles? Well, that's HALF of Star Wars sliced down already. If not, most.- No Clone Wars either. What the ♥♥♥♥ guys? Seriously, Stormtroopers are ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So are the Rebels. If you pair a Clone against a Stormtrooper in a damn wrestle, I'd bet $30 the Clone would rip apart the Stormtrooper. Like, even the ♥♥♥♥ing Droids are better than them.- Barely any maps. Like 5-6 only, and the only map that looks worth playing is Hoth. That's another slice of Star Wars cut down.- Survival Mode... Oh my ♥♥♥♥ING GOD. If you two as Rebels manage to kill an entire ♥♥♥♥ing army of Imperials, it just makes them look even MORE pathetic than they actually are. Two or four people against an entire battalion of Stormtroopers and they would STILL lose.  LOL!There's really only ONE good factor about this upcoming game.- Beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, lots of detail into literally everything.Alright, time to stop nerding out, but all in all - this game is worth the $10 and even better on sale. The content is massive in this one.			"

												I heard this game had awesome multiplayer. Sadly I got to it a bit too late and ended up only playing the single-player. That experience, while frustrating at times since it seemed like a number of the levels were designed for far more than just one person, was at least kinda neat. Im sure with a group of people it would have been quite awesome. Still, I did have some fun. I was a little sad when the campaign ended after the Battle of Hoth.Giving this a ""yes"" for being good at some point in the past. If you are looking to play this in the present...

												Star Wars Battlefront II (Soon to likely be called Star Wars Battlefront II: The Good One) is a classic Star Wars game many fans have fond memories of.But does it hold up?...Well, duh, why would most of the reviews be positive?The gameplay is as smooth as Lando, and tight like a chain around Jabba's neckIt may look it's aged as well as Yoda, but that's to be expected with a game that is over 10 years old (which in game development time may be a couple hundred years).The music is what you would expect, it's Star Wars.The story... Is slightly more entertaining than C3-P0 lecturing you, but there much more for the singleplayer than just the campaign, like galactic conquest and instant action. But really, instant action and the multiplayer are the real meat for the game.It is certainly moddable, which can add even more value than what you get here.All around, it's a solid game, while having aged, is still very enjoyable and relatively cheap to get and pretty much runs buttery smooth if you can get it running, which should not be much of a problem considering we live in the future.Basically: It is literally better than the EA reboot in pretty much everywhere where it really counts. And I'm willing to bet it will still be better than the sequel of the reboot.			"

												This may have been the original battlefield. This follows an over the shoulder FPS type of game where you move towards an objective to complete it. Sounds simple right? Along the way your enemies be it online or in campaign have their own infantry moving towards you, vehicles of all sorts (I'm not a Star Wars fan so forgive me here), and a walker (?) thing you can jettison. I honestly love the depth of being able to fight on a planet or in the orbit of a planet. I'm not a 100% what the heck is going on in the story as I've never watched Star Wars but hey, as a first timer playing the game I can get into it. If you are able to get through the out-dated graphics you're in for a hell of a game. .... oh and one more thing to add a bit of complication to your life. This game does have controller support however you will spend some time key-binding everything manually. The joys of life... I know :).Seriously though if this game is on sale I highly recommend buying it or some storm trooper will smack the yellow off your teeth.

It's so immersive with choosing your on battles or doing the campaign. Fighting on Hoth flying around the big AT AT's and then being able to play as Darth Vader as you go around slaughtering Rebels has never been so amazing.The score from John Williams gives the game even more of that Star Wars feel and in my own opinion I believe this is the best Star Wars game to date.I recommend this game to all Star Wars fans.

												Battlefront II is an absolute essential for any Star Wars fan, and it's been regarded many times as the best third person shooter ever made.  It stands up tall alongside popular series like CoD and Battlefield, and provides a similar experience fine-tuned to anyone who loves glowstick swords and laser beam guns.  The atmosphere is great and nothing captures the feeling of playing a Jedi or a Stormtrooper on the battlefield better.  The vanilla game has plenty of content, but what really makes this title shine is the rich tapestry of mods and extra user-created maps that have been contributed over the past nine years.  That said, it's absolutely necessary to play the game with the Conversion Pack and Battlefront Extreme if you want the best experience possible.  There are also a bunch of great maps and mods to be found in the Community Hub here on Steam as well as on Filefront, so it's worth a look if you find something you like.Don't get too excited yet though, while it's a great game, I can tell you it hasn't aged amazingly.  The classes are noticeably unbalanced and there are glaring glitches present(one involving the infamous issue of the game crashing when Stereo Mix isn't enabled).  The servers aren't densely populated anymore and there are usually only one or two with around 40 players.  Despite minor problems and showing age, the game is still very much worth the $10, even if you only play quick matches on Instant Action.			"

												There are, truly, few games like this one. Games that develop bonds between friends. Games that last for years, and leave memories that are hard to forget. Games where you can spend a whole afternoon enjoying, and feel like not a moment has gone by. This is one of them. Battlefront II if the peak of the whole Star Wars catalogue, and one of the best shooters of 2005. Space fights, lot of maps, four different teams with a lot of variety, heroes, ashort but amazing campaign (that answered a great ""What if""), progression and what not. I could say that this is a must-buy. No matter how old it is, if you are a Star Wars fan (or you loved the first battlefield games), this masterpiece will not let you down. Have some fun, get some friends and enjoy one of the best products this franchise has to offer. PS: If you do get it, get some mods! You will thank me later			"

												This game allows you to live out all of your Star Wars dreams and battles. I've played this game my entire life and it has never gotten old. Tight controls, intelligent AI, breathtaking environments (even more so than EA's Battlefront simply because this game has charm), and incredibly fun SPACE BATTLES! TAKE THAT EA! Honestly though, this game is not only a monument in the Star Wars franchise but a milestone of gaming as well. Even if you are not a huge Star Wars fan, pick up this game. The reviews should speak for themselves.P.S. If you even find yourself bored with the vanilla experience or just wanting something new, download GameRanger and play with others online. Or download one of the hundreds of mods and maps that are still being made and supported for this game!			"

												SWB2 is an alright game, and I love it, but you will always want a little more from it. The game is from 2005, so there can only be so much, but what is there is amazing. The gameplay is good, the story is good, the level design is good. But there just isn't enough. Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend it, but there is not much to go off of. The thing that really makes the game, is mods, which the community loves, and therfore will hold your hand in installing them.In the end, Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a great star wars game, and a good game. But get mods though, if you don't, the experience is going to get dry after about 8 or 9 hours. Oh, and also, you can get multiplayer through 3rd party programs, I go with Game Ranger, great support. Don't worry though, you're not missing out on much if you don't play multiplayer, I never had much fun with it, and all the people who did played it to death, and they are really good. They'll rip out your ♥♥♥, suck on your hemroids like lolly pops, and trust me when I say this, not a pretty picture.Good value for $10, and one of the best Star Wars games ever made, and the best with mods.

With fantasticly large battles, and great campaign, what could anyone ask for! I would suggest looking into modding the game, as it brings a whole new level to the gaming experience.			"

												Fight your own Dunkirk at Kashyyyk, Stand tall Horatius at Kamino, Take the shot in Mos Eisley. This game changes your stratagies and mind set with each map. No two battles are the same. With something for everyone, though outdated graphics-wise, it is still played today. The fact that it is so old a yet such a great game makes me look forward to Battlefront three. A game that will live through generations.			"

												10 years ago...This game had captured the majority of my childhood. First time I got my hands onto this game, almost everyday was powering on my PS2 just to play this classic either solo or with my bros. Massive land-based battles, space battles, hero mode, campaign, and galactic conquest ate up most of my free time. There was no doubt that this was the best Star Wars game ever made, and if not one of the best games I had ever played.3 years ago...A new Battlefront game for the next gen was officially announced. Finally! I could look forward to re-living my childhood, but with some new twists. As more gameplay trailers were released as time went on, my hype kept building up, awaiting to be satisfied on the day of release.2 months ago...I finally got my hands on the new Battlefront. I powered up my PS4 in excitement, hands held firmly on the controller, expecting to satisfy all the built up hype that was stored for 3 years, and entirely focused on what I expected to bring back happy memories. As I pressed start on the title screen, the first thing I was supposed to do was to create an EA account. After 5-10 minutes of restless anticipation, I finally started playing singleplayer. Indeed, I had quite a blast on singleplayer, but there was still loads of hype that needed to be satisfied. That's when I started playing all the modes on multiplayer. Overall, I had an enjoyable experience on this next gen Battlefront, but unfortunately, all the built up hype still wasn't quite satisfied. In fact, this EA remake of the beloved Battlefront I grew up with didn't live up to all the childhood memories that I had been expecting to re-live.Today...Since my good old PS2 had been out of commission for over 2 years, I decided to bring back my childhood (Which EA Battelfront failed to do) by downloading the original masterpiece from Steam. To this day, it still holds it's title as the best Star Wars game ever made.I couldn't recommend this game enough to any Star Wars fan alike, let alone to any gamer in general. If you grew up with this game and are wanting to bring back pleasant memeories, put it in your Steam library now! If you still haven't played this masterpiece yet, please don't hesitate to give it a shot, especially while it's on sale.			"

												Honestly this a great game. I play it with my friend over an online service, and we have a blast. If you have trouble getting it to work, or it crashes, etc. I suggest you look up a tutorial on how to fix it. Multiplayer is my favorite part, but you need to download an external program (gameranger) to do so. Gamespy (the games built in online service) no longer functions. Also go check out the mod community if you start to feel the base game is repetitive.			"

												This has to be one of the best games made. Sure not everything is perfect, But the fact that you can play as a storm trooper and drive a AT-AT just makes up for everything. It's like you're a kid again and watching starwars... Accept now you're that stormtrooper that can't hit a barn door. I rarely play the Mission stuff. The Skirmish is just endless fun, You can play Basicly any battle that was in the movie's.. And don't worry Luca's didn't edit this game.. So It's still awesome. You have a choice between the galactic civil war and the clone wars, Their is a huge variety of maps and gamemodes. You can ever battle is SPACE! Board the enemy cruiser and destroy it from the inside. You can also switch between Third and First person views. I played this so much when I was younger and I can still play it today and have just as much fun. I would recommend this game to any friend who has seen starwars or even hasn't. 10/10 Because you can play as a storm trooper. Oh and yes you can play as Boba Fett, Darth vader etc...			"

												This game is one of the best star wars games I have ever played. You can play as, Chewbacca, Darth Maul, Luke Skywalker, Jango Fett, The Emporor, and MUCH more. You play as a squadron of clone troopers called the ""501st"" in story mode. But, if you have always dreamed what it would be like to ACTUALLY fly a TIE fighter, or, a jedi spaceship, then this is the game for you. Also, if you click on the tab in the game called instant action, then select mos eisley, and set the mode to assault, then you can play as every jedi and sith in the game. But, multiplayer is actually an option in this game, if you download a software called ""Gameranger"" you can play with other players.I hope this review was helpful!			"

												Get ready for nostalgia, and a lot of it.I first played this game as a kid at a couple different friend's houses and fell in love with the game.STORYLINEYou are a member of the 501st at the Battle of Geinosis. From there you are given different missions that start in the Clone Wars. Order 66 is given and you witness the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire and then the fall of the Empire. all of this while still a member of the 501st. The missions are straight forward and objectives are given one right after the other. Some are easier than others but over all, not bad. The only thing I would have changed is some of the space missions, but space missions are optional. Overall 9/10GRAPHICS AND THINGS OF THE LIKENESSGameplay is pretty smooth. I personally never had any issues, but that may be because of my pc. My pc isn't the best but it runs pretty good for me. No lag, fast loading. I have no complaints. Graphics wise, it's not that bad for a 10 year old game. It has that old game feel that makes you nostalgic. A somewhat blocky appearence to the maps but thats to be expected. The characters look very smooth for their time, not extremely blocky but not completely smooth, but like I said; Smooth for their time. Overall 9/10REPLAY VALUEThere are a few different game modes that I'm going to mention. First, and my personal favorite, Galactic Conquest. This is a turn based mode. You can play as any of the sides in the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. You take turns moving your fleet across a small galaxy, conquering the galaxy. You win when you have control of all star systems and elliminated all enemy fleets. This mode can be played 4 times before you start repeating. It's completely random which adds more to the fun. the only thing I don't like about this mode is the number of troops that you have in a fleet. 150 points to win on land and you need to score 180 points in space. The number of points you get for completeing ""objectives"" is a lot for the win point to be 150 or 180. So for that I give 7/10. The other mode is Instant Action. Pretty straight forward. you can make your own map list and when you hit launch, it goes through all the maps in your list. It also allows you to edit some settings like the number of points you need to win, number of troops on land battles, how often special characters show up, and more. This is where I have the most fun because I can make a map list that will be exactly how I want it. Only complaint is you can't play both Clone Wars and Galactic Civil War on all maps. Some maps are exclusive to one era. for that 8/10. Overall for replay value I would give 8/10			"

												I promise you that there is no game like this one the market today. This has been one of my favorite games my whole life I would play it on the PS2 for hours with my brother and 15 years later its still my favorite game. Not to mention if you like modding games this game has some great mods.			"

-Quick Review-Star Wars Battlefront II was a first/third person shooter released to the PlayStation2, Xbox, and PC November 1, 2005 (Reference, Steam Store). The reason I state this is because ""prepare yourself for PS2 and Xbox Generation Graphics.The game plays like a capture the flag, base control, skirmish first/third person shooter game. Recently multiplayer was lost because of GameSpy's shut down, however there are ways within the community to bring back the multiplayer features. (check out the forums, Steam or Reddit) -Detailed breakdown review-Story:  In the game you can play part of the story by playing Campaign Mode, ""A shadow looms over the Republic. The Clone Wars have torn a rift across the Galaxy, its populace weak in allegiance and resolve."" Basically you play the game as a member of the 501st Legion, Get used to hearing that, the clones will be sure to remind you every time you have a cut screen.You play from the Geonosis Attack, (seen in Star Wars episode 2), fight on Kashyyyk, Corescant Jedi Temple, Kamino, The Death Star Hoth, and a number of other locations seen in the Star Wars universe.(Having a star wars nerd moment, ignore if you don't care about the Expanded star wars universe)I do need to highlight a problem with the lore, the Clones received genetic alterations that made them age much faster than usual human beings, twice as fast to be precise. A clone surviving from the battle on Geonosis would most likely die of old age before ever reaching Hoth.Geonosis took place 22 BBY, Hoth 3 ABY, Most of the clones where in their 20's and 30's at the battle of Geonosis, so we're talking 60 to 70 year old cone troopers. But I digress, if you find this type of lore interesting I recommend checking out the Republic Commando books, I've read a great deal from them, I enjoy the Mandalorian back-story to the clone troopers.(End of Expanded Universe Rant)Game Play: The game controls like a standard first/third person shooter, the reason I refer to it as first/third is that you can change which mode you're playing with the options, I really liked playing in first person because the assault rifles would have scopes then. But to be honest third is probably a better way to play (you can see more).I've never played any other Battlefront games but I assume they all have very similar controls, in this one you can jump, roll, crouch, and sprint. Sprinting and rolling require stamina to use. Each class has its own different set of abilities, skills, and tactics.There are two categories: Land classes and space classes. You can have space battles in this game. I'll stick to the land classes to give an idea of the diversity in classes: Trooper, Heavy Weapons, Sniper, Engineer, Clone commander (special class 1), Jet trooper (special class 2). the special classes change based on which faction you're playing as, you can play as the Republic, CIS, Empire, or Rebel Alliance. There are also heroes in the game, so you can get in on some awesome lightsaber massacre action.In addition to classes, there are various game modes, you can play a command and conquer style game called ""conquest"" you can play through the campaign, you can simple play a sequence of matches against NPC's set to regular or elite difficulty (I generally just played offline matches against npc's). Achievements: There are no steam achievements for this game. Price: Star Wars Battlefront II $9.99, I recommend waiting for a sale, this is a very old game, and you can take your time on waiting for a great sale. I believe I purchased my copy at 75-90% off.The number of hours shown on steam is a little bit deceptive, I might only have 15 hours at this point, but I first played this game on the Playstation2, I loved it enough to buy it on steam, but it wouldn't load on my computer until I installed Windows7. So I've easily spent double that time or more.  Additionally I do intend to play it more, it's one of those games where it's nostalgic value to me is high. Conclusion: Remember this is an older game, wait for a sale, probably should be a star wars fan to enjoy it, multiplayer requires downloading third party software or you can just play against npc's. If you don't have a problem with anything I've listed, suit up trooper, the Battle awaits you! I recommend this game.			"

												I had this game back when I was a kid on Xbox, I had alot of fun playing it back then. I recently got this game on PC, still as fun as I remember it(especially with mods). I always found this game fun but the second one was never as challenging as the original. Although again with the mods it has proven to be way more challenging for me. Despite how old this game is, it still proves to be entertaining.in case it's not obvious, this is my first review on here. So sorry if this review isn't the best or most detailed.			"

												Battlefront 2 is a great tactical 1st/3rd person shooter. Similar to the original, the objective is to capture command posts and eliminate the enemy. The space battles are impressive and there is a decent selection of ships to choose from. Like most Star Wars games the music and sound fx are brilliant, the graphics are still impressive despite being released 10 years ago. You can choose from four classes including infantry and sniper, including special hero characters like Luke,Vadar, Windu etc. One of the best maps is Hoth, where you can defend the base against the galactic empire and use snowspeeders to take down AT-AT's. Overall a great tactical game with new maps and options that rivals the original. 84%			"

												Literally the best game you could ever buy, I dont understand why this isnt the best seller on Steam every week. People need to get this game before it goes back up to its original price of £49.99, the game has no flaws and I am unable to find even one thing wrong with it, I am still shocked by the fact that this game hasnt won every gaming award out there. The graphics are easily 10/10, Battlefield and Crysis on the highest graphics have nothing on this beast. The sound is something out of this planet, the beautifully orchestrated music and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic sound effects are truely amazing 10/10. The final and greatest thing about this game is the fact that the voice acting is truly in a league of its own, all voices are perfectly alligned with the characters lips and the original voice actors are all used for there characters. Truly a perfect and pure game, if you dont own such a masterpiece then you are easily brain dead or inbred.			"

												Campaign:Rage-quit modeAI is terribleB/c of that you are always outnumberedAI dont fight each other as much despite being face to face with each other, instead they just stand there*Hoth: The Finest Hour* mission is the breaking point and you can see all these problems before you.Also, the enemy AI suck at aiming but this mission, they target you and only youInstant Action:Play this mode NOT campaign.Still same crappy AI, better aim in this mode IDK howAI confront each other betterAgain, you feel outnumbered and have to put more than you were already putting b/c it's the only way the game can ""challenge"" youHero vs. Villains mode is fun BUT Heroes will mostly win, unless you just go Spin-to-win(Darth Maul) when you're playing as  on the Villains side, and it will be very close b/c, again, your friendly bots just suck donkey balls.Despite the broken AI, I would still recommend this. This game is one of those nostalgic games from the 2000s and the fact that it is a ""Star Wars"" game makes it really great. I'll give it a rating: 7.5/10.			"

This game is still AWSOME!From the ease of the controlls to the range of classes, it builds up to a very enjoyable game that will only set the bar high for the third Battlefront that is hopefully coming out in connection with the new films.

												This game is amazing.

This is once again a minor complaint, since controls can be changed, and plugging in an X-Box or Steam controller can fix this.Overview: The game is beautiful, vehicle combat is amazing, and a vast amount of heroes and maps make this game from ten years ago better than the one we have today. This game is a definite buy. If there's a sale, snag this game, because it's perfect for any Star Wars fan.  Rating: 9.5/10			"

(If only Star Wars Battlefront I was available on  steam...)Though, it doesn't matter actually. Because, I'm satisfied and happy. I can relive my childhood with this masterpiece and have an absuloute BLAST with this game! ♥♥♥♥-ton of variety of maps, great singleplayer campaign, Instant Action and my favourite, Galactic Conquest. Multiplayer or not. Instant Action, Galactic Conquest and singleplayer campaign are what captures the soul and heart of Star Wars Battlefront. Agree or disagree. xDD If you are a die-hard Star Wars-fan, you get that dosh and buy this masterpiece, NOW!!Edit: I reset my computer to make The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim work properly, and now I can't play neither The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim nor Star Wars Battlefront II. 'Tis sad, but, hey: Both of these games are old, so it is expected. I don't blame Valve or Steam. I blame Microsoft's ♥♥♥♥♥ operative system that is Windows 10. I still recommend this game, 'tis an oldie, but goldie. Cheers. <3			"

												Pros:- Good-looking- Tight controls- Optional 1st or 3rd person view- Very fun game play- Original Star Wars soundtrack- Epic fights on huge fronts- Galactic Conquest- Instant action playlistsCons:- No multiplayer support* (uses gamespy)- Campaign lacks replayability- No steam achievements*There are 3rd-party applications which can allow multiplayer. I personally use GameRanger, which works great.SummaryThis game is a marvelous experience. The battles are massive, so you never feel like you're carrying your team when you put effort into a battle. Strategy and non-strategy are both viable ways of winning a game. It is unfortunate that it uses gamespy, however, because the game is no longer supported since it shut down. Achievements would provide some much-needed replay ability. Overall, though, one of the best games in my library by a long shot.			"

With up to 124 people per team on Hoth,Genosis and Kashyyk the game is amust buy. The modding community if amazing with different maps, skins, classes and total conversion mods!  The vanilla game features a wide array of maps from the star wars movies and 6 different classes per team. People can also play as their favouroite heroes and villains from the movies like Anakin, Chewbacca, Darth Vader and General Griveous. The game is amazing and is worth every penny due to the massive battles and vehicles. 10/10			"

												I was very worried that my childhood memory was playing with me as I was trying to remember how good this game was, but when I booted it up and made a play list of my favorite maps (according to my memory) and when I got in, it was the most amazing feeling I have ever had as I felt like a child again. The moment of WTF was in Hoth with 128 bots on each team and me on a hill watching the carnage and destruction of the battlefield will stick into my memory forever.If you are a big Star Wars fan or you like huge battles, get this god dam game because you will not regret it. I promise!10/10			"

												Well you knew I was gonna say this kicks the crap out of Dice and EA's current offering and I shall explain exactly why. *Space battles*Integrated vehicles in certain on-planet stages*A story mode featuring an imperial force named after the world's largest Star Wars cosplay organization*Aside from that a rather neat alternate campaign mode where you can pick any side you like from any of the two eras*MOS EISLEY ASSAULT*Better modability so you can have Hero Assault mode all day erry day errywhere*The fact that Pandemic remembered Ki-Adi Mundi and Adi Gallia enough to make them playable*It plays like a classic run and gun shooter with some strategy mixed in rather than Battlefield in Space With a Star Wars Skin*Hoth's XL mode on the PC*Space combat is still funI mean everyone else said it but the hell with it, I love this game and you oughta pick it up.

												What can I say about Battlefront? This game was a part of my childhood, and even if it wasn't, even if i wasn't a huge Star Wars nerd, I'd still love this classic game.It comes with memorable maps, great gamemodes, and a very enjoyable game overall.If any of you are Star Wars fans, or even just fans of the class based shooter, this game is a must have.UPDATE: I've got a LOT more to say about this game.The game types are absolutely fantastic. They have Multiplayer, which is self explanatory, yet still awesome. They have Galactic Conquest, a single-player conquest game in which you try to conquer star systems on memorable planets such as Kamino and Kashyyyk.The maps are memorable and immersive as hell. Especially the space maps. They have many different maps such as Geonosis, Mustufar, Mygeeto, Yavin 4, and even the Death Star and Mos Eisely, Tatooine.My god, I'd like to say more about this amazing game, but it's almost midnight where I am and I'm tired.I absolutely love this game and if you decide to buy it (WHICH YOU SHOULD), I hope you love it too!

												After getting this game to work properly for my windows 8 system. This game brings back memories of playing this on the PS2 or Xbox (whatever console you owned)It is Star Wars Battlefront II, part of the amazing Star Wars Battlefront series. Everything that you remember is in this game.Don't play with a mouse and keyboard. It's better to get a game pad since the space combat will be clunky for Mouse and keyboard users. On game pad it works great.The one issue i have with this game is one-sided the AI is. It's either strong or weak. there is no balance, especailly the Jedi during Story Mission ""Knightfall""I will recommend this game for star wars fans and any gamer in general.There is no multiplayer, just an FYI			"

												In my opinion this is the BEST shooter classic and one of the best star wars games ever made. Do not get fooled by my steam playtime of this classic, I owned the disc version before and gathered countless of fun hours of gameplay, and I lost the disc at the end of last year or so. OK, but now let's get into the game! The graphics are not amazing but they are perfect for this game, but if you want you can get graphic upgrade mods. The physics are quite weird but THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.there are many maps that are fun to play on. You can play as the following factions: Galctic Republic, CIS, Rebel alliance and the Galactic Empire. There is even a campaign!. The game is also easy to mod. The multiplayer is sadly shutdown, but there are mods or so that bring back the action of the multiplayer.It is worth the money in every aspect, I recommend this game to every shooter and Star Wars lover!

Use the Rebels, Droids, Republic or even the Empire and fight your way to victory in the epic conquest for the whole galaxy. Space battles also adds up to more entertainment. Control most, if not all of the Sith and Jedi from the franchise as a Hero to add advantages to your team. The storyline is great as well ! Definetely a great classic game to add to your library !

												Simply a classic. One of the best FPS I have ever played and why you may ask? Well let me explain, let's start with the gameplay. Just change some of the key bindings and it plays perfectly, simplistic but with enough depth and fun that it keeps you wanting to play more, no significant problems in terms of the controls and gameplay. Being a star wars game it has all of the sights and sounds that any fan would come to expect and more. This game has such attention to detail with looks and especially sound deign, enough to sends shivers down every star warsa fan's neck. Multiple game modes including a multiplayer (which I am yet to try) these game modes offer varied experiences one of which even has stratetic turn based gameplay which is a nice change of pace. Overall, I would recommend this to EVERY star wars fan and ANYONE looking for an FPS which focuses on having fun, addictive gameplay. 9/10 it's a classic for a reason.			"

Positives:This and Battlefront 1 are two of the main reasons I still own my original Xbox.The ground battles are amazingly easy to learn and play as well as ridiculously fun to get killing spreas on, they feel more like actual battles then any other game I've played (including the Battlefield series). The space battles are fun but hard as well just being beautiful even with out dated graphics and they feel like a genuine space simulator and not a stupid rail shooter. Last but not least; the Jedi battles. Never in my life have I had this much fun with a lightsaber; not as a kid with toy, not as a teen with other Star Wars games and not with any other sword battle game; EVER! Whether you're in a normal ground battle literally ripping though squad after squad of droids or in the Heroes Vs Villians mode on Mos Eisley. It is in everyway the just stupid, dumb, amazing fun!Negatives:There are only a couple reasons why this game is not as amazing (and perfect) as it's predicessor; one is the squad commands being missing for no reason and the other is the maps are not nearly as good as the original.Final verdict:9.5/10 Amazing game, why have you not bought it yet?

												This is a great game and the price is well earned. Now the game is solid with some glitchs with the AI here and there. Curse that corner in Naboo. So everything is good so I am going to just list the bad things. -AI on normal never enter your hanger (In space)-In Galatic Conquest Naboo Is apparently the birthplace of god and every time i play they try to take it over-Controls at first are wonky but some binding and fixed.-(Personal rant) So in jabba's palace there are the gonggorians (I think I spelled that right) guards. They are completely Over Powered. They Kill your hero in 2 hits and normal troops are brought down to a sliver from one hit.-Hunt is kinda one sided with (Example) The Ewoks never even getting close to killing off the empire snipers. (Other examples) Jawas and tuskens and the....... I thought I had something going but what ever team you join will win mostly (Execept Ewoks and tuskens they will lose everytime unless you are jesus). REMEMBER EVERYTHING ELSE IS GREAT.			"

Positives:This and Battlefront 1 are two of the main reasons I still own my original Xbox.The ground battles are amazingly easy to learn and play as well as ridiculously fun to get killing spreas on, they feel more like actual battles then any other game I've played (including the Battlefield series). The space battles are fun but hard as well just being beautiful even with out dated graphics and they feel like a genuine space simulator and not a stupid rail shooter. Last but not least; the Jedi battles. Never in my life have I had this much fun with a lightsaber; not as a kid with toy, not as a teen with other Star Wars games and not with any other sword battle game; EVER! Whether you're in a normal ground battle literally ripping though squad after squad of droids or in the Heroes Vs Villians mode on Mos Eisley. It is in everyway the just stupid, dumb, amazing fun!Negatives:There are only a couple reasons why this game is not as amazing (and perfect) as it's predicessor; one is the squad commands being missing for no reason and the other is the maps are not nearly as good as the original.Final verdict:9.5/10 Amazing game, why have you not bought it yet?

SWBF2 is one of, if not the last great Star Wars game (at least until the new Battlefront-fingers crossed), and that's as-is. Get this game and download the Conversion Pack and Battlefront Extreme, and you'll have arguably the greatest Star Wars game ever.EDIT: The new ""Battlefront"" by DICE sucks. Get this, the two mods I mentioned above and download Gameranger to be able to play this online again. You'll get so much more enjoyment out of this than DICE's disgrace that isn't worthy of the Battlefront title.			"

												So, Star Wars: Battlefront II is now a decade old.  Is it worth $10?  Yeah, I'd say so.  The graphics look good for 10 years ago.  The gameplay itself is fairly arcadey and simplistic (there are no unlocks, really), but the maps are fun to play.  On the whole, I find it to be an enjoyable casual shooter for offline play, particularly in the Galactic Conquest mode.  Also of note, here are things this ten-year-old version of Battlefront has that the new EA/DICE version does not:- A $10 price tag (less if you get it on sale).- An actual space mode, which also lets you attempt to board and sabotage the enemy capital ship.- Vehicles that let more than one player ride in them.- Spawn points that you can select, instead of randomly appearing on the battlefield.- More maps per game mode.- Clone Wars Era troopers and maps.- Soldier classes with different specific abilities.- Single-player offline mode against (admittedly rather dim) bots, where you can play pretty much the full version of the game.- A dedicated single-player campaign (although, really, it's just the same maps from multiplayer, with you playing as a member of the 501st with the odd cutscene here and there).So, yeah, I'd say this is well worth your money if you just want a casual shoot-em-up to screw around with here and there.  Is it an amazing game to stand the test of time and be lauded for generations to come?  Nah, not really.  It's fun, but it's simple.  On the other hand, that's kind of the appeal.			"

												This game is so much fun. Sadly GameSpy who hosted the online servers are out of business however, there's a program called GameRanger which hosts servers in a lot of games so you wont miss out on online multiplayer. But there is always offline multiplayer with bots. Also a good deal of mods for anyone who wants to 'enhance' their experience			"

												Hard to believe this game is 10 years old and yet I'm still having just as much fun as I did when it first came out. Sure it's an older game and the graphics aren't next gen, but that doesn't mean it isn't a blast to play.With all the mods there are to dowload this game offers hours of gameplay. Play it with a friend and you guys will have a blast laughing at the stupid AI as they run off clifs or shoot at dead bodies while getting shot at, not saying the AI has bad programing but they tend to be dumb sometimes.You'll have tons of fun with it.

												For Star Wars fans out there, this is the game you wanna get. At first the game is boring and confusing but once you get the hang of it and get on multiplayer its hella fun. I would highly recommend this game even though the graphics are crappy the gameplay is waht counts the most.			"

												Yes, I know that the description says you can't play online. Well, acutally, you can. GameRanger allows you to play most of the old GameSpy games that no longer have online capabilities. However, I will say that GameRanger doesn't have the best connection. But I still have a blast with my friends even with occasional lag. Also, this game is much better than any fps or tps.

												Did somebody forget to list a recording device as a minimum system requirement? 'coz this game would crash to black screen if all devices are disabled. At least enable Stereo Mix or What U Hear or a microphone device plugged in or onboard mic enabled. AMD Radeon users should disable AA in graphic option if you're using the latest drivers to avoid screen flickering. You can still force enable AA in Catalyst Control Centre or similar app.TL;DRLike a mini Star Citizen. Runs as smooth as butter on AMD Radeon HD6770m @720p maxed out. Flight control works with mouse almost as good as joystick.http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x49311q_battlefrontii-04-campaign-ch-2-a-desperate-rescue_videogamesBetter than EA Battlefront as this has single player campaign and cost much less. EA has a tendency to remove what works and producing half baked products instead of expanding on proven features by adding more features. So they add new features while removing time tested old ones.Battlefront II is very similar to other sci-fi games like Wing Commander 1 thru 5, Descent Freespace 1 & 2, Tachyon: The Fringe and Mechwarrior 1 thru 4 in that it is linear and mission based. Nothing wrong with that as long as the missions are well designed with rich cut-scenes and talented voice acting. Hence it is not open world free roaming like Privateer 1 & 2, Freelancer or X series 1 to 4 or more recent ones like Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen.However it does one thing which all the other games didn't with the exception of Star Citizen which still is not fully realized, seamless flight and combat from one carrier to another which is probably a world's first during its time. You can land and board enemy carrier and continue fighting on foot inside it. In other words, no artificial limits to playable game areas although the internal areas of capital ship are not complex as to require a considerable amount of time to explore.I've never played this game before till today and i'm pleasantly suprised at it's varied gameplay especially the use of jetpack unit to enable very high jumps. Space combat is very satisfying in the sense that it's smooth and fast with enormous capital ships to fly around and gawk at. There is nothing not to like about this game, certainly no bugs so far, unless we're talking about the flying drones or giant alien insects that look like a cross between praying mantis and spider.Highly recommended 9/10, would be 10/10 if it has free roam open world feature.

Which is pretty dang fine.Most servers are being made and removed quickly, so find the one with a link as the name and owns two servers (that'll be the one with a stable connection)Anyway about the entertaining part.Fun as hell. I just finished the Star Wars series, and when I saw this in the Steam Winter Sale, I knew I had to get it.So worh $5, more than you can imagine.What else can I say? I have nothing to say..

STAR WARS™ Battlefront™ II is an intense first- and third-person shooter, developed by Pandemic Studios and released in 2005. A highly successful title due to a more narrative-focused approach, the ability to take part in battles on some of the films' most iconic locations has secured it's popularity and replay value since release, with a passionate modding community to boot.Providing much-needed wish fulfilment and satisfaction for both Star Wars fans and gamers alike, the variety on offer here is substantial. The campaign itself takes place over both of the default eras, in which you assume the role of one of the class-types of the legendary 501st during the rise of the Empire. Most missions involve a set of objectives that introduce the player to the other game modes provided, such as Conquest, CTF, Assault or Hunt. Most of these modes are a standard affair for the shooter genre but space battles are also available. There's a fairly standard roster and loadout options at first, as well as the ability to unlock two higher tier classes upon exceeding a predetermined amount of points. However, the most fascinating addition to the series is the ability to unlock characters - both friend and foe - from the films and duel it out with your favourite heroes. The lightsaber gameplay is among the best the Star Wars IP is yet to see; Pandemic have absolutely nailed the feel of the various strengths and styles of the characters on offer. Though the game features some surprisingly complex A.I. enemies and teammates, it is admittedly prone to frustrating and occasionally amusing quirks. The level of difficulty and challenge is also minimal once you get the hang of it. Outside of the campaign, the options for Instant Action and Galactic Conquest will undoubtedly please many with the ability to setup custom battles and campaigns but the true values comes from the tonne of mods available. Since the death of the Gamespy servers, unofficial clients have assumed control of the community's ongoing interest but playing on your own is just as good as it is with others. From Conquest matches that run down to the wire to extremely intense shootouts down tightly-packed corridors; one-on-one duels with lightsabers to sprawling dogfights in space, this is one of the best shooters to appear in recent years and a perfect example of both a Star Wars game and a shooter done right. Pros Near perfect lightsaber combat. Impressive visuals with often stunning lighting and effects. Top-notch shooting mechanics that rival even more recent iterations and spiritual successors. John Williams' score and the classic sound design. Superb modding community and replay value. Controller support. Great offline/bot gameplay.Cons Partially dead and elitist multiplayer/clan community. Difficulty is essentially negated after a while. Clunky vehicle controls and navigation. No Steam achievements or trading cards, if you're into that sort of thing.Final Thoughts: Whether or not you're a fan of the Star Wars universe, Battlefront™ II has what much of the shooter genre has forgotten and all the makings of a good time. Intense and extremely enjoyable sci-fi action, fans will be right at home here, as will newcomers. It is not perfect, but well worth a look.Rating: 9/10			"

If you like Battlefield (mostly the old ones, like 2 or 2142) you will enjoy the hell out of this game.It's basically Battlefield but in the Star Wars universe. There are classes, vehicles, big maps... space fights.I am not a guy who can write good reviews, so I can only say:buy it pls			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME DO NOT BUY THIS GAME DO NOT BUY THIS GAME DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.. READ WHAT I HAVE SAID.. THE FULL REVIEW. This game is great, this game was my childhood on not only the PS2, but also the PC and 1 more console i believe.The game used to offer hours of fun, sadly though, As of May 31, 2014, online functionality, including network multiplayer and wireless chat have been discontinued for this game. This sadly restricts the game to only single player campaign. The campaign is very fun, but it isnt the same without the multiplayer. There is no other game like it, hopefully one day we can get some servers going for this game again. R.I.P Star Wars Battlefront 2. You will be rememberd in gaming history for years to come.			"

												I used to play Battlefront 2 all the time back in the day, this game is one of (If not, the best) Star Wars games of all time. If you played the most recent EA Battlefront and were disapointed, i'd recommend Battlefront 2 as it has everything that you probably wanted out of the EA Battlefront, but with less graphics.Also, if you want to play the multiplayer, you'll have to install GameRanger, there are usually atleast a 100 or so players at a time, so you should be good to go.

												I first appear to have a few hours, but this is only my Steam version; I have many more hours on my other versions.I'm not going to log anymore hours on Steam, since DRM-free is the way to go with GOG, and because this will just serve as my GameRanger version. For the review:THE GAME'S AMAZING. Best. Star Wars. Game. Ever. Battlefront III is pathetic. Want those graphics in the much better game, this? There's mods.WARNING: MORE CAPITAL LETTERS TO GAIN YOUR ATTENTION: This game has trouble running on newer OSes, such as Windows 7.  Some users don't have audio, and I don't know how to fix that, the discussions should have you a fix.  Most of you want to be able to play your newly bought game, Battlefront II. To fix this problem, go to:Control Panel > Sound > Recording > Right click, select ""Show disabled devices"" > Enable ""Stereo Mix""For some reason,  that fixes the game.  Now you can play it.  You can also play it in glorius 1080p60FPS. For some reason, the main menu is still 600x800 or something like that. Don't worry, it goes to 1080p when in game (just change the options).For more than compatiblilty, and base graphics, this game is better than Battlefront III in every way. Fine, online isn't great, but the game's 10+ years old. There's many Jedi in the game, when III has two. You can technically browse servers, but online is limited for a 10+-year-old game, where in III you can't. You're able to get in a ship, fly it towards the enemies, get out, and continue fighting. III just has a screenwipe to get in the ship (I'm unsure of how you get out).The game is intense fun. Shooting wookies in the face, blowing up clone/stormtroopers high into the sky has never been so fun. Force Pushing someone off the edge into the bottomless pit of doom (or just ""off the map"") to save yourself the effort of lightsabering them hasn't been so . . . funny, creative, or nice.  I HIGHLY recommend you get this game.  I  HIGHLY recommend this. Many others do too. Also, don't give me hate for saying Battlefront III is a bad game. It's a bad game. This is so much better.128v128 is awesome. 20v20 isn't as cool.			"

												Alright, my hours aren't very much on PC, but if my PS2 hours showed, it would be in the hundreds. This was (and still always will be) my favorite game of all time. This was my weekend with friends, this was my down time after school, this was the only game I would play for hours on end.PROS:-Amazing gameplay for an older game with large battles and a great design.-Many well balanced classes to chose from (plus many more Hero/Villain characters).-Large, well designed maps.-Various gamemodes for a different experience every time (e.g. Hunt, CTF, Conquest, Assault, etc).-Great vehicular combat and variety.CONS:-Graphics are old (but really who cares?)-AI is a little stupid at times-EWOKS! DARN YOU AND YOUR ROCKS!This game I recommend for anyone looking for a good Star Wars battle experience.11/10			"

You choose where you fight, including the shores of Kashyyyk, the firey lakes of Mustafar, the deserted fields of Geonosis, the royal halls of Coruscant, or even fly the X-Wing through orbit of Hoth. (Pretty much every planet in Star Wars you can think of, then add about 7 varied space battles)  You have the reigns of the entire Star Wars universe! Even hook up to some LAN with your favorite buddy, or some online with your friends. (Caution: Multiplayer is very hard to setup, even LAN) 10/10 Would chewbacca again			"

												     I absolutely LOVE this game!  I used to play it on the xbox back in high school so I was vey excited to see it on Steam!  I really like how it is compatable with a game controller (I sometimes use a wired xbox 360 controller), but the default keyboard/mouse controls are pretty basic.  Gameplay is just as I remember and it still feels like old times.  Graphics are somewhat lacking since it is an old game, but the gameplay makes it almost unoticable.  I highly recommend this game!

												READ THIS REVIEW IF HESITANT ON BUYING THIS GAME! If you are a huge Star Wars fan then you need to buy this game! I played this game on the Playstation 2 when it came out and it was part of my childhood. I was never really dissapointed with this game, the Campaign was very enjoyable (and a bit challenging at times) but a little short and the maps are very fun to play on and has huge variety (From the snowy landscape of Hoth to the murky Swaps of Dagobah). My favorite is the Galactic conquest mode where you have to capture planets to win and each of the planets are worth a certain amount of points and there is also Instant action which is quick matches. I don't know why people are complaining about the online multiplayer, yes it was run by GAMESPY, and yes they did shutdown; but there is still DEDICATED SERVERS that you can go and play on if you want multiplayer action, and you can still HOST games and have friends join your server; you can also use Gameranger and join through there as well. The space combat is just how i remembered it fun and very unique in there being different ways to approach and destroy your opponent's ship. This game is a masterpiece of its time and deserves to be in your game library (hopefully with hours played on it :] ) and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!			"

												They say no game is perfect but this game is perfection. I was nervous if this would run on my old PC, well it did run AND on highest graphics setting. There is two eras, the galatic civil war and the cloner wars, there are loads of heroes also, each map has a hero for each side that you can become. Classes are great because they are nicely balanced. You can use programs like Gameranger to play online too. If you don't want to download Gameranger you can play plenty of offline modes including space battles where you attack the enemy capitol ship! Galatic Conquest is flawless in my opinion and so is the campaign. If you love modern graphics that is the only downside. There is no DLC you can buy, it's all there at the start. I give it 9.5/10, only thing that stops it from being a 10 is that sometimes Galatic Conquest can be annoying.			"

												This game is perfect for anyone who fondly remembers playing it when it first came out. It is remembered as being really fun and it still is. The graphics have not aged well i will say that but graphics have never been a defining factor in a game or me. I say that the combat holds up very well today and would be plenty of fun for any Star Wars fan. The only issue is there aren' too many servers still up but you can definitely still have a fun experience online. I would definitely remember this even if I may be blinded by nostalgia.			"

It's a great community that has brought online life to many games that have discontinued servers. I just checked this out and it does in fact work. Just make sure to launch the first time via steam and set the game up. Thereafter you can launch directly from the game ranger app and enjoy online mayhem.This is great!

When I bought the game I didn't relize that the company that supported online had shut down so online mode was too. I researched online and found I few companies that could support it, none of them worked for me. I sometimes play campaign, but it's just not the same as online. I don't regret buying this game, and I still hope that I can find a company that will suport online, but until then I'll stick with campaign.			"

Within that game although also include the option to make it look like the old game for bad computers I guess.Campgain / Honestly just pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.Multiplayer / Not really directed toward the game, but I don't think anyone plays multiplayer or this game anymore. -- [[SEE EDIT]]Bot AI / I swear to god if I see 1 rebel amongst 20 Imperials and none of the Imperials shoot at the 1 rebel one more time. I'm gonna give up lol.Overall -Great game, really liked it since I started playing it on PS2 7~ years back only just realised how ♥♥♥♥ the graphics are.EDIT - I did some research and I found ""Gameranger"" which you can play Battlefront multiplay on. Going to be awesome playing with my friends :)			"

												There isn't much to say, just... Well, this game beats most new games.Not only is this just plain old fun, but the glitches are halerious! Time it right and you can land your star fighter (or another ship) through the force field... Then jump out and walk aroun ON TOP OF YOUR SHIP!!!Another time I was stuck on the final mission; Hoth. It was easy enough getting to the enemy hanger but taking it was impossible. I worked out two ways of taking it: 1. Run in, steal a rebel snow speader, fly out, turn around, fly in and let loose the blasters! 2. A bit more buggy but still a good technique. I was trying to use my walker (At-Rt, I believe) to gun through the doorway because it was about a centimeter to big... But when you sprint with it, your head bobs down low enough to slip through! Once again, I let loose my blasters.10 years of games and this is still one of the best.			"

So glad I found this game on steam, told my buddies about it and we still play even ten years later. When a game doesn't get boring for 10 years straight you know it's worth the money.

												Star Wars Battlefront 2 is one of the best games out there. Even better that the first one. It adds up more vehicles, classes and you can also play as a Hero (Jedi, Sith, Bounty Hunter etc.)! The graphics are amazing considering the time that the game came out. I love this game so much, I still have and play the PS2, XBOX and PSP versions of the game.Having a huge variety of maps, the fun never ends, you can test your skills in instant action with four game modes (conques, ctf, heroes vs villians and assault),then you can conquer the galaxy in Galactic Conquest mode choosing from four (4) factions (Rebels vs Empire and CIS vs Republic). The maps are amazing, really big, it's a war game afterall. You also have the ability to play space battles, something that the first game lacked (and the newest one...), your objective is to destroy the enemy capital ship!But no, that's not all. Download mods and or maps (prefered) in which you play space to ground on the maps the game already has or new maps that fans made!People still play the game online so it's not dead! This is hands down one of the best, if not the best Star Wars game!There are some glitches but not game breaking. Some characters are over-powered but they can be defeated if you know how to play well of course! The developers did a great job, but there are some stuff they could have added such as space to ground battles and the ability to escape enemy capital ships with an escape pod just like Elite Squadron.Other than that Star Wars Battlefront 2 is an amazing game and you should have it in your game library!9/10			"

												Go back to a time when you were given a full game with all of the content you could ever want with Battlefront 2. Before you blow 120 dollars on EA's Battlefront, try spending 10 for a game with double the content and 10 years of mods to choose from.9.5/10			"

												I remember playing this game every day when I was a kid on my PS2, this game is one of the best star wars game ever made. Great big battles with many different units to choose from out of 4 armies or more if you decide to mod the game. Great story in which you learn more about the soldiers and a fun multiplayer with many game modes including conquest and capture the flag.  8/10  "

												I remember playing this with my best friends on the PS2 on a dino TV with a 20 in screen. I made so many memories with this game and it made me very happy that it's on Steam. It makes me even happier that I can mod it to add even more content to the game! For the 9+ years I've been playing this I still can't get enoughof it! I mean I still go back on my old XBox and play the original Battlefront which I also can't get enough of. #originalstarwarsbattlefrontonsteam #greenlightitPros: -great game for its time, still great imo-great 501st storyline-easily moddable-decent PC port-plenty of vanilla maps that are mostly decentCons:-AI can be pretty retar-ded especially on maps modded in but that because of age and it does better than a lot of games nowadays-Not recommened to put settings on ultra because either way textures will be blocky at certain times no matter what(recommend medium to low)-lightsaber fighting wont be what you think it is-it's very easy to die as a hero, any hero #gitgudm8Must play for people who like Star Wars, large scale battles(you can mod it to go as high as you want), or nostalgia.

The graphics have not aged well i will say that but graphics have never been a defining factor in a game or me. I say that the combat holds up very well today and would be plenty of fun for any Star Wars fan. The only issue is there aren' too many servers still up but you can definitely still have a fun experience online. I would definitely remember this even if I may be blinded by nostalgia.			"

This game is a oldy, but if you're into the star wars trilogy and would want to feel how it is to play as a average troop, specialized vehicle, or even play as a jedi this game is for you. It is filled with decent sized map battles, space battles, and multiple ways to play each map.

The best thing about is you get to play the Jedi, good and bad side, but you also get to play the Clones, CIS and many more people against war in 3RD person view or FP view with turrets and with many Big Machines like the AT-AT you get to have so much fun on the BattleFront. its worth a big play and with 3 different modes to chose and countless hours of blasting fun with friends and of course by your self, why wouldn't you get this excellent master piece of a game 10/10If you want to watch a Let's Play! you can watch it here

If you unlock the space guy dlc you can even play as star wars himself. You can be WALLe space robots or white man clone guys its kinda racist but if you are good at COD and you get enough 420 quicksopes then you can be a jredi or a srith lightsaber man and kill all the bad ppl.

												A great FPS from my childhood. Star wars Battlefront II has a great campagain leading you throught the clone wars and into the civil war as a trooper of the 501st squad. After you finish  this campagain, you got yourself even more to play! Multiplayer, instant action, and my favorite of all; Galaxy conquest. In galaxy conquest you choose which faction you will be: Republic, CIS, Rebels or the Empire. You start out with the first basic class, and after wins and conquests of planets you buy bonuses and more classes! The great thing about this gmaemode is that it never gets old! Wheter you board an enemy ship, roll around as a droideka, give headshots to those clone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as a assassin droid, you'll have loads of fun with this game!			"

												This game came out during a really great time for Star Wars games.  It was surrounded by Jedi Outcast, Jedi Academy, Battlefront 1, Empire at War, Revenge of the Sith video game, The Sith Lords (KotOR2), Republic Commando, Star Wars Galaxies Total Experience, Clone Campaigns, etc.  And unfortunately, after 2006 there were very little Star Wars games that were any good.  So this game, to me, is considered one of the great ones of the pinacle of Star Wars gaming.The classes are well balanced.  The special troops have very different styles of play, but are not op.  The Clone Commander might have a machien gun with unlimited bullets, but it has no grenades, and is good only for close up troop destruction.  The droideka is pretty awesome, but it has a completely different playstyle as well.You have to get quite a bit of shots off the kill someone.  Even vehicles cannot one shot you.  The only one shots in the game are lightsabers and the sniper rifle head shots.  As it gets harder it definitely does get harder.  Space combat takes a bit fo a learning curve at first, but in one or two space combats you will be able to learn the gist of it.  I would say the only major downfall is the AI.  They can literally hurt your game.  In one mission (the mission I always have trouble with) you have to defend the Jedi library from being destroyed by the Jedi (they don't want the Empire to get the knowledge within it).  With a close up shotgun to the head, you can kill them in two shots.  Otherwise, otherwise they take 2-3 shots to take down.  The AI would face off against a Jedi, shoot it once, and then run out of the room to some other place.  Seriously, the AI will force me to quit in anger.  Even the opposing AI is somewhat stupid.  But the online play fixes that.So out of all the game, the only detracting qualities are the sometimes pathetic AI and the (expected) learning curve for the space combat.  Otherwise, this game is a mighty good farewell to a great generation of Star Wars gamers and games in general.			"

												After the massive failure that was Battlefront. Star Wars Battlefront II is still the go to game after all these many years. I still find myself enjoying this game and all it's content, that is sadly lacking from the EA released installment. But enough about that mess. We're here to talk about this gem and all it's glory.   Available to you are  a couple of  game modes like Galactic Conquest (my personal favorite) where you are able to build/control fleets that you can navigate on a galactic map against the AI. There are startegic elements present in this game mode like building a fleet over an occupied space to keep the enemy from taking it over without a fight. Usually resulting in a fun space battle. Building said fleets costs money however, which is  usually earned after each turn if you have control of a planet(s) and I believe by succesfully winning a skirmish. Also available to purchase are bonuses that can help you in your campaign - like extra troops, regenerating health, auto-turrets that protect your command posts and enhanced weapon damage. These bonuses are however one time use and only one active bonus is available per skirmish. So you'll have to purchase a new bonus before each skirmish.   The other mode is the Rise of the Empire Campaign where you play as the 501st Legion (Vaders Fist). Mainly taking place during the start of the Clone Wars, beginning with the battle of Geonosis, all the way to the battle at Echo Base on planet Hoth. This game mode mainly has you completing objectives to progress the storyline, such as recovering an item from the enemy, Defending a post from being overrun by the enemy or destroying a target. I wasn't too much of a fan of this game mode, not to say this mode isn't fun, but I would rather just play Galactic Conquest instead. And then there is Instant Action, where you can instantly jump into matches that you set up before hand. But all that pales in comparison to the great multiplayer that once was. If you were lucky enough to have been able to play this game back when the online was alive and kicking, then you got to witness one of the funnest online games to ever grace this earth.Sadly, the online is no more and the only way to play this beauty is to download some software like Hamachi to play with other people. Even then, there isn't much to hope for since you're not likely to find enough people to fill up the lobby, which is necessary for that true experience. It's just not the same otherwise, as bots don't make for fun matches. I would still recommend people to pick this game up, even today, as it is still one of the funnest games out there and it's certainly much better than Battlefront by a large margin. Maybe some day, fans will come together and revive the online. That, or we can hope that we'll get a true sequel that isn't some stripped down mess that only has it's looks going for it. Until then, Battlefront II is still a viable option to scratch that itch for epic battles on land and in space.			"

												As a kid, this game's given me and my sister many, many hours of enjoyment as we played splitscreen on the good ol' PS2. Back last summer sale, I bought this as a sort of ""thanks"" for all the good memories I have from my childhood. In the few minutes I played to check it out, I saw it was still as fun as I remembered Battlefront 2 to be. Lots of maps, lots of game modes, lots of entertainment. And from what I've seen, there are a lot of mods that add maps and characters being made to this day, which lengthen the game's lifespan even more. Certainly much better than EA's rendition of Battlefront (I wish Battlefront 3 didn't get cancelled, that version was supposed to be the chosen one!), and I fully recommend it :)			"

												Star Wars Battlefront II is one of the best team play shooters I've ever experienced. I played a ♥♥♥♥ ton on the old Playstation 2, So Don't be fooled by my low playtime. The gameplay is insanely fun, especially with a friend, or even family member. The campaign Is Great in so many ways (Except the Space sections, I suck at those).The controls are tight, great and easily tweakable. I spent hours on my PS2 playing with bots or with friends and different classes and having a BLAST. I recommend you get this game if you're looking for a fun, Classic STAR WARS Shooter.  "

												So, after using Han Solo to slide tackle my way into a CP, while dropping a bomb behind me that I blew up to kill three stormtroopers moments later, I realized I should probably review this game (if only to add to the avalanche of good reviews).  For those who did used to play and are on the fence about buying:- ""Is it still as good as I remember?""  Yes, yes it is.- ""Is the PC port functional?"" Nearly flawless, next question.- ""I've spent years playing brown-grey corridor MMS games. Will that long treahcerous slo-"" Yes, you'll be lost in pleasant nostalgia at a REAL shooter, and it won't stop.Now, for those who haven't played: do. This game may be an older game, but it harkens back to a day where games just gave you a gun, patted you fondly on the bum and said: ""Go nuts stormtrooper/rebel/Han Solo"".None of these scripted walks/vehicle sections, pressing F to pay respects or watching dumb NPCs prattle on in front of you, You can play as differing classes (or heroes) in maps where the objective is to take the enemy command points and hold them until either you or they run out of reinforcements. As good as the game is, though, I do have to point out a couple flaws that may frustrate newcomers (though these are not reasons to skip buying the game):- The enemy NPCs have that unpleasant quality where they automatically KNOW you're the player character, so any attempt to storm a room with ten of your fellow soldiers will end with you being the first one targeted by everybody right out of the gate. - Your own NPCs are almost endearingly inept at everything, whether it be holding cps or taking them. They also have a tendency to toss grenades in your direction in an attempt to take out the enemy you're fighting, leaving you to kinda work your way out of that situation.- I should mention that if you're gonna play the campaigns, there are no checkpoints. If you fail within a second of the end of the mission, you get to startt over from scratch.Still, at the end of the day, if you like shooters, get it.			"

												If you're reading this, I have one question to ask you.Why don't you have this game?Seriously, this game is just simply worth owning because its so much fun. It features a great offline mode, a varity of options and a very chaotic multiplayer. Not only that, but this game has a great modding community. You can see things from maps and units to entire game patches. However, the game does have some major compatibility issues with Windows Vista and up. First off, the main menu is permanently stuck at a fixed resolution(you can change it from the launch options, but the entire menu will become messed up), however 1980 X 1080 is supported when in game. Second off, there's an audio bug that halts the audio for a few seconds, then continues on. That can be fixed via launch options and by enabling stereo mix in your sound settings. Now the next big thing I havn't gotten, but other have been having crashing problems. From what I heard, you can prevent it from happening if you have something plugged into your mic jack (weird solution, I know). Aside from these issues, the game shines great and is amazing fun. If you like large open battles, epic space battles with starships, and intense close quaters combat, this game is for you.			"

												Battlefront II is... well, what can I say? It's mother♥♥♥♥ing Battlefront II. If I have to convince you to buy this game, then get the ♥♥♥♥ out of my face.This is some quality ♥♥♥♥ing multiplayer right here, on a scale rarely seen in multiplayer shooters. It's aged a bit for sure, but no game to date will give you the amount of freedom to fight every battle that happened and never happened in Star Wars.GameRanger allows you to play multiplayer even to this day, and there's always a server with players going on. May the force be with you, and ♥♥♥♥ EA.			"

												Here's my Review about STARWARS™ Battlefront™ II.PROS-Crap tons of Maps.-Decent gameplay.-Loads of Chewies.-Never before seen Wampa battles.-Dogfights.CONS-NO MULTIPLAYER!?!?!?!?-Bots are a little Dumb to dumber to.-Can be glitchy sometimes. (Not that Sonic' 06 Over the top glitchy)-Dogfights tend to be a little Difficult.Overall, Its a Fantastic game on its own. It's a Shame theres no more Multiplayer (Unless there's 3rd Party plugins to do that.) It might be a little bit outdated but its a Classic that could not die. Yet.			"

												READ THIS REVIEW IF HESITANT ON BUYING THIS GAME! If you are a huge Star Wars fan then you need to buy this game! I played this game on the Playstation 2 when it came out and it was part of my childhood. I was never really dissapointed with this game, the Campaign was very enjoyable (and a bit challenging at times) but a little short and the maps are very fun to play on and has huge variety (From the snowy landscape of Hoth to the murky Swaps of Dagobah). My favorite is the Galactic conquest mode where you have to capture planets to win and each of the planets are worth a certain amount of points and there is also Instant action which is quick matches. I don't know why people are complaining about the online multiplayer, yes it was run by GAMESPY, and yes they did shutdown; but there is still DEDICATED SERVERS that you can go and play on if you want multiplayer action, and you can still HOST games and have friends join your server; you can also use Gameranger and join through there as well. The space combat is just how i remembered it fun and very unique in there being different ways to approach and destroy your opponent's ship. This game is a masterpiece of its time and deserves to be in your game library (hopefully with hours played on it :] ) and as always MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!			"

												Although it is an old game it still holds up. There's even mods to help it, the mod community is never stoppingThere's still a multiplayer community This is a great game, even the story mode is awesome as you take the place of a clone going through the clone wars and eventuaally even becoming a stormtrooper.This game is basically 10/10 would play again			"

												I got this game for my eighth birthday alongside my PS2, and had countless hours of fun with it. I loved the game, and I had no hesitation in purchasing it for the PC.However, for reasons I do not understand to this day, it refuses to work on my desktop. It works perfectly fine on my four year old laptop, but it does not cooperate with my custom gaming rig, which is a downer.Oh well. Still, I'd get this gem of a game if I were you. If you've never played it before, you're missing out.EDIT- Nevermind, I'm able to play now. Thanks to Senor Mexicano for showing me how to get Battlefront 2 up and running again.Can't get Battlefront 2 to run? Stereo mix may be disabled on your PC, and that might be the reason as to why you can't access the game.To re-enable Stereo mix:-Go to Control Panel.-Click on Hardware and Sound.-Click on the sound tab.-Go to Recording.-Right click on the blank space, and click on ""Show Disabled Devices"".From there, you should be able to view and reenable Stereo Mix, allowing you to play Battlefront 2.Thanks again to Senor Mexicano.Also, Droidekas are awful.

												This game.....I love this game to death. I've played countless hours on the ps2 version of this game, and now that i've had it for a while on pc...Its still as great as it used to be! This is THE star wars game (If you're looking for the infantry viewpoint) to play. Graphics and animation are par for the course (if not better) from the ps2 era of games. The sound design is wonderful, blasters and lightsabers sound the way they should. Though, the original cast didn't make a return to voice the hero/villians (Mark Hammil, Harrison Ford etc). The story is wonderful, the telling of the republics fall to the empire and retelling the story from episode 3 and the story arc ends at the battle of hoth. There is also galactic conquest, a board game type play style where the objective is to capture planets and establish a hold over the galaxy. Then comes the meat of this games replayable nature, instant action. This is the ""free play"" mode of the game, being able to play on every planet, with every game mode (Conquest, 2 and 1 flag ctf, hunt, and my favorite hero assault). The space battles, abeit limited are very good and no star wars game since has made casual dogfighting as much fun as this. All in all, this game is a must buy if you are a star wars fan (like myself :3) Despite the missing multiplayer component, it is still great fun to play. This is a great game.			"

												Star Wars - Battlefront II is a third person shooter by LucasArts that puts you in the shoes of a common trooper or a droid while you reenact the greatest battle of the six Star Wars movies.You can play as the armies of the Republic, the CIS, the Empire and the Rebels, since the game covers both the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War eras from the Star Wars canon.Battlefront II spots a single player campaign revolving around a legion of elite clone soldiers, the 501st, as they serve the Republic during the Clone Wars during the last days of the democracy to later become one of the most feared army of the new Galactic Empire. The campaign takes place in several maps also available in multiplayer, but also tasks the player to complete several kinds of objective (like capturing a command post, destroying a target or defeat an enemy hero), so playing through the various missions feels like an unique experience and worth of a try.Battlefront II also introduces new maps where space battle take place: you can play as either a pilot or a marine from your faction, grab a ship (which can be either a heavy bombardier or a fast fighter) and try to severely damage the enemy fleet by either destroying its fighters or cripple its main ship either from the outside or the inside. While space battles always follow a strick formula with little room for alternative strategies, they are a welcome addition nevertheless.One of the major improvement from the original game in the sequel is about the hero units: while in Battlefront they weren't playable, the second game allows you to take direct control of them, albeit for a short time (which you can increase by killing enemies). You can play as both Sith and Jedi and scoundrels and bounty hunters from the two eras, each with his/her own weapons and powers.Another single player mode you can access in Battlefront II is the galactic conquest scenario: after choosing one of the four faction you are tasked to bring it to victory over its rival army and take absolute control of the galaxy. You have to move your army on a map of the galaxy and plan your attacks carefully. Winning confrontations grants you credits that can be used to purchase bonuses that can be activated for a single battle to enhance your armies (the bacta tanks perk will give your soldiers regenerating health, for instance).The multiplayer mode returns in Battlefront II in full force, offering several traditional game modes like capture the flag or control point captures or hunt on a pletora of new maps. It's also worth mentioning that the game has a very dedicated modding community always redy to develop new maps from different eras of the Star Wars canon (the Old Republic, for instance) or add new heroic or normal units per factions.Star Wars - Battlefront II is often labelled as one of the best games with a Star Wars license and I tend to agree, due to the very interesting and catchy gameplay and the excellent use of the series' canonic materials			"

												Great game, for more than just the nostalgia, even if you have never played before I'd recommend it. Story mode in a nut shell it's the story of the 501st clone legion and their part in the Star Wars universe from the mid clone wars to the battle on Hoth with awesome little journal entries from a surviving member before and after each stage. Along with story mode there are stand alone levels on various modes and galactic conquest where you pick a side and try to either conqure or free the galaxy. It's sad that the GameSpy servers are going down but I know I'm going to still be playing what is an overall fun game (already been doing so since I was about 12) and I can't wait for the next one. (Edit) The servers are down and the reboot is a dud, but I keep coming back to this old beauty, it isn't perfect, but still deserves all the love it gets in the wake of EA's take.			"

												I had high expectations for this game, and the developers have certainly made it worh my while. The gameplay is refreshing, in both space and on land. Explore every popular Star Wars vehicle, and take it into a blazing battle. Shoot down fighters in space, or knock down droids on the battlefield below. If you get tired of the random battles, try out the ""501st"" centered campaign. The missions were challanging at a higher difficulty, and the odds that you have to retry a mission are certainly high.Overall score: 8/10			"

												One of my Most Favorite Games OF ALL TIME!  However, I recommend buying it for PS2 because of a much easier control layout.			"

												Great Game for FPS players. The only sad thing is that GameSpy is no longer in the game so no online parties, unless you do LAN party.			"

												I do reccomend this game a its really good, and ive played more hours on my ps2, but im not sure why, every time i start a battle, it crashes to desktop, and it wasnt doing this a week or so ago. Great game if it works for sure.I wish the new one had a story mode, galactic conquest, and maybe even customization options.... but since its EA... that'll be $60 for half the game, and if you want the rest of the game you gotta wait a few months and then fork up some more cash. EA=Mr. Krabs of the video game industry, but worse, they ruin games over their greed.			"

												One of the best from the Star Wars! the game's plot set during the fall of the republic and the rise of the empire, on the eyes of an retired stormtrooper, the game modes are the typical from the FPS games such as Battlefield, conquest, team deathmatch, and the classes is represented by famous figures from star wars universe, to all the fans and FPS lovers, Battlefront II is recommended!

												This game has great content, a wide variety of maps, game modes, and specific classes that you can play as. This game also covers the whole spectrum from episode 1-6. The EA version of Battlefront is half the game this is.			"

												It's a brilliant game, I bought it quite recently and have had much fun with it. I cannot wait for the reboot in Winter 2015.Pros:- Good graphics for it's age- Good gameplay- Great campaign series- Maybe even better instant action systemCons:- Saving is between each game; you cannot quicksave- No online mode anymoreThat's pretty much all cons. There are little faults in this game!On to the Disney-made reboot soon, I feel surprisingly... lukewarm.I hope it'll be good, but.. it's Disney.			"
