												History says long ago there wasn't a single DLC on the market, everyone was happy buying their full games at reasonable prices, then one day from the heavens they dropped something called ""expansions"", they added new storylines, new missions, new characters, everything for the same price or lower, it was a wonderful era, until those stupid DLC come from the hell to bring you cosmetic changes, 1 weapon, lives or cheats, each one for just $10 USD..., this one fortunately it's an expansion and adds 8 new missions in the desert (duh) and new equipment for multiplayer, if you like Ghost Recon, this one can give you more hours of play at a reasonable price			"

												Ghost Recon: Desert Siege expands the world of Ghost Recon from Eastern Europe to the deserts of Africa. Small tweaks to the game make this a worthy addition to the original Ghost Recon. In comparison to the original game, the maps are also larger fitting into the desert theme. The long distance engagements can actually be quite interesting because more often than not, you are spotted in the wide open and there is little or no cover in some areas so approaching the situation is quite important.This is definitely a worthy addition to the original Ghost Recon game. Anybody who is interested in highly tactical games and already has the core game would adore this expansion. And if you don’t have the original, get on that because you’re definitely missing out.

												Ghost Recon. good ol' tom clancy. like actually some of the oldest clancy games. the campaign offers a great coop exp. and a for ever frustating complex SP bot experince. MP is classic. and for 2001 its pretty good. except the rugged geometry, the sprite explosions. the rough models. and the lens flare sun. OK so this isnt BF3. but BF3 aint no GR. If you are a fan of tactical shooters then you have already played this and I dont need to remind you of how good it is. Revisiting it is fun. and is still worth gathering a bunch of friends together for a no spawn elite run. dont forget the vent.7.0/10 (expansions included)			"

												The expansion mod of the original ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon,"" ""Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Desert Siege"" replays the experience, sweat, suspense, and 'awesomeness' of the first Ghost Recon in a desert enviroment.It stages in a war against Etheopia, and gives you the feeling of being in the heat of the sun while you play! Though there aren't as many missions as with the first Ghost Recon, the missions are harder, and take a bit longer to complete.This ""Desert Siege"" mod is just an advancement on the fun of the original ""Ghost Recon.""Don't hesitate to buy this!

												If you already own the original, this is a must have. If you don't own the original; shame on you. Pick up Ghost Recon and the expansion in one swoop.Even without the numerous enhancements, tweaks, and goodies, Desert Siege is worth its price for the mission editor alone.The desert settings are a great addition to the game integrating that all important immersive feeling of actually ""being there.""It also features some subtle but important improvements to the original gameplay that make Ghost Recon a more polished and enjoyable game as a whole.

												Ghost Recon Desert Siege is the first expansion pack for Ghost Recon, developed by same Red Storm and released in 2002,  one year after original. Yep, still same tactical shooter. It added new single-player campaign, new weapons and expanded multiplayer.Well, since multiplayer is kinda dead, you probably not going to care about those two new modes. However, you can play 5 multiplayer maps in custom mission if you choose Firefight or Recon mods.Also I didn't notice new weapons personally. I mean, how different they can be from whatever realistical weapons Ghost Recon already had.But it does add a new single-player campaign made up of 8 missions. And this time things are going south, from cold Russia into whatever hot African country, where you will be annoying everybody off by the border. Yep, it's still same Ghost Recon gameplay in different enviroment. Still with frustating AI, with enemies now even more happy to throw grenades that teammates AI doesn't bother to avoid, feeling sometimes unfair. Still quickscamming.It doesn't add new gameplay elements, the only new thing are enemy jeeps, which have driver and machine gunner. They can screw you up and are nice addition. But it's puzzling that Demolition's anti-armor weapon is useless against jeeps. I mean, direct hit may not even harm anybody in the jeep. It should blow up!But the levels themselves felt much better designed around Ghost Recon gameplay. They are now much more wide open, consisting of huge spaces. And I feel it makes it more pleasent to deal with teammate AI, as they are much better at providing support and cover over such distances. While you place them around to cover each other and move on slowly, taking baddies out from a far. Unless you once again have to enter building with only one path where you get one-shot instantly. Missions also didn't try to be gimmicky, the only armor escort mission has a very slow-moving convoy.And well, this expansion is good. At least if you liked the original. Overall I think I had more positive experience with Desert Siege's 8 missions than with original's 15 levels.			"

												This game is awesome. It took me 2.7h to complete the game.I will do some pros and cons for the gamePROS-The game graphics are pretty decent comparing the game to other games from '02-The mechanics of the game are awesome. It's not like shoot them up, you have to think of your own startegy to pass the Mission-This game is one of the more realistic games, when they shoot you 1 time, you'll probably die-In this game it is required to commander 1 or 2 teams(depends on how many teams you will take), and you can send your troops across the map with your orders because they will not move if you don't tell them to move-Max number of teams is 3(including your own team), so the game is not that hard to play-Couple of bugs but no need to be worried about-The game is forgotten but it doesn't need any updates or patches except for your team mates - in the beginning of the Mission they don't always say what they should say-You can make a perfect teams of Ghosts waiting for your command-The game is 8 Missions long. Too short if you ask me but that doesn't bother me at all-Community isn't dead but there aren't many players that patrol through the Community Hub-Models for the game are ok, they have made some new ones and they added some new weapons to the arsenal-Enemies now drive other vehicles besides tanks and SAMsCONS-Multiplayer is dead, ubi.com isn't working for the game. Only GameRanger supports Multiplayer now, and there aren't any servers online-You can't jump in the gameI recommend it. 8/10 Would destroy 3 tanks in a row again!			"

												Desert Siege is definitely worth playing if you enjoyed the original Ghost Recon campaign. I actually had more fun with the eight new missions here than the original fifteen; the new maps are far more interesting and realistic in design, offering a broader range of tactical opportunities, and the experience just flows more logically overall.
