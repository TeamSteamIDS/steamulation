												Well, I actually enjoyed this.I read the reviews, expected the worst, yet for a game I was supposed to hate, I still came away having finished it twice and had fun both times.  As others have said, it is a God of War knock off, and a budget one at that.  The voice acting is not very good, and the story, well a bunch of fantasy-sounding names doing this and that... I couldn't really keep track of who was who, so it was enough to know I had to kill the bad guy at the end.  Gameplay is basic hack and slash, and though you can kill most of the early grunts by simply grabbing them, later enemies need to be made vulnerable first.  Much like GoW, it has orbs to collect, quick-time-events, large boss battles, some cut-scenes, weapons upgrading, and special ""rage"" attacks.    The world is decently large, but there is little backtracking and generous save points to keep things moving.The hack-and-slash gameplay is broken up with some light platform elements, a few sequences of sliding down walls, and quick-time-events for some of the boss battles.  Those QTE's are one of the bigger weaknesses, as it can be very tricky to trigger a few of them (looking at you - swamp boss).Other issues include some occasionally dodgy hit-detection, a sometimes problematic camera, and absolutely terrible keyboard-mapping; use an Xbox 360 controller.  On the plus side, the game has decent (if now dated) graphics, a good pace, some decent cut-scenes and at 4-5 hours on normal, it does not overstay its welcome.Others have complained about the controls.  Be warned that the game by default works with an Xbox 360 controller, but it is not set up correctly until it is selected in the Game Configuration on launch!  Once this is done, the game controls exactly as expected: left stick moves, right dodges, and the buttons and triggers perform attacks and other actions.Overall, as a light-hearted action romp that does not require a whole lot of thought, it actually turns out to be a pretty fun game.  It is easy to get into, not so difficult that you can't progress with at most a few tries (on normal), and pretty satisfying when you actually get to the end.  Wait for a sale for sure and set your expectations accordingly, but once there it turns out to be a fun little budget action title that is well worth the small asking price. "

												Garshasp really wants to be the God of War. He's even been practicing Kratos' trademark scowl of perpetual anger.Unfortunately for him he's a little like that friend who thinks they're a brilliant singer, only you'd rather force macaroni noodles inside your ears than listen to them belt out off-key renditions of what at some point where probably real songs but have morphed into unimaginable abominations through a voice you can't seem to escape. Garshasp is clumsy at his best of times, broken at his worsts, and always as entirely unpleasant as his almost reptilian face which firmly states that no, we are not and will never be friends (he's kind of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that).The Monster Slayer is an action game that plays like a bunch of awkward breakdancers trying to murder each other but somehow only managing to land a hit every third try. Garshasp's movements are flashy, but annoyingly slow and prone to completely breaking the already poor hit detection, with hits and characters clipping through each other constantly as everyone flails around madly until they run smack into one of the omnipresent and aggressively restrictive invisible walls. Even when combat is ""working"" it's still essentially broken, with your character being entirely overpowered and enemies only being a threat so much as their outrageously large health bar threatens to put you to sleep as you monotonously mash the same buttons waiting for them to eventually die. The fixed camera is as pleasant and functional as a handicam held by someone who has had a few too many drinks, either obscuring platforms, breaking the environment, or causing you to puke as it stutters around erratically.And naturally there are the moments when the game simply gets a little fed up with having to even partially function and decides it's going to chop your framerate in half, or freeze up during an important jump, or just crash entirely because damn it being a game is hard and Garshasp has had enough of it! Frankly I've had quite enough of him as well. Please don't call. Forget this ever happens. I'll be busy with drowning myself in booze hoping I can do the same.			"

												When the Persian superhero Garshasp appeared on screen, old memories of the Soul Reaver came alive in front of me. The graphics, the movements were also familiar, just i used dead monsters to upgrade my weapon, instead of healing myself. The fighting system is not too varied, and not bugless, but easy to use.  Music is okay, there was 1-2 cool tracks, especially i loved that one at the beginning of the 3rd part of the game, that was truly awesome. Achievements are working, and despite of having a strong feel of consoleism, i've had a very good time.			"

												Garshasp: The Monster Slayer is a hack and slash game in a similar style to God of War. Unfortunately for this indie disaster, it only shares the same genre as God of War and none of the polish, breathtaking visual polish, and satisfying combat. The world of Garshasp is bland and boring, the story is generic, and the protagonist is the illegitimate child of the Prince of Persia and Kratos. 	The combat in Garshasps is absolutely dreadful, the combat feels slow and repetitive. The lack of combat animation variety was pretty jarring even for a game that only lasts three hours. This is magnified further by the developer's arrogance to create zoom in effects whenever Garshasps does a grapple kill. It looks awful enough from a distance, it just looks downright funny close up. The sound effect also does the combat no credit. Everything sounds muffled and of low quality, combined with the fact that weapons clip through enemies makes it very difficult to feel any sort of satisfaction when smacking baddies around. 	The puzzles and platforming in Garshasps, while bad, is still more serviceable than the combat. Moving obstacles have these huge boundary boxes that pushes you away if you get to close to them. This makes traversing areas with loads of moving traps tough because you can't predict when you'll get hit. You have to leave huge arbitrary amounts of space between Garshasp and the trap in order to avoid getting hit. It's still doable, and areas without any traps is a treat to run through. The wall sliding on the other hand is rage quit inducing. The sliding is incredibly fast and hard to deal with when the controls are unresponsive. 	Shockingly enough, Garshasp does have some redeeming qualities. The game itself has a generic world but it is a well designed generic world. The swamp foliage and boss art design looks fantastic even without anti-alias, the textures didn't look half bad for a budget title. The story has a good origin in Iranian mythology, but delivered poorly through un-epic writing and very poor narration. Garshasp: The Monster Slayer is a stellar example of when good ideas can't formulate good games.

Garshasp: The Monster Slayer is an action beat'em up. As Garshasp, you're on the trail of Hitasp and his minions who killed your brother and stole the ancestral Mace of Trit, chasing him all the way to his hideout to get revenge.Pros: The gameplay is easy to learn: you get light and heavy attacks, which you combine with your blocking, jumping and grabbing moves. As you gain combat experience while using the sword and then the mace, you unlock additional combos, which keep the game fresh considering some of the enemies resist certain basic attacks, like grab or light attacks. The game focuses on quick action, mostly free of puzzle save a bit of platforming. The bosses all have very different, although easy to figure, attack patterns (except the second, which is just two of the first). It clearly tried to pay tribute to, and copy, the style of God of War, down to health and XP orbs.Cons: The graphics are bad by 2011 standard and feel even worst today. Textures are poor, environmental design such as rocks and cliffs are polygony as hell. Character design is pretty sad, too, and you'll spend each facial closeups of cinematic scenes wondering how Garshasp's forehead creates a frown that would shame a Klingon. The enemies are extremely repetitive, maybe five or six different types which are rarely mixed in the same wave. Keyboard control is all over the place, and while a game pad works much better, the dodge move is exclusively available with the keyboard! What lazy gameplay design forgets to assign a button to the dodge move? Even the game's key-binding options left out the dodge move, I had to jump from game pad to keyboard until I finally installed a 3rd party key-rebinding app. FOR 1 BUTTON. Level progression is also a terribly missed opportunity, you learn no skills or feats, only 2 levels for either weapons which unlock combos you'll barely use. The single-course linear world can be completed within 3 hours. Unless you care for achievements, you will never again feel like playing through this bore-fest of bad voice acting and cliché storyline.Verdict: ★★☆☆☆ - Forget itThis is indeed the bad God of War clone people claim it to be. If it's sitting in your Steam backlog and you happen to have a few hours of free time to waste, the action scenes aren't too mind-numbingly bad. But don't get me wrong: it IS a bad game I can't justify recommending.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												This game is fun for the first couple of boards, but the controls get complicated rather quickly and it's hard to figure out what it is the game wants you to do. The up close action sequences trying to finish off the bosses are just too difficult to perform. After working on the boss for an hour I gave up. It's one thing to study the behavior of an enemy to find the timing of an attack pattern, but when you have him beaten this game makes you go through a complicated array of direction pad pushing where it's unclear what the symbols even mean. The timing is may prove frustrating to learn. Once you realize the symbols indicate which *direction on the D-PAD* you need to push it gets much easier. Don't pay more than $2 for this, but it is a good game if you get it at a low price.			"

												Truly said, I played this game like 5 years ago, and back in 5 years ago (non-steam), this game already looked outdated - lame graphics, boring game process etc. If you want to play this game NOW it would be even worse, so think twice:-Graphics is like from the early 2000s-Gameplay is even worse than dark souls one - a huge part of the *difficulty* of this game is bad controls. Like really bad. So most of the time you are sweating to roll back from enemy attacks and the rest of the time you swinging your weapon trying to hit those enemies, missing half of the attacks again cus of the bad controls. They are nonresponsive and lame.^ those 2 reasons alone are enough to not play this game at all because this is a slasher game.+ steam achievements - not really a plus because this game sucks-No steam cards - so there is no reason to even buy this game on sale.

												As odd as it may seem, I actually thought I'd really like this game. I don't mind games that are lacking in quality, as long as they provide a good time. Unfortunately, this one soured rather quickly. For those of you out there who were planning on playing this with a controller, it's...extraordinarily hard to get used to. Left stick rolls, right stick/directional pad moves, etc. This was odd, but doable, so I learned it and continued on (though it didn't get easier). I found myself enjoying the level, despite being able to spam one attack that kills the majority of enemies in one hit, taking most of the challenge out of the fighting. The narrator sounds cheesy, Garshasp himself doesn't look human in cutscenes (seriously, look at community screenshots, it's kind of an inside joke), but the environments are nice, and the game sets up what could have been a decent action title.There are those who like this game, and I definitely see why. I enjoyed it up until the infamous ""wall falling"" sequence in level one, where the game teaches you how to slide down a wall with a dagger whilst avoiding patches of wall that will dislodge you. This was fun--until I was instant-killed by a boulder that fell on my head after a 0.02 second window of it appearing on the screen. Obviously, trial-and-error is part of gaming, so I tried again, going different routes and speeding up his falling to avoid the boulder. About 20 tries (no joke) later, I had tried everything (going left, right, center, speeding up, slowing down, avoiding boulders, etc.), and even when I thought I'd passed it, the game instant-killed me despite seeing no boulder on the screen or imperfection in the wall. I'm not sure if it was a glitch, if there was a boulder that just didn't appear on screen, or what it was, but my journey with Garshasp ends here.This is my first ""not recommended"" review, and it comes with regret. I wanted to like this game, and I enjoyed it up until the Invisible Instant-Death. You may very well enjoy this, especially if you have a soft spot for ""bad"" games, but be forewarned that many people cannot even get it to work. Check the latest issues in the Community section--some people can't get it to load at all (I couldn't until I messed around with the game's files and launched the application from the .exe file, for example), some people only get a title screen, etc. Also, if you'd like to try it but don't want to pay full price, check the bundle websites. Garshasp shows up in bundles quite a bit, which is where I got my copy.Check this game out if you want to, but definitely do your research before purchasing.			"

												If you're reading this, then you probably already know that the controls in this game are convoluted and imprecise, and that the art style is a bit strange (Garshap, in the cut scenes, looks half-human, half-lizard man).  You probably also know about the cheestastic writing and voice-overs. None of that bothers me. I can live with it all and, while I'm not familiar with the Persian legend upon which this is based, Garshasp has a Cimmerian feel to it. Being a Conan fan, all of that cheesy goodness works in the game's favor for me.But, oh man, that camera. That insanely bad camera that goes where it wants, when it wants and, over which, you have zero amount of control.  It's actually a bunch of static cameras placed in odd locations without any thought as to how that placement will affect gameplay, and there is no logic to it. This isn't a racing game, and I'm not watching a replay, so why not have it over my shoulder, like any other action game?  Why am I sometimes running toward the camera? This isn't Crash Bandicoot 2, and I don't see a polar bear chasing me, so what gives? You're seriously telling me this didn't bother anyone while they were building the game?But even that isn't a deal breaker for me; I've played plenty of games with poor cameras, and I'm sure I'll play plenty more. No, the deal breaker for me is that the developers don't care about the player. Period. This is evident at the first boss, who crashes through a wall in front of you (one of the few times the camera is actually behind you, where it should be). He leaves behind a massive hole in the wall, through which you can easily fit. Yet, after the battle, the game switches to a top-down view (presumably hoping you won't notice the GIGANTIC HOLE IN THE WALL) and won't allow you to walk through it. Why? Because the developers have decided they want you to climb the ladder behind you instead.Nope, sorry. Forget this game; life is far too short. God bless anyone for sticking with it as long as they did. This ""developers vs players"" ideal is just poor design, plain and simple. This ill-will could have been avoided by simply having the wall collapse behind the boss when he crashed through it, but apparently it wasn't important.  Instead, it's a slap in the face to people who paid for the game, and if the developers are sticking their collective middle finger up at me this early, I'm not sticking around long enough to see how bad it gets later. Not recommended.			"

												For all the bad reviews Garshasp has gotten, im actually quite impressed with it. This is a straight to the core knock-off of God of War obviously, just as it looks. And for a small indie dev team to do this in such a great way is amazing. It's obviously not as polished as god of War itself it, but they did a bang up job regardless.It has just everything God of War has. Bloody Hack and Slash action (although the blood animations look a bit scrappy, they could have definitely put more effort into doing that better), it has character progression, you colelct red orbs just like in God of War that upgrade your abilities, it has quick time events to kill enemies just like God of War does, and it has massive boss fights the same as God of War does. It's not as brutal as God of War is, there isnt those bone crunching sound effects and geysers of blood everywhere, but thats all cosmetic. It's cool and adds to the feeling of a game, but it isnt necessary to have a good time playing it.While some people frown upon complete knock-offs, i do not. I rather enjoy them. It gives you the same game wiht a different theme and whole new storyline. Garshasp is an Iranian folk-lore character with the same level of badassery as Beowulf, or Hercules. I havent really dug into the game quite yet, ive only played for a short while, but it was enough to get a feel of the game and how it plays.I've also encountered one bug thats a bit annoying, especially mid-combat. If you're standing on top of an enemy as they dissapear after youve killed them, you get stuck in place until they are gone. This caused me to take some damage quite a few times. While not game breaking, it still should not have been overlooked and left that way.All in all, there is no God of War on the PC, and for the extremely low price this game costs, its a great alternative. It has also been bundled quite a few times, so coming across a bundle code for next to nothing shouldnt be too hard either. You can literally have a functioning God of War type game on your PC for less than a dollar.On a scale of 1-10 id rate this at 8/10.			"

												Hey do you like God of War?  Would you like God of War if it didn't have any of the interesting monsters, mythos, or gameplay and is just a vastly inferior product?  Well Garshasp is for you.  I mean that's literally what Garshasp is, a weak underdeveloped video game, that tries quite hard to be like God of War, but falls short in almost every aspect. The first thing gamers will find, is the graphics are no where near the level of the screen shots.  The cut scenes are ugly, but the game itself are almost as bad.  The screenshots look good and are in game, but even with a modern graphics card, the rest of the game is pretty poor. The gameplay is the one thing that might be acceptable, however the player is often too powerful.  If the player can grab an enemy, he gets full immunity to attacks, and a lot of the trash mobs are grabbable, so the player just has to grab for 5-6 times in a row and can win some battles.  If it's that easy, what's the point of the battles? For other enemies, they have to beat the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of them before they can be grabbed (And get an insta kills).  This isn't so bad, though near the end there's a few really annoying bosses that come back that have to be defeated. The thing is none of this is compelling.  It's all lacklustered, the character's look awful, and the enemies are dull.  At least with God of War most of the kills are amazingly over the top, this game just doesn't push anywhere near that level, and falls far short because of that. The levels are dull as well.  I mean god, I can go on, but everything in this game isn't worth the time it takes to break it down.   If you want a barebones God of War... I don't know what to tell you.  If you want to play God of War for the PC, Devil May Cry is available, it's not exactly the same, but it's enjoyable.     But what ever you do, don't get this game.  even if it was 1 dollar, it's just not worth your time.			"

												Yeah, ""Garshasp: The Monster Slayer"" is cheap, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's an ugly game in every aspect.It's a ""God of War"" wannabe. For a GoW clone done right, check out the great ""Marlow Briggs"". This, while a worthy effort, fails in almost every aspect.The game looks bad. The textures and the visuals are very basic, yet that doesn't prevent the game from having constant frame-drops. OK, my computer's certainly not the best, far from it, but a game such as THIS should not have such frame dips.The game is a name-dropping fest: the evil whatshisname killed your brother whomever and stole the whatchamacallit and is now going to use it to wreak havoc in the kingdom of whatever. And that's about it. The story's told via poor cutscenes and clumsy infodumps. The writing, needless to say, is childish at the best of times, and borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ otherwise.The combat is boring and imprecise. The hitboxes are flawed, at best. Your sword kinda floats through enemies as if they were immaterial, whole combos and movement are floaty, in fact. And, as I said, boring just because of the said fact. There's no strategy or variety to them. That includes Garshasp move set.It's not the worst game out there, but pick it up only if you're very bored and on sale.			"

												A God of War clone by Persian developers that tends to focus on Persian mythology than the actual story.PROSGreat combat w/ combo's and stuffGreat soundtrack P.S not amazing of some sort, it does succeed to show off Persian culture Smart enemy AIGreat puzzlesCONSCancerous camera movementLack of replayabilityShort campaignOnly two weaponsOutdated graphicsBugs, crashes, basic stuffI highly recommend this game if you want to enter Persian culture for the first time, and to experience how hard these developers worked on this game for such a long time.  Though I highly don't recommend this game if you're an average gamer who is bored and is in need to find a hidden gem on steam, simply because this game aged poorly and despite being a God of War clone, I can easily say that it is outdated af...Still waiting for the third game...

												The game doesn't run on modern computers (Win 7 64bit): it says OgreMain.dll is not designed to run on windows. A lot of people had the same problem on the forums. Have tried all the workarounds mentioned there and it still doesn't work. (Reinstall the bundled PhysX, run in administrator mode, run in WinXP compatibility mode etc.) You can see that it also low Metascore points, so I don't think it's worth your time.EDIT:I managed to make it work. You have to1, Reinstall Physix (from redist folder)2, Resinstall Flash (from redist folder)3, Restart the computer4, Run it as administrator (Don't have to run it with XP compatibility, I could run it as Win 7 compatible)Optional:5, Run GarshaspConfig and choose the keymap tab and select xbox360 profile (if you have an XInput compatible gamepad), otherwise the sticks will be switched.It's also recommended to set the graphics to low for the wall sliding section, so it's easier to see the barriers (there are 2 barrier types: light and dark; light does little damage).So after you have been through this, what we have is still a bad game, with boring combat and bad leveldesign.

												Rated: 4/10Honestly I was hoping this game was just under rated like blades of time was, but its just not good. The story is a generic revenge tale. The character models brow is absurd. The combat is not very fluid which is essential for this genre of game. The narrator isn't good either. He reminded me of the Conan movie narration but much much worse. The controls aren't mapped correctly for a 360 controller, but that's a small gribe compared to how bad the combat is. The sounds and music are janky and over the top. If you like indie or B games because of personality this game doesn't have any. Don't play this even if you get it free like I did.			"

												You really can't go wrong with this game for five dollars. It's been called a God of War clone so many times that I'm beginning to think I should actually play God of War to see what all the fuss is about. If God of War is that good, I hope they make plenty of good clones based off of it. As far as this game goes, I had a blast playing it. My favorite part of the game was the art design which was truly original. I loved the originality of playing as a mythological Persian warrior Garshasp, (basically Persia's Beowulf). The combat was very fluent and fun, and the controls were tight and responsive. The biggest glaring flaw that this game had was that there is no control of the camera angle, which takes some getting used to. I'm not sure why they designed the game like that, but you do eventually get used to it, even though it is awkward at first. The game is also relatively short with little character development and story. So if character development and story are very important to you, an RPG might be a better option for you. Also, the last boss is a PAIN IN THE @$$!  It took me like ten tries to beat him! This game has good combat, wonderful art design, cool bosses, great controls, and just enough platforming parts to keep it interesting between combat without it becoming annoying. I had a lot of fun with it and the price is great.			"

												I'm not going to lie, its a weak title, but Ill give a little slack since its indie. Graphics are passable, Gameplay plays like any other Hack & Slash pretty much, controls are a bit sluggish (playing with a 360 control, no idea on kb/m) But for some reason, I am enjoying this game. Its only about 3-4h long, but the low price (as of this typing is 4.99 USD) makes the sting for that go away.If you like H&S games like Darksiders, DMC, God of War, give this a try if the price is still right. Just keep in mind this is the first game from this developer so, go easy on it eh?(If you have issues launching the game, try installing flash through IE, had issues, did that, and viola)			"

												Pretty much a basic hack and slash spectacle fighter.The graphics are decent for its age, but the game is very basic and lacks polishing and depth.Aside from a couple bad puzzles and lack luster boss fights, the game is solid for its price and its decent considering its an indie game from a smaller team.At worst, I got some very good laughs in at some of the minor problems with the game.Monsters die a lot more quickly than they do in god of war, dante's inferno, etc so I was really happy with the faster paced combat and that I didn't spend 20 minutes fighting trying to kill things.Its an ok game for 2-3 bucks, I wouldn't pay 5 though as it lacks polish. So I can recommend it if you like the genre and want to support indie developers.I'll be buying and LPing the expansion as well.			"

The camera is in the wrong place at times and there are platform sections that feel bolted on to add something else to do apart from attack the same few monster types.

I've played it for 15 minutes so far and I couldn't even beat the first (sub-?)boss. No, not because I suck (yeah, I heard that), but because it's buggy (enemies spawning on the main character) and it has a terrible camera that spins at the worst moments... and don't get me started on the hit detection. It's the reason why I couldn't take down the boss. I tried it two times, and after that, I decided to shut it down as quickly as possible.

Options must be adjusted within the Steam menu before playing and the default gamepad is not an Xbox 360 controller.  Those who play in bursts may wish to note that, while there are reasonably positioned checkpoints preserving progress, only some allow saving between game sessions.That said, I was motivated to finish Garshasp despite the plethora of alternatives piled in my library.

												The graphics are ok and sound is great, the story is also good, could be alittle more than just a story about a hero that seeks revange on some evil dude who wants to rule the world, but is still good. There is action which is good, I think that the fighting sequences are well made. Unfortunally the controls are absolutely horrible. They are very stiff and at some points the game doesn't even react to the buttons you try to press which makes the game ard to play just because the character won't do as I want him to. The hitbox of the character could also be alot better. There is at a point in the where you take damege from enemies that is standing too far away from you to actually be able to hit you.The game would be good if the controls were better and the hitbox was alittle smaller than it is, but now t's just frustrating to play and it feels like the amount of energy you put down to actually succeed in the game isn't worth to play it.I would not recommend this game.

												Garshasp could very well mean the same as garbage, since that would probably be the most fitting name for this game. Controls are terrible, camera is terrible, sound is terrible, graphics are terrible (mostly because of bugs that create random untextured walls and holes in the ground), gamelength is very short, gameplay is mediocre at best (like devil may cry, just without effects, combos and badassness, you have a sword though). If you don`t mind spending money on a game with a length of around 2 hours, an uncontrollable beast of a camera, crappy quick time events and an extremely high level of fun which is roughly on par with ♥♥♥♥ing minesweeper without mines, then go ahead and give this game a shot - surprisingly enough, it is still better than Garshasp 2 after all.

												One of the worst games I've ever played. The story is unengaging. There are about five or six combos, yet only two are useful. It would be ""spam main attack to win,"" but for some reason, enemies are invincible while going through their attack animations. This leads to much frustration in certain parts. There are a lot of long, boring, UNSKIPPABLE cutscenes that basically fly through the area you are about to fight through. The game designers thought it would be a good idea to put save points before these.I would say the graphics are good, but the game runs worse than the Witcher 2 without matching up graphically.			"

												How many games have a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off dude with a sword? None. Well, none with a 49 metascore- but only ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ casuals care about scores. This dude, Garaphaspiahihshitops or whatever is so♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that 9 out of 10 doctors think he has hypertension from all that pent up anger. He doesn't even have blood coursing through his veins. Garshasp was so badass that he leaped at a horse in the middle of the night as a kid (this is totally in game) and replaced all his blood with HORSE TESTOSTERONE. He's literally the incarnate of anger. If you deny Garshasp anything, he'll ♥♥♥♥ing come to your door, impale himself on his own sword, and kill all of your goats and nearby farm animals while complaining about being too♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off to even care about the testosterone leaking out of his chest cavity. He'd probably wish for another pair of arms and a second heart just so he can pummel more of your goats into the Earth before he bleeds out, and impale himself one more time just to get the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of him. UPDATE: Game is still badass, 10/10 GOTYAY.			"

												Garshasp could very well mean the same as garbage, since that would probably be the most fitting name for this game. Controls are terrible, camera is terrible, sound is terrible, graphics are terrible (mostly because of bugs that create random untextured walls and holes in the ground), gamelength is very short, gameplay is mediocre at best (like devil may cry, just without effects, combos and badassness, you have a sword though). If you don`t mind spending money on a game with a length of around 2 hours, an uncontrollable beast of a camera, crappy quick time events and an extremely high level of fun which is roughly on par with ♥♥♥♥ing minesweeper without mines, then go ahead and give this game a shot - surprisingly enough, it is still better than Garshasp 2 after all.

												This game has the potential to be a good game but it is plaqued with a terrible third person view that does not allow the player to pan.  It would not be bad if the games camera angles were intelligent and gave the player a partially realistic view.  The monsters and bosses are very basic and add no real surprises. The color and graphics are nice to look at but if your forced to see a scene the way the director wants you to, I would think it would be. I give this game a 4 out of 10			"

												This game is a poor mans God of War or Prince of Persia, with a dash of Darksiders and is inferior to all three.  Garhasp features an aggravating cinematic camera that the player cannot control, tutorial windows that inexplicably cannot be bypassed and pop-up at the worst moments imaginable, a checkpoint only save system with too much distance between points, and a difficulty level that will guarantee you will have to replay the same sequences repeatedly to pass them.  If you like a challenge for all the wrong reasons, by all means, pick up this game.			"

												This game remins me a lot of games like Golden Gaxe from the golden era of video gaming.It's mainly the same as the ""ancestors"": run down the scripted levels and kill every enemy thrown in your way. Here and there the plain hack'n'slash gameplay gets interrupted by boss fights and other things like sliding down a wall avoiding obstacles, steering some sort of boat or the usual - and quite simple - lever riddles.The game has it flaws, as it's full of invisible walls, sometimes when fighting on a stair the enemies ""sink"" halfway into the ground, and the standard controller setting being totally messed up. At least the controller issue can be fixed by swapping the mapping of the two analog sticks in the seperate settings program before launching the game. As you can't edit the preferences from within the game better be prepared to quit and restart the game a few times until you get the settings right to suit your deeds.Another problem I encountered was that when I first wanted to start the game all I got after the logos where shown was a black screen and an error message. I found out that you have to execute all the seperate installers in the game's redist folder on your harddrive (for eg OpenAL, PhysX, etc.) to get the game up and running. I think normaly this should be done automatically during the installation process of the game ... but ok ... it's a hassle but at least the game works flawlessly now ...When you got it up and running I personally found the game quite enjoyable. It's a no brainer hack'n'slash through and through. Nothing else to expect here. No exploration no fancy combos (though the charakter can learn some but you get notified about them - and you don't really need them - you can also play the game with the standard controls only without problems, except for some bosses, which I like).The graphics look ok for me as they do their job but they are far away from being great seeing this game came out in 2011 and so it's relatively new ... but all works well ... everything fits quite well together ... and the artstyle is coherent throughout the game.What impressed me a bit were the really well done german voices. I haven't tried the english version yet but I guess they're well done to. For a game with this budget it's something special to have professionaly made voice overs I think.Well ... well ... ;)... all in all this game isn't expensive and when you like the genre I think you could buy it without really regretting it especially when it's on discount, what tends to happen on a regular basis. For what it is it's easily good enough for a single playthrough.			"

Multiple times in the game the camera just moves so involuntarily that I find myself falling off places just because I'm going forward and the camera swivels but I'm still going the same direction I was going before.  It would be good if those 2 aspects were changed.  For 5$ it's a good game though.			"

												This game is not going to be anything to ""phone home"" about. It's not gonna win any awards and I wouldn't even rate it very high on the 10 out of 10 scale. That said ... I wouldn't rate it very low either. Picture a capable God of War clone with AMAZINGLY beautiful atmosphere, great graphics, overall fun gameplay, but completely forgettable story and terrible voice acting. That's basically Garshasp: The Monster Slayer.It's a really fun ""time waster"" so grab it on sale for a couple bucks and have fun, but don't expect too much. Oh, and check out my community control scheme for Steam controller cause there was nothing else available and the default controls for bother keyboard and gamepad left something to be desired.			"

 The crippled son of God of War and Prince of Persia – warning, this is a full review, it will be really large Introduction:  	I wanna start this saying, i like the game, i understand why it got bad reviews and people saying it is not recommended, but i will recommend it for one reason, i like it, its fun to me, and i believe it may be fun for other people, the game is nowhere near perfect, or even “good”, it has a lot of defects and is really unpolished, read the full review to decide if you wanna buy it or not, or just jump to the conclusion if you are too lazy to read(i recommend reading, it will give ya a better idea of what the game has to offer.) Gameplay:  – 4.5/10  - Combat:  – 5/10		The game has a typical hack`n slash gameplay, you have a “fast” attack, a “heavy” attack,  a “grab” attack, a block button and you can evade incoming attacks to each of the four directions, when you have a enemy stunned you can kill it with a special killing animation, where sometimes you may have to hit buttons on the right order to kill him, it sure sounds like a good God of War styled game right? Wrong, the mechanics are the same, but there are very little combos, the attack animations are unimpressive, the killing animations are rather boring and your dodge almost never works cause you move too little away from the incoming attack, but ignoring the “looks” of the battle, the battle system is pretty solid and does its job very well.		So, the game keeps throwing hordes of enemies at you, and you have to kill them all to advance, good old hack`n slash style, and the enemies are kinda cool, not really a LOT of variety, but enough to get the game going, the game is rather small so you will not get annoyed by the lack of variety while the game lasts, in addition to the hordes the game throw at you, sometimes you have to stop and turn levers or activate buttons, while you do those actions, more enemies come at you, and this feels actually really lame, cause there is no penalty when you stop doing the action, so you can stop, kill all the enemies and then do the action and it will all be good, which destroys the purpose of having the horde on the first place.  - Boss Battles:  – 4/10		The boss battles feel the same as normal battles, the only real difference is a big life gauge on the top of the screen and the over-sized enemy... yeap, that is it  - General:   - 8/10		Now, a really cool mechanic that the game has is “sliding” down on the walls, there is a lot of walls in the game where you have to slide your way down, and this is actually a pretty good and solid mechanic, you will have to avoid gaps on the wall and salient rocks or you will loose your grip and die, you can speed up or slow down your sliding so you can avoid obstacles, this I must say, is the better working mechanic on the entire game.  - Leveling Up:  – 5/10		Leveling up works similarly to god of war, where you collect red orbs to fill your level gauge, but the problem is, you don’t choose which weapon or perk you wanna level up, the orbs will go to the weapon you are using at the moment and will upgrade the weapon level giving you new combos with that weapon, so you are not really in control of how you level up, the red orbs can be found by killing enemies, destroying objects or in a big “chest”-like orb(you can replenish your life with a blue variation of this “chest”)		You also can upgrade your health amount by collecting 4 “tears”, they are blue things that look like orbs, they are hidden in the environment and each boss drops one after killed. Graphics:  – 5/10	While the graphics are nothing amazing, they do their job, the 3D models are good, kinda low poly, but good, the textures are outdated, they seem like something out of the ps2 era, the cutscenes do look a lot better, but this being a 2011 game, they are outdated as of now.	The HUD and the boss health gauges look really bad, they are really sharp and dont blend in on the rest of the graphics, but they do their job and will not damage the experience even one bit as you will almost never look at them.	You can see some graphical bugs trough the game, they are not many, but they sure are easy to spot, I am impressed the developers missed them. Audio:  – 4,5/10  - Music:  - 6/10		The music is rather blend, but it is not bad, you wont really feel it but it gives a nice background noise while you slain all those monsters.  - Sound Effects:  – 5/10		The main menu noises are annoying as f*ck, they are loud and look like they were cut in half, the weapons and other sfx sounds pretty good, leaving me thinking why the hell would the menu sounds be so awful.  - Voice:  – 3/10		The monsters noises are... ok, but the narration is bad, really bad, the narrator voice is quite dry and annoying, and he tries to simulated an old man narrating, speaking very slow and keeping his voice down, but it doesnt work, just looks like someone was trying very hard while reading some papers for the first time in their life. Story:  – 2/10	I don’t even know how to rate this, cause the game story is really dumb and the lore is almost non existent, the old man narrates all the story and from what I could understand it is: Garshasp was trying to prove that he is amazing, his brother was killed by some random monster for some random reason, they stole his brother mace, and now Garshasp has to retrieve the mace cause it has the power to destroy the world... awesome, no? Lets be easy here, the story on this game doesn’t really matter, you just wanna kill some monsters and go on a adventure, but man... this is a really♥♥♥♥♥♥and messy excuse for you to go on a adventure... this is the worst part the game has to offer Conclusion: 	The game is not GREAT or AMAZING, but it sure is fun, it has only 4 hours so you should not expect much from it, you will play those 4 hours and probably like them, but they sure aren’t the best 4 hours you ever spent in a game.	If you have some free time and wanna play something just for the fun, buy this at a high sale, more than 80% should do, and you will probably not regret it.   Topic Score   Gameplay 4,5   Graphics 5   Audio 4,5   Story 2   Final 4  "

												0/10This game is too freaking bugged. I don't remember how I got it to work back in summer 2011 (although it still crashed, froze an whatnot then), but it STILL crashes on startup although everything required is installed and the developers still haven't fixed anything.This game is an unfinished piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ even a year after its release.Get one of the Prince of Persia games or Devil May Cry 3 instead.

												This is an ambitions indie project, as they tried to do a ""god of war"" type of game on a shoestring budget. The end result is a good game at its core, but unfortunately it is plagued by many technical shortcomings. I did enjoy playing this game, but be warned that some moments will be very frustrating and you could be reloading dozens of times at some tricky situations. If you are a patient player though, you will get a lot of bang for the buck for this game at its current 2.5$ price tag.			"

												This game shows promise, but a horrific camera and some janky controls relegate it to ""only on sale, and only if you're bored"" status.A shame really, the level design and characters show real promise. It has a unique visual style and some decent music and voice-over work.However, it isn't terribly enjoyable to play, and that is really what a game is about.			"

												This is a God of War knockoff with a Prince of Persia texture applied; done on a low budget. The game isn't *ugly*... but it's nothing spectacular either. The camera is annoying and the controls are particular. Using a mouse and keyboard is awkward, but the default xbox controller layout is equally unintuitive (the left analog stick controls dodging, but the right analog is movement? uhg).I can't stress enough how much of a GoW clone this thing is. Right down to the health / exp orbs laying around for you to crack open... except this game has a bonus camera / controller metagame you've got to fight against. Good luck!			"

												I highly do not recommend this game. Though it started out strong with decent graphics and a well made story line. Unfortunately the gameplay is sluggish and clumsy, graphic glitches a plenty and on top of that too many bugs that cause that will casue the game to be impassable in places.  Unless there can be some significant fixes, I shall be uninstalling this game.   At this point it was not worth the money I spent on it.			"

												For those who like God of War and don´t mind a game a little rough on the edges. Very short game tough. A word of warning: you have to plug in and configure a gamepad in order to enjoy this game. The camera chages very dynamically and the keyboard is really frustrating. I plugged in my DualShock with USB adapter and it was a blast!			"

												If God of War and Prince of Persia had a child, this game would be it.Taking strong cues from both games, it still manages to miss the small, but important parts that made those games a lot of fun.Dynamic camera angles supposedly give an action movie feel to a game, however the angles changed so often, I started to get dizzy.Even worse, it would change whilst doing something crucial  - like leaping from ledge to ledge over a chasm. Hours of fun right there.The absence of game enhancements like ledge grabbing, waypoints, tighter or fixed camera control, shows off the superior qualities of similar games, to the detriment of this one.In game, Garshap has a brow so low, he is a Neanderthal, and the game is obviously a port from console, which usually means frustrating control handling for PC players, and this is no exception.If you enjoyed God of War or Prince of Persia, then stick with them.This child of theirs, whilst initally charming, stands very much in their shadow.6/10			"

												I do NOT recommend this game. The controls are absolutely HORRIBLE. The camera turns and twists as you go through the map, which causes the controls to change CONSTANTLY. This makes running and jumping between platforms one of the most frustrating experiences. I couldn't even get through the first level because of the controls before ragequitting. DO NOT BUY NO MATTER THE COST.			"

												Garshasp. what can I say.pretty decent story. bare minimum, warlord killed your brother or something and stole your clans sacred mace; you have to kill him and get it back. 3 hours later you do. there are a few issues that are apparent in an indie game but nothing really that hinders the game to much. I liked it, it was a fairly good game but needed more. and I think if they had the chance they would make better one. I am looking forward to Garshasp II. 6.5/10			"

												this game is pretty meta. i mean, i've seen some meta stuff, typically involving the destruction of a 4th wall, but this game takes the cake.the idea is that i play as garshasp, and slay monster, right? well, i'm not actually garshasp until i start playing. funny thing is, the game will not let me start it up because it itself is a monster (i guess?) and i cannot slay it. incredible. there goes all my money down the drain for a gimmick. what i don't understand is why even program the game, write a script, create models and textures and hire voice actors if none of that was going to be used? pretty elaborate troll.i really wonder when games will stop using gimmicks to get a fan-base, and just deliver a good product. this game could have been the half brother to the witcher (best game ever made). so much wasted potential on a joke. good job developers, you got me.
