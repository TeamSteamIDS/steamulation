												This is not a modern-day type FPS.  No realistic crap, no Call of Duty or Battlefield-type ""take cover or die"" realism.  This is a BALLS-OUT bad@ss old school FPS.  Did you like (the original) Wolfenstein, Doom, Quake, and Duke Nukem 3D?  If you answered yes to any of these: Buy ths game.  Now.Now to the uninformed, Serious Sam The First Encounter is a FPS bullet hell with swarms of enemies, no cover, but plenty of bombs.  Just collect guns and shoot, shoot, shoot!!!!  The physics are wonderful and the enemies look hideous and hilarious simultaneously.  Plenty of blood and guts, many enemies, and a ton of weapons (I forgot how many, I'm sure the store page says).And don't forget Sam Stone's comments.  I think he was Duke Nukem's cousin.  Maybe nephew.  Maybe both.A+ in my book.  I'm a fan of old school bad@ssery, but if you're not, the game may not be for you.  Go back to Call of Duty, sheep.			"

												Whenever I hear the term ""video game"" I immediately think of the Serious Sam games. Pure 100% action packed mother♥♥♥♥ing balls to the ♥♥♥♥ing wall holy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I'm getting my♥♥♥♥♥kicked fun.What is Serious Sam The First Encounter? It's an old-school First Person Shooter, you shoot things, pretty simple stuff, right? Well, the thing about Serious Sam is that it does it so well, all you really need in a game like this is shooting. None of that modern military shooter garbage where it pretends to be ""realistic"" or ""tactical"" and it takes itself too seriously. Ironically, Serious Sam doesn't take itself seriously at all, it's fairly ridiculous actually. Non of that two weapon limit crap and health regeneration that seems to be the norm nowadays, this game is seriously bat♥♥♥♥♥♥insane cranked up to eleven.So why is the game so good? It's fun, for one thing. It's you against a horde of enemies, you shoot everything that moves and it's extremely satisfying to do so. You have a wide arsenal of weapons to help you take on the extreme amounts of enemies flying at you constantly. Each weapon is so finely crafted and balanced to suit each situation in the game and you'll learn over time to know what weapon to use when and on what enemies. You can't just stick with the same weapon because you also have to worry about ammo conservation and it might not work as well as other weapons depending on what situation you're in. You'll slowly but surely adapt to the idea of switching weapons constantly and you better, or you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥kicked.The insane variety of weapons you get is ludicrous, and you can carry them all at once. You got your shotguns, minigun, rocket and grenade launchers, laser gun, ♥♥♥♥ING CANNON and more. The game also gives you these weapons at a nice pace as you progress through the game. You'll need every single weapon because this game isn't easy, you will always be attacked by tons of enemies and you'll need to use whatever you have. As for the enemies, there's a very large variety of them as well, and some of the enemy designs are fairly amusing; like headless screaming suicide bombers called ""Kamikazes"", scorpions with chainguns, reptilian creatures that throw homing balls at you and many more.The level design is nothing more than serviceable, which isn't a bad thing, it does its job, the enemy placement is occasionally very well and the game has nice pacing. You can also look for secrets which are fairly well placed actually, secrets help you out by rewarding your exploration with health and ammo. But what I like about the level design the most is that it isn't the maze-like level design of some other old-school and classic FPSs, THANK GOD (yeah, I'm talking to you, Doom 2!). All I want in a game like this is to shoot the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of everything that moves and I don't want to spend time figuring out where I'm supposed to go. Occasionally mid-way or at the end of a level you'll be fighting a boss, and these aren't just bosses, they're the size of a building, they're massive and very fun to fight, some of which you will later encounter as regular enemies once you've defeated them.The game also has a storyline, rather forgettable and it's nothing more than a setting for the game but the intro to the game sums it up very nicely. Humankind uncovers some advanced technology from another race, eventually they are attacked by aliens and at the point of being entirely doomed, they send Sam ""Serious"" Stone, a hero wounded countless times but never defeated, through an artifact called ""The Time Lock""; which has the power to send a single person back in time, so Sam is sent thousands of years back in time when humankind had a fighting chance to defeat Mental, the evil bad guy who is responsible for all this mess; and thus Sam fights his way through Mental's horde and whatnot. The Protagonist is likeable and quite awesome though.The game also has multiplayer. STAY FAR AWAY, besides the fact that the multiplayer is dead, deathmatch is so incredibly unbalanced and pointless. There's also co-op, and it's up to 16 players which is kind of awesome but in my opinion, this game shines the most in singleplayer.It's also not a bad looker, while the graphical fidelity isn't incredible, it still has some nice textures and shadow effects, modeling is good but the animations are a bit meh. The game is also very colorful, even though it takes place in Egypt which is always great. Also, the soundtrack is fantastic, it fits the game very well. I also have to mention the excellent sound design in this game. If you listen closely, you can hear the enemies that you are about to encounter and each enemy has its own sound, so you know what to prepare for when you're about to enter a new area or a room. And when you are surrounded by enemies, you'll know which direction they are coming from because you can hear them very well no matter which direction (if you're using headphones, of course).In conclusion, if you're into the golden age of FPS, then you've probably already played this game, if you haven't though; definitely be sure to give it a try. I'd go as far as to say that this is probably the best game to start with for people new to the FPS genre. And as a remake, this is just as good if not better than the original version.			"

Fast-paced and shamelessly entertaining // Best for those seeking an FPS throwback to simpler times (with better visuals)+ Massive visual improvement over the original game; textures, models, and lighting all have been thrown far into the future compared to the game's original release+ Introduces an autosave function+ Offers cooperative play+ Maps are large and allow for generous movement when in combat+ Enemies attack in droves; spikes the difficulty, certainly, but also keeps the adrenaline flowing+ The action is practically non-stop; there aren't any innovative mechanics by today's standards, but the consistent need for maneuvering and gunplay makes for a great, and a classic, mob shooter+ The monster designes are surprisingly creative, if often campy and odd; here, too, the visuals have been given an overhaul, and the enemies are much more detailed as a result+ There are secrets aplenty, often hidden behind walls+ Applaudable level design+ Weaponry benefits from a moderate variation and a deep satisfaction in their use- With precious little breaking up the fast pace, the gameplay gradually becomes a bit too uniform; can give way to a sense of tedium if played for long hours at a time- Multiplayer appears dead; completely unpopulated, and no active servers at the time of this reviewLockeProposal's Big Day OutCommunity GroupCurator PageSerious Steam Reviews subReddit "

Short version: 87%For those who missed the awesomeness of the first Serious Sam games, the HD remake is the perfect spot to jump into this old-school FPS franchise of serious weaponry, hordes of aliens, corny humour, and most importantly: lots and lots of mindless but oh-so-fun action.Long version:After the not so enthusiastic reception of Serious Sam 2, CroTeam decided that it would be better if they returned the franchise to its roots. The result was Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter, which also marked the debut of third Serious Engine. (Apparently they wanted to erase the memory of SS2 so much that they released the remake before Serious Sam 3: BFE was finished.)The finished product is mostly just a facelift on the original game, where the goal is still the same: use shotguns, rockets, cannons, and everything else in the vast arsenal to kill your way through a seemingly never-ending flood of monsters in ancient Egypt, all in order to stop an alien warlord called Mental before he eradicates humanity in the far future. All while finding silly little secrets and listening to the corniest one-liners any action hero ever spoken.There are a few minor tweaks here and there: some new level secrets, rebalanced difficulty (easiest settings don’t reduce enemy health that much), and a few modified enemy spawn compositions or locations. They are not too large to make new players feel they don’t get the original experience, but enough to give something even for the veterans.The graphical update is surprisingly humble. CroTeam touched the levels with respect, only making sure they were up to 2009’s standards, without adding unnecessary effects or any flashy things. This may come off as bad news for those who are used to FPS games being all about grandiose visuals and on-rails gameplay, but great news for those who want to know what makes these games so good but don’t want to go old-school in the graphical department.

												If you're reading this before October 13th, 2014, buy this game now. Easily one of my favorite FPS from the Quake era.  Maybe it has something to do with its large single player maps and it's Ancient Egypt theme. This is a very pretty HD remake and I can't wait to play through it again on modern hardware.  When it was first released in 2001 the whole community was sort of in awe at how such a good looking game (at the time) was priced at only $20...well, at least I was.  While Quake was headed in the Arena direction, Sam stayed true to the single player experience.  Secrets scattered throughout all the levels, hordes of monsters spawning in front of you, and lots of tongue in cheek humor.  This is a classic FPS that shouldn't be ignored, and it will teach you how to circle strafe.			"

												I remember growing up and playing the original Serious Sam: The First & Second Encounters. They are very good games, especial from an independent gaming company. When I heard that my original favorites were coming back, but with improved graphics, I was happy! The game play is mostly the same, there are a few changes to enemy AI, cut scenes, and weapons, some are good, but some are disappointing. It has the same weapons, enemies, and music and sound effects!Overall, I think the Second Encounter of the HD versions is a better choice, because it contains the First Encounter in it as well, you just don't see the intro, which is a little important if you want to follow the storyline. Serious Sam 3: BFE is the prequel to this series, it tells you what happens before the First and Second Encounters. I recommend this, and the original versions to everyone!			"

												A proper classic bullet hell shoot em up. I loved this game, back to the roots of gaming. Thirteen levels of pure shooting, explosions, blood and guts. Things can get rather hectic when you get further into the game with all kinds of different enemies swarming after you but with the wide array of weapons you have available, you'll be able to smash through them with no problems. My favourite weapon has to be the Canon, you literally fire a huge canon ball and it just wrecks anything and everything in its path. There is a co-op option available, as well as high scores on each level which makes the longevity of this title larger than most. Definitely one of my favourites now. Pick it up!			"

This review is a little lengthy, so if you want a quick summary of why I recommend Serious Sam HD The First Encounter skip to Results and read from there.Croteam makes a smash and they do it without any logic, realism, or sense. The Campaign:Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is an epic game which takes place in Ancient Egypt. This first person shooter is based in the future where the world is about to be destroyed by the monster Mental. All hope is lost until we discover that the way to defeat these monsters can be traced from our past. Further research reveals that humanity has discovered an ancient race the Sirians who had also fought and lost to Mental's might. Humanity finds the ancient Sirian technology known as the Time-Lock which can allow one person to traverse time and space. Our protagonist Sam, who may be very serious, is a champion, a hero, and a legend for humanity. Fighting off every alien he encounters to the end Sam, a true warrior, is given the ultimate task. To use the Time-Lock to travel back in time and to defeat Mental while he is busy dealing with the Sirians. The Gameplay:Serious Sam is revitalized in HD with a stunning thirteen levels (plus an additional two secret levels) digitally remastered and designed to meet the demand of modern day consumers. The graphics are not going to be anything like your blockbuster games, but that’s because the original was produced in 2001 and this is just a remastering. But the game looks rather clean and plays incredibly well. This game not only has secret levels, but is filled with little secrets for the avid gamer. Mysteries abound and things to find Serious Sam leaves you without want. Result:I played Serious Sam: The First Encounter only a little bit when it was released in 2001. Then purchased it recently because it was on sale. Not being an avid fan of the series I can definitely say this game is a fun purchase even if you never really played the original. There are an abundance of crazy enemies, a wacky story (that makes you keep wondering where all the humans are), awesome weapons, fun boss fights, and lots of crazy items. This game not only challenges you in combat making you feel like a hero, but also puts you to the test by throwing puzzles all over the place. The game requires you to solve puzzles, complete challenges, and defeat enemies in order to progress. The levels are long, the campaign is long, the game is a blast, it’s a must buy. If you like puzzles, you like first person shooters, you want nostalgia, or you just like to be a hero then this is the game for you.Pros:+Incredibly fast paced combat+Puzzles in every level+Secret levels and many secrets within each level.+Lots of fun an interesting enemies+An abundance of bosses+Crazy amount of fun weapons to shoot about+Digitally remastered and in 1080p+Fun and gripping story that mixes reality with fantasyCons:-There is a limit to the amount fo auto-saves, you will lose older auto-saves in order for new ones to save, but don't worry you can just continually make saves yourself (I had over 200 by the end of the campaign).-The sensitivity can randomly spark (meaning it just shoots up and your character can suddenly turn with only the slightest mouse movement facing you the wrong way).

												In recent news, Croteam PC game developer successfully merged video gaming with LSD and named the hybrid Serious Sam.This game is beyond fun even given its age. The graphics engine alone is beautiful and you will be able to run it on a semi-decent machine at full specs.The game's beauty lies in its ridiculousness at how many aliens you need to kill each level. The arsenal at your disposal is amazingThe tongue in cheek humour as well makes this game a gem that never gets boring.Not sure what the HD rerelease brings but it is definitely worth it. Grab it when it's on sale.Right now a game like this at 1.69 is beyond a steal.			"

												I find the 2nd Encounter better than the 1st SS, but it's up to you to decide. Anyway, 1st of all HD version is beautiful but old gnarled non-HD version for me way better (+ its easier to find secrets :) ).+Visuals - HD-rework looks beautiful - very high quality, very well done.+Sound - amazing soundwork, OST is simply the best, last levels songs providing goosebumps in huge amounts. Weapons sounds are great as well.+Gameplay - run and gun as is, huge amounts of enemies (especially if you are playing multi because a number of enemies increases with each guy). A Huge amount of secrets, an enormous amount of the jokes, and Sam is just brutal. Your mom sized monsters, your willy sized monsters, flying monsters, fish monsters, monster monsters, and a lot of deadly traps.+Multiplayer - Co-op for campaign, or PvP arenas, both very fun :)+Various difficulties - actually difficulties heavily affect the gameplay in this game - harder the difficulty - worse guns you find on levels, less ammo, lower amount hp healed by medkits, the amount of the enemies and their hp increased, they even become invisible, like all of them.+Lore - huge wiki describing all the enemies and weapons you face in your pocket, very fun and interesting to read+-Steam achievements - HD version includes steam achievements but they have 2 problems, 1st of all sometimes they just refuse to trigger, and 2nd there are a lot of multiplayer achievements that hard to get.-Lacks of Chainsaw, Sniper Rifle, Flamethrower and Serious Bomb.This game is the best, try both versions old and new and compare yourself, personally I like the Second Encounter way more than the 1st, but I can be wrong here, 1st Encounter is not that bad after all. Buy this game for yourself and your friends for a better experience, good thing that SS often put to the 90% discount, but actually it worth every penny.			"

												DISCLAIMER:  I played Serious Sam HD: TFE inside of Serious Sam HD: TSE, so I've logged more time than Steam would suggest.The first two Serious Sam games were pretty novel when they were first released.  As Sam, players ran through massive levels, fighting similarly massive groups of (often massive) enemies.  It wasn't exactly the most radical idea on paper, but it was executed on a  scale that was previously unheard of in FPS games.  Levels often had over a thousand enemies, with fights pitting hundreds of opponents against the player simultaneously; a few enemies were even larger than entire maps in other FPS games.Since then, several of the games Serious Sam has (inevitably) been compared to have caught up to Sam's scope--for instance, there are countless Doom ""slaughter"" WADs that will throw hundreds or thousands of enemies at you.  But whereas most of Doom's arsenal was never really intended to contend with thousands of enemies, Sam's was built from the ground up with mass extinction in mind, and its bestiary was designed for enormous arena battles.Weapons are your primary means of interacting with the world in an FPS and, in the case of Serious Sam, the arsenal is especially rock solid.  You begin with the typical pistol(s) and combat knife, but it isn't long before you're fielding double-barreled shotguns, miniguns, laser rifles, and even an enormous cannon.  Virtually every firearm fills a niche and will find ample usage--especially on higher difficulties.  Rockets might travel further to snipe distant stationary targets, but the grenade launcher can charge up significantly faster projectiles and shoot around corners; the laser gun doles out tremendous damage up front, but its projectiles take time to travel through the air; the minigun's hitscan shots can mow down faraway crowds, but its ever-so-slight wind-up is a liability in close quarters.  The guns generally feel great to use, as well.  With an appropriate thunderclap, the double-barreled shotgun reduces Kleer to bone fragments; the SBC Cannon's VW Bug-sized shots blast through enemies like so many bowling pins and wipe swathes of the battlefield clean.Enemies are well-designed, too.  Unlike later installments in the Serious Sam series, TFE and TSE don't make the mistake of having numerous hitscan enemies.  Rather, most opponents produce a variety of physical projectiles--some follow you, some scatter, some cut through the air in small volleys, and some lazily fly towards their target--that can be seen and dodged.  That one factor is crucial because it means that dodging can keep you alive even when fighting a hundred foes.  Indeed, Serious Sam almost feels like a sort of ""bullethell""-FPS at times, and by encouraging fancy footwork over taking cover, the game maintains a higher degree of momentum than many modern FPS games.  The sheer variety of enemies can be a refreshing change of pace from the standard/heavy/sniper trifecta that so many FPS games like to focus on nowadays.Then there are the levels:  They're huge, and they're especially gorgeous in the HD versions.  While TFE focuses exclusively on an Egyptian-themed mapset, it still includes some beautful setpieces including sprawling palaces, moody moonlit stretches, and Oases.  It certainly doesn't hold a candle to TSE's greater variety, but it does its best.  The maps are packed full of secrets--some obvious and some devious--as well as easter eggs and entire hidden levels.  If you're a completionist, be prepared to spend a lot of time hunting down some of these secrets.Given the size and scale of eveything, one of Serious Sam's biggest selling points is (perhaps unsurprsingly) its co-op support.  Up to 16 players can take on the campaign(s) in TFE and TSE, with a wide variety of player skins to choose from.  You've never really experienced everything a classic FPS has to offer until you're bunnyhopping across massive sand dunes, gunning down waves with half a dozen other players who look like cyborgs, neon cowboys, and Santa Claus.  In fact, there are several different co-op modes including a ""Coin-Op Co-Op"" arcade-style points/lives system that helps strike a nice balance between players having infinite lives and the level being over for a player the moment they die.  Honestly, I played countless hours of the original TFE and TSE years ago and I still feel that I got my money's worth with the HD remakes.  While they run on earlier versions of the Serious Sam 3 engine than Serious Sam: BFE, they're still perfectly capable of squeezing out some fantastic graphics.  And if you're planning to run TFE HD on an older computer, the sheer number of graphics options will let you tweak everything until it's just right.In conclusion, I'd happily recommend TFE HD to anybody who has enjoyed Serious Sam in the past, who is interested in taking a breather from modern FPS's, or who is simply interested in exploring what is now widely considered a ""Classic FPS"".

												This Game may not look like much on the outside. Just a grindfest with rooms full of enemies as you trudge from one room to the next. For a long time I thought just that and always avoided this series. On a whim (and recommendations from both totalbiscuit and yahtzee from zero punctuation) I purchased a little game known as painkiller. I loved the gameplay so much I bought Serious Sam HD Gold Edition. I have loved every minute of the serious sam series from its subtle humor to its satisfaction of coming out on top no matter the odds stacked against you. I HIGHLY recommend this game to any fan of first-person shooters or fans of challenging games. This is a true gem of a series and worth full price and more! I loved the series so much I bought a serious sam shirt and every time i typed the work series i almost typed serious. BUY THIS NOW! side note: this game is very difficult.			"

												First off, I am not a pro game reviewer.Graphics:I personally think the graphics are awesome, not photo real but it is not that kind of game.Game play:Intense.  The game goes from fairly slow to frantic paced.  The difficultly goes from don't hurt me to I like smashing my face against brick walls (not what the game calls it but I do LOL).There are many secret places to find and killer weapons to pick up, keep your eyes open.It is a fast paced shoot  things game that in my honest opinion is a ton of fun, but  for me the replay I think is small, your mileage may vary but for now one play will do me.Sound track:It adds pretty well to the atmosphere  of the game, at times maybe a bit repetitive but mostly very good.In the end, I think if you like FPS you should like this game, I recommend it. :kungfusam:			"

												An incredibly neat throwback to when FPS games were games and not interactive movies. It reminded me of Doom/Quake/Duke Nukem and a few other games at some points, yet the gameplay is somewhat more chaotic, and revolves around blasting away crazy enemies in wide open areas. Yup, this game seriously rocks. Fast-paced chaos, humour, nice design, cool enemies, sexy skyboxes, kickass music, crazy secret places and huge areas that take 30 minutes to get across await you!

Loved the run and gun style of the game.  Sometimes I like the seriousness of realistic shooters but sometimes I just want to cut loose and just kill stuff.  The Serious Sam series excels in this area.Good graphics, Good gameplay, funny lines, fun story and good challenge if played on higher difficulty.  I mostly played the single player campaign and loved every second of it.  If you're looking for the latest and greatest graphics then keep looking.  However if you're looking to relax, have fun and kill lots of enemies then this game is really up your alley.Give it a try, you just might like it!			"

												Serious Sam First Encounter HD is the remade version of the classical game from 2001, an excellent game with a new skin to keep it ready for a more graphics-wise judgemental audience. Serious Sam First Encounter HD will be a good buy for both new players wondering what the deal is with this thing and why everyone likes it, and the older gamers who remember the originals. It is as true to the original as it can get, with a few improvements.Storywise, it's nothing to write home over. It's a fairly standard story for a game that relies more on its gameplay than on captivating you with word words and more words. Aliens happened, they're after you, you're in acient Egypt and you have guns. Good luck!There is more to it, if you take the time to read into the story there are just enough flavourful blurbs and explanations around that you can read to figure out where your enemies came from, and parts of the storyline, though it isn't something that will carry you through the game, it's more like an extra.The true power of Serious Sam is in the gameplay, with excellent level design, guns that are satisfying to use, and a very high skill ceiling allowing you to feel like a god laying down devastation on hordes of enemies, moving fast enough to dodge almost all of their fire (Since all but a few enemies use projectiles, this means you can dodge nearly everything with enough practice) yet not too fast to become unmanagable. This, along with plentiful secrets, and a game that won't just say 'no' and throw up an invisible wall if you move slighly off the beaten path means that Serious Sam has an excellent grasp the concept of what great games are about- FreedomFreedom to choose your own tactics (And most are valid as well! No need to gimp yourself)Freedom to move as you pleaseFreedom to explore the levels and find all the secretsAnd the freedom to handle any encounter in the way you want to.Along with this, Egypt as pictured is a somewhat unique setting for an FPS game, with a lot of it lending itself for interesting levels and impressive scenery. The enemies you face are unique and mostly iconic as well, with the beheaded bomber and kleer skeleton being some of the more known enemies. In addition, Serious Sam has a great sense of humour, and you can play with a friend, two friends, or a whole army of friends.If you're interested in a great FPS game, this is a game for you.			"

This is a remake of the Classic series, Serious Sam, which are the First and Second Encounter on HD performance, and i have to say, this game has way better graphics then a lot of games that are coming out this few years, the kind that you really think its well done. About the game, the story is simple, nothing so hard to understand, the point of the game its just aim and shoot as many enemys as you can, and Serious Sam does that perfectly. If you are a fan of FPS Games and like to shoot as many enemys as you can, you definately need to play all of the Serious Sam Games, and try to play the games in order so you can understand the little story there is in the series.

There isn't that much i could call negative like the actual movement which feels a bit too slow, especially compared with Serious Sam 3, which is 3x times faster.

												The high definition remake of the original Serious Sam: TFE turned out to breathe some serious new life into the game.  One of the original kings of the FPS genre, Serious Sam does a lot of things right, with a few things wrong, and suffers a tad from being a bit of an old title.On the upside, the map sizes in this game are huge, providing a great open-world, fast-paced FPS adventure.  The voice-acting is nicely done with the expected humour and satirical remarks.  The design and layout of the levels are great, and very well-planned and make the game flow very well, but the downside to this game thing, is that if you manage to play for a long stint of time, the game manages to blend it's levels together and it starts to feel a little stale.Nothing about this game is really amazing or innovative compared to todays FPS games, but it does manage to create an atmosphere of non-stop action from start to finish.  There's always something to shoot around every corner, some new tactic to come up with, new enemies to fight and new weapons to pick up.  The old-school secret areas are also a great touch to the game providing secret weapons, armor, health pickups or maybe getting a weapon earlier than you would otherwise.The boss fights are pretty fun and in general the game is still really fun, the added benefit of the HD remaster in graphical fidelity and a few new features (autosave, etc...) really gets Sam back in the game.I would recommend this game to anyone who likes new or old FPS games, just give it a try, you might like it.

												Serious Sam is an arcade style shooter where you dodge bullets and face a huge amount of enemies. Despite seemingly simple and straight forward, you have to manage your ammo, choose the right gun for the right enemies, learn their attack patterns, prioritize certain targets while being mindful of the crowd of monsters storming you. The game is intense, especially towards the end, well worth a playthrough.The graphics are a bit old, the maps size is huge though mostly empty (except for secret bonuses and traps), but the idea of battling aliens in Ancient Egypt temples, palaces and cities is rather neat.

Review for Solo play :If you still haven't played the nearly masterpiece, in the brutish FPS genre, that is Serious Sam 3, go to play it now and come back here later.So have you loved SS3 ? Then SS1 is worth a deep look. It's in all aspects very noticeably inferior to SS3, but it's still brutish, full of enemy hordes, with a very solid FPS gameplay. It is however less polished and balanced than SS3, and it relies too heavily on quick save & load, which seriously impairs the flow of the game, and can get really annoying at times.Pros :- Very solid & classic FPS gameplay, with very efficient movement & weapon feelings- A lot A ton Hordes Swarms of enemies- Very decent HD remake that brings enough visual quality for my 2010's AAA spoiled eyes- Pretty decent final boss fight...Cons :- ... But lacks of memorable & interesting intermediary boss fights- Gameplay is too much based on quick save & load, as most heavy fights will require to know what monsters spawn from where- Most big fights happen in big open areas that end by all looking similar, meaning there's a lack variety in the battles and we feel we're just doing the same one over & over again- Very few indoor levels, and usually they are annoying because the enemies are designed for outdoor (eg: they are very fast and/or very powerful and thus are very hard to dispose of in close quarters)- Despite the HD remake, too much environment textures are still super low res- 1 ""boss"" fight seems to have been designed to exploit it as doing it the normal way is supra-hard, while using an obvious exploit (rocket jumping out of the combat zone) makes it ridiculously easyRanting Notes :- The differences between SS1 & SS3 should be taught in game design school. On the paper, these 2 games are very similar, but everything is better crafted, better balanced, more challenging & more enticing in SS3.- As I had played only a little bit SS1 a long time ago, it was funny to discover that most of the bestiary & environment originality of SS3 was already in SS1- Very often when you pick loot, it'll spawn new enemies ; sometimes it works well, ie: it lets you control the spawn speed & order, sometimes it works less well, ie: why do I pick this health potion as I'm going to lose 3 times the HP it gives to me to fight off the spawns ; sometimes it works very very badly, ie: oh, I walked on this because I was running away from too much enemies, and now I'm getting even more enemies ; and it's even worse if you don't notice you just picked up something that triggers additional spawn, coz you're in the middle of another spawning phase >_<- This review has only 1 time the word ""serious"" or its derivatives... Ok, now it's twice :P			"

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter, as you could guess. It was released in 2009 by Croteam and was also known as the first game to use Serious Engine 3. And yep, as serious as ever.It also came out on X360 through Xbox Live service. The only difference that I am aware of is that it had multiplayer only up to 4 players and aim assist.Multiplayer community seems to be dead. Okay, maybe not completely, I did get into some match once at one day. But in other times server list is completely empty. And it makes sense, since Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter has Fusion feature which means that owners of SSHD:TFE get to have Egypt levels to be ported into that game. So instead most of people play in SSHD:TSE.Premise of original Serious Sam is that Sam Stone is sent into past into Egypt to try to stop the Mental forces before they destroy the Earth. And to do this he would need to pass many levels that have sections designed to serve as arenas to lock players inside. You didn't have as much exploration as in Doom or whatever Quake clone game. Instead it was more focused in pacing and tactical choices during combat itself, with encounters lasting few waves, as enemies keep pressuring you to move around. There were a lot of different enemy types and you had a lot of different specialized weapons, so you would have to choose correct gun for each sitatuation, prioritize targets and avoid all the different attacks. It's a classic!HD is surprisingly faithful to the original. I kinda expected it to change a lot of core gameplay, but Croteam is just a honest indie company and gave a game just a nice graphics upgrade. Gameplay is almost same and the awesome soundtrack is completely identical. It's quite nice! And yep, even included Karnak from demo version, just like original. No technology test though.And yea, it looks excellent, with much more natural looking desert and canyons. And if you take a careful look then you will see that some details that was just part of texture is now actual geometry, for example. Though, environment feels not fully finished, as inner places didn't get any additional details and some models seemed to have same textures quality, like statues, despite having more destruction phases. Just good nice new rendering with new light. Though I do wonder about some changes. For example, Alley of Spinxh levels is always at night and the third level of tomb has a fog changed from nice blue color to some dusty brown. As if Egypt doesn't have enough brown color with all sand.But hey, look at all those great shiny weapons. And look at all the remade enemy models, now with ragdolls. Gore and weapons effects just got sexier, as you can now even gib part of enemies bodies, dismembering them, splitting apart, blowing head off with shotgun. It's awesome. Just look at the bull's death, where it would still slide around after being shot, leaving a trail of blood! And heavier enemies now can even be gibbed with a cannon, the heaviest weapon you have. The only strange thing is that Skeleton Kleers and Harpies are always gibbed upon death. For skeletons it looks good. But for harpies it looks strange, even gibs looks like just a few tiny chunks.It also got some nice editing on gameplay. Some beheaded have a saw on their heads, giving them a melee attack. Bomberman looks fancy with that head on a spike, even. And heavy biomechanoids only shoot a single rocket when close to player, to let him have it easier, while it almost always was a certain death being very close to one in original. Kamikazes also seem to have smaller radius of explosion too. Flying gnaars seem to be more dangerous, not stopping when attacking. And weapons switch was made faster, which I approve. Though for some reason you can't walk anymore. Not that it ever was needed, just fancy.If there is one thing I am most thankful the most is that new Netricsa messages notification is put somewhere to the side of a screen and doesn't grab your attention so you can ignore it easily. It was freaking annoying to be visually nagged by it everytime I killed each enemy types while playing custom maps in original.Though, not everything is going perfect and some cuts had to be made. Most noticeably is that some of obscure engine features of Serious Engine 1 weren't implented in Serious Engine 3. Due to this, all the gravity-changing shenagians had to be cut. To be honest, I don't miss them too much, in Serious Sam 1 they were used only as funny thing in a bunch of a secrets, plus once non-secret usage in a secret level. It probably costed more time to reimplent them for something so small. I mean, at least when Croteam was making the first Serious Sam they had plans to make it much bigger game, with futurustic levels which would abuse gravity features. Once they cut it all to be Egypt-only, well, it was pretty much funky leftover.It also doesn't have mirror and sliding surface, which I remember used only once.They also seemed to screw up weapon balance slightly. You see, minigun was made to shoot two times slower, but each bullet does two times damage and is supposed to consume two ammo. But it only consumes one. Result: There is no more reason to use Thompson and you effectively have two times more ammo for minigun than in original. Oh well.But hey, at least Laser gun isn't glitched in HD. It would sometimes start shooting only at half-speed in original. So flaw taken, flaw given.And multiplayer is still awesome. Didn't get to cooperative, but I bet it's same spam, with same cutscene-skipping. And competetive part is awesome, still fast-paced. Although I noticed that rocket-jumping got nerfed and jumping off the slope doesn't give you additional height. But you are supposed to use knife to run fast and it still gets you in many places. And yep, still awesome arena-shooter which proves that you don't need some fancy strafejumping to be balanced and fast-paced.Oh yea, and double shotgun in original was shooting at double speed. In HD it's same as in single-player/coop. Not sure what I think of it, but I think I like it this way. But maybe I need more experience with both ways.Oh yea, and did you know that original The First Encounter was particulary embaressing due to having only a single DM level? Thankfully, HD added a bunch of them, even including Little Trouble from The Second Encounter. Hm, though HD multiplayer doesn't have scorematch mode, only fragmatch. But no one, absolutely no one, was playing scorematch in original anyway, so nah.Overall, not perfect, but damn excellent HD remake with a bit of balance editing, untouched core gameplay, some environment upgrade and great gore system.And yes, those who want to play Egypt levels in Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter have to have this game purchased.

												Synopsis:The classic arcade FPS Serious Sam: The First Encounter, which scored an overall of 87% on Metacritic and was awarded Game of The Year 2001 on Gamespot, is now reborn in glorious high-definition for legions of long-time fans and a whole new generation of gamers around the world. Featuring dazzling visuals and revamped design, gamers take control of the legendary Sam Serious Stone as he is sent back through time to ancient Egypt to battle the overwhelming forces of Notorious Mental and the Sirian army.Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is essentially a remake of the original Serious Sam with a new Graphics Engine. New levels have been added and technically a new weapon, The Grenade Launcher, but this weapon was originally featured in Serious Sam: The Second Encounter.  The Graphics have been enhanced to a certain degree that someone new to the Serious Sam franchise will be able to jump right into it. Basically everything in game received the HD treatment, Weapon texturing and enemy texturing has vastly improved. Sound effects and music are pretty much still the same however.Gameplay is pretty much identical to the original iteration so nothing much has changed. However this comes to the first part that REALLY gets on my nerves with this game. Enemy spawns are damn near AWFUL. I lost count of how many times I died due to a Kamikaze spawning literally right on top of me. Enemy placement sometimes getting downright frustrating at times with for example Kleer Skeletons basically camping doorways and you get double ""clawed"" from two angles getting heavily damaged if not outright killed from such a attack. ""Trap"" Enemies are usually the work of lazy map designers. This same trap rule has been applied to ammo and health pickups as well adding on to the sentiment of being punished for picking up items which are supposed to help you.While the game was enjoyable there are many aspects which make it feel cheap and lazy. My recommendation is to either stick with the Original games or get Serious Sam 3.Final Score: 65/100			"

It doesn't have the Serious Editor or Survival Mode (those are both included in TSE HD), but I still definitely recommend this game.			"

												I'd recommend that you get this game but I strongly suggest you wait for a sale as it's not good enough in my opinion for a full price buy.Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game. It throws realism out the window for arena styled shooting that has a surprising amount of depth to it (memorizing how many shots to kill an enemy, learning to crowd control, finding secrets, etc.). There's a colorful cast of enemies and a handful of genuinely funny moments. When the cheap rock soundtrack is going and you're dominating the monsters around you, it definitely gets exciting.That said, it is a remake of a fairly old game and the age shows in certain aspects. Sam does seem to try too hard to be funny at times and the writing comes off as flat more often than it is funny. The game's design is pretty solid in most aspects but sometimes it just throws obscene hordes of enemies at you after it runs out of ideas, quickly devolving into frustrating tedium. The guns are also fairly mediocre for a classic fps as some of them tend to be used and handle in very similar ways (the tommy gun/minigun/laser gun are all essentially identical with dps and very slight chagnes in travel time being the only difference).Side note: If your game hangs on the final boss, check to verify cache as the steam client seems to forget to download a 5mb patch.

Mixing challenging encounters with interesting boss fights you really can't go wrong.Played it before or not, Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter belongs in every shooter's fan library for its brilliant throwback to older days when killing things was all we needed to do.

												After playing Serious Sam 3, I thought I would checkout this game. What can I say? It's actually the follow-on story to Serious Sam 3!! This story starts exactly where 3 left off . Despite it's age, the game is pretty good! Graphics aren’t bad and the gameplay is lots of fun. Since this game came first, you can hardly criticise it for being too similar to Serious Sam 3, but I would definitely play Serious Sam 3 first. Not only will the story make more sense, but you might find those similarities make 3 a little dull. That would be a shame since 3 is definitely the better game. Anyway, this one is well worth the money. It’s an old-school shooter that fast and furious and lots of fun. Buy it!			"

												No cover, lots of weapons, all man.One of the best frantic FPS just got even better.Not only the graphics are heavily improved, but the fluidity of the action feels a lot better than before.The game has some of the most well balanced difficulty levels I've ever seen; harder difficulties adds in more enemies or changes some to more menacing ones, instead of just tediously upping the damage output and health, which the FPS market likes to do.  It's a lot about quick decisions, rather than pure endurance and conservation, which helps with the afore-mentionned frantic flow of the series.  However, if you're not up for too big of a challenge, there are easier difficulties which makes it so that you're not missing out and right at home.If you're also a junkie for high scores, this game will not disappoint either.

												A doom-like series that, in a lot of times, will make you go: ""What the -beep-?!"" due to the surprising amount of ambushes from the enemy, the enemies you witness before you and some of the secrets can be interesting to discover. The weapons are just astounding and each new one with have you going: ""Ooohoohoohoooh!"" As frustrating as it can get, if using the right weapon on the right enemies, it can help you with defeating your foes and continuing on to win for humanity. Now get this game and get serious!			"

												A classic reborn. Serious Sam HD looks as good as the original did when it came out, but with modern graphics and standards. The gameplay is unchanged and as fun as ever.For anybody unfamiliar with Serious Sam, this game is anything but serious. There is pretty much no dialogue and a bare minimum plot. But that's because this is a classic FPS when games involved a character running around with more firepower than an Armored Tank Division. Blast your way through crazy enemies with bullets, lasers, rockets, and...cannon balls. One of the highlights of this game is the massive environment. While some maps are contained to the insides of buildings, lots of the game takes place outside in the deserts of Egypt and the maps are impressive. Not because there's a whole lot to see when running around a desert, but rather there's something majestic and awe inspiring to crest a dune and see a massive, ancient Egyptian city sprawled out before you.This is a run and gun masterpiece and worth every penny.

												Serious Sam (HD) plays like an old school game. No blood effects on your screen. No slow movement of the character. No gun limits. Secrets everywhere that are varied. No Cut-scenes. Tons of varied enemies. Projectiles you can dodge. Silly blood settings. If you like games where you just kill mindless amounts of monsters while traveling through Egypt I recommend this game. It is a pretty enjoyable experience and a faithful remake of the original without being tainted by influence of modern shooters.Beware though that the servers from what I have seen are pretty much dead, so unless you have 16 people to play with you won't be able to get the full experience of the multi-player in either death match or co-op.

He says he's going to kick behind and chew bubble gum and make poop down your neck. There are pigs and even women (which grandma says I shouldn't go near because they are bad (but I did when she wasn't looking, grandpa likes)) Between you and me, there is an arcade in the second level and a secret room with the 3rd weapon in the game. Duke Nukem 3D is well worth the time and is quite honestly, Grandpa's favorite game. 15,000/10 for badrear-ery.			"

												This game is just fun. Simple as that haha. I first played this game when I was in around 8 and I remember thinking then, ""This is the best game ever !"" And 13 years later I'm still believe that is true ! Using the Serious Sam 3 engine, Serious Sam: The First Encounter get's a whole new make over that makes that 8 year old in me happy. If you have never played Serious Sam, the throws waves upon waves of enemy keeping you on your toes as you progress throughout the levels. Going back to old school FPS mechanics, all you really have to worry about is shoot anything that moves. Story? Well monsters are attacking, You are Sam, and♥♥♥♥♥♥is getting serious, thats about it haha. So if you feeling a bit nostalgic and/or just wanting to find a game thats pure fun then definitely buy Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter.			"

												Best Quick Save Simulator Yet!Serious Sam Is a balls out old school fps and also the remake is one of the best remkes ever.You take on the role of ""Serious"" Sam Stone, Hes pretty much duke nukem's son, And always has some  great one liners here and ther (Serious Puns). Gameplay, its a old school arena shooter, you go to a big area, and swarms of aliens, zombies and other stuff swarm in to kill you. Youre weapons are standard 90s FPS weapons, Shotgu, Lazer gun, minigun, rocket launcher and other awesome weapons. The canon is awesome, it shoots a giant canon ball that rolls over bad guys, its the ""BFG"" of the game. now lets talk about the graphics, this is the HD remake and wow, this game looks amazing. everything cranked up and they game looks almost photo-realistic. If i could find i con i really cant, maybe just some cheap moments here and there but in general i really cant. Now this is HARD, seriously (Badoom-tis) you want to punch your monitor sometimes, but after playing throught it 2 or so times, i've gotten good. Over Serious Sam Is Awesome Game, If you dont have a PC that can run this then get ""Serious Sam Classics: Revolution"" its the original games combined in one game with widescreen support. I reccomend Serious Sam to any FPS fan looking for a challenge.Final Score - 8.5/10			"

												Do you like fast-paced action where there are only 2 objectives: shoot everything that you see and while not being killed? Then this game is for YOU!It might not have the GREATEST modern graphics, but at least the art taht you do see (example: an Egyptian city) has great art detail and passion that went into making the scenery. The gameplay might not force you to adapt to anything (besides learning to shoot-at-will and to run away as soon as new music plays), but it sure as Hell is interesting! I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy shooters where there are NO special abilities in-game, just simple, difficult, shoot-everything-that-moves gameplay.			"

The courtroom scene halfway through was done with astonishing realism; each part of the legal proceedings - including Sam contesting his $250 fine for parking in a metered spot using - occurred in real-time with little to no errors (as far as I could tell). The appearance of a clown in the final act had the promise of some comic relief, but - spoiler alert - he was quickly hit by a drunk driver.			"

												Good old fashioned shooter with excellent gameplay, very memorable sound, and very nice graphics. This game is a remake of the old Serious Sam: The First Encounter, and it uses the same maps and models just retextured and a a higher polycount. There are so many secrets in this game it's amazing and they are all fun to get. There is also amazingly fun multipayer, co-op and deathmatch. Play with your friends and have a blast!			"

												It makes me happy to see great originals re-made for the high quality that gaming has now settled in, so I don't mind supporting such things if they aren't free patches. Playing Serious Sam in HD is engaging and fun without being even slightly mentally exhaustive, as many games are after acouple of hours. If you like first person shooters and are willing to try a totally arcade world of amusing gameplay, then pick this up in a sale. If you played the original, this does it justice and will make for a fantastic replay(apart from the final boss being a confusing experience).			"

												★★★★☆Aaaaaaah now this was fun , after aaaaaaaaaaal these years I finally got my hands on First Encounter HD edition, after playing the original back when, what 15 years ago, it was really nice revisiting this game , but how to review Serious Sam ? there is no way, everyone knows this game is awesome , even better with friends, the HD remastering if you can call it that enhances the graphics quite a bit, but other than it doesn't change anything, if your the type of person who is use to iron-sights prepare to play a game with the mechanics from the old days , no iron-sights, no regenerating health, instead there is health-pickups and ammo scattered on the floor and monsters spawned in huge huge numbers, point is get Serious Sam HD : The First Encounter :P 4/5 !!!

												When I first got into PC Gaming way back when(around 2001), this was one of the first games I played. I first discovered the demo on a CD I had, and loved it. Sam's one liners, etc, It was/still is mindless shooting fun, and that's what gaming is suppose to be. Some enemies in the game are quite tough to deal with, for instance the werebull, which is a cross between some kind of cattle, and a bull. save your more powerful weapons for those, along with The Kleer Skeletons, etc. There really is nothing bad to be said about this game;Some have said on the forums that b/c the game is the HD Edition, it's ladened with rich and heavy graphics, they could not get it to run;Lucky for me though, this was not the case. So, if you like no nonsense shooters without much of a plot, one liners that will make you chuckle,  and more, then pick this one up;trust me, you'll be glad you did.			"

												If you enjoyed the 90s FPS Generation with games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Heretic, Shadow Warrior, Blood and many others others you will enjoy this game. Serious Sam is an old-school First Person Shooter, with all the elements that made classic games great: lots of weapons, no regenerative health, full action without cutscenes and the core: shoot everything that moves.Serious Sam HD is a remake of the 2001 version, with improved graphics, achievements and online features over Steam. I haven't played the original version before and for my surprise I was astonished on how fun this game is. There are several skill option, ranging from the easiest (Tourist) to the most hardcore (Serious). The game can be quite difficult and overpower at some times, and if you enjoy hard games there are plenty of options to make the game even harder than this. And trust me, this game is HARD. I would definitively recommend this game to anyone looking for  some old school action and nice HD graphics.			"

I'll just keep playing the original"".The remake might as well be a whole new game, but with the same weapons, enemies, maps, etc. Which sounds like an oxymoron, but you would have to play the game to see what I mean.Strongly recommend.

												Well it's exactly as advertised. An HD remake of the first encounter. Unless your computer can't handle it it's the best version of Serious Sam. There's nothing new here, but nothing has been removed either. It's literally the same game as the classic TFE but looks AMAZING. If you don't already have the games the Hd versions are the ones to get (unless like I said your pc can't handle it). If you already own the games there wouldn't be a point in getting these unless you want better visuals(I have all versions of the games on steam because I love them).If you've never played the games before it's basically an FPS where you fight massive groups of enemies in large, open, arenas, shooting, strafing, and jumping like a cracked-out spidermonkey with an unquenchable thirst for mass murder and an warrant for death. You will hear people compare it to quake/ DOOM and while it is closer to that side of the spectrum it doesn't really play like them at all. The ID games were designed more like mazes, while SS has more straightforward level design and is focused solely on combat. Not to say that SS has poor level design (it's quite good!) it's just a different style. The only real issue I could see anyone having with the game is the fact that the entire encounter takes place in Eygpt, but they do a really good job of incorporating variety into the levels, and sure the setting of the game stays the same, all the levels feel different. They are all really well designed and interesting/fun to go through. Some people might also whine about plot development, but I'm pretty sure if your'e playing a game for a narrative you are looking at the wrong form of entertainment. Go read a book. Punk...  Seriously.			"

												This is an amazing game, even though i havent played the original SS, i can say this is really great, the HD graphics look nice on ultra even if its an old game. The action is really fun, but keep in mind that this game has non existant single player mode, if you want to play single player you have to buy the 2nd encounter which i also have it and its amazing too. Lastly, this game is mostly about multiplayer where there are 2 modes co-op and deathmatch which both are really fun.P.S- in the 2nd encounter, the multi player is inactive, noone plays it.I recommend this, along with the 2nd encounter.

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a very action packed old-school shooter, like Duke Nukem, where the main focus of the game is just to keep shooting with a tough-guy character as the protagonist. The HD graphics look great, but there are many areas too big for nothing, so they look rather plain, and travelling across them is a pain, taking too much time. The story could have been better told in cinematic form rather than a large paragraph of text.I know this is an old game, but this was my personal opinion. It is a rather good game for an old one.My Rating: 6/10If you love old-school shooters, then this is definitely 9/10 for you.			"

												Awesome HD remake of the first game which was already awesome. For a serious sam fan you should probably go over this one except if you want the old school nostalgia feeling with the old one.However, The HD remake really takes what the classic one is and brings it into gorgeous HD with a turely amazing experience while playing watching freaks just explode infront of your face.Nevertheless I can do nothing but recommend this one especially if you're a fan of the classic ones!This one offers a very fresh experience.

												Oh my god, this game is a masterpiece! Now with HD graphics, are you kidding me? I used to play this game back in 2004 and I always thought that this game and Unreal Tournament 99 were the best FPS ever created! I still think this one is one of the best FPS's.There's a storyline, a guide with every monsters you kill/weapons you recieve and lots of secrets. It also has very nice graphics in the HD version and the music is awesome as always. It has a surpringsly long campaign too!I don't know if you'd like this game as a newcomer to the series, but I would give it a try. I'm going to finish both game whenever I have time!Just a little warning though, you will jump off your chair a few times while playing this.			"

												*jump**shoot**jump**shoot**jump**die**repeat*6/10+Fun system, pleasing to look for secrets and loot+Updated graphics, but still has that old feel. If I didn't know it, I'd say my enemies were flat. (That's a good thing, trust me.)+Runs 60 FPS on every system I've tested on, no matter what the graphics settings were+Lots of customization in settings (Basically, you have the options to change what color/kind of blood you see, and how the atmosphere of the game looks like.)+Database system encourages researching enemies, and quickly identifies the foe you are fightingx Level design, it can be really good at times (Puzzles, mild parkour), but otherwise, it's straight and forward or it's an arenax Lots of difficulty settings, but they feel really poorly designed (I'm playing at normal, and it seems way harder than normal. I've played easy, and it's way too easy. There's at least 6 different difficulty setings. :B)x Saving! You can save, great right! Not really. So, in the game, you can press F6 to quickly save your game. Otherwise, if you die, you are set back to the start of the level. This sucks when you forget to save or are too busy getting blown up to save.x Sound quality. First off, Sam is hilarious. He says some super-generic puns that'd you'd expect from a cheesy action movie or Duke Nukem. But, the enemies sounds... Well, you got the Kamikaze who screams his a** off when he charges, Scorpion bosses sound like someone taking a sh**, and the Bone Horse-thingies are too loud. The game's music isn't that great, but you can't really mute it, because sounds play such an important role in knowing when you're going to be attacked-SUPER REPETITIVE, I kid you not. Combat doesn't change, it just gets harder because the enemies have more health, fire more bullets, or are more plenty in numbers. The combat is basically just jumping and shooting, avoiding enemy charges, or tearing down hoardes.-LEVEL DESIGN! (I know I said this already, but...) There's this one level that was just agony. You start off with your pistols and shotgun (Only the shotgun does good damage) and you have to go into a large field with enemies. Once you kill them all, you have to fight another wave. Then, another wave of harder enemies come. Then , you fight a boss. Then, another boss, and then another, much larger boss. Again, this all takes place in the SAME FIELD.-Plot doesn't justify the game. Why am I fighting? How did I get here? Why are these enemies spawning? Why are there so many? Why do they look the same? What am I looking for? Isn't there a much easier way? What do you mean I have to read about it? It'd be so much easier to explain if it took place in hell.IN CONCLUSION[/b]-Well worth the $1.50 I paid for both of the games-A lot like old games like DOOM or the original Serious Sam-You could probably get much more enjoyment from another game, but this game does have its perks-I'd say it's NOT worth the Steam price (14.99 for the first game, 30.00 for both.)-Good if you're looking for an easy-to-run game to pass the time "

												Basic. If you're looking for a shooty game, then this one is for you. This game is a budget one with some touchups, hence the HD in the title. It does it's job well enough. You face a variety of enemies, and have a standard selection of weaponry to take these guys out. If you've played any FPS games from the last 20 years, then these really won't surprise you. Pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, machine guns, lazer gun, grenade launcher, and this game's crowning achievement: the cannon ball launcher. Its standard now, but maybe back when the game first came out that wasn't the case. At least the monsters you fight look pretty unique and interesting. From bony bovines to the mildly amusing headless suicide bomber, its pretty alright. At the very least it adds personality, which this game doesn't exactly have an abundance of. The hero, sam the serious, is more or less forgettable. Its easy to forget you're playing a character, save for the few moments he says something, which is also unremarkable in execution. Its a strain to talk about the interesting things with this game. Level design is ok. You go through Egyptian styled hallways. Sometimes you might find a secret or a branching path, but it'll always lead back to the hallway. That's integral to the game design, seeing as how more than likely that hallway will lead to a big square chamber; the game's bread and butter. It then proceeds to spawn mobs over and over in waves. This repeats again and again. Sometimes you might have an objective you need to complete, or an item you need to collect, but most of the time will be spent fighting waves of enemies. This game was probably more exciting when it first came out. But now its pretty standard. Most of it is enjoyable shooting fun. There's a rush involved when you're dodging loads of enemies. My main complaint would be the final boss, which betrays the entire rest of the game. Instead of a big huge balls to the wall fight, you get a fight where you run, wait for a door to open, and then circlestrafe until you win. Disappointing, and near impossible in my experience. The final boss needs to be in a specific area of the final map for you to win. The problem is, the final boss only stops to shoot at you. The rest of the time it is moving towards you are relatively the same speed as you move. So, you have a constantly moving boss, in an arena where you need it to be in a specific place. This does not a good final boss make. I ended up cheating to win, and I closed the game and called it a day.It's not bad. But I wouldn't call it exceptionally entertaining either. It's ok.			"

												Despite several attempts I don't see the pull for this game despite that fact it's very, VERY difficult fps. I swear it's like someone put something like this to try and force competition with everyone. I really don't see any story or why people seem to love this game so much.Update: going back and accepting I don't have the mad (or Serious) reflexes needed for this game I lowered the difficult from Serious and found I had a lot more fun with it and have advanced through many different temple stages, though difficulty still amps up quite high, especially with Kamakazis attacking you!Honestly though, this game is pure gold. I love it's humor, I love how it's never static where creatures spawn. If you try being smart like I try to be, you get attacked by that damn Kamakazis so I suggest headphones or decent speakers as you will need to listen for the ""AAAAAHHHHH"" before it's too late and you get blown to peices.There are many things to love about this game with it's design and the design of some of the strange otherworldly creatures who see you as an immediate threat and attack you in their own ways, the monster logs making this more fun to learn about these creatures and where they come from.I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play an old-school FPS. No school like the old school with FPSs imo. Especially on the PC where we've had classics like Doom and Wolfenstein back in the day that invented the genre.			"

												This is one of my favourite games for the following reasons:1. One of the best methods to reduce my anxiety. Playing this on Easy or Tourist difficult depletes my stress massively.2. I'm beginning to play this on Normal difficulty, and I'm starting to feel as if I could be decent at FPS games.3. I really dislike bloody murder of humans, so I murder these nonhumans with the Kids blood and gore option.Also, I think the Beheaded Kamikaze is sexy.			"

												An old-school shooter that starts out strong, but falls apart by the end by flooding the player multiple times with such a large amount of enemies that after killing about half of them, the act becomes too monotonous to enjoy.Buy it if you have an itch for old-school FPS games with decent graphics, but avoid otherwise.

Its can get ridiculously hard in singleplayer, but it sure is fun.

												This game hates you. Once you think an area is clear, the 50th boss fight for that level immediately spawns, and you didn't save. Soon, you will learn to hate it right back. You'll learn what does and doesn't trigger those big swarms of enemies, you'll learn that maybe you shouldn't always look forward, and that maybe you shouldn't always go into secret rooms because then 10,000 monsters will all spawn right on top of you.Despite being a fairly old game, it feels as though it was made just to point and laugh at casuals. There's this one part near the beginning where there's this fairly noticeable shortcut to skip an ENTIRE SECTION of the map if you feel like fighting off a swarm of tough enemies. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a good FPS game.			"

												Serious Sam is one of my all-time favorite game franchises. The HD remakes of the First and Second encounters are an excellent way to get into the series if you never played the original from 2001.Diverse enemies, fun weapons, and plenty of one-liners. As a big fan of ancient Egyptian history too, the maps are very cool to run around in. After all these years, I keep coming back because it is one of the few FPS to still give me a satisfying challenge on Serious difficulty. Highly recommended, especially if you can pick it up for cheap during a sale.			"

												Welcome to Ancient Egypt folks.  On your left, a screaming pack of headless kamikazes.  To your right, a green, four armed demon, and behind you, a lava monster.  Meet Sam ""Serious"" Stone, star of one of the most ridiculous shooters ever made.  With an updated engine, new models, and improved textures, Sam returns to his roots in the first game he ever starred in.  Much like its predecessors: Doom, Quake, Duke Nukem, Serious Sam aims to overwelm you with waves of enemies running straight into your crosshairs.  Explore the secrets of Ancient Egypt with your friends.  Co-op multiplayer is a blast!  If you like mindless killing and simply holding down your left mouse button, this is definitely a game for you!			"

There some very intense moments as you go through the game but if you've already played through serious sam 3 like me, you should have no real problems. Still, a good game as a part of the franchise which is the reason I bought the whole pack in the first place.			"

												Reviewers say the gameplay is identical to the original standard definition edition. They also say the HD graphics really don't add much, and you'll soon get bored of looking at the shiny finish on things. They report it is buggy. Not one glitch/bug did I 'encounter'. The high definition (HD) graphics literally stun. Hours I added to playing time adoring the rich textures and details, and amazing places. Often (after action had stopped,) I would unexpectedly pause in my tracks, and gasp at the visuals. (Woah.)If I still had the original games and played them over lots and recently, maybe then the experience might not work.  However I think I gave my original copies to a charity shop to sell, many years ago. The game was fresher, and more captivating than I ever remember, now sumptuous from HD look. I say it's twice the the game impact of the original, that reviewers say was great. First timers, and veterans of games; try maybe no higher than hard difficulty at first attempt.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I thought it would bring some classic, fast paced shooting fun that I haven't had in a while. It did, but it tossed in other things that I'd say ruin the game.(I played on normal difficulty, so my complaints may not be as big of a deal on lower difficulties)Biggest complaint: If you're playing by yourself, be ready to be completely swarmed by enemies, to the point where it's near impossible to get by. There's a part with frogs, where if you don't do the technique just right, you're gonna get pretty screwed pretty quick. Or another part later in that I ran into, where there's hundreds (not kidding) of skeletal things (dogs? maybe?) flooding down a path at you, where you can't really keep the enemy line back, and even if you somehow can, you'll run out of ammo far too soon for it to matter. Can't seem to get around them, either. They'll just crowd around you and kill you in seconds. (came back on this part to find rocket jumping over the spike pit makes it possible, but still irritating.)Other than that, the game can still be cruel in ways it really shouldn't. You found a +1 Health sitting in a corner? We're gonna spawn 5 enemies right behind you when you pick it up. You decided to walk around the whole area instead of just directly going where you have to? We're going to spawn wave after wave of enemy for each little path you go through. It's tedious, and oh so annoying.Then there's just a few nitpicky things, like sometimes with the dual revolvers, the left revolver will shoot 1 more time while the right revolver reloads, then you have to wait for the left revolver to do its whole reload animation before you can shoot again, or some areas you fight in being a bit too tight for the enemies you are fighting in them.tl;dr Solo playing this is fun at first, but is a chore or even a nightmare later in. Probably better with a friend, but who still plays this?			"

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is an old school shooter set in Acient Egypt, with the protagonist being Serious Sam, a superhuman badass who must go back in time to save Earth from Ugh Zan's invason of monsters! The game itself is amazing, with every minute being filled with non-stop action and shooting. Best part is, there are no objectives. 1 mission for every level: Make it to the end! Now i should note, if you want to start at the very beginning, play Serious Sam 3: BFE first, (BFE = Before first encounter). The achievements in this game are insane, and serious dififculty almost made me ♥♥♥♥ing quit this game. Even on normal this game is tough as nails, but very fun and enjoyable. Another thing i love are the secrets. The secrets are so useful and cool, that even sometimes are surprising because of how much effort are put into 1 mesely secret. Now one of the BEST parts about this game are the enviorments. The grassy and sandy enviroments are so amazing, each level has its own unique enviorment, from sandy egypt-styled enviorments to grassy enviorments, the enivorments are one of my favorite parts about this game! Just look at these enviorments! 


That's a long path...

Especialy in the later levels, like Metropolis City. Hell, even the Sewer level didnt fail to give me a damn good level design! There are 13 levels, (15 including the 2 secret levels), and each level is filled with monsters to gib and kill! There are also a lot of puzzles in this game too, mostly levers, pressure pads, etc, but these puzzles give the game a bit more to offer than just killing enemies. The 2 secret levels can be unlocked by doing certain things, but im not telling you how! :3 Now i must say, the game did give me some glitches, not game breaking glitches but otherwise minor glitches that were still noticable. I also thought that sometimes even on Normal that some parts seemed like i was playing on Serious, but then i remembered that this is an old school shooter, and that this is what an old school shooter is all about: Shooting and killing! Overall, Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a blast to play! I highly reccommend it to anyone who loves a great old school shooter!~~~Final Verdict:8.5/10: Amazing!~~~			"

												Worth buying if you get it on sale and playing for a few hours until the fun starts to wear off.Otherwise:• it's an 90s style FPS, like DOOM 1&2 or Painkiller• good antidote to overcomplicated puzzle games• you'll get bored of staring at indistinguishable Egyptian temples about an hour in; it goes on for a lot longer than that• level design over-relies on some ""cheap"" feeling gimmicks like teleporting monsters into the world behind you• levels feature prominent, genuinely funny booby-traps• has working, non-mandatory co-op multiplayer• one technical flaw with the audio: no HRTF. You can't locate sounds by ear very well because the way the game simulates sound isn't detailed enough (it doesn't simulate phase differences caused by sounds arriving at your ears at slightly different times, which is the most accurate mechanism your brain has for working out which direction a sound is coming from)• some of the monster designs are bad, by which I mean tedious to fight (stupid undead bullet-spongy ponies)• occasionally the game throws one or two hundred of its most boring monsters at you (ugh so many ponies)• some of the weapon designs are crap, by which I mean they hit like wiffle bats and that's just boring• unfortunately, all the voice acting and the sounds… sound like they're from a 90s FPS. Ew.			"

												I refunded this game. Before you continue reading, please know that I am a professional video game critic.The problem with this game is not really that it is a bad game. The problem is that there are better games with the formula that this game uses. The level design isn't good, and that is why killing enemies feels like a chore after a while. The guns don't feel that good either. Why do I recommend this game if I am writing negative you may ask? That is because most people might not have played Quake 2, DOOM or Shadow Warrior.If you haven't played the above mentioned titles, I think you will have a good time with this game.			"

												8/10I played this years ago, then i decided it was the right time to buy and replay it on Steam, becasue this is an amazing title, and so i wanted it to be on my library.It's an amazing FPS, there's a lot of humour in it, tons of monsters, fun guns etc, all in a HD version which is really good, visually many times better than the original.Not too bad that the story is kinda ""meh"", but believe, the gameplay will capture you, whith unique levels' design, secrets and situations.

												It's quite a fun game, got in the complete pack when it was 90% off. Couldn't stand playing the classic as it looks too ugly. Whereas the HD version is tolerable in how it looks.I like that it's full on fps with plenty of hordes of enemies to kill.I dislike enemy placement way too many are put in a small space or coridor making it hard to avoid attacks at times.Game is way too short, my first play through only took 8 hours to get through all the levels and then kill the final boss.Would not recommend buying this game as it's too short. 8 hours of one playthrough is just a day, to complete, not even a weekend. Don't bother with this game if you want a good single player game, I can see you'd get more playability out of this if you do multiplayer. I'd rate it 6/10			"

												There is a very specific reason I don't reccomend this game:If you are new to the series, it gets boring really quickly because of its repitition.However, most people that buy this game are old enough to have played it when it came out, and they're playing because of the nostalgia they have towards the game.If you didn't play it when it came out, don't buy it. You won't have the nostalgia to keep you going.			"

												First of all i love old school  fps games. So this isn't about the game's age. Problem is this game failed as a shoot'em up, because of shooting feel. It feels  exactly like virtua cop 2 (gamer dinosaurs unite!) which is a very bad thing about fps games(not for arcade games). Just click and shoot, you can't feel any thing (hit or being hit). Like shooting clouds. By the way, I can speak about other annoying things like spawning enemies, similar levels etc. But i don't, cause it's useless. Everything about single player is coming short. And i think the devs probably know that, cause above the %80 achievements are about multiplayer deatmatches. And guess what, multiplayer is dead. Surprise(?) i don't think so. Well for the final i can say, if you like this game (or nostalgia) and have friends like yourself, you can buy it (on sale of course).  Otherwise i don't recommed it, even on sale. Especially new players, look for other games friends, this game was all about hype and hype was dead long ago.			"

												Well, i played this games (Serious Sam I and Serious Sam II) in my adolescence and it brings me memories.That would be the main reason which i bought it for, however, as a gamer for about 15 years by now, i would say that Serious Sam is a fun-to-play-with-lot-of-friends game but only if they can argue and chat by voice so you can hear them complain about the flaws, bugs and hateful mobs.I haven't play it in single player, but i forsee its going to be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ as mobs spawn too much and the game itself is boring. You only have to kill, you can't level up, there is no sense of rewarded-challenge- The difficulty level increases as more and more mobs appear in specifically hard spots where, to aim, you have to ignore all the melee attackers and guess what? melee will continue spawning until you kill those big mobs far away.Its a thumbs up what they did with the graphics, but it sucks that mods usage doesnt count for challenges, for example, What would be the problem with my steam badges if i choose to play as a Patrick Star (SpongeBob friend) character?In conclusion:-Play only with friends with microphone-Dont rush-Dont play the whole game in one stand (is even more boring)-Buy only if you like shooters-Its very repetitive, and gets harder each 100 meters you walk-You are going to die a lot of times-You are going to curse some challengesWould i recommend it?Only if you have lots of friends with microphone playing it at the same time AND/OR if you played it as a kid and you plan to play it again.

NOTE: This game is FUN HOWEVER, I just don't recomend it to people like me, who are looking for a frantic single player experiance. Dang I wish Steam had a ""MEH"" buttonIs this game bad? NOIs this game great? NOIs this game heavily flawed? YESDo I recomend it? Eh... I am going to have to go with ""NO""Welcome to the world of Serious Sam, a strange world where you goal is to kill anything that moves. Sound fun? It is! A ton of unique diverse levels for your crazy brain to plow through. Tons of enemies and great satisfying levels make for what should be a phenomenal game! Why isn't it then? Simply put the levels have some of the worst design choices I have ever seen in any game I have ever played. Sure some points the levels can be a blast, like the first half of City of Memphis - Metropolis where you have to go around a city styled maze and collect the 4 scarabs while avoiding the waves upon waves of different enemies that are searching for you in the maze, and City of Memphis - Sewers with some original designs and very generous enemy placements which make for a unique intense experience. However, 2 MAJOR flaws bring what should be a great game quickly down to some of my least favorite games of all time.First MAJOR FLAW: Unfair Padding/ Poor Level Design:Red signs of these problems start to appear however once you start playing the second half of the level City of Memphis - Metropolis, there is a pit with spikes with a chaingun that is supposed to spawn across from it to signify that you should go over there, although the first time I did it, it didn't spawn. A bull comes barreling across the pit and of course in classic game fashion it saves right as it is about to hit you giving you exactly 1 second to respond once you load up the save which is a whole different can of worms. Once you cross the pit you hear more bulls, a few dozen come flying at you and it shouldn't be a problem until those freaking skeleton running things come running at you and guess what... there are well over 100 of them. Earlier I did say how waves and waves can be fun... but only in well designed arenas like the one previously mentioned. However at this part it is just a straight hallway leading to a double door where they are spawning.They even continue to spawn even when you get on top of their spawn point making them practically impossible without rare or even unfair luck. Prior to this the level Oasis is entirely padding. From the first part of the level with the outside madness of hundreds to enemies to the ""boss encounter"". Why is it in quotes? Because, frogs... They decided that whenever creating a game, if you want to pad a level over 8 minutes without putting in any effort is spawn hundreds of small enemies that kill you easily inside a small square room. GENIOUS! It's not that I am against difficult games, because I am not (just look at my achievement list that includes Cave Story + Blood Stained Sanctuary which is one of the HARDEST levels in video game history). This happens more than once throughout each levels, some more then others which makes the game very hard to enjoy. From what it seems, they took a lot of time designed the first part of a level (excluding everything in Oasis) and then just decided ""Man I took way to long on that level and it's not even up to the adverage length! Lets spawn 1000000 enemies!"" which is most unfortinute.Second MAJOR FLAW: Enemy SpawningAs I stated above briefly whenever you get near where an enemy spawns it does regardless, making for a practically instant death. An example is in Oasis in the first room you have the ability  to grab health on the edge of the valley. Once you get over there, enemies have the ability to spawn and can spawn directly on top of you which lead you directly to death. This happens a lot of the time in the game and really bogs down the experience.ConclusionAnd those are my main problems with the game. Does it make it terrible? No. Does it make it unenjoyable in every sense of the word? Yes. Unfortunately what Croteam fails to see is that when designing a level one should design it well and not but one hallway with a few hundred of the same enemies spammed to be sure to kill you artificially lengthening the level, and expecting a player to know where an enemy spawns before it spawns which leads to an almost instant death is just cruel. I did finish the Demo Level on Hard difficulty and I had a blast. But I played on the 5th level of this game on Normal and I felt like I was being killed just for the sake of padding. Again, NORMAL what most people start playing a game on. Overall I recommend this game for friends. But as it stands this is one of the most unenjoyable single player experiences on Steam.Pros:+ Fantastic graphical style+ Fun setting and level styles+ Fun and uniquely satisfying weapons+ Fun and diverse enemies+ Fantastic MultiplayerCons:+ Absolutely atrocious level design+ Abysmal enemy spawning mechanic+ Very Very Poor singleplayer experience leading to no fun at all.Overall: 5.8/10 ""Major flaws that bring what should be a great game down low""			"

												Great game, chaotic and a blast to play, especially with friends!So why am i not recommending it? Because for only £3 more you can get The Second Encounter. It contains a lot more levels, weapons and enemies, and the entire campaign from the First Encounter!I suggest you only get this if you're a collector, or can't afford to pay out another £3 for some reason.

												First part of the game is pretty good, with interesting level layouts and beautiful visuals.The real problem with this game lays in the latter half of the game within the final 2-3 levels. Each enemy encounter becomes a MASSIVE grind fest killing the same 2-3 enemies over and over in giant waves within the same looking giant box. Over-all, it isn't a terrible game. The first part of the game is fun, but latter half is incredibly boring.However, if you're considering buying this; skip it. Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter has this games campaign included in it. Save your money by buying THAT one instead. I would not recommend buying this based on that fact alone.And please note that is the ONLY reason I do not recommend this.			"

												I was really looking forward to playing this game after many years, but since the developers don't seem to have a clue on how to help people who have purchased their game (believe me, I have tried everything with the 'Executable signature verification failed' - error); I am deleting it.99.9% of all games I play on my computer work perfectly, so I was quite surprised Croteam hasn't fixed this yet; I mean, the game has been out for years. Sure, one could debate whether one should be a computer wiz or not to be able to fix it, but I believe this should be the responsibility of the developer. So, I am not spending another minute with it, there are better games out there that work from the start.Sorry Croteam, this is not OK. Good luck with future games though, but I will not try them or even buy them.If you are wondering about the info:""0 hrs last two weeks / 0 hrs on record"" - it's because it didn't start obviously.

												I know what people will say. ""Git gud"" or ""this is an FPS for REAL hardcore gamers"". This game is just plain old unfair. It's not like other classic FPS games that give you a challenge that is satisfying when you overcome it. This one just kicks you in the balls on a constant basis. What happens in DOOM when you find a secret room? You get a ton of health, armor or ammo and you feel like you made a small little accomplishment. You get rewarded for your effort. What happens in Serious Sam when you find a secret? You get an item that gives you 1 HP and spawns a mass amount of enemies right behind you that will take off 40 HP from you in a second. Why the hell would I wanna seek out secrets if your gonna punish me?The enemies also have a really annoying spawn system. Walked into a new corner of the map? Spawn enemies. Grabbed an item? Spawn enemies. It's so constant and they spawn all around you. You're often unfairly ambushed.Obviously this is the point of the game. To be punishing. But guess what? If there's no sense of accomplishment at some point, there's no reason to play it. Dark Souls makes me feel really good in between making me rage. This game doesn't in the least. I haven't beat it yet (got to the mass stampede of those skeletons and bulls right after you get the minigun) but I can't play it for more than 15 - 20 minutes without taking a break. It's so damn monotonous.Yeah, it's a classic to many, and I won't say you're wrong for loving it, but to me Serious Sam is the worst of the classic, challenging FPS games like DOOM, Duke Nukem and Quake.

												The voice acting is pretty good, it's quirky and even inspiring sometimes- though more often than not cliché and watered down in to one liners.The gameplay is essentially Doom 2 with a few new enemy behaviors and more rooms to be locked in until you clear them out entirely of said enemies and much longer and larger levels.If you think finding secrets and exploring levels is going to benefit you in any way, think again. Exploration and finding secrets is punished abrasively as an artificial difficulty increase. You might get some bonus health, or extra armor, or a new weapon a little early compared to finding it on the beaten path you're seemingly expected to rush through, but you wind up being ambushed by enemies that will more than likely make the collected secret not worth grabbing.The sound design leaves a lot to your imagination and even more to be desired. You can often hear enemies before you see them, usually you'll hear ones hiding in ambush of you going to secret chambers and stuff, which is sort of a way to know where not to go though it's not always useful since the orientation of where sounds are coming from is not properly given to the player regardless of how you have your audio set up. (Even on a 5.1 you can't audibly tell where an enemy who's ahead and to the left of you is without it being in your direct field of view) which makes for some more awesome ""ambushes"" from enemies that are around corners and behind walls from you.The ""intense mood music"", which plays only when enemies are actively pursuing you, became annoying not even 3 minutes in to semi-active combat.Overall this game is not ground breaking, it'd be better named as ""Frantic Frank"". Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is bold irony and a step back as far as FPS titles are concerned.If you want to play something similar but actually good check out Rise of the Triad. "

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a very direct remake of the 2001 sleeper hit it is based on. To summarise, the game's an arcade focused FPS where you success is driven by fast reflexes and ability to chain points. Besides some glossy modern day improvements cosmetically including: a new physics engine, gore, some destructable environments and DX9c quality visuals, this edition is no different now as it was nearly ten years ago from release. It's fairly upsetting, and actually the game's flow still never manages to be as fluid or smooth as I remembered from all those years ago. Perhaps Serious Sam HD's biggest fault lies in that it hasn't taken advantage of any major gameplay improvements made in it's sequels, like Serious Sam: The Next Encounter on Gamecube even. The presentation is fairly average with below average menu navigation and poor multiplayer lobby support. It's an easy game to run, and supports the Xbox 360 controller but this release is tough to endorse otherwise.			"

But how does it hold up today?Pros:   Graphically the game looks beautiful and highly detailed for an old game remaster. Physics feels good and makes killing so much fun.  Core gameplay is good and twitchy shooting is at least fun at the start of the game.Neutral:  Multiplayer is really chaotic and unstable, but at the same time it’s worth to try. Unfortunately it’s hard to find a single match nowadays. Not enough boss fights. There are only a few gigantic bosses, but I wonder why devs didn’t make some more? Cons:  It’s absolutely the most repetitive game I have ever played. Same enemies, patterns, areas get so boring after a few hours.  There is some kind of a story about getting back to ancient times. However, it presented in a really poor way - dull looking text between missions. Oh, and fonts are small too to make player suffer even more. Glitchy achievements.  Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a good remaster, but a very average game at it’s core, due to repetitiveness and lack of more interesting features.6.5/10   "

												First preson shooter with no sense for combat.This game is dreadfull. I dont know what made the series a household name, but i know that it wasn't ""The First Encounter"", the gameplay is just terrible.You shoot things, over and over and over again, and its dull as it can get, the weapons have not kickback, or response to you in any way.The storyline and overall design tries to be funny but fails miserably and turns out to be just weird...Then you got to higher difficulty to get a challenge, but then you just fail because you are supposed to, not because of lacking the skill (enemies get incredibly strong while you are still a walking brick that can barly dodge).Dont buy it. Dont even waste your disk space if you get it for free, all that time you would sacrifice...'nuff said.			"

												A poor game that has aged terribly.If you're on a nostalgia kick for the original, then it does what it says on the tin; but the game's only gimmick back in the day was the wide-open maps; something that became common place over a decade ago.Fans with rose-tinted specs may try and tell you it's ""a classic""; it's not.  Even back when the game was originally released it was average, and it has only got worse.			"

												Don't buy this, I'm serious. Seriously though, this game is amazing but it's way over priced. Buy Serious Sam Classic: The First Encounter instead. The graphics in this remake are definitely better, but if you want the true Serious Sam experience buy the original. The original version's graphics aren't even bad. Furthermore, by today's standards the graphics of the HD version aren't even that good. I'm being serious here. Seriously, you should trust me and get classic instead of HD. I'm serious.			"

												Serious Sam, huh? More like Serious♥♥♥♥♥♥ That's all this game is. One big♥♥♥♥♥♥ A steamy pile of doo doo.Serious Sam at its core is a mindless run and gun with no heart or soul. The main character tries so hard to be Duke Nukem for no apparent raisen. Sam himself is an idiot amongst idiots. Every enemy you fight is just a faceless thing throwing itself at you in waves. The developers must have been really confused with character design for the enemies. They just toss in whatever random crap they can think of.

There's a scorpion man with a machine gun attached to his arm... some sort of flying harpy... a skeletal demon thing.. the stupid bull creature from Star Wars Episode II...

												This game tries to evoke the exciting, arcade-like feel of early-generation first person shooters like Doom.  However, when making this game, the creators didn't notice that a lot of what made Doom and the early Quake games fun was tight controls, satisfying weapons, and an atmosphere that took itself seriously.  Serious Sam has none of those, so it feels like a half-baked mod with a bunch of silly concepts.			"

												Awful HD remakes. Lag-stuttery performance because of either poor coding, poor optimization, or both. This game has one area, egypt, and the second encounter is the exact same game with egypt in it but also a few more areas, so I basically got ripped off and did not need to buy the first encounter because it is useless. $2.50 wasted. Only a cult set of people enjoyed these turds back when they came out long ago and nowadays nobody really cares about them and for good reason. Giant, open, lifeless, contentless, boring, repeating, ugly, lonely levels are each entirely the same color (tan or green or whatever) with a few props and of course thousands of boring enemies with poor shooting mechanics from seemingly 1992. It is too bad the cool art direction of the enemies could not have been used for a better game because a few of the enemies are pretty cool.Take Doom, Quake, and Half-Life, take away every single thing that made them all so great, and you have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage of a game. One of the most generic, watered down fps games I've ever seen. It is not fun.The weird thing is that the only decent game out of them all is Serious Sam 2 and Serious Sam DD XXL. Serious Sam 3 is one of the worst games of all time.			"

Well now. It turns out that I need something slightly more than pure plotless twitch shooting; although this was mostly fun as hell and a definite boon for my twitch-aiming, some of the levels were stupidly difficult or just over-long, the boss fights were dull circle-strafes, and it basically outstayed its welcome. Still, what do you expect from the design for a game this old? It was OK. And thanks to the Steam sale I have all the sequels to play, too. Hmmm...!			"

This game is a tad bit short and all the other games are really just the same idea with more maps and enemys so really all you need to know is shoot at what moves and dont worry about what sam stone is saying.Now why cant more games be like this!

												If you're looking for a game with a solid storyline, realistic gameplay, strategic cover, regenerating health, 6 different assualt rifles, 4 pistols, and a handful of submachine guns, all with fancy scopes and stuff that you don't need, then you're in the wrong place. Play Serious Sam, and take a trip back to the golden age of shooters, where violence is fun again. Get rewarded for exploring the map, not killed for ""going AWOL"". Find new guns earlier, and extra health and armor. How about a cannon that splats any enemy it shoots, or a 4-barreled laser gun? A double shotgun that does as much damage as a rocket launcher? Fight giant scorpions with chainguns, and 100-foot lava golems. And did I mention the headless kamikazes? This game is a SERIOUSLY fun time.			"

												This game is all about the combat no story,no qte nothing but gameplay.And because its like this I am sure glad the gameplay is some of the best!This is a true fps none of this modern crap,you need med kits to stay alive and there is loads of enemys with atleast 3 or so types attacking you at one time.The third game has more enemys both in numbers and types so if you really want a shooter that really is amazing then get that one.But this game is still great and now that you can get serious sam revoultion (the best way to buy this game now) you have no real reason to not atleast try the sam games.Its classic shooter fun and I highly advise you atleast try out the games demo it gives you a good idea of what you are getting into.Its HD to!I dont know if there is a reason to get this version of the game though because of the serious sam revolution game that just came out for less money then just this game.So really just get serious sam revolution and play these awsome games! This game is a tad bit short and all the other games are really just the same idea with more maps and enemys so really all you need to know is shoot at what moves and dont worry about what sam stone is saying.Now why cant more games be like this!

												RO: Daca ati jucat Serious Sam versiunea clasica cand erati mici si stiti ca va placut sa omorati multe creaturi ""ciudate"", ei bine sigur o sa va placa si seria HD, acelasi Serious Sam dar in varianta HD !  Pentru cei care nu stiu cine-i Sam, ei bine pot sa zic ca este un tip cu ""capul pe umeri"", seria Serious Sam este bazata pe killing, killing, admirat peisaje epice si iar killing. Desii duce lipsa de o poveste♥♥♥♥♥au toate jocurile care se respecta (nu zic ca nu are poveste), acesta compenseaza prin faptul ca este foarte fun, mai ales daca iti place sa omori cate o ciudatenie la fiecare colt sau la fiecare pas (da ... nu ai timp de liniste in acest joc).EN: If you played Serious Sam classic edition when you were young and know you liked to kill many odd ""creatures"", well you surely will like the HD series, the same old Serious Sam but now in HD !

												Like the best pieces of software out there, Serious Sam does one thing, and does it extremely well: Pit you against impossible numbers of suicidal enemies. But don't be fooled; your foes, though seemingly lacking both beauty and wisdom, are still capable of advanced and cunning tactics. Among those are spawning behind your back or right in your face, remaining immobile indefinitely in a shadowy corner waiting for you to walk into the room, or - when all else fails - running directly into gunfire in hopes that your supplies will vanish sooner than their ranks. Which will often prove a remarkably effective strategy.			"

There is a real challenge here, yet don't be intimidated because you will quickly learn how to survive. If you are a fan of shooters at all I must suggest you try this game and the second encounter HD. No regenerating health, no two weapon limits, and no ""leaving battlefield"" nonsense.

												I grew up playing serious sam and this was the first game that got me started on playing video games as a hobby (this and Half life 2) so I was crazy excited when Croteam made a HD version. Because when I was growing up graphics didnt affect me. But nowadays graphics are getting better every year and serious sam was getting left behind. This brought back good memories. Anyway, serious sam is a good shooter game. It has the chance to has a good story if you read the level desciptions before the levels but before now i just skipped them. Though as long as you know generally who Sam is you will be fine but no big if you dont. Story 7.5/10Graphics are very nice and this runs very smooth on most computers. the graphics are much better then the origonal versions. graphics 9/10The levels are full of nonstop action and most of the difficulty is surviving. Also there are secrets in the levels like hidden ammo and health or guns. level design 8/10.This game in underrated, i recomend it.			"

												Serious Sam: First Encounter, published and made by Croteam (from Croatia) was a very awesome, arcade first-person shooter where you can blast off monsters rather than a storyline like the likes of Half-Life series. But, not only you can blast off monsters in it, but it contains some puzzle that you kinda solve for yourself. Thankfully there are hints to know where they are and you just wen through it.The monsters are a bit cheesy but there are some that are hilarious, especially with those kamikaze bombers, whose are headless and come and say ""AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"" and it explodes you up. Creepers from Minecraft won't touch that one.Despite the fact it is made by Croteam, I can honestly say that this game was good. I've haven't seen any international game publishers who can sucessfully made a good game out of it (though Japan makes ALOT of good games and some bad games). Thankfully there are no lolis and pedobears  in this game. LOL!Overall, good game! :)			"

												Shoot, shoot, shoot and shoot some more. That's Serious Sam for you. When it first came out it was something out of the ordinary. With a surprising success. Wandering through levels with some nice looking old egyptian architecture, you fight armys of monsters. This time, the word ""army"" is to be taken seriously, as you literally kill thousands of monsters from start to finish. A few simply ""collect item"" and ""push switch"" puzzles in between give some variety, but the big picture is just you, your gun and what you can shoot with it: EVERYTHING!Sam himself is more or less a cheap copy of Duke Nukem, with a similiar rough voice (though not as cool sounding) and one liners, as well as some comedic relief and a few references to pop-culture. The HD Version really enhances the graphics, in direct comparison to the standard version. Give it a try for some mindless action, even with co-op!			"

												It's a very specific kind of shooter, comparable to Painkiller. There are many who, being used to different styles of shooters, will dislike this kind, at least at first. It is a classic, though, and I recommend it for those who like shooters and a little challenge. You can switch between first person and third person perspective, and I personally recommend playing it in third person because there's a lot going on around you and you will need to evade bullets and enemies.

												Although the gameplay is pretty solid, the actual levels and enemy design are overall bland and somewhat tasteless. Maybe I'm just being picky, but I think that ruins the game. If you're able to look past that, than you'll enjoy this more than I did. Definitely worth trying, though. 6/10			"

												No aim down sight, no cover based shooting and absolutely no nonsense.This is shooters as shooters are supposed to be, harkening back to the days of Doom, Quake and the many ripoffs those games spawned Serious Sam is a bit of a ripoff itself of thse classic games and doens't revolutionize the forumula but it does take it's own unique place upon it, it's skill based with hundereds of enemies you have to fight all at once and of course it's legendary coop. A 'cult classic' if there ever was one, if you like oldschool shooters you owe it to yourself to at least give this game a try.Do yourself a favour and grab some friends, crank the enemy health up as high as it can go and have a blast getting your asses kicked, the crazy frantic action of the coop is what this game is most famous for but the singleplayer is still a wonderful challenge.Prepare to backpeddle and scrap for every bit of health you can.

												Serious Sam HD is not an easy game.  But that's what makes it so rewarding when you succeed.  This is a fantastic game with a wide range of awesome weapons, a wide range of enemies, and interesting enough graphics to keep you engaged in the fantastic gameplay.  Enemies will make you jump by hiding around corners, and they will spawn behind you just to make your life hard, and you will yell at your computer, but the game is never unfair.  Reccomend.			"

												Iconic FPS game, one of the first I have ever played and was very happy with the HD remaster. I look to Serious Sam as a refresher to FPS games because it is simplistic yet challenging. It's a fun change of pace to have to constantly jump and move in arena-styled maps rather than ducking and hiding behind cover constantly. 10/10 one of my favorite games.			"

												This is a 100% accurate to the original HD remake of a fully old school shooter from 2001.Since this is an old school shooter the story matters the least and is almost non-existent, but the story is earth is struggling to beat this evil alien race and earth sends this guy Sam serious Stone to go back in time to ancient Egypt to kill all of them, nothing in this game is meant to be taken seriously.The gameplay is your typical old school shooter where you’ll go through levels from point A to B and killing everything along the way, though serious Sam is quite unique among old school shooters since you move through really large open environments, you’ll have hundreds of enemies charging at you all at once, most items are booby trapped and enemies will spawn when you pick up certain items, and you have Sam stone who is very similar to duke nukem where he spits out one liners and steals movie quotes. You have a set of weapons which consists of a knife, dual revolvers, a shotgun, a double barrelled shotgun, a Thompson, a mini-gun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, and a cannon which is like a cannon of a ship but it fires cannon balls the size of boulders which will run over anything smaller than it and explode within contact of anything larger than it. Certain weapons work better on certain enemies and different situations since a lot of the time when there is a horde of enemies charging at you, you’ll be using the rocket launcher but when you are in too tight quarters for the rocket launcher and enemies are too close to you, you’ll want to switch to the mini-gun, and when there’s not that many enemies you might want to switch to one of the two shotguns. There aren’t really any problems with serious sam but this game is very frustrating especially on the higher difficulties because this game is extremely difficult and it has some of the most annoying enemies in any game ever made and when you have a 100 of them bee lining towards you it’s just overwhelming. There’s also this one point early on in the game where the difficulty spikes completely, but none of this stopped me because I finished this, the second encounter and 3 all on serious mode. This is one of the best old school shooters ever made and you should definitely get this if you like old school shooters.			"

												Serious Sam HD is not an easy game.  But that's what makes it so rewarding when you succeed.  This is a fantastic game with a wide range of awesome weapons, a wide range of enemies, and interesting enough graphics to keep you engaged in the fantastic gameplay.  Enemies will make you jump by hiding around corners, and they will spawn behind you just to make your life hard, and you will yell at your computer, but the game is never unfair.  Reccomend.			"

												The Serious Sam franchise in general was a pretty fun shooter, but even the HD versions are a little dated in my opinion.  That being said, the game has a nostalgic twist to it -like the classic Duke Nukem' and Doom games.  So if you want to go a little retro, try this franchise out.  Not a lot of replay value though and designing your own levels can be a pain, so if it's on sale for $5 or less it's worth it.			"

												Don't know which murder simulator to buy, and haven't played Serious Sam HD yet? I think I can make your decision a little easier. Short version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE. Long version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE, maggot. Better yet, get the TFE/TSE bundle. TFE is a game about Sam ""Serious"" Stone killing massive loads of alien creatures in ancient Egypt armed only with his wits. As well as a cannon, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, a tommy gun, a big knife, two shotguns, akimbo Colt .45s, and a neurally-implanted computer system. Because he didn't want to overdo it, you see. Logically, I can assume that this has already convinced you. Thus, I'll leave you with this advice: set your color options to ""Vivid"". Trust me on this. If the default colors are pretty, then Vivid is BEAUTIFUL. Now get out there and tear a Werebull a new one. ...Oh, and do tread lightly. Sometimes that +1 HP just isn't worth it.

												For those who haven't played the 1st few generations of fps's (doom, quake, wolfenstein, duke nukem 3d) then this game will be a good compilation of what those games were like. For those who are veteran fps gamers, this game will be nostalgic.I would describe this game as Quake gameplay + Duke Nukem's persona with updated graphics. The single player is very tedious (especially random monsters spawn), I would probably just recommend enabling cheats and just storm through the single player if you ever loose your patience. Most of the fun is in the mutiplayer which is very much like Quake 3 Arena and Unreal Tournament.I recommend on buying Unreal Tournament 3 instead of this game for multiplayer action.			"

Play Serious Sam, and take a trip back to the golden age of shooters, where violence is fun again. Get rewarded for exploring the map, not killed for ""going AWOL"". Find new guns earlier, and extra health and armor. How about a cannon that splats any enemy it shoots, or a 4-barreled laser gun? A double shotgun that does as much damage as a rocket launcher? Fight giant scorpions with chainguns, and 100-foot lava golems. And did I mention the headless kamikazes? This game is a SERIOUSLY fun time.			"

												There are a couple of reasons why this game was and still is a great one. First, even though it was not developed in a time where graphics were at their best, its makers really managed to pull out the best of what the graphic can be at that time. Second, it is a fun game and killing hordes and hordes of enemies and dicovering secrets never becomes boring with every level presenting a new challenge and a new way to overcome it. Last but not least, the producers of this game gave a lot of time and effort in designing every level, with the areas looking amazing and well detailed.However there is a single flaw in this game. It is a bit predictable.All in all, this game is a great game and one of my all time favourites.			"

												I have always enjoyed the Serious Sam games and they are a million times more amazing in HD. Originally I completed these games on the console and I was excited to find out that there was more content in the PC version. These versions are a lot of fun on Normal difficulty but becomes horrifyingly difficult on Hard. There are two more difficulty modes I would never attempt. I highly recommend Serious Sam: First and Second Encounter, it's a satisfying Wave FPS with some comedy tossed in that gives the player a great feeling of progression and accomplishment on each playthrough. You can choose any levels already completed which is excellent for casual replay. Really this game is a classic for any library and if you haven't played it you are missing out.I believe the trick to enjoying the Serious Sam games is to set up keybindings for your weapons and learn them well as it will add alot of depth to gameplay.

												Don't know which murder simulator to buy, and haven't played Serious Sam HD yet? I think I can make your decision a little easier. Short version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE. Long version is, get Serious Sam HD: TFE, maggot. Better yet, get the TFE/TSE bundle. TFE is a game about Sam ""Serious"" Stone killing massive loads of alien creatures in ancient Egypt armed only with his wits. As well as a cannon, a chaingun, a rocket launcher, a grenade launcher, a laser gun, a tommy gun, a big knife, two shotguns, akimbo Colt .45s, and a neurally-implanted computer system. Because he didn't want to overdo it, you see. Logically, I can assume that this has already convinced you. Thus, I'll leave you with this advice: set your color options to ""Vivid"". Trust me on this. If the default colors are pretty, then Vivid is BEAUTIFUL. Now get out there and tear a Werebull a new one. ...Oh, and do tread lightly. Sometimes that +1 HP just isn't worth it.

												If you want an arcade style;  start A kill X goto B Kill Y goto C kill Z type of game, this may suit you.I typically want some more motivation in a character, and I joked to friends, silent protagonists in other games have more character than ""Sam"". There arent alot of mob types,  but the game occasionally will put a hundred mobs on screen and it doesnt drop in FPS at all, which I found to be pretty impressive. There is an online compoent Ive tried several times to use, but it seems few, if any use it. Steam reviews need a meh button. As far as Im concerned, im just not the target audience, its technically sound, the environments are nice, the music is good. The gunplay is amusing.  ""Sam"" just is lacking to me. I cant hate on a game thats not really aimed at someone who frequents RPGs and the like.			"

												This game is all about the combat no story,no qte nothing but gameplay.And because its like this I am sure glad the gameplay is some of the best!This is a true fps none of this modern crap,you need med kits to stay alive and there is loads of enemys with atleast 3 or so types attacking you at one time.The third game has more enemys both in numbers and types so if you really want a shooter that really is amazing then get that one.But this game is still great and now that you can get serious sam revoultion (the best way to buy this game now) you have no real reason to not atleast try the sam games.Its classic shooter fun and I highly advise you atleast try out the games demo it gives you a good idea of what you are getting into.Its HD to!I dont know if there is a reason to get this version of the game though because of the serious sam revolution game that just came out for less money then just this game.So really just get serious sam revolution and play these awsome games! This game is a tad bit short and all the other games are really just the same idea with more maps and enemys so really all you need to know is shoot at what moves and dont worry about what sam stone is saying.Now why cant more games be like this!

												Serious Sam, the character, is a time traveller sent back to ancient Egypt to fight aliens for reasons. Serious Sam, the game, feels more like it came from another dimension, a dimension where shooters never turns dust brown and clothed in ridiculous pretensions of militaristic realism. It is bright, colourful, imaginative and wilfully shallow and stupid.To my mind the most pleasantly surprising thing about Serious Sam is how simultaneously thoughtful and mindless it is. The mindlessness is obvious, you shoot all the aliens with the big guns. The thoughtfulness springs from varied nature of the enemies and weapons combined with how refreshingly fair and open the designers were about their scripting. The scripting is simple but brilliant. This is a game that will shamelessly spawn enemies directly in front of you if that is what the scripting calls for. This is game that doesn't give a damn about real world physical possibility so if it clashes with their level design then it can take a hike. On the other hand it also never appears to use infinite re-spawning of enemies. This allows for the player to play with the scripting, triggering a wave of enemies and then retreating slightly to deal with them before progressing. This might sound shoddy but it isn't, it really isn't, it is actually great because it allows the player to fully play the game rather than just experience it as a rollercoaster. This is a game that is made to be played rather than merely taken as some sort of an interactive cinematic experience. I won't spoil it but if you pay attention you'll notice the game even establishes an informal convention regarding some optional waves of enemies where the trigger can be identified and avoided by the play if they just want to continue.Honestly, this isn't the sort of game I love. I was never a fan of old school shooters. I like to sneak about and take things slowly rather than charging in all guns blazing and all guns blazing is Serious Sam's thing. I can't deny that this sort of thing has its place though and this is perhaps the best game I've played of this type of shooter. If you've just had a stressful week and just need something loud and stupid to comfort you then Serious Sam might be just the thing.			"

												If you like shooting a lot of things then this is the game for you.If you don't know, Serious Sam is a deliberate throwback to the old style of FPS games, like the original Doom and Quake.  Fast movement, blowing away tons of enemies, and maze-like levels are the norm here.This HD remake seems to be exactly the same game as regular Serious Sam The First Encounter, just obviously with increased model, texture, and animation quality on everything.  It is also running in an updated engine, but just playing through casually I dunno what benefits there are to that specifically.Anyway, I recommend, though maybe not at full price unless you really like old-school FPS games.

												I grew up playing serious sam and this was the first game that got me started on playing video games as a hobby (this and Half life 2) so I was crazy excited when Croteam made a HD version. Because when I was growing up graphics didnt affect me. But nowadays graphics are getting better every year and serious sam was getting left behind. This brought back good memories. Anyway, serious sam is a good shooter game. It has the chance to has a good story if you read the level desciptions before the levels but before now i just skipped them. Though as long as you know generally who Sam is you will be fine but no big if you dont. Story 7.5/10Graphics are very nice and this runs very smooth on most computers. the graphics are much better then the origonal versions. graphics 9/10The levels are full of nonstop action and most of the difficulty is surviving. Also there are secrets in the levels like hidden ammo and health or guns. level design 8/10.This game in underrated, i recomend it.			"

												A game about shooting lots of monsters very fast. The public online is dead, but if you get some friends together to play Co-Op or DM it can be fun. Single player is fun as well, so no need to buy with friends. If you are a fan of DOOM, Quake, or Painkiller this is a game for you!			"

												The Serious Sam franchise in general was a pretty fun shooter, but even the HD versions are a little dated in my opinion.  That being said, the game has a nostalgic twist to it -like the classic Duke Nukem' and Doom games.  So if you want to go a little retro, try this franchise out.  Not a lot of replay value though and designing your own levels can be a pain, so if it's on sale for $5 or less it's worth it.			"

												I was late to the video game party. Never really getting into the idea of playing games to beat them until 2007 or so. And I never got into old school shooters. That is, until the year the HD version of Serious Sam: TFE came out. I happened to stumble across a youtube video and thought it looked interesting. Played the demo, thought it seemed cool. Payed the $15-$20 it cost and then came magic. This is in my top 5 FPS games of all time and one of my personal favourite video games. This game introduced me to the old school FPS genre and it easily made me more interested in First Person Shooters in general. The classic version is pretty much just as good, but a lot of effort was done in the remake and the HD version gets rid of that one little texture annoyance from the classics, where looking around really fast made everything distorted from 0.2 milliseconds. Not as good as Doom or Quake, but I am just as nostalgic for it as those games, if not even more so. Just buy it, right now. Don't think about it, just do. If you're worried about the difficulty, very easy is hard to die on and playing in classic co-op, you have infinite spawns. So theres nothing to be worried about. This is also a very good game to introduce you to the old school genre. I hadn't done much with old school FPS (aside from beating 1-2 levels in Doom) and I learned a lot of techniques from this game. I never strafed much in games before and after the first 3 levels of this game I was dodging stuff left and right. It isn't for everyone, but even if you just want a fun game to play through with a friend for a little distraction, it offers that. Although, I might reccomend SSHD:TSE over this one, if you just want a quick game you can marathon with a buddy and then forget about. I however, think it is a downright classic.AKA: BUY THIS GAME			"

There is a real challenge here, yet don't be intimidated because you will quickly learn how to survive. If you are a fan of shooters at all I must suggest you try this game and the second encounter HD. No regenerating health, no two weapon limits, and no ""leaving battlefield"" nonsense.

The environments are a bit samey (Egypt, egypt and MORE EGYPT) but the same could be said of Quake and Doom (browns and reds in drab architecture everywhere). The big rushes are pure unadultered fun, with enemies coming in from every angle, really builds up your adrenaline even in single player. The weapons get more and more crazy as the game goes on, from the mundane (pump-action shotgun) to the insane (a handheld pirate's cannon, that you can charge up), they all serve a specific purpose and are useful even for the jobs they weren't meant for, yet all feel distinct.Buy it, play it with your friends, turn on teamkilling for added insanity.

But I was pretty disappointed because you cant use the old cheats like: please god (immortality), please fly, or please allweapons (give all weapons in the game in 1 second!). The story is about a man who´s really SERIOUS! He must save the universe (mainly the Earth) from Aliens creatures from Mental´s Army (Yes, its really his name). Actually this game is the second. Because this is: Serious Sam: First Encounter and the ""new"" Serious Sam 3 has name ""BFE"" which means ""Before First Encounter"" When I was a child I really didn´t liked the part in sewers. I was little scared of it. It was dark and you were swimming in the water and then some weird sound and electricity from behind... It is the electric piranha. Game is actually pretty funny and for the oldschool gamers the one of the best choose. :)9/10 (Because its great game and because I play it when I used to be a little kid with dad)Buy it definetelly! :D			"

												This is a game that you can only play with friends. That's not to say that it's a bad thing, on the contrary, it's a benefit. Serious Sam throws so much insanity, anger and general chaos at you that you're missing out if you don't have someone else to act as a human shield. Secrets are a lot easier to find, cooperation is fun and overall I'd say you should get it. Between the friendly fire, weapons and general adventure, it really is the more the merrier.There are some cons though:Boss battles that'll catch you off guard and don't always make sense initially. (Trust me on this.)Secrets can sometimes be unfairly hidden or require a great deal of work or searching to find.Enemies warp in, they don't have proper spawns or doors they walk through.No regenerating health. (Get good scrub, this ain't Call o' Duty.)There is a secret level that you will go the entire game without seeing. You might be able to guess where the entrance is, but it's going to take a while to get to it. If you're good, you won't cop out and look it up online. Yes, that means you.The last boss is just... insane. I won't spoil it for you, but you won't be ready for it.So, that being said, I'd say get the game. Great with friends. Unless you don't have friends, in which case find some you sad, lonely depressant.  "

												I have always enjoyed the Serious Sam games and they are a million times more amazing in HD. Originally I completed these games on the console and I was excited to find out that there was more content in the PC version. These versions are a lot of fun on Normal difficulty but becomes horrifyingly difficult on Hard. There are two more difficulty modes I would never attempt. I highly recommend Serious Sam: First and Second Encounter, it's a satisfying Wave FPS with some comedy tossed in that gives the player a great feeling of progression and accomplishment on each playthrough. You can choose any levels already completed which is excellent for casual replay. Really this game is a classic for any library and if you haven't played it you are missing out.I believe the trick to enjoying the Serious Sam games is to set up keybindings for your weapons and learn them well as it will add alot of depth to gameplay.

												If there's one thing I've always loved about Serious Sam it is thus: It knows what you want and it doesn't try to be anything but a balls-out FPS game.When I want a good storyline and plot development, I play Fallout or Elder Scrolls or any RPG really.But Serious Sam is for after those hard nights working the overnight shift at a gas station in bum♥♥♥♥ rural southern America where everyone treats you like an indentured servant or (if you refuse to sell them liquor or tobacco for whatever reason) the freaking antichrist.Serious Sam is nothing more than a mindless first person shooter that says ""We know what you really want when you turn this game on. Here's your Big Effing Gun and there's a horde of rather unplesant people, go have an entrail flying good time m'boy!"" which after one of those nights is EXACTLY WHAT I WANT! Its like the stress ball of the gods! Save the  story for when I'm off work right now I want things to DIE! 8D			"

												Although the gameplay is pretty solid, the actual levels and enemy design are overall bland and somewhat tasteless. Maybe I'm just being picky, but I think that ruins the game.

												Still have my copy for OG Xbox...still use the case....but no xbox to play it on, was so happy to finally be able to play serious sam again...and in HD? Seriously? Co-Op and multiplayer are great, and the levels are really well done , I forget the name of that stretch of desert with that massive boss at the end? But playing through that again remastered is worth a buy alone...only complaint is no steam workshop because this game is practically begging for mods! If you need more headless guys with bombs on their hands running at you while yelling...you should probably pick this up.			"

												Serious Sam is a game about killing as many enemies as possible before they overwhelm you. The game throws so many enemies at you at once, it's easy to become fatigued by the sheer amount. This game is intense. Hearing the galloping of hooves or the sound of the earth shaking while mooing sounds follow shortly after will scare you for life. The graphics look beautiful in the Serious Sam 3 engine. Killing monsters has never looked so amazing. The blood splattering on my face looked almost realistic. After I'd slaughtered everything, it was truly a treat to observe the scenery.  Sam loves to comment on events that take place sometimes. He doesn't comment on everything, just the new events that take place. Such as: encountering a new enemy for the first time.  Serious Sam: The First Encounter HD consists of one theme, 13 levels and two secret levels. The theme is Ancient Egypt. This game took me 7 hours to complete on normal difficulty. This is an old school shooter where the only goal is to get from A to B as you blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, without dying, while trying to find all the secrets. The story is simple and is given to by text as you advance through each level. You don't have to read the story, but I found it interesting even if it is basic. If you love Doom, you will love this game. The gameplay is very fun. However, the game does become repetitive after a while as the game does very little to mix things up. This game loves to trap you in tight corridors while spawning enemies around you. It does it quite often. It becomes very predictable. The game loves to trick you by placing traps around each level. To bait you, they love to activate them after you collect health and ammo. Do you see that heart over there? IT'S A TRAP! I did become bored after three hours of blowing up enemies as it all began to feel the same. I began to think: ""Ok... I've been blowing up these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for ages! When can I advance to find something new?""  The levels are very well designed. Nothing feels cluttered or wasted. Everything has been well placed and thought out. The enemies are incredibly varied. Each enemy is designed for a specific purpose. One enemy will sprint towards you, whilst another will bombard you with fire from above. But they were merely a distraction. Three more powerful enemies will charge through the weaker ones and strike you. There are 17 different enemies in this game. The sound is a bit iffy sometimes. It's subpar compared to everything else. It doesn't sound top notch. This makes it obvious that they didn't have a high budget when they were making this game. After all, they were on the verge of bankruptcy at the time. Serious Sam saved the studio. However, they could have remade them for the HD edition. There are ten weapons. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You will use all of them as ammo is fairly scarce. Especially when battling hordes of enemies. The mini gun and XL2 Lasergun feel very powerful to wield. I loved spraying bullets at the enemies as they charged towards me. It feels very nice. However, the Schofield .45 and the 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun are useless after you pickup the Double Barrel Coach Gun and the M1A2 Thompson as there are simply too many enemies in the later levels for them to be useful. They're too weak.  There have been things removed from the HD remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter due to issues regarding the engine. Such as: the inverted-gravity effect in The First Encounter has been removed and Harpies can no longer carry Beheaded Kamikazes. The online multiplayer has been improved, but unfortunately no one is online. Score-match has been removed. Presentation: 7/10 Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Multiplayer: DEAD. RIP. Final Verdict: 7/10 Overall, it is a good game. But, I recommend you get it on sale if you do chose to purchase it. Recommended to the people who love Doom, Wolfenstein, Painkiller, Quake, Bulletstorm, Shadow Warrior, SiN Gold, and Turok.			"

												Okay, so after finishing this game, I decided to first finish SS:HD - The Second Encounter before I reviewed either of them. Earlier today, I did just that, so now I feel I can deliver the verdict.The game was pretty short, but good. It's made in the same engine as Serious Sam 3, and shares many of it's (fantastic) visuals with that game, including the gorgeous blood. Now, when compared to SS:3, it was admittedly a tad sub-par, but that shouldn't surprise anyone considering the original SS:TFE was released so long ago, and SS:3 was made with newer stuff. But what if you don't compare it to SS:3?Wellm the game was good. The level-design and layout was surprisingly good, shocking even, considering the original levels were made more than a decade ago. The secrets were clever, as we've come to expect from Croteam. The weapons were very nicely remastered. The enemies were... dang, they were frustrating. These SS:HD enemies are really irritating at times. Aside from that, I don't really have any major criticisms for this game.So long story short:If you're a Serious Sam fan, get this. Especially if you've played the first Serious Sam game that this game remastered, and you're in the mood for some nostalgia. You're probably only going to play this first one once, but it's a good thing to have under your belt if you want to be considered a Serious Sam veteren, or if you're just looking for something fresh. SS:HD - The Second Encounter is actually very replayable, but I'll get to that one in my review for it.			"

												A masterpiece, at the date of its release it was the only one that could support so many enemies at the same time without dropping the fps counter. Its enjoyable nature is the constant search and destroy for enemies, that never end.			"

												Never have I had so much fun while having so little idea what's going on.If this is Serious Sam, god knows what Silly Sam entails.For this game, you don't need:Trigger discipline or spray control.What you do need:The ability to shoot while running backwards or sideways.			"

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a very good arena fps game,if you like old school fps games like Doom and Duke Nukem you'll enjoy it!Graphics are not that good,but still are decent,the longevity is like 5 hours long played in tourist difficulty,but if you want to play in superior difficulties you'll take much more time to finish it (i advert you,it's a freaking hard game).Bad things? only 5 hours long,and the price (15 €/$) is really too high (like all the game exist). Absolutely recommended,but not for the full price and only if you're buying also Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter,in fact to see the end you must play it.			"

												Serious Sam is a classic old school FPS with a fast and frenetic twist. The action in this game is extremely quick and can have you aiming, ducking, and dodging enemies from every angle with a slew of fun to use weapons (fans of games like Unreal Tournament will recognize this formula)The HD coat of paint is a nice touch, but the game still keeps it's classic 80's action hero vibe with challenging combat the higher the difficulty goes.Saving constantly is a must because most times the games won;t do it for you and enemies can be unforgiving.Challenging, but not impossible, it's a nostalgic blast to the past for me and well worth playing.

Product received for free
												Me and 2 mates (one of which had bought me the game) ran through the whole campaign in one go, it was a great experience and I'm definitely going to replay on a harder difficulty, maybe with a handicap (like knife only, single pistol only, etc).I also enjoyed being gang-banged by the Kleers in that one level, and being destroyed by the horde of Werebulls in the final level. Now I'm going to have flashbacks whenever I see those damn balls on chains.Overall, buy this game right now, guarrentee that you'll have a fun experience.			"

												There's something about the classic Serious Sam games that you simply don't find anywhere else in the First Person Shooter Genre. Is it the waves upon waves of enemies converging on your position every level? Is it the familiar yet creative assortment of firepower at your disposal used to deal with these waves of enemies? Is it the astronomically large level layouts that still manage to please the eye? Is it the protagonist's famous one-liners?Whether you're a returning fan of this series or someone experiencing it for the first time, Serious Sam will leave you satisfied, excited and longing for more.Plus the ""Hippy"" gore setting is funny.

Co-Op and multiplayer are great, and the levels are really well done , I forget the name of that stretch of desert with that massive boss at the end? But playing through that again remastered is worth a buy alone...only complaint is no steam workshop because this game is practically begging for mods! If you need more headless guys with bombs on their hands running at you while yelling...you should probably pick this up.			"

												Short Review: Serious sam is a great, fast pace, FPS that is even better in HDLong Review:STORY: The game puts you in the shoes of, well, Serious Sam. Saving the Earth of Ailens trying to take it over. And that's all the story you need, Sam is every single badass from the 80's rolled into one. Though not as ego induced as Duke Nukem, he still just as awesome. Every single one-liner will make you laugh (even out loud).GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Serious Sam is like Duke Nukem 3D, see something, pump lead in it. But what makes Serious Sam differ from Duke Nukem is the enemies and how they work. In Serious Sam, enemies are more aggressive in nature and will come at you from every direction. While in Duke Nukem enemies stay in one place and wait for you to come. Serious Sam takes the FPS to the next level being tough as nails and it doesn't care if you're ready or not. It will throw everything at you. LEVELS: Levels are large and open, giving you more room to run around and avoid thousands of enemies. The most you'll see in TFE is deserts and some jungle areas, even though the visuals don't change the layoout does, Making every level feel different from one another.Overall I give Serious Sam a.... 9.8/10. Great levels, great gameplay, and a great main character. The only thing I would highly recommend is wait until the game's on sale. Because you can get TFE and TSE for only two dollars.			"

												Although the gameplay is pretty solid, the actual levels and enemy design are overall bland and somewhat tasteless. Maybe I'm just being picky, but I think that ruins the game.

												#updated@13may2016: As 4 people noted, this review was satire-a-like humor/troll as a reaction to the game bug/crash, ofcourse I love any Serious Sam game. Please do buy any Serious Sam game, the are simply brutal fun, so ehm, if you got mad at me for this review, I'm sorry... I'm just a headless idiot. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!#Quite a fun game and all, but after you've worked your bloody behind off to rush through this game and shoot the bleep out of everything on Serious Mode Co-Op, you worked yourself into physical pain... AND THEN, as you enter the room to finish the game, game has an ""unexpected error"" and crashes, leaving all the hard work for nothing, including the more then deserved achievements we where about to get.Eventhough I was a fan after #3 BFE, I'd not recommend to buy this HD remake untill pathetic crashes like this, on an otherwise super stable high end gaming pc, are gone!

												I'm really tempted to put off writing this so I can hit that convienent ""Play Now"" button. I'll put it straight- Are you one of those folks who loves more traditional FPSes for all of their glorious superiorities over more modern ones? This is the game for you. No sprinting, no ironsights, no regenerating health, just you against waves of enemies with weapons that feel so good to shoot. Think how great it felt to use the shotgun in DooM, it's just like that. You know what I also really love about this game? Serious Engine 3 lets me play this game on settings close to ultra with framerates consistently around 60 per second... on my laptop. To give you an idea of how impressive that is, here's my specs-1366x768 60Hz PnP monitor2.3GHz AMD Quad-Core A10-4600M APU (HP lies, it's actually maxed at 1.9GHz)6GB DDR3 SDRAMAMD Radeon HD 7640G with 3060MB total graphics memoryTypically this rig starts to choke when I play HL2 on ultra settings. I've seen rigs with worse specs than that play it with no problem. The point is that Serious Engine 3 is extremely efficent. Now you can play an old-school-style FPS with beautiful graphics on your low-end machine. I wish I'd tried this out sooner. Looking forwards to buying SS3: BFE soon!			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review like all my other reviews, if you want a better full review, then please read better reviews then mineANOTHER DISCLAIMER: Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter and Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter's reviews are more or less the same as the gameplay mechanics are basically the same in both games. So please think before commenting about the similarity in the reviews Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a game developed by Croteam and published by the wonderful peeps at Devolver Digital. The First Encounter is the first part of two parts, known as The First Enocunter and The Second Encounter. The first two games in the Serious Sam series have been faithfully recreated in HD with a brand new engine and shiner graphics while still retaining the original game (now known as Serious Sam Classic)The story follows Sam ""Serious"" Stone as he is employed to travel back to Ancient Egypt after aliens take over the world in the near distant future to put a stop to the invasion in the first place. As Serious Sam, you get to travel across old Egyptian ruins and fighting against creatures of all shapes and sizesThe gameplay is like that of old classic games, such as DOOM and Wolfenstein where you shoot enemies non-stop in huge arenas whilst getting keys, objects, health and ammoSince this is an HD remake, we expect the game to be nicer than the original and with that it manages. The game runs on Croteam's very own engine, Serious Engine 3 and I must say the graphics were really nice. The arenas are huge and sprawling, full of Egyptian sceneryThe music and sound effects are faithfully brought back from the original, so nothing new there. The sound effects are good but you can hear the difference in sound quality, sometimes poor to sub-par. Music too was the same, the music quality varied from poor to sub-par but this is understandableThe only thing that bugged me was the enemies, they were annoying to say the least. Always running towards, knocking down your health like there no tomorrow and Serious Sam runs so slow that even my late grandmother could run faster than him. The game doesn't feel as face paced as other arena shooter games I've playedSerious Sam HD: The First Encounter was a good first part into the introduction into the Serious Sam series and I cannot wait to play the second part of Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter. If I had to recommend either the classic versions or the HD remakes, I would go for the HD remakes. Although I would still recommend the classic versions of Serious Sam, I think the HD remakes still hold up RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I AM GOD! My hearth game finally has better graphics and all of old secrets and dialoges! But I was pretty disappointed because you cant use the old cheats like: please god (immortality), please fly, or please allweapons (give all weapons in the game in 1 second!). The story is about a man who´s really SERIOUS! He must save the universe (mainly the Earth) from Aliens creatures from Mental´s Army (Yes, its really his name). Actually this game is the second. Because this is: Serious Sam: First Encounter and the ""new"" Serious Sam 3 has name ""BFE"" which means ""Before First Encounter"" When I was a child I really didn´t liked the part in sewers. I was little scared of it. It was dark and you were swimming in the water and then some weird sound and electricity from behind... It is the electric piranha. Game is actually pretty funny and for the oldschool gamers the one of the best choose. :)9/10 (Because its great game and because I play it when I used to be a little kid with dad)Buy it definetelly! :D			"

												As an old guy who grew up on an Atari 2600 and eventually graduated to Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom II, Unreal, Half Life... This game is terrifying. Whether it is the new HD version or the original, you owe it to yourself to pick it up - particularly if Sam is on sale.I had some kids (stupid STOOPID kids) to raise, so I missed out on a lot of video games. But now I have time (so much time...)Serious Sam is terrifying iin ways that modern FPS's are not. A decade or so later - the game still holds up. EPIC.			"

												A real surprise package to me to be honest. I'm not a serious Sam veteran and played it for the first time when it was recently in a ludicrous Steam sale. It truly encapsulates the shooters from the 90's in its frantic, fast over the top action. It doesn't really try to do anything new, in fact it does everything old but that's one of the things that makes it great.   In this day of brown shooters with even more brown filters and regenerating health its a real breath of fresh air. Its good manic fun and to me is everything that's good about the FPS genre, I mean, who needs cover when you have a mini gun?			"

												Okay, so after finishing this game, I decided to first finish SS:HD - The Second Encounter before I reviewed either of them. Earlier today, I did just that, so now I feel I can deliver the verdict.The game was pretty short, but good. It's made in the same engine as Serious Sam 3, and shares many of it's (fantastic) visuals with that game, including the gorgeous blood. Now, when compared to SS:3, it was admittedly a tad sub-par, but that shouldn't surprise anyone considering the original SS:TFE was released so long ago, and SS:3 was made with newer stuff. But what if you don't compare it to SS:3?Wellm the game was good. The level-design and layout was surprisingly good, shocking even, considering the original levels were made more than a decade ago. The secrets were clever, as we've come to expect from Croteam. The weapons were very nicely remastered. The enemies were... dang, they were frustrating. These SS:HD enemies are really irritating at times. Aside from that, I don't really have any major criticisms for this game.So long story short:If you're a Serious Sam fan, get this. Especially if you've played the first Serious Sam game that this game remastered, and you're in the mood for some nostalgia. You're probably only going to play this first one once, but it's a good thing to have under your belt if you want to be considered a Serious Sam veteren, or if you're just looking for something fresh. SS:HD - The Second Encounter is actually very replayable, but I'll get to that one in my review for it.			"

												Game is a throwback to simpler times with multiple guns being on hand, no reload fun with health and armor pick ups across the levels of Egypt against hordes of oncoming enemies in expansive maps. Game shines in Coop however the online is dead most of the times unless a sale is going on so don’t except to find alot of people on at once.The second encounter is a pretty much the same formula with better map design choices that will leave your scratching your head as to what the devs were smoking when they made these levels but all in good fun.

YesWorth revisiting? Yes, always great fun to hope in and blast a few enemiesBest part – No nonsense, no frills First-Person Shooting, an FPS in the purest sense. Absolute joy to play.Worst part – The Egypt setting can become somewhat tiresome towards the end, still a minor complaint as you'll be focusing on the swarms of enemies rather than the scenery.			"

												Good old game with HD textures added to it, gameplay is still solid, does beomce rather repetitive. Basically just wandering thorugh egyptian styled city fighting waves of enemies in rooms or large areas, no real storyline or exploration. There are a few secrets on each level and 2 secret levels that you can find but they dont offer much as a bonus for finding them, usually its just some health or ammo or a gun you have already found a bunch of times. Achievements suck 70% of them are for its dead multiplayer, only about 2 people are ever playing online at a given time and even then its not enough to achieve some of the achievements. game takes about 5 hours to complete, is super repetitive and gets boring about 3 hours in but still i enjoyed it overall 6/10			"

												Serious Sam, the character, is a time traveller sent back to ancient Egypt to fight aliens for reasons. Serious Sam, the game, feels more like it came from another dimension, a dimension where shooters never turns dust brown and clothed in ridiculous pretensions of militaristic realism. It is bright, colourful, imaginative and wilfully shallow and stupid.To my mind the most pleasantly surprising thing about Serious Sam is how simultaneously thoughtful and mindless it is. The mindlessness is obvious, you shoot all the aliens with the big guns. The thoughtfulness springs from varied nature of the enemies and weapons combined with how refreshingly fair and open the designers were about their scripting. The scripting is simple but brilliant. This is a game that will shamelessly spawn enemies directly in front of you if that is what the scripting calls for. This is game that doesn't give a damn about real world physical possibility so if it clashes with their level design then it can take a hike. On the other hand it also never appears to use infinite re-spawning of enemies. This allows for the player to play with the scripting, triggering a wave of enemies and then retreating slightly to deal with them before progressing. This might sound shoddy but it isn't, it really isn't, it is actually great because it allows the player to fully play the game rather than just experience it as a rollercoaster. This is a game that is made to be played rather than merely taken as some sort of an interactive cinematic experience. I won't spoil it but if you pay attention you'll notice the game even establishes an informal convention regarding some optional waves of enemies where the trigger can be identified and avoided by the play if they just want to continue.Honestly, this isn't the sort of game I love. I was never a fan of old school shooters. I like to sneak about and take things slowly rather than charging in all guns blazing and all guns blazing is Serious Sam's thing. I can't deny that this sort of thing has its place though and this is perhaps the best game I've played of this type of shooter. If you've just had a stressful week and just need something loud and stupid to comfort you then Serious Sam might be just the thing.			"

												If you like shooting a lot of things then this is the game for you.If you don't know, Serious Sam is a deliberate throwback to the old style of FPS games, like the original Doom and Quake.  Fast movement, blowing away tons of enemies, and maze-like levels are the norm here.This HD remake seems to be exactly the same game as regular Serious Sam The First Encounter, just obviously with increased model, texture, and animation quality on everything.  It is also running in an updated engine, but just playing through casually I dunno what benefits there are to that specifically.Anyway, I recommend, though maybe not at full price unless you really like old-school FPS games.

												Short Review: Serious sam is a great, fast pace, FPS that is even better in HDLong Review:STORY: The game puts you in the shoes of, well, Serious Sam. Saving the Earth of Ailens trying to take it over. And that's all the story you need, Sam is every single badass from the 80's rolled into one. Though not as ego induced as Duke Nukem, he still just as awesome. Every single one-liner will make you laugh (even out loud).GAMEPLAY: The gameplay of Serious Sam is like Duke Nukem 3D, see something, pump lead in it. But what makes Serious Sam differ from Duke Nukem is the enemies and how they work. In Serious Sam, enemies are more aggressive in nature and will come at you from every direction. While in Duke Nukem enemies stay in one place and wait for you to come. Serious Sam takes the FPS to the next level being tough as nails and it doesn't care if you're ready or not. It will throw everything at you. LEVELS: Levels are large and open, giving you more room to run around and avoid thousands of enemies. The most you'll see in TFE is deserts and some jungle areas, even though the visuals don't change the layoout does, Making every level feel different from one another.Overall I give Serious Sam a.... 9.8/10. Great levels, great gameplay, and a great main character. The only thing I would highly recommend is wait until the game's on sale. Because you can get TFE and TSE for only two dollars.			"

												Played and beat the game both in coop and singleplayer. There is no punishment for dieing in coop which is why i prefer singleplayer much more. Game is very challenging on normal, you will become a pro at strafing and switching weapons for different enemies by the end of the game. It's fun to pick up and play casually in for a few hours but not for long sessions. Final levels become very tedious with neverending waves of enemies, there is a cool final boss though. 6/10 (Decent)			"

Dude, you can't be serious, seriously. 11/10 will play and get suicide bombed by kamikazes again.			"

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a very good arena fps game,if you like old school fps games like Doom and Duke Nukem you'll enjoy it!Graphics are not that good,but still are decent,the longevity is like 5 hours long played in tourist difficulty,but if you want to play in superior difficulties you'll take much more time to finish it (i advert you,it's a freaking hard game).Bad things? only 5 hours long,and the price (15 €/$) is really too high (like all the game exist). Absolutely recommended,but not for the full price and only if you're buying also Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter,in fact to see the end you must play it.			"

												a classic FPS that has you killing hundreds to thousands of enemies with huge bosses with great soundtrack and a large amount of weapons to choose from and some one liners make this a awesome FPS and thats not counting the Multi-player  theres 2 modes theres the coop that lets you play the SP with up to 16 of your friends and theres deathmatch witch is pretty awesome and each map is based on maps from the SP and the weapons are very balanced  theres no OP weapon in this game (unless you count when people spam grenades) so this is a must have if you love old school shooters ^^			"

												This game can be described in 3 words: ""Its a trap!!!""Its a game based around killing hordes and hordes of enemiesYou see a nice shiny pickup item in the distance. Go to it and boom you're surrounded. Monsters everywhere.But the game gives you the tools to kill these monsters. You have alot of weapons at your disposal. There are alot of ammo and health to pickup.The game autosaves for you. You wont even need to quicksave. You have multiple saves, dont have to worry about a save getting overwritten.The First Encounter takes place in Ancient Egypt so the levels are Egyptian themed.This is not a covershooter. You cant hide and regenerate your health (unless you're playing on ""Tourist Difficulty"" ). You need to keep moving, shooting and dodging.There are also secrets to find.There are 2 or 3 instances where the game might go overboard with a horde and it overstays its welcome. And you wish it would stop because its a tedious horde.Switching weapons can feel a bit slow in the heat of battle.Not enough gore. Enemy corpses vanish. After a crazy battle the area is way too clean. There needs to be blood and guts everywhere.Arachnoid have hitscan weapons.The Second Encounter has everything The First Encounter has and more.TFE levels can even be played in TSE if you own both games.There are new enemies.New weapons: flamethrower, chainsaw, sniper rifle, bomb.

Co-Op and multiplayer are great, and the levels are really well done , I forget the name of that stretch of desert with that massive boss at the end? But playing through that again remastered is worth a buy alone...only complaint is no steam workshop because this game is practically begging for mods! If you need more headless guys with bombs on their hands running at you while yelling...you should probably pick this up.			"

												Played and beat the game both in coop and singleplayer. There is no punishment for dieing in coop which is why i prefer singleplayer much more. Game is very challenging on normal, you will become a pro at strafing and switching weapons for different enemies by the end of the game. It's fun to pick up and play casually in for a few hours but not for long sessions. Final levels become very tedious with neverending waves of enemies, there is a cool final boss though. 6/10 (Decent)			"

												If you just wanna know if I would recommend this game... YES! But if you wanna see my detailed opinion about this glorious painkiller, then continue reading.I am a fan of FPS games, I have played through Wolfenstein to Overwatch, and I have to say THIS type of first person shooters are my favorite. Just games where you kill, kill and kill, without any compromising story, best graphics ever, but with a kickass soundtrack, stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥and just doing some massacres. This game just wants you to feel powerful, and that is what you will get here with many guns and enemies, the maps are fun but linear, but for me this is not a problem for games that are in this category. The length of this game is... ok, the levels take a little too long for my likings but its only 15 levels, you will probably end this game in 9-12 hours, nothing very special. Now, is this game in HD worth it? of course it is, from what i have seen this HD version just makes graphics better, and in my opinion I think its more worth buying this HD version than the original, just 15 bucks.The soundtrack is ok for this game but it would have been much much better, and as I said, the story is ♥♥♥♥ing generic, something that in this genre I wouldn't mind having a♥♥♥♥♥♥story. And the multiplayer is fun, not the best but it can give you some good moments with your friends, BUT, if you wanna buy this game just for the multiplayer, DONT!, simply because its not worth the 15 dollars just for that and its not the main spectacular thing of this game, and if you dont have friends who own this game, you wont find matches online either.So in conclusion, I think this could be a good 1st try of this type of games, and in my opinion its one of the best FPSs ever, it doesn't add nothing new to the genre but still is plenty of fun, if you like and finish this game, I would recommend you to buy the HD version of Serious Sam 2, simply because its also as same as fun as this one.My rating to this game is a 8.8/10  "

												Me and 2 mates (one of which had bought me the game) ran through the whole campaign in one go, it was a great experience and I'm definitely going to replay on a harder difficulty, maybe with a handicap (like knife only, single pistol only, etc).I also enjoyed being gang-banged by the Kleers in that one level, and being destroyed by the horde of Werebulls in the final level. Now I'm going to have flashbacks whenever I see those damn balls on chains.Overall, buy this game right now, guarrentee that you'll have a fun experience.			"

SERIOUS mode. You know a dude is serious if he seriously likes to play Serious Sam on Serious mode. Seriously. Seriously though, if you don't like a challenge, this game isn't for you. I find it quite a challenge, but I also find every little victory rewarding.VERDICT: A serious 10/10. SERIOUSLY. WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THAT SERIOUS 10/10 FOR SERIOUS SAM.			"

												Ah, Serious Sam... One of the first games i played. I remember, playing this side by side with Half Life. Game is really unique, Duke Nukem clone, who did more justice to Duke than Duke himself. Truly a wonderful game. Fun game. Seriously.			"

												Serious Sam HD: The First Encounter is a very good arena fps game,if you like old school fps games like Doom and Duke Nukem you'll enjoy it!Graphics are not that good,but still are decent,the longevity is like 5 hours long played in tourist difficulty,but if you want to play in superior difficulties you'll take much more time to finish it (i advert you,it's a freaking hard game).Bad things? only 5 hours long,and the price (15 €/$) is really too high (like all the game exist). Absolutely recommended,but not for the full price and only if you're buying also Serious Sam HD: The Second Encounter,in fact to see the end you must play it.			"

												Another awesome game (in my opinion) of the serious series. For those who haven't ever played a serious game don't expect something deep, it's a remasterd (I think, I kinda confuse remake and remaster) version of an old game and its main purpose is to be light, immature, funny (in its own way) and making you go everywhere guns blazing. For those who have already played a serious game (I personally had played serious Sam 2) you can expect a really nice experience, although a big part of the game consists of walking in big rooms and and facing hordes of enemies (which is not bad but happens a lot), and also watch out for health pills and such because there are A LOT of enemies spawning because you picked up a pill. Overall a pretty nice game that I would recommend as long as you buy it because you want a game that is relaxing and funny, so if you buy it I can only tell you one thing, go slay them all (there will be a lot)			"

												Do things like reloading, regenerating health, and plot development annoy you? Do you consider the late 90s the golden age of the FPS genre? If so, this is the game for you - assuming you have balls of steel and you like to keep said balls to the wall at all times.			"

												Honestly this game is very good, because it respects the original version (2000), and doesn't mitigate the difficulty of this game. I won't extend my opinion about the gameplay because it's near from the first game.8/10, 14$ on Steam for hours of fun (and rage too), it's pretty cheap.			"

												The best game in the core series.The sequel went from 9th generation of FPS (sawtoothed arenas with spawning enemies) to being an action game. But together with new and diverse level sets it only made game less of a repetitive grindfest (FE). Also new story and direction finally tied that whole mishmash pile of enemies into cohesive world in that rare setting of cartoony zany vinegret (like alice in wonderland, or Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.² in this case). And unlike BFE it doesn't turn them into a grey-brown color-corrected unremarkable dullness.Story is a generic post-modernistic referential ""deconstruction"" with extremely dumb jokes which are delivered rather well and usually funny. But while having good enough mechanical catharsis with the last boss, plot-wise it just tells that main antagonist got away, ((( I R O N I C A L L Y ))) point its finger on it and says ""OH YOU GUISE AIN'T THIS DUMB, AIN'T ME SO HIP AND COOL TO POINT AT IT?"".Still, technically it is a 9th generation FPS in it's core gameplay and is mostly the same as first games, just with turrets, vehicular sections and overload of cutscenes (and loading times between them). It mostly behaves as expected and some guns are rebalanced to be more pleasant and useful. Also this game has one of the best shotguns (which is also totally balanced) i can remember (first place being taken by Ex Machina shotguns, which are that way only by happy coincidence of several minor bugs, though).Well, hope you liked bulls and kreels from the original, because those types of enemies make about 50% of them all, even some old ones have this new behaviour. The other 50% are annoying flying monsters; everywhere. It kinda gets overboard on the latter levels, but is still manageable.When it was released i didn't like the new face of sam, but now i think it's kinda better that way — it has the most character and is most recognizable. BFE sam is also beats the original version. Most music is kinda great, but totally ruined with dynamic mixing.Technically game is mostly fine, it works In UHD UWS Surround after editing of .ini file and runs stable. But sometimes mouse behaves strange and feels off or laggy and game sometimes can corrupt your save file so it would crash the game on read or write, so better have bunch of them and do it often.

												Serious Sam is a game about killing as many enemies as possible before they overwhelm you. The game throws so many enemies at you at once, it's easy to become fatigued by the sheer amount. This game is intense. Hearing the galloping of hooves or the sound of the earth shaking while mooing sounds follow shortly after will scare you for life. The graphics look beautiful in the Serious Sam 3 engine. Killing monsters has never looked so amazing. The blood splattering on my face looked almost realistic. After I'd slaughtered everything, it was truly a treat to observe the scenery.  Sam loves to comment on events that take place sometimes. He doesn't comment on everything, just the new events that take place. Such as: encountering a new enemy for the first time.  Serious Sam: The First Encounter HD consists of one theme, 13 levels and two secret levels. The theme is Ancient Egypt. This game took me 7 hours to complete on normal difficulty. This is an old school shooter where the only goal is to get from A to B as you blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, without dying, while trying to find all the secrets. The story is simple and is given to by text as you advance through each level. You don't have to read the story, but I found it interesting even if it is basic. If you love Doom, you will love this game. The gameplay is very fun. However, the game does become repetitive after a while as the game does very little to mix things up. This game loves to trap you in tight corridors while spawning enemies around you. It does it quite often. It becomes very predictable. The game loves to trick you by placing traps around each level. To bait you, they love to activate them after you collect health and ammo. Do you see that heart over there? IT'S A TRAP! I did become bored after three hours of blowing up enemies as it all began to feel the same. I began to think: ""Ok... I've been blowing up these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s for ages! When can I advance to find something new?""  The levels are very well designed. Nothing feels cluttered or wasted. Everything has been well placed and thought out. The enemies are incredibly varied. Each enemy is designed for a specific purpose. One enemy will sprint towards you, whilst another will bombard you with fire from above. But they were merely a distraction. Three more powerful enemies will charge through the weaker ones and strike you. There are 17 different enemies in this game. The sound is a bit iffy sometimes. It's subpar compared to everything else. It doesn't sound top notch. This makes it obvious that they didn't have a high budget when they were making this game. After all, they were on the verge of bankruptcy at the time. Serious Sam saved the studio. However, they could have remade them for the HD edition. There are ten weapons. Each with their own strengths and weaknesses. You will use all of them as ammo is fairly scarce. Especially when battling hordes of enemies. The mini gun and XL2 Lasergun feel very powerful to wield. I loved spraying bullets at the enemies as they charged towards me. It feels very nice. However, the Schofield .45 and the 12 Gauge Pump-Action Shotgun are useless after you pickup the Double Barrel Coach Gun and the M1A2 Thompson as there are simply too many enemies in the later levels for them to be useful. They're too weak.  There have been things removed from the HD remake of Serious Sam: The First Encounter due to issues regarding the engine. Such as: the inverted-gravity effect in The First Encounter has been removed and Harpies can no longer carry Beheaded Kamikazes. The online multiplayer has been improved, but unfortunately no one is online. Score-match has been removed. Presentation: 7/10 Graphics: 8/10 Sound: 7/10 Gameplay: 7/10 Multiplayer: DEAD. RIP. Final Verdict: 7/10 Overall, it is a good game. But, I recommend you get it on sale if you do chose to purchase it. Recommended to the people who love Doom, Wolfenstein, Painkiller, Quake, Bulletstorm, Shadow Warrior, SiN Gold, and Turok.			"
