												I am fairly confident that Payday: The Heist is one of the best games I've ever played. At its heart, it's a cops and robbers game that feels a bit like Left 4 Dead, except instead of navigating on a linear path through multiple maps, you take control of and dominate a single map, and you only play as the robbers, not the cops. Featuring a diverse set of maps, a cool leveling system that encourages player experimentation and mobility, and generally just being amazing, Payday: The Heist is the single greatest co-op experience I've ever had. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead, to be quite honest.Would you like to know how many things I would change about the game?Zero things. The answer is Zero things. Because there are Zero things I would change. Actually, come to think of it, I would change one thing: the game's leveling curve is a bit 'off,' and newer players have a harder time enjoying the game until about level twenty or so, but that's a problem easily solved. Oh, don't get me wrong, I'd totally be up for adding new features--maybe better stealth, more customized ammo, more maps with more unique behaviors, and stuff like that--but the fact is, the game is just pretty awesome as it is.You can sprint sideways.You can use fake dummy turrets to keep crowds down while you steal a man's blood in the PC-exclusive Mercy Hospital level.You can sprint backwards.You can spend thirty-three minutes drilling into a secret vault hidden away in the game's first level.You can yell at Alex for being a terrible, terrible crane driver.YOU CAN SPRINT IN ALL DIRECTIONS AND THE BRENNER IS AMAZING AND THE STRYK IS LIKE PEW PEW PEW AND MY LOVE FOR THIS GAME IS SO INTENSE YOU DON'T EVEN...All of the game's features work well together. Only one of the maps--Heat Street--is bad. It's a co-op game. It's not a solo game. You play with other people, and you'll have a blast. I've bought fifteen or twenty copies for friends now.EDIT: Hey, just because I've bought copies for friends doesn't mean I'm going to buy a copy for you. A) I can't afford to do this anymore, and B) if you're a person who friended me at random, why would you expect me to buy you a game?			"

												Oh man, Payday: The Heist... This game carries so many memories for me. I know it's old, and the community isn't really all that active anymore, but this game still kicks♥♥♥♥♥ Now, this isn't PAYDAY 2. You won't spend very much time devising plans or sneaking around (more on that later), but instead, you have a clear objective, and then you let all hell loose with some kickass weapons. So, is this game for you? But isn't PAYDAY 2 so much better? Well, let me break this down.In general, PAYDAY 2 has a more ""realistic"" feel, with your characters movement and weapons being a little less arcadey, and more down to earth. Payday: The Heist is exactly the opposite, and it's still great. Characters are fast, weapons have dead point accuracy (most of the time, not always) and in general it's trying to make you feel as little vulnerability as possible. And although you could argue about which is better, there's no denying it feels pretty badass.Another key difference is that one of PAYDAY 2's main selling points is that things within the heists switch around, making things more unique. The original lacks this in every single heist but one (which is my favourite, personally) and it does definitely wear on you after a while, however if your anything like me you'll play them again just because it's fun.I'm almost done with comparisons! Another big one is that outside of the beggining of two heists, there's no stealth, only guns blazing. So if your really into stealth, you'll probably prefer PAYDAY 2.And finally, the upgrade system. In PAYDAY 2, upgrading is quite complex. You have skill trees, even skill decks for bonuses, individual weapon upgrades, etc, making a very deep (albeit sometimes confusing) way to make your character powerful. The original streamlines this: All you have to do is pick which tree to advance in, and as you level up you get things from that tree (like weapons, perks, bonuses, etc.), with you being able to switch between trees at any time.So that's it with comparisons. So how's the actualy game itself?It's fast, furious, difficult, and just plain amazing. Assuming you get the Wolfpack DLC (which I highly reccomend) you have 4 skill trees, 9 heists, and all in all a ton of fun. I only have ONE WARNING: DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME ALONE! The AI is so stupid it's embarrasing. You can do it for bragging rights, or for practice, but this game needs to be played with other people, so get a team.Regarding the community, outside of Europe not that many people play it, so I suggest getting a 4-pack and playing it with friends.And that's my review! Hopefully you now understand which PAYDAY game is for you! (I reccomend getting both, if you can)FINAL SUMMARY:This game, and it's sequel, are amazing. Fantastic gameplay, great dev's, and hours upon hours of fun. Just don't do it alone!			"

												Payday: The Heist is a first person shooter game developed by Overkill Software and published by Sony Entertainment. The game was released in October 2011 on PC, after being released on PS3. The game is owned on Steam by over four million players due to its regularity being on sale. The gameplay is based around completing heists with a party of four people including you. This can be done either in a single player environment, or up to 4 player co-op online. The heists can consist of the classic bank jobs, right the way to the complete extreme of extracting blood from a highly classified patient. You play the role of one of the four main characters in the game, Dallas, Chains, Wolf or Hoxton.  Each member of the team can use a variety of different weapons, you are able to select your load out before jumping into a heist, so once you get to know what is needed to be done on each heist, you can select what to use accordingly. Each of the missions starts off in a stealth style mission, where you have to disable security camera, turning off alarm systems etc. Whether you complete these tasks successfully or not without being seen will determine how the rest of the heist will carry out.  These starting missions are done really well, and you will be fully immersed since most of them have you sneaking around a pitch black building trying to out manoeuvre the guards. A lot of the missions also come with the added obstacle of civilians – these are crucial in any of the heists as you can keep them hostage and use them as bargaining trades should one of your other team mates be captured by the police too. Whilst you can spend a good portion of the game in stealth and hopefully not being noticed, a good portion of the game will also be spent with you going all guns blazing as you attempt to fend off an almost endless stream of enemy police and SWAT.  The gunplay in Payday really well done. All of the guns feel as powerful as you would expect, and the choice of weapons is pretty big when compared to other FPS games.  Ammo does become a problem with your primary weapon since you’ll be shooting this off constantly at points, but can be easily countered by the abundance of pickups of ammo off dead enemies. Even though Payday is almost four years old at this point, it is still a really good looking game, especially when you ramp up the resolution to 4k. Originally I thought the game was made using the Source engine due to the familiarities in the graphics with the likes of Half Life 2 and Left 4 Dead, but the game is made using an engine called Diesel (made by GRIN, who are now defunct unfortunately). There are a couple of textures which are very low resolution which is a shame, but I can forgive this a bit given that a lot of the levels are actually fairly big, so this must have been done to reduce the need for loading screens.  The game has a really good ragdoll simulation too, when you are mowing down the enemies, they don’t just die in a normal fall to the floor fashion, each death is individually animated depending on where/how they were shot, which adds to the originality slightly. Payday is fully voice acted and done really well at that; the game is almost narrated by what seems to be someone behind the scenes instructing your team on what to do next on the heist. You’ll get remarks back from the rest of the team in responses to objectives being completed and you’ll also get a lot of radio chatter when you are in firefights with the police too. This is a really hard game. The first couple of heists come with the option to play them on easy mode; these must really be the games tutorial since they can be completed without any real problems; yet once you reach the third or fourth mission, the difficulty takes a big ramp up and you’ll actually find yourself either failing missions from not completing objectives, or because you have died or been taken into custody. I had to replay each of the last few stages of the game multiple times before I was able to successfully complete the heists. Even though the ramp in difficulty felt really harsh at the time; I began to enjoy the game even more because of it; because it’s not just as simple as a “get in and out” job, it forces you to plan your every move, and you will tread with caution around every corner because of the unknown ambush that awaits you. The game also has another two difficulty levels to be played on, Hard and overkill mode – these are modes which should not even be considered when playing on single player because you will not stand a chance. I tried the overkill mode out and it is just absolute carnage. I will definitely be asking friends to join in a game to give this mode a proper try out. Whilst all of the missions have the same key objective, and there is really only one way to complete said objective, it can lead to a little repetitive gameplay. The game does however try to counteract that by adding a little bit of randomness into the stages by shaking things up a bit; such as locations the locations of key civilians that you need to keep hostage, meaning you still have to go searching through the whole building to find them rather than rushing to the one place. Each of the levels has some form of random element to it which is nice to see, since you will be playing the same six or seven heists over and over again.I have put about twenty hours into Payday: The Heist so far and see no end in sight for it at the moment. There is still a really active multiplayer scene if you want to just find pick up groups with randommers, but I would highly recommend playing this with a bunch of friends on Skype to get the full experience out of it. The added levels of difficulty also adds plenty of replay ability too; meaning you will not run out of interesting content for a long while with this title. The game does have one piece of DLC which includes new weapons and two new heists, which is a worthwhile piece of DLC. The game is also extremely technically sound too; I was able to play on 4k resolution with all of the graphic options maxed out and I was still able to hit the heights of 160 FPS, so this is one of the best optimized games out there at the moment.  Keyboard and mouse is recommended to play with, given the FPS nature.Overall, Payday: The Heist is an extremely good game; one that I am surprised it has taken me so long to play, and one that I will certainly be keeping installed on my machine because of the high replay ability factor. The game is also very cheaply priced at £10,99 – but like I said at the start, the game is always going on sale, and most of the time it is for 90% off; at that price, is it an absolute no brainer to pick it up – you may as well pick up the four pack for yourself and friends whilst you are at it.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												I never thought I'd hear myself say this but...killing cops and stealing♥♥♥♥♥♥is so much fun! never thought I would like a game like this, but I do like to play the occasional fps (such as rainbow 6, or borderlands). Payday is very challenging and yet at the same time so rewarding; when I finally complete a mission I've been struggling with I feel EPIC. It's very addictive, and the only negative thing I have to say is that I wish there was something to spend all your money on in game, like with Payday 2. I also really like that this game has co-op, I play with my husband and we have a blast. I highly reccomend this game. 2 thumbs up.10/10.			"

												When I got PAYDAY 1 on a steam sale, I didn't play it till my friends got it. And now it's one of my favorite games. Even though PAYDAY 2 is out and I find that game really fun, I still come back to this game because the 2 games have 2 different play styles. PAYDAY 2 is more realisic and strategic, while PAYDAY 1 feels like it's more Left 4 Dead or Mass Effect 3 multiplyer. It also feels more fast paced, sending larger waves of enemies in maps that offer poor cover causing the player to use their unlimited sprint, and 0 reduction on your speed due to the armor you must wear to survive, to dodge and return fire on maps that contain both close and long range encounters. Both of the PAYDAY games are on my list of best games I've ever played.I highly recommend these games.			"

												Started to play this game without too much expectations when the game was free for a day, since it has only a limited number of maps. I certainly didn't expect that this game would be fun even after 1k or even 2k hours. Admittedly this game has lots of flaws, but in part that's what makes it such a great game. The random elements in the game, spawns, enemy pathing and to a lesser extend the objectives, make the game unpredictable and failure is always around the corner. Unlike some Co-op PvE games out there, you actually have to play tactical and watch your HP (using ""shoot and cover"") to complete the heists on the higher difficulties (and for beginners even on the lower ones). Failing to do so will get you punished (although you can get away with it to some extend when playing with a VERY good team) and in all likeliness gets your character killed.Besides the satisfaction of beating the game on the highest difficulties with a good team, you can basically make it as hard on yourself as you want. If the default difficulties aren't enough, install DorHUD and play on an even higher difficulty with even more spawns (and yes, this makes a huge difference). Seeing all those helmets flying is a reason to keep playing the game and there's always room for improvement: more kills per minute, better accuracy, fewer downs, faster completion of the heist or just competing to be the best in the stats at the end of the heist when playing with other players, which can make for incredibly fun games ;).The only downsides of this game is the crappy bots (although this can be seen as a factor that makes the game harder) and the fact that there are quite a few cheaters. As a programmer and creator of (an attempt of) an anticheat module (+more), DorHUD, it's actually part of the challenge to find ways to beat the cheaters or at least expose them.In fact, I didn't only have fun playing the game but also improving it. It's one of those things that are not for one or a small number of ""uses"" and I can get to enjoy the changes every time I play it. Of course there are also a number of downsides to this, but it feels good to help improve a game that I enjoy playing.Since this is a review, maybe I should mention that it's worth even its full price. On sale it's only €2.48 (€3.47 with the soundtrack DLC that gives you an extra set of masks and some awesome music). It's roughly the price of one glass of beer, but you can play this game for a lot longer than you can enjoy that beer. You can even play this game after having drunk lots of beers (or vodka, if you prefer that).			"

												Imagine Left 4 Dead except you're shooting cops instead of zombies.There's a level progression system in the game just like in the sequel, but you don't have to worry about any of the RPG ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t elements, just level up and spend points. Imagine more like Killing Floor where playing the game gives you progress  on each class. You can grind it out to get there faster, but that'll go against what the game's pushing you towards.People say it's comparable to Payday 2 in that they're the same characters and world, etc. They're wrong. The game is paced completely differently: heists aren't meant to be quick in-and-out situations, they're long, gruelling marathons you have to push through. They also don't function on an ""all or nothing"" reward system. If you fail right at the end, that's okay, you still get money (experience) for every objective you completed along the way. It's not as rage inducing as ♥♥♥♥ing up a Big Bank stealth right as you're opening the vault, then having to run and get the god damn drill because alarms went off.That's another thing, there's not really stealth save for one or two missions. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. When you ask yourself ""Are we rushin' in, or are we goin in sneakypeaky like?"", the answer should always be the former. Stealth in this game is a lot harder, and it's more of a dickwaving contest kind of situation when you can stealth the few maps, rather than being the optimal strategy necessarily.Overall, it's worth picking up even if you have Payday 2. It's not like the Left 4 Dead series in the regards that L4D2 replaces the 1st in every way, they're just completely different games with different mechanics.			"

												Payday The Heist is an amazing game that you should not buy for full price. It goes on sale for five dollars at least four times a year, and then you'll probably be able to grab the Wolf Pack for 99 cents, which is almost necessary to feel like you got the full game. If you've played Payday 2, I need to warn you that the two games are fundamentally similar, but that's where it stops.  Payday:The Heist does not have as many mechanics as Payday 2; you will always be a speedy, slightly tanky glass cannon who is in danger of running out of ammo and must take cover to survive prolonged assaults. But this gives the game a tension and skill ceiling that really augments the gameplay. Payday:The Heist is much more scripted than Payday 2; in general you are playing the heists the way the developers intended and some may find that repetitive. But the heists are SO MUCH BETTER than in Payday 2! Nothing in Payday 2 comes close to the sheer creativity and versatility of what every heist in Payday:The Heist throws at you. It's very tough to get bored when a single heist involves you visiting a hospital, restraining all the civilians, impersonating doctors, breaking into quarantine, drawing and purifying blood samples, restarting the power to get the elevator working, crashing into the morgue and commandeering an ambulance for the escape. It's really a kickass game and you're missing out if you don't try it.			"

												Payday can be a little bit jarring if you go in expecting something like a bank robbery simulator and instead find that all your jobs almost immediately devolve into re-enactments of the movie ""Heat"" and/or the Battle of Stalingrad. Don't worry about it. That's Payday.And while summiting Mt. Deadcops doesn't quite tickle the same area of the brain that gets turned on by expert planning and execution, it's still a pretty rewarding co-op experience with loads of personality. Make sure you have some friends willing to play before you buy, because this game is meant to be social.			"

												Have you ever dreamed of robbing a bank, jewerly store or stealing a well-secured precious object?Almost everyone do that sooner or later, in FPS PAYDAY™ The Heist you can try it out either with AI or up to 4 players in cooperative mode. The game brings you to every detail of heist, from entering target facility to escaping the police if necessary, which can be very tricky. I enjoyed FPS side of the game, shooting a lot of cops, whose raids are really common and after a while you will be surprised how many police forces are in the city ready to dying trying a heist of 4 robbers. On the other side defence is not a problem at all, the difficulties start with a lack of ammo - that's what I suppose as the biggest obstacle. I recommend this game for coop gameplay, with a bunch of friends it is really entertaining, but in singleplayer mode the game is almost unplayable, because of the uselessness of bots. 7/10			"

												It doesn't feel like the predecessor of Payday 2, hell no, from the gameplay itsself I'd even prefer it compared with Payday 2.You got less bugs, no dlc warfare, a proper environment(birds in the sky, rain,... all missing in Payday 2) and way more fun.No inspire, no dodge, no weapon dlcs make the game harder than pd2 and that's the reason it is way more fun.Yes it lacks the variety of maps, but I like less proper maps more than thousand of♥♥♥♥♥♥maps(forest, diamond, mallcrasher, 1.000 times bank heist is♥♥♥♥♥♥and never played again after the achievements to be honest).It's really fun to play and you need a proper team for the 145+ heists, sadly most public players got 145+ with Overdrills and run around like chickens but if you found some proper crewmates you can play it all day long.

												This game, I would say, is better than it's sequel in many ways.1-it's more polished. sure this game isn't beautiful or complex, but it has far fewer glitches, bugs, it's more balanced and is just generally more, finished.2-i personally find far more enjoyment from it's heists, which last a decent amount of time and are very satisfying to pulloff, aside from some lack of replayability without friends.3-the game seems, well, fair. it's balanced, the cops can both put up a strong fight but also don't take extortionate amounts of bullets to kill and in no heist are all odd's against you.4-it's cheaper, easier to run and more unique, in it's own action-movie homage way.what i will say that is bad is that it's no beauty pageant winner and has quite a rustic style of fighting, and isn't entirely quick to connect people to a lobby and could've had more done for it overall.I recommend this, especially if it's on sale, and don't mind that this review might've been a TL;DR.

 It's a mother******g BULLDOZER!! Payday: The Heist is a 2011 FPS developed by Overkill Software, and puts you in the shoes of one of four criminals who, by working together, seek to take down the next 'big score' by robbing banks, extracting prisoners, stealing diamonds and a fair amount of other stuff in between.The game plays mainly as an FPS with a couple of strategy/defense elements mixed in to the recipe: upon the start of a heist (not all, but most of them) you are given the chance to walk around the map and pick out surveillance cameras, guards, and the like, and to get into the best possible position before everything kicks off.Once the masks are on, the weapons are drawn and the yells/swear words start flying, the players are guided by their mission organiser, Bain, whom warns them of objective notifications, incoming police assaults, etc.Naturally, the cops aren't gonna shrug their shoulders and say 'eh, we'll let the interior security deal with it' are they?So they send in special units in with the waves, that are very hard for one player on their own to take out, Left 4 Dead style: The Taser can stun players, the Cloaker can incapicitate players instantly if they get within melee range, Shields carry riot shields, and (MOTHERF*****G) Bulldozers are walking tanks, deadly at short range and a pain to take down.While the game shines at its most in multiplayer, solo play is also an option, but at times the AI can be too incompetent: They always defer objectives to the player and can sometimes be a little dumb, running into firefights to try and get you back up if you go down without taking out the immediate threat first.The graphics are a little bit of a mixed bag as well. When looking around the environments, it's quite stunning, but when viewing models up close... Not so much.Despite these minor setbacks, Payday is still an awesome co-op game to play with a pal, or two, or three for an afternoon of robbery and assault. While it's sequel may have now beaten it by more than a big margin, the first game is still a great place to start, or if your rig is sadly not powerful enough.8.5/10.  A few niggling issues, but Payday: The Heist proves to be more than a solid enough entry for online co-op gameplay.  "

												Once you start up Payday you can instantly see the resemblance to Heat, a Michael Mann-directed action movie. Every level is about a heist - you go in, you grab the money and you get out. In the meantime, dozens (if not hundreds) of cops are hurled against you. The 4 of you must work together to survive the level.Every level has sections. You always have to do something before you can advance. For instance, you are in a hospital where your job is to steal blood samples. However, in order to proceed to the section of the special patients you need to cut through a door with a saw. These machines usually require activation. Still, you need to remain close by to see if they stop so that you can start them up again.The waves of enemies get more frequent and dangerous. Same goes for the bank mission: you cut through the safe, but oh wait, you need some thermite to be able to enter the vault.Payday is one of those games where if you complete the levels you have pretty much seen everything. BUT! You have new weapons and other equipment to unlock once you level up. This so-called reputation level goes up till 193 and the higher level you are the more money you need to achieve the next level.Essentially, the replayability goes along the road Killing Floor has. Higher levels make you stronger (due to the new equipment) so you are able to pick a higher difficulty and replay the heists once more. Or die trying as this game is VERY difficult. Even on normal difficulty you will sweat to see the end of the road. And then you have at least 200 achievements waiting to be unlocked. :)PAYDAY is a fun game. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you like ""farming"" this is for you. "

												Comparing this game to PAYDAY 2, I generally prefer PAYDAY: The Heist for the following points:1. The ""loud"" is more fun here than in PD2.2. ""Diamond Heist"" doesn't have any client lag during stealth.3. The DLC is worth the price compared to many other PD2 DLCs.4. Masks are better and more in focus than in PD2.5. It more likely focuses you to play with other people, than solo.    - The heists are tough on highest difficulty, most of them impossible to be done with 2 standard players, sometimes even 3 standard players.6. Bain interacts more with the crew than he does in PD2.7. 2h Overdrill on Overkill 145+8. The Overkill 145+ difficulty.9. Overkill 145+ in general is more difficult than Death Wish (except you play PD2, PD:TH style)10. Undercover special waves...I prefer playing PD2 for the following reasons:1. Way more heists.2. You can easily solo run most of the heists (due to stealth).3. Stealth may be more interesting if you build the correct ""challenges"".4. You have more options what you could do in PD2, than in PD:TH.General ups (+) and downs (-) (most of them already mentioned):+ Way more co-op based+ It's harder (on the highest difficulty, default)+ Love those masks...+ Very nice soundtracks+ Focus on co-op- No Mercy has certain stealth issues- There's no focus on stealth in PD:TH, it's in general about ""loud""- Singlplayer works on Hard difficulty but is a pain on higher difficulties- Lots of hackers who can ruin your gaming experience.There's probably even many more points, which I probably forgot to mention. :)			"

												Many people compare PDH and PD2 together saying one is better than the other. They're both great games, however, they both exel in their own fields. In this review, I'll cover what PDH does better than PD2.  Firstly, we have the fluidity of the animations. Hot damn, those animations feel good. Just the feeling of reloading an AMCAR so quickly and effectivly gives me a great feeling of satisfaction. When chaining these animations together, it feels fluid, not jerky. On the contrast, the PD2 animations can feel jerky when put together making it not as satisfying to move around, reload, shoot. Secondly, we have the desync. This is a HUGE problem with PD2, however, I have found no instances where it is nearly as bad in PDH. People move where they are, not where they've been. Everything feels like it's not run clietside, but rather on a server where everyone has the same ping and latency. Lastly, we have the difficulty. PDH is MUCH harder than PD2, and it shows. The average success rate for heists is about 25%. Playing on normal doesn't just make the cops mindless drones like in PD2. This may be due in part to the low health and armor of the characters, but it shows. The game is rewarding and punishing. Now, for the downfalls. PDH doesn't have as many hesits as PD2, not as many weapons, not as many gagets. It doesn't even have skills. However, it instead has a RPG like level system which makes you work to level up all your skills. It is rewarding and difficult to get where you want. In the end, PDH is a much better feeling game to play, however, it does not have the new shiny look of PD2 with all its new heists and weapons. This game is for those who want a challenge from the normal rinse repeat of PD2. Not for the faint of heart (you've been warned!).			"

												Hands down, this game is more challenging than Payday 2 and funnier if you have 3 friends to play with. I recommend this game more than Payday 2 because skills and teamwork are required for finish each heist and is pretty more balanced than the sequel, also it doesn't have thousands of useless, overpriced and pay 2 win DLCs and microtransactions. If you want to start to play at this franchise, start from here.The cons? The game is almost dead, killed and completely abandoned by the developers, but considering how they ruined the sequel with their updates, it's not a real con. The few random players that play this game are cheaters or most people that aren't good enough to play over easy/normal difficulty. The experienced players mainly play in private or friends lobbies. So, be ready to play most of the time with the bots (that are really dumb). The only DLC present in this game, gives A LOT of contents. 2 heists, 1 skill tree with 3 weapons, 1 sentry gun and other special abilities.I dream this game will be updated by competent developers... but is not. Huge potential wasted.			"

												Hi,First off, I did walked thru and maxed my stats in this game 3 times (yes, I reseted by mistake and saved), but this game gets better and better the longer you play it!YES, it is hard at the beggining, and I hated it - hated the aiming, the constant getting hit by unknown cop, hitting me from 100-1000m with pistol (with accuarcy 95%) and the endless wave of cops swarming your position, when all you had is a crappy pistol and M16 with 3 magazines (and ofc no ammo).But before you agree with me even more, try to remind yourself starting playing every FPS you had in your life.. was it that easy at the beggining? Maybe, if your first game was PD2 ;)This game has everything you need!Great gamelay? checkGood graphics? check (remember this game is pretty old, and still looks nice!)Lots of guns? checkLarge and demanging maps? check!Not infested with DLC? CHECK! (yet it has some DLC, but it's worth having)Drill that jams every 5 minutes?! F CHECK! :DRecommend, 10/10 - this is what every shooter should looks and feels like!Sincerely,RFZ "

Nominee for the ""Test of Time"" awardThe best co-op game out there which 4 friends (or 4 total strangers) can have a blast playing the role of a high profile carrier criminal.If you like in-game eye candy over gameplay, play changing builds, crafting masks, modding guns this game isn't for you, check the other game.General Info:♠ Total of 9 heists to attempt, 7 from base game & 2 from Wolfpack DLC. Without the DLC you can still join lobbies running them but not be able to get few achievements tied with the 2 heists.♠ 5 Difficulties, easy(1st 2 heists only), normal, hard, overkill, overkill145+ & new addition of overkill193 (modified overkill145+) from DorHUD*.Pros:1. Very high replay value.2. Large heist areas, which you have ample space to run around.3. Good untiring graphics 4. Nice sounds. 5. Competitive Steam Achievements & challenges to complete.Cons: & some remedies 1. Cheaters -Even though this is not a PvP game there are a lot of pathetic fks who want to ruin your game. There isn't any built-in cheat protection, so it's a good idea to do a quick Shift+Tab -> ""View Players"" & check the stats of the players in the lobby. Having many abnormal heist finishing times, having masks which shouldn't have (not always a cheater though) are some indicators a cheater in your lobby. You may want to check out DorHUD* which will give you some useful information about players in your lobby & help you ban cheaters permanently.2. Disconnects - If it takes very long time to connect to the lobby there is a good chance you'll disconnect during the play.3. Some rare bugs - like falling out of the map*DorHUD http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dahm4pdGet a 4 pack & gift to 3 good friends or go public find some good friends & have fun!			"

If i have to compare part 2 with part 1 then Payday 2 is more a CARRYBAG SIMULATOR wich is litterly a cashcow with everymonth new DLC. Overkill is so ORIGINAL that they even copied the Wolf Pack DLC from Payday the Heist to Payday 2. What i also dislike from Payday 2 is that you have to choose what armor and what gun you gonna use depending on your playstyle (Loud or Stealth). And giving point to Skilltrees to your character. In Payday the Heist beside a silenced handgun doesn't it matter what armor you take or gun compared to danger meter. There is no Stealth or Loud meter in Payday the Heist. That is the main reason why i like the simplicity from part 1. Not much weapons, but good and challenging enough. I get also a lot Payday 2 players in my Payday the Heist game server and all are complaining that Payday the Heist is pretty HARDCORE / much more difficult compared to Payday 2. What Deathwish or overkill is in Payday 2 is in Payday the heist more hard or normal. Find good players then you start loving the game. Communication and be nice to crewmembers is the key for beating the game. Overkill 145+ or Overkill 193+ with DorHud mod will be much easier if you have the right people in your surrounding.Payday the Heist has also few disadvantages, like no restart functionallity online. You have to die all together or shut server down and hope that the players will come back or you have to reïnvite them. Payday 2 has instantly build in option for restart online game. Payday the Heist has not so much levels. In beginning there where even less levels. Because No Mercy did not excist and later came the DLC Wolfpack. Although the support of Payday the heist is ended, game is pretty old (2011), i have still a wish for new DLC for extra levels. In total there are 9 levelsWith DorHud mod thanks to DorentuZ there is a restart functionallity added. You can also skip game intro's. Best part of the mod is : It detects cheaters!!!! It reports players who have a VAC-ban or do things that normally not can be done. You can kick them permanently if you want that. Trust me Payday the Heist does have a lot cheaters!! DorHud also fix a lot game related bugs that Overkill never before has fixed.More info : http://steamcommunity.com/groups/dahm4pdFrom what other players told me Payday 2 has also problems with cheaters. I stopped playing Payday 2 because i don't like the way how Overkill use Payday 2 as a Cashcow with all the DLC every month. Payday the Heist has sometimes troubles with bugs, but the game is pretty good. Some bugs could be irritating, if some one leave your server in No Mercy while loading level, the bot will stay in elevator and the level cannot be started (for example). In some levels you get shot by Swat or kicked by Cloaker, tazed by a Tazer trough wall or you can do shieldsurfing (Wallhacks).Some glitches are also in your benefit, like standing in Medic or Ammo bag will give you armor. So if you need to reload, hide in a bag. If you are almost dead, stand in a bag. If swat is reloading walk out the bag and shoot him. In Heatstreet if you hide behind a dumpster/container in a corner you can slam swat a lot without getting hit. Handy if you are low on ammo or health and need to bring your teammates back.The game maybe from end 2011, it is still fun to play. You will fall down a lot in the beginning, but keep trying then you gonna love it. I stopped with this game in the beginning because it was to difficult. 1 year later i did gave the game a second chance and i am still loving it. For me this game is worth every penny/dollar/euro.

												This game is all about killing 'cops' or 'sprites' depending how you look at things.In fact I actually have met a real live cop that plays this...Dead set! True! The conversation in game went something like this...Kyzka: So what you do for work?Cpt Bob: I'm a cop in real life.Kyzka: What? Seriously?Cpt Bob: Yeah.Kyzka: Isn't that like living a double life or something? A cop playing a video game where you’re a bad guy that kills cops for a living...Cpt Bob: It depends, I view it more as I’m in training learning all the things I should not do.Kyzka: Is that why you’re forever in donut shops?Cpt Bob: Exactly we try our best to arrive several days after the incident that way this sort of killing cop thing never happens...In game Cops pretty much arrive in waves the millisecond you start to look at someone the wrong way. Just like Payday 2 there are special enemies in the way of Tasers, cloakers, shields, bulldozers and snipers that spawn in frequently to stop you from getting your pay dirt. However unlike payday 2 the special enemies often act quite differently. For instance Bull dozers move much more faster than they do in payday 2, though they don't have as much health, still if you get shot twice from them it’s more often than not 'man down'. Tasers will often come in pairs and strike instantly. Cloakers have no warning sound that they are close by and most of the time will pounce on you when you’re trying to interact with something or someone. Shields other than the Gl40, there is no other gun which can penetrate their shield. Forget you’re Gl40 and the only answer left is to quickly try and flank them. Snipers in the droves are undoubtedly the worst. Every time I try the level undercover on 145+ I openly weep when I'm informed I have to go to the roof.The second biggest difference between this and Payday 2 is that ALL the maps are LOUD. None of them are 'True' stealth. Granted 'Diamond Heist' can be done stealthily on the easier levels, but try it on 145+ and it’s all guns blazing again. Sadly the stealth side of things was never properly instituted in this version of payday and so playing as a pacifist would never be a real option most of the time. There are only 9 maps in total with four different difficulty settings with 145+ being the hardest. (This is not including the fact that someone has created a mod which creates a 193+ level for those that love to experience sheer pain).The developers Overkill have finished with the game and have moved all their focus on Payday 2 even recreating the same levels from this one to there. So most people ask the obvious question, 'Why bother to play PAYDAY the Heist?'1) For the experience. Since both the skill tree and the special enemies react differently there is a much more rewarding experience in the level of difficulty fighting in comradery with three other team mates against the relentless sheer hell of countless waves in this one than you might experience in Payday 2. Since all capped 193 players have the same instruments at each other’s disposal it’s all about game play and team work. Have one person acting alone and it’s probably game over for the whole team. This game is so much harder, that I’ve actually seen people who have spent 5,000 hrs plus be taken out within seconds by a cloaker or a taser. Having said that the game also offers fewer enemies for those that try each map solo without bots. This has given rise to the gauntlet of challenges from die-hard fans in the fool hardy attempt of showing off their skills as they venture alone. Here is an example of two professionals who have raised to that challenge...

			I was really surprised even being able to pull this off once. O_o I can say though, RNG matters quite a lot. ^^ However, it's still hard even with good RNG. :P		

2) The history of the Original secret vault and what gamers had to do to get there is also a rich part of gaming history and to attempt it yourself is a 'must do' for any serious gamer out there . Here is a video explaining it all in detail... https://youtu.be/j7nFAURAGEM?list=PLv2Qcu6n6_mI9QeFdDv_xDSe5WL-6PuslSo, basically first you need to do all the heists on 145+ to get the golden mask. Then play the first world bank with three other people each wearing a golden mask standing in your respective positions, next you will have a 2hr constant onslaught of the hardest enemies  while you wait for the drill to get through. Only to be confronted by another room which requires a correct code to be entered into the floor tiles to avoid being gassed to death. Then you will get rewarded with one of the most beautiful vaults you will ever see. Some even claim that sending the video of the above adventure to Overkill will result with you getting a special secret mask.3) Another challenge I would recommend is doing the last level 'No Mercy' Loud all the way on 145+, without the bag glitch, there are no achievements for this challenge, the reward is simply knowing the fact that you have done the hardest level, on the hardest difficulty, the hardest way.The Payday Story stops abruptly and hints towards left for dead more than it does Payday 2. It honestly feels that something is missing like a payday 1.5 maybe?True there are plenty of Trolls, Hackers and Noobs in this game just like there is in Payday 2. True there are only 9 levels to grind away at while trying to reach that coveted 193 level, but it’s the level of difficulty and the constant dedication of the professional players who remain behind throwing out challenges and helping new ones that can make this game a really rewarding experience and a thumbs up.In final it is a great game to vent off some steam if you ever get a speeding fine, Thanks Overkill. Wish you were still here...			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.Payday: The Heist is definitely one of the best downloadable titles.Payday the Heist developed by Overkill Software and released in 2011 is a coop based first person shooter falling in the same sub genre as Left For Dead. Payday essentially takes the gameplay elements from Left Four Dead and instead of a zombie setting, the game has a crime mob atmosphereThis game has been compared by the trolls as a ""Left 4 Dead clone,"" which is horribly false. It actually does have some reliable comparisons about each games'The premise of this game is great. You get to embark on only six various heist missions and complete different tasks. You get to play with four of your Co-op friends and there is plenty of teamwork and coordination involved. However, this game is insanely unbalanced.There's almost an infinite enemy respawn, There is a ton of upgrades for instance, which comprise new guns, less recoil, better accuracy, more damage, better armor, mines, new accessories, cuffs, etcYou can also take up to three hostages (for each member of your team, unless you exchange your ammo bag for three cuffs). But you cannot even move these hostages, you basically place them on the ground, tie them up and pray that the cops won't get to them because if they do, the time for negotiation and your subsequent release from custody gets extended beyond 3 minutes. And let me tell you, once one of your team members gets caught, there is very little chance that the other 3 members will be able to hold out for the entire 3 minutes. So the whole hostage thing is moot, just ignore them, or kill them so they don't get in the wayEvery frustration that I have described so far has to do with normal difficulty. I cannot even imagine what's it like playing on Hard or OverkillI honestly have no idea what the devs were thinking about this game. Why throw that many suicidal cops and swat team members? It is so unrealistic. All they do is use smoke occasionally, send in one member with a shield or taser gun. They basically make suicidal attacks like the Japanese in WW2, so you get to mow them down and get shot at the same time. When you get shot at, your screen jerks around, your aim gets messed up and your screen gets red - the typical FPS tricksll they had to do was lessen the amount of enemies, make enemies harder to kill, make mini tasks more interesting and add a fluid cover system. However, most of the mini tasks that you need to complete do not have any meaningful cover available, so you basically run around like an idiot and try to kill as many enemies as possibleOverall: The game basically crosses the line many times over where the frustrations pile up and it's not fun anymore. The game gets repetitive and tedious pretty fast. other than that. multiplayer is fair enough but it gets boring after a while.			"

												A rival for the THIRD-best multiplayer game I've encountered, after the formerly brilliant (pre-modded, pre-maimed) Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2.  It's also quite HARD, which makes it kinda tricky to play with your friends and/or relatives who are, well, kinda ""♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; (to use the favoured gaming vernacular).  But if you're up for a challenge, and know a few ""peeps"" (read: hard-bitten criminal scum) who may also be up to the task, it's pretty hard not to recommend.  Hell, you may even want give it a burl with bots.  Though such foolishness is, of course, only bound to end in tears... Verdict: 9.5/10.			"

												Payday is one-of-a-kind, at least for me it is. When I first saw the clown masks, I could only think to myself - The Dark Knight. As it turns out, it is like the Dark Knight but without the Batman. It is the 'heist' that starts at the beginning of the movie. Stealing from a loaded bank while fighting off an unlimited number of police officers and SWAT is hardly an easy task. The money they said, would let me buy Steam games as far as the eye can see. I went for it. That's when the fire nation attacked. As I leveled up my reputation, I remembered the one thing that could save me, my ammo pack, so I laid it down and went to town. Pow pow pow, the SWAT went down and I escaped with my pockets full of cash. But alas, the bus driver had to end my streak, leaving me with a mouth full of gas.   There are other levels too might I mention.Obligatory score: 7/10			"

												Go back to where it all began, with the 4 original heisters... Payday: The Heist. If you want a game that actually challenges you and focuses on team play, then grab this gem. With only 1 DLC ever made (excluding the in game soundtrack), this is a true video game, not a DLC fest, like Payday 2 has become.This is a straightforward team based shooter with no strings attached and has some similiar game mechanics of Left 4 Dead. It is a game where you must work hard as a team or die as a team! It is an unforgiving game and the challenges become harder as you progress, until you get to the dreaded Overkill 145+ difficulty, which is much harder than the Deathwish on Payday 2. In this game, you do not have Skills, Perk Decks, Armror or fancy weapons (RPGs) at your disposal. Because of the lack of these things, you will need to work hard and be smart with your team, to overcome the Overkill 145+ achievements.The only negative is finding a team to play with. There is only a very small amount of people who play this (probably a maximum of 300 people online at any one time). But there is plenty Payday The Heist groups and of course the forum is still reasonably active. There will always be someone out there to help you, if you don't have friends to play with.So what does this mean for you? Well, go Steal, Kill and make a Deal, in the best Payday game made.Pros:-Original concept, before it got ruined in Payday 2-Very team focused game play-Very challenging experience-No DLC every month -No micro-transactions-No cross-overs (with game or film companies)-No large downloads every month (2gigs or more, are standard updates in PD2)Cons:-Small amount of players (this can be over come by finding groups / forums to get a team)-Game can lag a lot more than Payday 2 (especially if your team is from around the world)-Some minor bugs in game, that will probably never be repairedI give this game 4 out of 5 Beers.Cheers,Frost			"

												PAYDAY The Heist is a 4-player co-op FPS game in which you and your friends heist your way to wealth and glory. with nine well designed heists(Two of them DLC) to keep you busy.Somehow, it manages to be better than the sequel, Payday 2, with better and more balanced weaponry, better heists, better balanced hostiles and smooth, mostly intuitive controls. That said, it is not without flaws. The stealth system is not entirely as great as in Payday 2, but that's pretty much all I can think of at the moment.The progression is decent, giving you new guns and abilities over time while giving you plenty of gametime to unlock it all. You can choose what general direction to unlock things in on leveling up, and things unlock at a steady pace that doesn't leave you grinding for levels just so you can play as you prefer. All in all, it's well made and works fine.Overall, it´s old,but gold.10/10 Sweep  "

												PAYDAY The Heist is a addicting first-person action game which is incredibly good on both multiplayer and solo. The game has a variety of heists and jobs which are all unique, such as the diamond heist and panic room, which force you to think strategically and be efficient in completing the mission. You must delve into the mind of a master criminal as you organise you crew and fight against the law. I absolutely loved the characters and their variety of masks, particularly the staunch Russian, Wolf. Multiplayer allows a new experience as you play with people from all over the world and are required to work together for a massive pay out. You'll find yourself easily engulfed in this game, levelling up, making cash and becoming the worlds finest criminal.Overall 7/10			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a first-person shooter game developed by OVERKILL Software, the first of the PAYDAY game. First of all, DO NOT compare this game with PAYDAY 2, that game is newer than this and has been improved and upgraded a lot.PAYDAY: The Heist lets you play as 4 criminal named Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains in their criminal career, executing heist from robbing a bank, street chase, into breaking a hospital for something. It's not as easy as blazing your way inside as sometimes you have to make an entrances by drilling or blowing while defending yourself against police and SWAT assault in their attempt to arrest you. As you play, you will level up and get upgrades for your characters and weapons. PAYDAY: The Heist also lets you play cooperatively up-to 4 players.PAYDAY: The Heist has very decent graphics and effects. The Characters Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains has very great detail on them, and the police has many variant too which also affect the gameplay. The performances is also great, no problems at all, nothing broken.If you compare PAYDAY: The Heist with PAYDAY 2, PAYDAY The Heist is a game before PAYDAY 2, like many games with a sequel, the sequel are supposed to be better than the previous right? So don't compare them.Overall PAYDAY: The Heist is a good game, especially when you can play with your friends, 4 of them. It's harder to play this game alone in singleplayer, just try to find some friends or buy 4 pack. I recommend this.Rating 9/10			"

												Wayyyyy better than Payday 2. No skins, No goat♥♥♥♥♥♥and reall heisting with intense actions and fights. One simple mistake and the whole heist could fail . You really have to work here together and work as a team. It´s also way harder than Payday 2.  The DW difficulty in Payday 2 is in Payday The Heist.... just Hard. I can really recommend this game. I have nearly 1.5 K hours in Payday 2 and to be honest.... I have much more fun with this game.From my side : 10/10			"

												This game is a remnant of when Overkill was so much better, long before gameplay got dumbed down, pointless ""new"" enemies, DLCs that pop out to slap you silly, oh and, no microtransactions. At least Overkill was smart enough to make this game (and the only good DLC they can offer) at a reasonable price. Believe me, you will save tons of cash if you stick with THIS game and not PAYDAY 2 and the horrendous content that has been infected by other cancerous games and cash-grabbing wh-0-res.In all, get PAYDAY: The Heist  to show Overkill how to make a good game and keep it that way.

 ""Damn, it feels good to be a Gangster"" ‘Payday: The Heist” is a fast-paced, edgy, co-operative first-person shooter (FPS) that takes its inspiration in no small part from the fantastic Michael Mann heist flick ‘Heat’. A pulsating background score, tense entry and setup sequences, interspersed with absolute chaos once the heist is underway, make this probably one of the best Heist games ever made.Campaign | Gameplay: Released by Overkill Software / Sony Entertainment in 2011, the game consists of 7 Heists that can be played in Single-player or Co-op mode, with an additional 2 Heists available as DLC. Gamers choose to play as one of the four main protagonists – Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf or Chains – each a specialist in his own area of Heavy Weapons, Explosives, Engineering/Tech, and Sniper/Support. Each heist also consists of a series of sub-objectives – which may include locating a key target (such as a bank manager), gaining access to restricted locations, destroying surveillance footage etc. Additionally, the fact that components of these sub-objectives will randomly spawn in various locations on the map ensures that no two playthrough’s of a particular heist are exactly alike - a major bonus to the overall replayability of this title. While playable in Single-player mode (supported by 3 AI controlled bots), the game absolutely shines in Multiplayer / Co-op where each member of your 4-man crew is a different player. Obviously, the quality of your experience and ultimate success of the heist will depend on the experience of your crew – but being part of a well drilled team provides an adrenaline rush that few other games will match.Flaws: In considering its shortcomings (and there are a few) – Lack of a single player campaign, short overall length (limited to 7 Heists), average graphics, somewhat clunky K&M controls (/no controller support), text-based UI, and an overall experience targeted at a narrow cross-section of the gaming community, you might think this is a game to pass on. But,… what it does, it does brilliantly well – and the thrill of running through a heist with a top-notch crew who work together, seamlessly combine to complete objectives, cover each other’s backs and take scores is something well worth the experience. ‘Payday: The Heist’ ultimately succeeds as an homage to the great heist flicks of the past – it’s slick, fast-paced, offers a good variety of heists, and is supported by a phenomenal soundtrack. Robert de Niro (in ‘Heat’) tells it like it is: “We do what we do best – Take Scores. You do what you do best – Try to stop guys like us”.

												PAYDAY: The Heist is an awesome coop game with lots of fun and endless replayability. I also recommend both of the DLCs for both of the additional heists, the soundtract, and lots of other ingame goodies. With both of the game's DLCs the game has a total of 9 replayable Hiests with lots of surprises, challenges, and ingame goodies to explore. The game is also super fun to play with a group of friends when playing in multiplayer. It's one the most enjoyed FPS games i've ever played. ^_^			"

 TL;DR PEOPLE THIS IS A LONG ONE, IN A NUTSHELL, 10/10 There are some people out there who don't know what this game is. Yet they know what Payday 2 is.I'm not one of those people. Payday 1, straight up and front, the father of Payday 2. Heisting, shooting, action, and some humor mixed in there. That's what Payday 1 is all about. In my personal opinion, this game is way better than Payday 2. I could go on for days, but I shortened it for you below.Pros:-Great heists. Very different from PD2. (We got Banks, Bridges, Panic Rooms, Streets, Hospitals, and even a secret vault)-Awesome and I mean AWESOME soundtrack. They set the mood for the heists.-Pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good dialogue. (""Like a GLOVE!"")-References. Most of them from heist movies, others from, well, other things. -Co-op power. Teamwork is awesome and the people on here are nice.Cons:-Premade masks. I know, I know. ""But Payday 2 has customizable masks!"" I DONT CAREEEEEEEE. These masks are awesome.(not that PD2's masks aren't, of course.)-Premade upgrades. Yeah, yeah, Payday 2 also has customizable upgrades. So? I got a gun, an ammo bag, cable ties and a scope. All I need.Besides that, nothing much. You probably didn't even read all the way down here. If you did, congratulations! Waste of time. Anyways, 10/10.			"

												Advantages : As Compared to Payday 2, this one has balanced weapons. One does not win more easily with more real-life money.Disadvantages : Doctor Bag and Ammo Bag requires players to play awhile on designed classes. For those who are not very good in FPS , this is a major disadvantage.This game has bugs which prevents some Windows users from using Steam Overlay , which is unfortunate. Most steam players need it to contact with other steam friends online.			"

												PAYDAY The Heist is a 4-player co-op FPS game in which you and your friends heist your way to wealth and glory. with nine well designed heists(Two of them DLC) to keep you busy.Somehow, it manages to be better than the sequel, Payday 2, with better and more balanced weaponry, better heists, better balanced hostiles and smooth, mostly intuitive controls. That said, it is not without flaws. The stealth system is not entirely as great as in Payday 2, but that's pretty much all I can think of at the moment.The progression is decent, giving you new guns and abilities over time while giving you plenty of gametime to unlock it all. You can choose what general direction to unlock things in on leveling up, and things unlock at a steady pace that doesn't leave you grinding for levels just so you can play as you prefer. All in all, it's well made and works fine.The gameplay itself is pretty good, with cover playing an important part and no enemy feeling unfair or like an unreasonable bulletsponge. It makes sure that almost every thing you're doing is of importance, with a good pace where sometimes it is tense and other times you can take a breather. It feels like you're always doing something, whether its rejoining your group, running from cover to cover, or taking out a few special units. Somehow the drill jams less than in Payday 2 as well.Of course it's not all bad, the AI is just good enough to work, and the hordes of cops make you sometimes feel like you're playing L4D with cops instead of zombies, zombies with guns. There are surprisingly few negatives to Payday The Heist.Overall, it's a bit old, but it's still great. I'd even say better than its sequel. And with regular sales it's easy to grab some friends and go heisting. If the regular price tag is not worth it to you, a sale will probably start soon.			"

												This is a really entertaining and fun to play with others, kind of game.  The setting is just right, the game mechanics are there, and the music is top notch.   I remember buying it because of one thing, dynamics.   The conditions in a heist, will change.  From small things like location of items or chance of extra loot to spawn, to something larger like an entire room full of cash.   The feel of the game is there and the change in the game itself make it feel fresh, even after dozens of play troughs.   Also, there are different forms of ""heists"" in the game.   Most are simply ""go in and grab money/items"" but others are ""escort person from A to B"", but don't let that ""A to B"" analogy fool you in thinking it it easy *cough* Green Bridge *cough*.Anyway, this is just a great game to play either solo or with friends.  The only down side would be that the number of people playing it, has gone down but it is a tough yet entertaining game.  There are a few minor features here and there that are a pain, and are improved in Payday 2, but the vast majority of the game features, are all here.   Even the DLC is very well done and I HIGHLY recommend buying it as well.			"

												More than 4 years but still a good FPS game. I do not play PAYDAY 2 so I cannot compare between them.Limited maps but still every time of playing can be challening and enjoyable. I did not get bored playing the same map for several times. The upgrading system is also interesting which is related to money earned (or stolen) as a thief. You keep stealing money to enhance or unlock weapons and equipment.Will reach top level before leaving this game.			"

												If you your coming from Payday 2 then there are some things you should know.1. This game is much more difficult2. The graphics look slightly better than CS Source3. Very few players play this game anymore4. In my opinion, this has worse songs.5. Also in my opinion, this game has better gun play6. It also has better players to play with.Overall, I like this game I find it enjoyable, and would reccomend it if you want a more difficult Payday experience.			"

												Aahhhh Payday: The Heist, you are like an old friend. The game is nice and simple, do this, go there, do that. It's calming. The weapons are all viable and solid, but you have limited ammo and need to preserve adding a degree of challenge. You have armor, but once that's gone you'll die fast. You feel real, like there's some high stakes involved. Then the sequel came out, bigger explosions, more weapons, mask customization, (slightly) better graphics. Sounds great right? WRONG! Everything feels extremely cluttered, you feel invincible, and there's so many things going on at once it gets really confusing. Not to mention the tenancy of new DLC every month that adds new guns, maps, and masks that are completely useless 80% of the time. Please, just buy the first. It has less maps and guns sure, but they're much more polished, smooth, and it's an immensley pleasent experience coming back to Payday after all this time.			"

												The OG Heisting game. This game is addictive and fun. It does not feature that many heist but thanks to the randomized spawn, everything is pretty much infinitly replayable. My favorite feature is the random events and the unique voice lines that the crew speak when events and objectives are activated.  Two of the heist are DLC but you can still join games, you just can't host them. With an amazing soundtrack this game is a great investment.			"

Good and decent gameplay IMO even it's a really difficult on its level, but I think it's good if we play it on Co-Op mode. Play with friends seems fun instead play it alone. Can't wait to buy Payday 2 soon and see how can I compare it with this. Overall, recommended for FPS Gamer!9.5/10.			"

 TL:DR  Cons - The Diesel engine is old, and while it doesn't yield its ugly veil as 'well' as it does in PD2, blemishes do present themselves- No tutorial.   I always felt that a tutorial would greatly serve PD, introduce you more intimently with the enemies and Special units and their weaknesses.-Hackers.  Are everywhere.  But if you are dying to find honest heisters, check out the Payday the Heist Online sub on Reddit! Pros-THIS GAME IS HARD.    And I love it.  While I feel its a shame it doesn't have a tutorial, this game pretty drops you directly in the frey and expects you figure it out.  It makes every heist a hard earned victory, and a vigorous one at that-For whatever heisters remain, its generally a very supportive community-A DLC expansion pack that is a true bang for your buck.  Hoenstly one of the best DLC packs I've ever bought-Fantastic atmosphere!  Each of the heists stand out for a variety of reasons, and its easy to tell them aprt. Verdict It's 15 bucks.  You're not losing much, and its some of the most fun I've played online!OVERDRAWN, SOAP BOX PREACHY SEGMENT: Story Pretty much none.  Most of, if not all the missions you play in this game are extremely isolated and I like that, very much.  The base story is that you, and three of your friends are proffesional bank robbers taking on the biggest and most elaborate hits.  Ranging some simple bank heists, to raiding a panic room for cash, to even stealing blood from a patient in a hospital.  While the mission total is short, (With the games expansion pack only offering an additonal two) there can only be around 9 heists.  But the RNG makes for great staying power. Mechanics/Engine PAYDAY: The Heist is  of the two, one of the more grounded games.  It knows its engines limitations, and is sparing with the spectacles.  PAYDAY 2 on the other hand, is a much more... Outstanding game.  With PAYDAY: The Heist, you are only able to go loud for a majority of the missions, or heists.  Only one two can be stealthed, by not fully.  Working in horde based siege modes, there are four phases to a mission:Casing: You and the crew are just casing the joint.  Taking in security previsions, placements and looking for objectivesAnticipation: The heist has just gone loud.  The police have just showed up, and it's about to go down.Assault:The police will, in favor of tacticallly approching your arrest, will instead besiege the area with armed forces.  Overwhelimg your defensives, on the higher difficulty.  They have a tendancy to really throw down the gauntlet. Control: This is the phase where the police pull a tactical withdrawl.  Though only briefly.  You use this time, to med-up and restock.  In certain cases, trade allies from custody. Music This is, where the PAYDAY series has always managed to impress.  The Soundtrack, compased by Simon Viklund, then Overkill's inhouse music producer and dialogue director, impresses as always with a booming soundtrack.  While the songs can not be interchanged, like in PD2, they are much more tied into the heist you're playing.			"

												Someone's gonna want to shoot me for saying this, but I don't care: I think Payday 2 is better than Payday 1.BANGWith that said, here's my comparison for the two, staying as factual as an opinion can be, so you can decide for yourself what you want.Payday 1:Pros:-Large, complex heists-RNG is much less significant, you'll never be screwed before you start.Neutral:-Very difficult. This could be a pro or con depending on your perspective, but Payday 1 will destroy you if you go in without preparing, and will probably destroy you even if you do prepare for it.Cons:-Low weapon variety-Upgrade system: The upgrades are given to you in a specific order within 1 of 4 ""trees"" (really, they're sticks, a straight line). This means that, even if you never use the Crosskill, you may still have to upgrade it before you can upgrade the Brenner.-Loot system- You're paid for completeing objectives, meaning that you could make potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars without ever seeing the vault (in fact, there's a farming method involving playing First World Bank on the highest difficulty, completing the first few objectives, then suiciding on the first assault wave).-Only 9 heists- it may sound like plenty, but you'll get tired of them fast as you try to max out your upgrades-Enemy AI is incompetant-Allied bots are uselessPayday 2:Pros:-Much larger variety in heists, even without DLC-More characters-Many more weapons-Upgrade system-You buy a weapon, then you modify it. No trees involved.-Stealth heists-Loot system: You're paid for securing loot. In many cases, you have to bag loot and carry it to a secure area.-Greater enemy variety-More contacts (you aren't just listening to Bain the whole time)-More variety in difficulty. Death Wish and One Down are just as hard, if not harder than, Overkill was in Payday 1, but the lower difficulties ease you into the game, allowing you to get equipment and experience to prepare you for the harder difficulties.Neutral-Enemy AI is smarter. Not by much, but it's there.-Allied bots are more useful. Again not by much (unless you want to install this: http://modworkshop.net/mydownloads.php?action=view_down&did=12736 ), but at least they can soak up tons of damage while you accomplish things.Cons:-Alot of DLC (however, sales are frequent and significant)-More simplistic heists-Weapon mods are almost entirely controlled by RNG.-RNG can screw you over easily (it's possible for a stealth run to be made near impossible by a door to the camera control room not spawning-it's not even a glitch)They're both good games, really. But if you're a newcomer, I see no point in buying Payday 1 when Payday 2 exists			"

												What do I think about PAYDAY The Heist?Well, this is probably one of the best games I have ever played. You must be really pro to play it! In some aspect it is difficult, so thats why co-operative game is needed. Make your own crew, grab a lot of money and escape from SWAT!Actually, the idea of the game is perfect. First time I see a simulator of Bank Robbery Game, which is fu****g AWESOME!If you owned PAYDAY 2 and haven't got PAYDAY The Heist, you must purchase it and try for yourself. Now there are a lot of players who gain reputation by making OVERDRILL. If you want to feel real atmosphere of the game, then raise your reputation by fair play (It doesn't mean that you can play only Diamond Heist with Stealth on OVERKILL too :-P). Try to improve yourself. If you did all possible ingame challenges, make your own, or try to improvise (for example: LOCOOVERKILL 145+ ""If you know what I am talking about""; Pacifist in First World Bank, B9-S Pistol only and others...)I respect OVERKILL for their hard work and for this amazing shooter, that they have created!And yeah, DALLAS is the Best!!! ;-)See you at the safe house (c)			"

												Now I've played the game a little longer, I think I can write a bette review than ""amazing game"". It is an amazing game, however it is not perfect. While I still highly recommend it, with time this seems to be slowly fading away. I love the game. I love the maps, I love the mechanics and just the overall feel when you complete a heist. However as the game gets older, more people seem to be fading away, and more cheaters seem to be arising. There is still a rich community of people who play this game, but good luck finding a public session containing good and nice players. What I'm saying is unless you already have a few friends who play, getting into this game is difficult. However, ♥♥♥♥ it, y'know, it's not expensive, just buy the game and see if you like it... cba to type a longer review on a phone touchscreen keyboard.			"

												When you first start playing, the game is hard as nails and requires strong teamwork and lots of perseverance to get through a heist on the Normal difficulty (only two heists are playable on Easy). However, once you've put in some time and level up, you become better able to survive and succeed. The game's general tempo is great, you're running around on this map constantly under pressure from the police, and periodically they'll send in tougher waves with special enemies like the ""Bulldozer"" (a super-armored SWAT trooper), ""Shield"" (a trooper with a riot shield, naturally), and ""Cloaker"" (a stealthy spec-ops type).There are three ""classes"" in the game: assault, sharpshooter, and support. While the difference between them is at first only the guns they use, as you complete missions you'll level up each class and earn more benefits. However, there's not really a system where you pick and choose your benefits: it's straight up ""higher level = better"", with no balances at all.One major aspect of the game's ""crime"" theme is the hostage concept. Civilians litter each level; shooting them causes police to act more aggressively, but they can be shouted down and zip tied to be used as hostages. If a player-character is caught by the police, they can be traded for a hostage, so in a sense hostages act as ""extra lives"". However, the police will also be trying to rescue the hostages, so maintaining control of them is critical. "

												The game focuses on four robbers (Dallas, Hoxton, Chains, and Wolf) who team up. Their first heist took place at the First World Bank, where they entered a vault by using thermite hidden on the inside of a photocopier and stole a large amount of money. A post-game message congratulates the group, telling them that they are ""set for life"", but recommends more heists, including robbing drug junkies in an abandoned apartment complex and ambushing a prisoner transport in heavy rain weather, simply for the enjoyment of the players.

												Ah, Payday. I got the game while it was free and I'm glad I did. A fun game where you play as one of four members of a group which robs banks and conducts other similar heists. Playing with friends is highly recommended as you will either bask in glory when you all finish that perfect bank job or yell and curse at that one guy who won't help you back up. You start off with basic weapons and skills, but these are upgraded when heists are completed, objectives are achieved, et cetera. You will find yourself constantly replaying First World Bank because it's the only one where you have a chance of finishing, but the missions are also randomised a slightly different way each time you play them.If you consider buying this game but end up going for Payday 2 instead, try and get this during a sale. The assault waves in Payday 2 are still strong, but it always seems like the cops never leave you alone in this. If you get to a stage where you find Payday 2 is too easy for you, come to this. It is still a very fun and challenging game with friends and that is what keeps me playing it.			"

												Sim, o game possui um nome engraçado (PEIDEI \o\), porém fica apenas nisso mesmo. PAYDAY é um game que traz bastante seriedade em seu desenrolar. Você assume o papel de um bandidinho mascarado, e juntamente de sua gangue (Mais 3 amigos em Cooperativo) assaltam bancos e tentam roubar a maior quantidade de dinheiro possível. É um game que eu achei bem dificil, pois a quantidade de inimigos que aparecem depois de um tempo é absurda, por isso para se dar bem nesse jogo você precisa ser bom em FPS em geral, caso contrário você vai sofrer muito enquanto joga.. HAHA! Jogabilidade muito boa, gráficos bons e até mesmo a trilha sonora do game é ótima, porém peca na falta de enredo, mas nada que tire muito o brilho do jogo.------------------------------~ NOTA: 7,8------------------------------			"

You have a variety of different weapons to use for whatever play-style you perfer.Overall, i recommend this game to anyone who likes co-op games.And no, this isn't just some inferior version to Payday 2.

Because each megabyte of Payday: The Heist full of references to these movies... and  to many others.Pros:+ A unique concept of cooperative game.+ Beautiful and minimalist design.+ Excellent balance.+ Hardcore.+ Additional capabilities (variability, in-game experience, challenges, customization)+ Crossover with the Left 4 Dead Universe (easter eggs, additional heist NO MERCY)+ Fair price (the game was distributed for free of charge during Crimefest)+ There is only 1 paid DLC (except OST) and no microtransactions (as in PayDay 2)Features:• Strong, but a modest content (like in Left 4 Dead)• Unideal AI (but much more smartest than in Killing Floor)• The game has no support by developers anymore (but it works perfect)• As a result - there is no anti-cheat (recommended to play with friends)Cons:- Some things should be realized much better (optimization, stealth mode, perks menu)- No support for custom modifications.8/10Outcome:ᅠPayDay: The Heist - a revolution in a particular genre of games. Cooperative robbery, wow!No more zombies, infected or mutants. Just cops and robbers. But there is a special squad, which is ready to kick your аss. And believe me, you have to make an effort that did not happen.ᅠCharacters, dialogues, sets and music - everything points to a lot of cult thrillers and action movies. This game literally consists of explicit and implicit references to ones. You will visit the deja vu on UNDERCOVER heist, in all senses.ᅠUndoubtedly, the product has some flaws. But it is necessary to take into account, that Payday: The Heist - debut(!) of Overkill Software (an independent studio at the time). It's made with lots of love, and isn't overly commercialized like PayDay 2.ᅠPayday: The Heist is able to gift you and your friends a lot of pleasant evenings and it is can be buyed during steam sale for a song. With this game you can to be in robber's shoes, not robbed. And, in case you are a big cinephile (like me), you will find yourself in paradise.			"

												Entertaining cooperative multiplayer and unconventional shooter. The gameplay is fast-paced, tension building and also fun. The graphics are quite good compared to other downloadable titles. Gunplay is also smooth. Co-op shines in this game and this game is best playing with your friends.Game : 7.5/10Graphic : 8.0/10			"

												This game is charming. I don't even know what exactly uniqueness of this game that distinguished itself from standard FPS games but it surely did. Like the L4D2, amusing and fun in both single player and co-op. I will recommend this game to everyone who enjoy to play Left 4 Dead series. And for people who afraid of having nobody to play with, don't worry cause it has a lot of people who waiting to play with you. ^^			"

 PAYDAY: The Heist   is the 4 player co-op FPS(first-person shooter) video game developed by  Overkill Software . This game is all about robberies and heists, given by the mysterious individual Bain, handler of the PAYDAY Crew. And obviously, you're playing as the 4 robbers, calling themselves the PAYDAY Crew: Dallas  - Mastermind of the crew, leader, wears a smiling clown mask with the American pattern.He is also depicted as the ""Assault"" class in the game. Hoxton  - An englishman and the ""Sharpshooter"" of the crew.He wears a pink and white clown mask. Chains  - An afro-american ex-marine, wears a white, blue, and pink mask. He is depicted as the ""Support"" class in the game. Wolf  - A swedish ""Technician"", demolition man, and a psychopath of the crew.Wears the white and red demon mask.Each character has its own background, morals and a sense of humor.They're bad guys, but they're badass.So, there are two mods for this game, singleplayer(just you and 3 bots, useful if you want to learn maps) and multiplayer(with randoms or friends).Before the each heist, you and your teammates must ""pre-plan"" it(gear up your weapons, select upgrades and crew bonuses and etc.).If you've ever played Left 4 Dead before, you'll catch on quickly, if not, don't be shy, ask your teammates about something you don't know. And i should add, this game is very  hardcore on high diffuculities, so ""hold on to your butt""!And soundtrack is awesome!!!!!!Overall, if you and your friends want to have some fun, this game is definetly for you.I'm already tired to speak about it - heists, charachters, soundtrack, weapons , gagdets...bla...bla..bla ------>  9/10P.S. Buy this game and its DLC on sale, it is a little bit overpriced, but i can assure you, its definetly worth your time and money!			"

												This game, is simply fantastic. It has 6 or 9 Heists, that are AWESOME to play through. I played PAYDAY 2 first, so it was weird at frist when I started playing this. Now, on to the Pros and the Cons!Pros:1.The gameplay is quite amazing.2.YE OLDE HOXTON.3.Skills are better than what they were in 24.No money like in 2, well, there is money, but it counts it as EXP.5.Tons 'o References in the No Mercy Heist like Dr. Acula from Scrubs6.SECRET VAULT. GO FIND IT.7.Cloakers are easier in this one.Cons:1.Chains sounds like a white guy that smokes and tries to voice act a black guy2.The Clown masks don't look like the icons or avatars you see3.Hard when you start at Reputation level 0, but it gets better.4.Really wish they'd come back to this...    So that's it folks! Can't think of anyhting else. Thanks for viewing!			"

												Left 4 Dead 1 is a great horror co-op game, Left 4 Dead 2 is a great grindhouse co-op game, and this is a terrific heist co-op game.A lot less forgiving on the teamplay factor, regardless of the fact that friendly fire isn't a factor, the game rewards dedicated, planning players incredibly well.

												PAYDAY. The name says it all. This is an awesome bank robber game. The functionality reminds me a lot of an EA/DICE game, which is fun to play around with.  The game has good AI logic, the bots don’t run around doing nothing, they actually can think (unlike some games I’ve seen). From breaking into a bank, to taking out waves of police units, to taking all the money you can in the vault, this is a great game.			"

												This game is amazing, it's really fun and it's also really hard, unlike PAYDAY 2. Can't believe I actually refunded this game once... It has 9 heists, but they have different situations, which add up to replayability. And the difficulties can affect maps, too. For example, on any difficulty except OVERKILL 145+, the drill would be 30 mins. But on OVERKILL 145+, it's 2 hours (OVERDRILL).			"

												My review for Payday: The HeistPayday: The Heist is a fun CO-OP game, where you play with your friends or strangers in different types of missions from robbing a bank to helping a criminal escape, The game focuses more on action than stealth like your typical heist movies, so if you like games that are more of a bank robbing simulator (or you just definitely want to feel like a badass robber) and pure action and that feeling you're in a heist movie then this game is definitely for you.There is also a sequel called Payday 2, If you're a fan of a hybrid of Loud/action and Stealth, then buy the sequel.

PAYDAY™ The Heist is a nice cooperative game. The design is very interesting and the maps are overall good. Controls are easy to learn, and gameplay's pleasant for the most part. Keep in mind however that this is a co-op game, I cannot say it is fun solo. It's also rather frustrating that it takes a large amount of time to unlock more weapons and items, and the game is exceptionally difficult which will definitely push away newcomers. Regardless, the game is entertaining and a worthy experience with friends. 7.2/10.0 "

												Lets get to it:Gameplay 4/5:As I'm sure you know, its a four player coop fps where you and your teammates perform different heists. Similar to the Left 4 Dead series, when you run out of health you fall down and your teammates have to come help you up before a timer runs out, but unlike L4D theres no rescue closets in this game, instead there are civilians. Players can shout at civilians to force them to the ground and then tie them up, and after a while the police will trade your teammate for a civilian, the time before the police will trade your buddy depends on how many civilians hes killed, the more killed, the longer of a wait.Assaults: Assault waves are when waves of police come and assault your team (simple enough, right?), almost every heist will begin with an assault wave. The police won't trade for civilians during an assault wavesSpecials: Just like L4D, there are four special units in the game, each one acts uniquely and is best taken care of differentlyHeists: Unfortunately there are only nine heists (six without dlc) in the game, so you can finish the game pretty quickly; fortunately each heist plays semi-uniquely. Each heist will probably take somewhere from half an hour to an hour. Theres not even a level editor.Online: Surprisingly the online community is still very active, enough so that theres still at least five people online at one amMusic 3/5:Very actiony music, suits the game wellGraphics 3/5:There graphics you would expect from a fpsOverall 3.5/5:This is one of the few games I would tell someone to purchase even while its not on sale			"

												I began to play Payday: The Heist in 2012. After 200 hours i left it for Payday 2.  One after the other game updates ruined Payday 2 for me. I've turned back to Payday: The Heist, and i was surprised - it is still exciting even now (three years later). I met a lot of cheaters, ""rage quiet"" hosts and most importantly - met with good people. It makes this game even more enjoyable for me. There is lots of pros like:- pleasant graphics- great soundtrack - random generating events- challenging difficulties- memorable level design- good optimization- smart enemies- low price ... and there is even more ... There is not much cons in this game:  - only 9 heists- dumb friendly bots- cheatersThis game was not AAA, but it will give you more experience then most of them - so grab it.			"

												Diamond in the rough. After getting annoyed by legions of cops (every city has millions, you know?!), who are shooting you in the head from 1000m-distance, you begin to understand, that this is not your ordinary shooter (also, it's not really a heist-simulator, it's more or less a tactical PVE-shooter, in which you have to survive enemy waves, while defending one or two objectives). It's difficult, and get's even more difficult after reaching lvl 145 and unlocking the 'Overkill 145+' difficulty. But this is where the fun begins. You need to know the map, you need a plan, you need a good team with good equipment and you need balls of fire. Need a challenge? Go for Green Bridge or Heat Street on max. difficulty settings. BTW, Payday has some great and diversified missions, some even provide a stealth-approach for the team (which is not used much in the first PAYDAY game, like i said, don't expect a real heist-game) and there are some random events and variations for each and every mission. You can also level up and unlock some new weapons, perks and equipment but it's not as grindy (really not) as PAYDAY 2!PRO PVE CO-OP! fun and diversified missions challenging really good gameplayCONTRA may need some time getting into heist-theme under-utilized too much cheating going on (WTF!)This game really needed more heists, otherwise perfect experience for me...

In Payday 2, you just need a dodge build, some good dlc's and a good perck deck to complete  harder heists, when in this one you dont need lots and lots of dlcs. In my opinion this game focuses more in the teamwork, the realism and the challenge. Also the bots aint braindead as in the Payday 2.			"

												PD:TH is way better than DlcDay 2. I think this game feels far more realistic than Payday 2. In this game you need to take more cover than in Payday 2. In Payday 2, you just need a dodge build, some good dlc's and a good perck deck to complete  harder heists, when in this one you dont need lots and lots of dlcs. In my opinion this game focuses more in the teamwork, the realism and the challenge. Also the bots aint braindead as in the Payday 2.			"

												An amazing classic.Back when the Payday heists were fun to play on repeat.Well-balanced guns.Pure skill-based strategy. No game changing skills. So long as you're good at the game, you can do Overkill.Enormous, unique maps, each expressing different feels and gameplay.Simple, fun, and easy to get into.			"

												The best FPS I've ever played. This game is better than PD2, because there is much more hardcore gameplay. Are you OD veteran in PD2? So, prepare to get absolutely destroyed playing on hard difficulty here.  You also don't need to by DLC every 2 hours.Every mission is unique with it's own plot and music. Every weapon has it's unique stats, so there are not any useless guns.Separate thanks to developers for the fact they still allow players to get invited to PAYDAY: The Secret Group by completing a 2-hours overdrill. #it_feels_like_something_is_in_the_air_MONEY  "

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a 4 player cooperative game which involves a crew of professional criminals attempting to score big by stealing various targeted items of high value. From cliche bank vaults to money printing plates, you can be sure that the local law enforcement won't make it easy for you and your crew getting out with the loot. Literally dozens of law enforcers will be dispatched to bring justice to stop your little crew from leaving the scene handcuff-free or alive.Everyone should jump at the chance to get this underrated title. Helluva rewarding game with intense gameplay with heavy cooperative elements aswell. Extra content for this game is already in the works to keep it alive. If you need a great 4 player co-op game for you and your mates to enjoy, look no further. Especially with it's cheap $20 price tag and more discounts to come, it's a steal! "

												I would solely recommend this game to players that have friends that are willing to play with you. This game is excruciatingly difficult to play by oneself because the AI's thinking pattern is: ""IS THE PLAYER DOWNED? IF TRUE: HELP UP, IF FALSE: CONTINUE GETTING SHOT AND NOT TAKING COVER."" It's not bad that the AI wants to help you, but when you get downed in an open area with cops everywhere, you're pretty much screwed because they couldn't give two 5h1ts if they're getting shot at while helping you up. But yeah, with friends to play with, this game is a really good time. Find some friends, and rob some banks/diamonds/gold, etc.			"

												Compared to Payday 2, Payday: The Heist is a lot harder, easier to level up, less of a grindfest, and more fun in general.The only reasons that this is worse than Payday 2 is that the community is dead and there's not many weapons, and you also can't use steam overlay in it without having an outdated graphics drive.I'd give it a solid 8.5/10.

												Imagine the perfect robbery: you know the blueprints inside out, when the guards go for their coffee breaks, and exactly how to get into the safe. Everything goes without a hitch, and by the time the safe is found, you're laughing. Not a shot fired. Payday: The Heist doesn't work like that.Despite the crime-caper presentation, tactical objectives and elaborate plans, Payday always comes down to shooting. Four players go into a situation - a bank with a vault full of juicy gold in the basement, an ambush to rescue a prisoner from a police convoy - and then get into a hell of a big fight with the police. It's a magpie co-op shooter, most obviously influenced by Left 4 Dead's dynamic approach to the team-based FPS and Modern Warfare's Spec Ops mode, and its developers are clearly students of the mass of 'horde' modes out there.Payday has faults, but is very good indeed, an FPS where common elements are carefully made to fit its rhythm rather than just taken for granted: this sounds like faint praise, but it has the best ammo balancing I've seen in a long time. Players start fully-stocked and a perk can give bigger starting clips, but from that point every bullet has to be maximised. Enemies drop small amounts of ammo, but only enough to keep your head above water.Health is equally well-handled, a mixture of an overall bar that only recharges in segments and a 'shield' that recharges wholly. The more the overall bar goes down, the faster the player is knocked down, making it a treasure to be guarded: a backup that in clutch moments gives that extra second of life.You're always on a knife-edge. A healthy team can feel invincible, but a team that's been banged up is too brittle to fight carelessly. One-time deployables can be taken into missions, and using them wisely is a whole other story.On top of such considered engineering, Payday boasts a winning art style that mixes grotesque clown masks with sharp suits and a brutishly high-tech take on law enforcement. Even more impressive - stunning, even - is the dynamic audio design, which contributes to all of Payday's most exhilarating moments. One level will have a tight, looping drum beat that builds and builds into a pounding house tune just as all hell is breaking loose; another will begin with a cheesy piece of europop that turns into an industrial wail of sirens. It has an absolute gift for catching the right moment to push itself to the front and centre of the experience, and burrows its way into your mindset. When the sound's going crazy, so are you.The cops are a motley bunch at the start of a mission, wearing their short-sleeved blue shirts and little caps and dying in droves. As things pick up, more capable classes start mixing into the waves: machine-gunners with light body armour, shotgunners in thick riot gear and special agents that sneak around before emptying a revolver into your back. Individually, they don't amount to much and neither does the AI, but you'll only ever see them in swarming groups that seem to come from nowhere, relentlessly battering a fixed position or skewering a moving group.Payday's mission structure is basically 'quiet time' and then 'assault', with much more of the latter. Each of its setups has mission objectives to be completed in the middle of the shooting, but every single one involves holding down a button at a certain point then waiting for a timer to tick down. Heat it ain't, but things are kept interesting by the objectives changing position and sequence on each playthrough - a structure that comes to fruition in Diamond Heist. (More on that later.)There are always small groups of cops around, but every few minutes the game sends a heavily-telegraphed wave of enemies in, which puts the game in 'Assault' mode. These relentless firefights can last from a few minutes to what feels like an eternity, but is probably more like 15 minutes - and during it, hundreds and hundreds of cops will die. They pour out of corridors, scale balconies, drop from helicopters, bust down doors, explode out of lift shafts - and if they get position on your team, the crossfire is withering.The final twist in every assault wave is the special cops. They're half Left 4 Dead's special infected, half Modern Warfare 2's riot shields and Juggernauts - but at least they're good copies. The taser cop immobilises players with unerring accuracy, making them spasm and empty their gun's clip wildly until a team-mate intervenes or they go down. The Bulldozer's a giant that can take sustained punishment and mete it out, a terrifying sight when you're in a corner, and shield-toting cops make a slower but no less inexorable advance on your position, begging you to waste bullets. Cloakers are the one original nasty: pinpoint spec-ops soldiers that specialise in sneaking up or rushing in for a deadly melee attack and then picking off your buddies when they wander in to save the day.The police have a lot of options and there's no telling exactly what an assault wave will contain - some wars are won at a distance with calm precision and some with a shotgun in the face. Payday only offers six missions, and some of those aren't huge, but the ebb and flow of its assault waves means it just about gets away with it - even in the same environment, with the same starting positions, no two waves play out alike.Payday does have one recurring problem: its downtime is often too long. There will be times when, one minute after surviving a pitched battle, you're waiting on a roof for the next event to be triggered or the next police attack - and nothing happens. Payday's best moments are when it stitches its discrete chunks together seamlessly, moving from dynamic objectives into assault waves into brief respites. But every so often, it just leaves you hanging.There are other flat notes. Civilians can be tied up to use as hostages - these can be traded between rounds for any team member who's gone down permanently, and cause the police to start sending in rescue squads. The mechanic fills a role capably enough but feels a little under-developed: being able to use hostages as bargaining chips or human shields during assaults, for example, would seem obvious.Payday doesn't even go that deep, and to be fair it shows little desire to. But there are infuriating inconsistencies within its world. You must avoid killing civilians, for example, in the midst of these slaughterfests - but these civilians are so nakedly designed to keep on running into crossfire that hitting one feels like the game's pulled a trick on you.There are plenty more moments of silliness, but Payday gets it right, too: sawing through bars and burning through vault roofs with thermite are the stuff blueprints are made of. And then there's the Diamond Heist.In terms of robber fantasies, there are few better setups than a high-security vault filled with diamonds on the top floor of a skyscraper, slap bang in the middle of a party. Only available on Hard difficulty, Diamond Heist is easily Payday's most dynamic and varied mission, with major branches opening up differently on each play-through, and it's set in a quite brilliant environment.The vault's in the middle, and several balcony floors rise around it full of offices and cubbyholes. Staircases lead to a huge roof with a helipad and glass skylights. The mission can be completed entirely through stealth, the four players moving silently from floor to floor disabling alarms and avoiding security patrols, before a clean getaway without a shot fired. This didn't happen a single time that I was involved. Rating: 10/10			"

Para análise em português, leia mais abaixo.Payday The Heist - Review: Got fun with the bad crewThis an exciting game, where you not only can do teamwork, but you really need do teamwork.It's a game to play with friends, like a squad. It's not a game for 'John Rambo' players.It's very hard to obtain all achiviements, because the game is a lot hard, even on normal difficulty, especially without a good teamwork.The game has inspirations on Left 4 Dead. The crew of Overkill admitted that, and put a lot of easter eggs of Left 4 Dead on game. Also, you can find easter eggs from the movie Heat (1995) that has a history of a bank robbery.Explore the game while trying to survive...Team up and got fun!  My Personal Score   Fun: 8/10   Gameplay: 8/10   Ambientation: 7/10   History: 3/10   Replayability: 8/10   Multiplayer: 9/10 --Payday The Heist - Análise: Se divirta com os caras mausEste é um jogo excitante, onde você não apenas pode trabalhar em equipe, mas realmente precisa fazê-lo.É um jogo para jogar com amigos, como um time. Não é um jogo para jogadores do tipo 'John Rambo'.É muito dificil obter todas as conquistas, porque o jogo é muito dificil, mesmo na dificuldade normal, especialmente sem um bom trabalho em equipe.O jogo possui inspirações em Left 4 Dead. A equipe da Overkill admitiu isso e colocou vários easter eggs do jogo. Você também vai encontrar easter eggs do filme Heat (Fogo contra Fogo - 1995), que conta a história de um assalto a banco.Explore o jogo enquanto tenta sobreviver...Junte seu time e se divirta!

 So, you wanna rob some banks?  ..... well this is not exactly the case here. If you want a more active, more content (and DLC) filled and more varied game, I suggest you get PAYDAY 2. The issuses surrounding micro-transactions have been dealt with, they have been removed, and community is back to normal. That being said, what do you get from this game  BASIC FEATURES:   Heists (or missions) in which you have to complete certain objectives such as defending a position, or keeping the hostages in check while your team mates gather cash. While there is only one proper ""bank heist"", other missions have a good variety, ranging from heist in a Hospital to escorting a VIP Heist (or missions) can be done solo or with friends/strangers(Recommended) Each heist gives you cash at the end, which is like experience progression system found in RPGs. You earn this by playing well, like headshots etc, helping teammates, and simply completing your objectives. There are three skill trees (fourth being DLC) that you can spend you cash in. Assault, Sharpshooter and Support (Technician in DLC); each with their own unique upgrades.  You select the tree, and you level in that skill as you play. REMARKS * It's pretty well optimized. * Graphics are good enough for a multiplayer game.* Overall gameplay is quite good, with pretty satisfying gunplay. Guns sound really amazing as well.* Music is stellar, with tracks ranging from tense to exhilarating and adds to the experience.* Since there are only a handful of missions, playing them again and again could feel repetitive. Though they have enough variety in their objectives that they don't feel stale, at least for a while. Also, if you play this game in breaks (like playing during weekends only), you wouldn't get bothered by it.  * Unlocking upgrades is a bit tedious, as you need to do quite many missions to get you hands on the good stuff.* Due to the popularity of it's big brother PAYDAY 2, it's sometimes are to find a match, Though, you should not have any problems during the peaks hours. CONCLUSION/HOW MUCH RECOMMENDATION? Overkill (the studio behind it) clearly put much love and effort into the game. But it only seems like a prototype for the much bigger and better PAYDAY 2, which team's passion passion shine. Regardless, this is a fun competent and extremely enjoyable Co-op FPS. If you've not played any online FPS/ played a few online FPS  : While I can point to Team Fortress 2 and Left 4 Dead 2, but if you are interested in a more ""realistic"" game, then I RECOMMENDED it. This is one of the few FPSs which I think neither too complex that it becomes overwhelming, it is not too simple either that it becomes boring. Also, it works quite well on low end PCs and Laptops. But, I also suggest you give PAYDAY 2 (GOTY edition) a shot, if you have a good PC, and extra money for DLCs If you've played a quite many online FPS  : If you like FPSs that are simple and fun divergence, where you don't need to learn the mechanics and intricacies of the systems, you can give it a go. Otherwise, simply go with PAYDAY 2 (GOTY edition).			"

You must avoid killing civilians, for example, in the midst of these slaughterfests - but these civilians are so nakedly designed to keep on running into crossfire that hitting one feels like the game's pulled a trick on you.There are plenty more moments of silliness, but Payday gets it right, too: sawing through bars and burning through vault roofs with thermite are the stuff blueprints are made of. And then there's the Diamond Heist.In terms of robber fantasies, there are few better setups than a high-security vault filled with diamonds on the top floor of a skyscraper, slap bang in the middle of a party. Only available on Hard difficulty, Diamond Heist is easily Payday's most dynamic and varied mission, with major branches opening up differently on each play-through, and it's set in a quite brilliant environment.The vault's in the middle, and several balcony floors rise around it full of offices and cubbyholes. Staircases lead to a huge roof with a helipad and glass skylights. The mission can be completed entirely through stealth, the four players moving silently from floor to floor disabling alarms and avoiding security patrols, before a clean getaway without a shot fired. This didn't happen a single time that I was involved. Rating: 10/10			"

												An entertaining bank robbing game.It has the same Gameplay as the L4D series, but then again a bit different which makes it stand out.While playing through the Campaigns you will level up classes and acquire new skills and weapons.I personally dont think its better than the L4D series. But definitely not worse!You should try it out if you are looking for something new...			"

												Payday is an amazingly fun game. I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out. Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. Rough around the edges, short in length, and aiming takes some time to get use to. However, in it's own way, it is very innovative. Each stage (lasting roughly 25-35 minutes) boasts with new surprises and situations depending on how you play and who you play with. No run through of any stage is ever the same. The stylish gameplay, cool concepts, and massive amounts of variety within it's few stages will keep players coming back for a very long time.			"

												Nice game! Not just a regular FPS. It combines 4 people to play along together in a sets of missions. I love the gameplay. Just one thing bothers me: ridiciously amount of police, and some f*cked up logic. Who would send a batallion (more than 30) of normal police, SWAT, etc just to take down 4 people? TOO MUCH BLOODBATH/LIVES taken away!Moreover, they are bursting, in a room, or even walk to you in very close. There's no grenade as well. Real SWAT team could've send tear gas/smoke grenade or something. Aside that, the gameplay's okay.			"

												So, this is a COOP game from 2011, but since half of these reviews are slow as ♥♥♥♥, I decided to come back and reveal yet another game from the dephts of the past years. I present to you, PAYDAY: The Heist.This game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ass fun with friends, and not that good when playing solo. PAYDAY: The Heist's synopsis involves 4 professional guys robbing picked out heists. When I first started this game, I was given the benefit of the doubt in thinking that this will be some crappy indie game, even more doubt when I found out the company, Overkill Software, was formed from the directors of GRIN, whom is responsible for one of the worst, most generic games ever made, EVER. I was wrong.GRAPHICSNow, the game doesn't have those top-notch graphics we see, it ponders more to the gameplay, but this section isn't left out. Everything, from the First World Bank, to the No Mercy hospital is enriched in detail, and complexity. Low-res textures are, as much as they can, removed and only when you are some detail-nut who likes to notice things. The game doesn't offer that much of a linear chance, but everything is complex and well-made. There are also some visual filter stuff in the menu I don't use. Bloom♥♥♥♥♥♥ while appearing at some points of a heist, is not excessive and appears only for added realism. All-in all, graphics are pretty good.SOUNDThe sounds, while not perfectly executed, give some needed environments the buff they need. Civilians screaming in terror are probably the most thought out, but the guns don't sound great. For example, the cops shooting their pistol sounds pretty ♥♥♥♥ing weak. And when huge firefights occur, the gun sounds just take a huge♥♥♥♥♥♥and leave, because everything is just said gun sounds, no bullets whizzings or anything. Doesn't give that much of a scenery if you ask me. The music makes up for it though. It's a mix of rock and electronic, and gives you that adrenaline pump when you need it. Bass rapes the songs at times, but it's still executed to pump you even more.GAMEPLAYNow here is the best part of the game. It really gives it it's substance. You and your buddies go on heists that are picked for you. Prediction is eliminated at this point, because every situation occurs RANDOMLY, and requires you and your team to pick out your loadouts carefully. At the start, you are bestowned with the option to scout out ahead and mark out the plan, which doesn't give the game that immediate action build like the mainstream concurence now-a-days. The only drawback I have on this heisting system is how unreal it is. Seriously, you get like 5000 SWAT officers shoved up your♥♥♥♥♥ WHERE the ♥♥♥♥ do they find this kind of firepower? I am drilling the vault, and a great bunch of police officers appear at an Assault wave ready to buttrape you. Of course, this is all for an intended challenge, but really? You're gonna bring the whole America down on my♥♥♥♥♥ Once you start the heist, you can use the F key to shout at stupid♥♥♥♥♥civilians who don't listen to you. They also managed to sucessfully find some use out of the keyboard key. You can use that to make officers cuff themselves, mark out special units, and do a ♥♥♥♥♥on of other things. It's amazing how much use one button can do here. Most of the gameplay involves drills and saws that are required, so it may get tedious for you, but the replayability and different scenarios excuse for it it, and gives it more interest the more you play. The A.I, unfortunatley, sucks balls when you play solo, but it can be perfectly understood because this is a CO-OP game and not designed only for you (if in that case you have no friends, ♥♥♥♥♥♥). The game also warrants defending your backs. If you go alone to find some object or♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can guarantee you'll be in custody, unless you're pretty sure you can handle the cops. It's all about thinking and planning everything out as a team. You get a HUGE arsenal for things to prep yourself up too. Silenced UZIs, pistols, 2 shotguns, assault rifles and so much more. If you're a gun-nut, you'll love it. I had some added problems with the difficulties, because it's just police spam all around, and basically redefines the whole meaning of difficult. You need to SERIOUSLY prep up and have some firepower to finish a mission on the highest difficulty. This difficulty is somewhat lowered when the music from earlier kicks in during an Assault wave for adrenaline, and also the added cash, to remind your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that you have a million bucks waiting for you to roll in.STORYThere is no story for the game, but it has a synopsis. Basically, 4 guys (a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a Sheffield guy, American and a Swedish) gather around and eventually meet some hacker/whatever called Bain. From then on, it's straight heisting. My favourite guy is Hoxton, the British♥♥♥♥♥♥This game is what CO-OP should be. While it has some drawbacks, I had kickass time playing it, so I give it an:8.5/10""			"

												-Amazing plot: rob banks and run around like headless chickens screaming out for Bain.-Real 3D-time technology: drills/saws are so realistic that you find yourself staring at them during the entire heist!-Very motivating rewards: loot cash from banks to spend it on absolutely nothing! Thank you, Overkill.-Infinite playability: ever get bored? Smuggle out the same Chinese prisoner over a hundred times!-Endless action: there's more cops than there are dollar bills in the bank you're trying to rob!-Superb graphics: did I ever mention something about the drills/saws looking like a real piece of art?-Massive supply of guns: really, there must be almost a dozen guns in this game!1!11111!11-Incredibly balanced: as a team of four, absorb over a thousand bullets and take down over thousands of cops! Alone!-Intelligent AI: feel free to solo, having your AI team stare at a wall while you're bleeding out.-Great community: teammates tend to try to shoot a vase while you're trying to sneak your way into the pentagon.-Great community: did I mention the one time my team took the last bit of an ammo bag while I had litterally 0 ammunition left?-Great community: this one guy tried to kamikaze a bulldozer (juggernaut) by slapping it with his wrist.-This community is REALLY great: I love having my game paused for 5 minutes to have someone join then say ""oopss, sry wrng room""-Detailed heists: I had to smuggle a chinese prisoner, tie him up into a chair, lift him up via balloon to have an airplane swoop by and catch it at the exact specific time-frame.-Great community: someone called me a d*** for not reviving him when he has a swarm of cops circled around him.-Bain is god: you don't know where he is, who is his, what he is but you still accept instructions on robbing the national bank from him.After falling off a roof I instantly recovered by grabbing my teammate's hand.420/69 would drill again.

												Decided to come back to this from Payday 2, and this game does not ♥♥♥♥ing dissapoint.  Whereas Payday 2 has more options and an RPG style progression, Payday: The Heist is much more linear in how the game unfolds.  You can unlock all of the skills in the game, there are a small selection of weapons, and at most the ""skills"" are designed to work around a party of 4.What this game lacks in choice, it makes up for one of the best heist/action movie simulators you're going to play in a long damn time.  Straight up recreations of scenes from movies, or entire movies themselves.  Rather than throw 20+ different options to complete at a heist at you, you often have one objective to complete at a time, often with dozens of cops throwing themselves at you.Holed up on a rooftop with SWAT climbing up the sides and jumping from adjacent buildings at you? Check.  Fighting your way down a crowd downtown street, chasing a traitor who stole your cash ala HEAT? Check.  Sneaking into a highrise building to steal a buttload of diamonds while holding various corporate members hostage for negotiation?  Check and check.The graphics have aged a bit, being a 5 year old game, but they get the job done and it's well optimized.  The music is absolutely amazing, and in many aspects I would count it as better than Payday 2's soundtrack.  Rather than dubstep/DnB tracks, P:TH opts for breakbeat loops with emphasis on bass, giving it a lower key but higher overall intensity feeling to the shootouts.  Rather than spending the entire match in a constant shootout with cops regardless if there's an assault in progress or not, the game gives you downtime inbetween assaults, letting the tension build before dropping you into a balls out assault wave from every direction.  It gets you in the mood and honestly keeps me coming back to the game again and again.  I particularly enjoy the Panic Room Theme, which slowly builds up as you fight your way up the derelict apartment building to the saferoom filled with cash.At $15 this game is a steal, the WolfPack DLC is unnecessary but does come with some nice skills and weapons, it's your call though since it's 66% the price of the actual vanilla game.

												Payday: The heist je co-op střílečka, ovšem ůplně jiném stylu než oblikle. Budete mít 4 čený tým kriminálníků a vaším cílem bude vykrádat banky, obchodovat s nelegálními předmněty chytat ty jenž zradily váš tým skrátka spoustu zajímavých věcí. Hra si hodně zakládá na kooperaci takže pokud máte nějaké kamarády nejlépe 3 tak hurá do akce. Hra s lidmi po internetu je také dobrá ale podle mého názoru spousta lidí nevnímá pokus o komunikaci a dělá si co chce (tím ale nemislím všechny). Ach hra s boty, boti jsou naprosto hloupý vážně jejich IQ dosahuje data příštího pondělka což je možná skoro 1 sakra, takže Overkile příšte lepší AI. Hru bych velice doporučil určitě si užijete mnoho zábavy, takže neváhejte a bežte si ji hned koupit!			"

												This... this game started it all. This game has never been a piece of scheisse for me plus I always had the hope we were going to get more DLC's since the first one is called ""Wolf Pack"" I thought we could get more ""Packs"".  (Yeah, yeah I know). As I was saying... to really enjoy this game you need a good team. (And I love mine, Mista, Duck and Bread). Don't even bother trying to play this in SINGLEPLAYER cause in MULTIPLAYER is when the game really really shines.The gameplay is just flawless and runs smoothly in most low-med computers and it is not buggy.  I'd dare to say is better than Payday 2 if we talk about having fun. But there are two things completely different.A good shooter, good graphics, good music, good everything.I love this game.Oh, and the community are not pieces of ssssss. I don't know if I can say the same of Payday 2 community, but I also recommend to buy a four-pack and play with friends so you avoid all of that.Remember, stay low, stay dark, avoid guards and gunfire, here we go!!

It's challenges you with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics. Meaning no scenario will ever play out the same way twice.

												PROs:-Guns feel solid. While the starting stuff can feel a tiny bit weak at first, after getting some upgrades the weapons start to fill out nicely. -Difficult. Its kind of arguable, I suppose, that being difficult is a good thing, but its hard to feel like a winner without having to first travel down the bloodiest, most bullet-filled hell that the higher difficulties on this game can be. -Graphics aren't too bad; that's always a plus. Don't expect anything mind numbing on this front however. -Soundtrack is noice. There can never be enough beep-boops in my game music.-Teamwork is key. Also pretty arugable to be a pro, but there is nothing better in my opinion then completely curbstomping a giant wave of enemies with all of your friends (given that you are good enough). CONs:-The difficulty might push away people who just want a casual experience. Its pretty hard to be casual when its so easy to get downed. Break from cover without thinking on the higher difficulties? Dead. Not taking out Snipers? They will find a way to shoot you eventually. Bulldozer charging you from behind? Good luck with that. -PhysX installer bothers you as you boot up the game. This is fixable, however; just follow this guide:

												It's a bit weird considering that I came to know the franchise I played the most by 2016, by pirating it's very first game.Payday: The Heist.And when I paid my due (buying the original), it's because this game is just pure awesome!I'm still not of the hook yet, as when Payday 2 came along, I pirated it first until like 10-20 update the game have released, that's when I decide to just buy the original for good to make the enjoyment of the game unhindered by searching the pirated update (it still exist though, iirc)PDTH shines in it's cinematic heist flow and solid gun play, compared to Payday 2 which offer diverse playstyle and ever increasing arsenal and heist location. But Payday The Heist still holds its own as a classic throwback on the game that spark the genre of heisting-with-your-friend.One feature I would surely miss from the recent iteration is the character interaction during heisting. Every heist have some kind of story between the character as it progresses. I hope Payday 2 can aim higher on that department.Sadly, PDTH is bogged down on a number of element.The Heist is more-or-less static, you can only do it one way or a mix of 2 with still the major way basically the same with every heist released in PDTH.Progression system to unlock arsenal, equipment and passive skill is grindy at best. You won't reach the end growth if not clocking more than 50 hour doing the hardest heist getting all objective and loot. So it might turn off some people.There's only 1 game mode, which is heisting. Don't compare it to Left 4 Dead series which have mutator, scavenge, etc. But PDTH relief this by having the heist objective a new and different on each heist. Basically making the heist's objective on the same level with L4D various game mode if I say so.For those of you who came to know Payday 2 first, you won't regret buying this game that spark the genre. It might server as a break from your 1000th hour of Payday 2. It'll feel fresh, trust me.Even better if you can get your other heisting partner in Payday 2 to play along in this.Discount is really generous when it comes to sale.Getting DLC for this is more lucrative, since it ties also to existing Payday 2 DLC, buy 1 to get 2 so to speak.Get ready to begin the story of the original Payday crewAnd it'll not be as easy as Payday 2.Mask up			"

												The concept is interesting and music is quite good. However, developers failed at pretty much every other aspect of the game.The color scheme is ridiculously bad. Brown filter makes you sick almost immediately.Weapon handling is even worse than graphics. It feels that bullets just disappear into the thin air even if you're shooting the enemy point-blank. Killing waves of brain-dead cops is repetitive and annoying. Watching how they die is boring and unsatisfactory.And most maps are badly designed. Avoid.			"

												I bought this game on sale after I had so much fun playing PAYDAY 2, just to see how much PAYDAY 2 changed from PAYDAY: The Heist. I was surprised to find out they are like 2 completely different games!ABOUT THE GAME:Take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score”PROS:+ Fantastic level design (completely different missions unlike PD2)+ Vast variety of enemy types (cloakers, tasers, shields, dozers, its amazing)+ Can be very challenging and engaging (requires teamwork)+ Unique gameplay mechanics (taking hostages, restarting drills etc)+ Skills and equipment are cool (a little bit lacking of content)CONS:- You can't skip the opening cutscenes (makes repeating missions tedious)- Only a few missions (can make the game feel repetitive)- Interaction times are off (even with skills, restarting drill takes FOREVER)- Stealth mechanics suck (not really much to work with)- Connection problems (they happen often)SUMMARY:The game is a lot more simple than its predecessor PAYDAY 2, but it is still just as fun in it's on way. It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying.Final Grade:7 / 10 jammed drills			"

												Unlike PAYDAY2PAYDLC2, all the weapons, equipments and abilities will unlock when you gain specific amount of money in this game. It would never be easy for any one if he didn't prepare enough. Experience, skill and teammates(I hope so) are the only things lead your heist to success. Just +rep this time.More reviews will be added when I reach 145 and 193.			"

												A game I find significantly more entertaining than the sequel. Do beware of some of its issues though. Enemies have divine accuracy, snipers are a nightmare, cloakers give no warning whatsoever and have virtually no OHKO cooldown, and tasers only need to see a small part of your playermodel to taze you and are extremely difficult to shake off single-handedly. The game can be frustrating with bots or incompetent pubs. The difficulty system also works differently than the sequel, with all difficulties capable of providing a challenge.PS: If you buy the game, make sure to get the Wolf Pack and Wolf Pack Weapons DLC. Sentry guns, machine pistols and grenade launchers. What's not to love?PPS: I mentioned the friendly AI before. I cannot stress how absolutely worthless they are. If you play with them with any frequency, you will rip your hair out as it takes them five seconds just to initiate a revive when they're right next to you. There is also no special that will not utterly wreck them. A single Shield trumps all three bots with ease. In other words; when possible, stick with multiplayer.			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a first person shooter that allows players to embark on a spectacular and intense experience of a career criminal.The 6 original heists (First World Bank, Heat Street, Panic Room, Green Bridge, Diamond Heist and Slaughterhouse) provide a variety of approaches to achieve the best payday, including blasting the way through a downtown bank vault, managing hostages in an armored car hijacking and even a midnight infiltration of a high-security facility.This game challenges the player with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics, which means that the scenarios will never be repeated, forcing the player to adapt to different situations every single time.The game features an amazing 4 players cooperative experience, and teamwork is essential to ensure the plan's success.The gameplay is good, the graphics are great in my opinion and the soundtrack is superb, although the AI could be improved.The released content provides 3 amazing new heists (Undercover, Counterfeit and No Mercy) and plenty of fun.I highly recommend PAYDAY: The Heist along with the Wolfpack DLC.

												Much better than Payday 2. It lacks some features such as more advanced stealth and skill trees from Payday 2 but the gameplay is much better. There are no micro-payments, no skins. Just you, your buddies and your gun. Also, the difficulty is much higher, you actually have to be good at the game to play on Overkill difficulty! And no OP DLC will help you overcome that problem. Speaking of DLC. there is only one availible, and it adds much more than so called ""DLC's"" or money grabs in PD2. It adds 2 new heists, new unlocks, new weapons and the best part is that if your friends don't have the DLC maps they can still play with you if one player has the DLC! The levels are challenging and fun, the gameplay feels more tactical and Co-Op focused. I strongly reccomend this game over the ""sequel"".			"

												One of the best game's I own on steam! I'm a fussy gamer to find the perfect game, but this is one of them! An almost ""bank robbing simulator"" mixed with epic action and stealth. You need to take cover and you take damage so easily! I'm preordering PayDay2 and If it's not as good as this beauty of a game there is no god.			"

												Very good game. My favorite feature of this game is probably the really low resolution mask( I mean who couldn't love those ugly masses of plastic).I don't really know how the stealth works because I'm a scrub a stealth. Best hesit has to be heat street, which is where your driver screws you over and drives off. But if your looking for a game to goof off with friends or have a nice time with the community, I would recommend this game. 8/10			"

												I bought this game to play during the summer and I was very excited to play it to the point of me almost exploding with excitment when it was the last day of school. I even had trouble waiting for the game to load and then it finally loaded. I was so happy when it finished loading, so whenn it was done loading and i pushed the play button and a message said preparing payday the heist and then it just crashed and i was so distrought over paying $16.00 to buy a game that wouldnt even work not to mention the devlopers got a PAYDAY and i got a game that doesnt work. So my point being this game does not always work and run like it should.			"

												This game is fantastic! If anyone is thinking about buying this then get it! It is one of those few games that make you feel rewarding and make you want to do more things. Payday The Heist is about four guys, Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. You get to choose who you want to paly as and what heist you want to do. As you play and beat heists you will get money which is what you use to level up your class. There are 3 (4 if you get the DLC) classes that you get to level up. Each class has different weapons, crew bonuses and bags. The difficulty of the heists depend if you want to just have a normal experience. Overkill if you want to go hard. And easy which is only for the two heists for people who just started playing the game. Over all, this game is a fantastic FPS. If you are choosing to buy which Payday to buy first, get this one for starters. And remember, SHOOT THE BULLDOZER IN THE FACE!			"

												I bought this game on sale after I had so much fun playing PAYDAY 2, just to see how much PAYDAY 2 changed from PAYDAY: The Heist. I was surprised to find out they are like 2 completely different games!ABOUT THE GAME:Take on the role of a hardened career criminal executing intense, dynamic heists in constant pursuit of the next “big score” PROS: + Fantastic level design (completely different missions unlike PD2)+ Vast variety of enemy types (cloakers, tasers, shields, dozers, its amazing)+ Can be very challenging and engaging (requires teamwork)+ Unique gameplay mechanics (taking hostages, restarting drills etc)+ Skills and equipment are cool (a little bit lacking of content) CONS: - You can't skip the opening cutscenes (makes repeating missions tedious)- Only a few missions (can make the game feel repetitive)- Interaction times are off (even with skills, restarting drill takes FOREVER)- Stealth mechanics suck (not really much to work with)- Connection problems (they happen often) SUMMARY: The game is a lot more simple than its predecessor PAYDAY 2, but it is still just as fun in it's on way. It is much more loud oriented and doesn't have much stealth in it, but makes working with your teammates to complete tough missions more satisfying. Final Grade:7 / 10 jammed drills			"

												If you have any idea of what anything is, you should already know that Payday the heist is a four player co-op FPS. In which you rob stuff.You take the role of 1 of the 4 clowns in the payday crew, hitting banks, armoured transports, and more. This game is just fun to play, but frustrating at a few moments, just play it smart and you should stay out of trouble.Payday the heist feels like it's younger brother, Payday 2, so if you like Payday 2, this game is more of that and vice versa. It's not like they're exactly the same though, here are some notable differences:In PD:TH the heisters directly interact with bain, which makes bain that bit more likeable, instead of just the guy that nags at you.Cash is pretty much experience, when in the sequel it's two seperate things.Singleplayer actually works in PD:TH, since the companion AI revives you if you're down.The upgrade system is more simple and linear.There are much less weapons in PD:TH than there are in PD2, but that means you can decide what weapons you want alot easier.Overall, I have fun playing this game. I recommend it to anyone who likes co-operative fps games, because overkill sure kicks♥♥♥♥♥at making those.			"

The DLC adds quite a bit to it as well. Don't expect to be amazing right off the bat if you're used to shooters, its harder than it seems (until you level up and get more equipment anyway).

												I will admit right off the bat, I'm not good at writing reviews. I will also admit that I do not care. This game deserves a review, and it's getting one. Anywho...PAYDAY: The Heist is, well, a bank heist simulator. Basic stuff: walk into a bank, put on a mask, shoot guards, keep civilians in check, etc. Also, if your computer is as bad as mine, you're destined to have framerate issues unless you have a custom config. I can understand this, because the graphics are amazing, the animations are realistic, and the amount of effort put into this game is overwhelmingly great. I bought this during the Winter Sale, at a low price of $2. Trust me, it's worth more than that. Its actual price is great for such a great game.+Awesome graphics+Realistic+Great price+Satisfies your criminal needs-Frustrating at moments, but that's part of the fun.-THOSE DAMN TASERSOverall 9/10			"

												Without a doubt, one of the best Co-Op games ever made. You can play this game endlessly with your friends and never get bored. Singleplayer mode isn't that bad either except for the fact that your AI teamates are dumb ♥♥♥♥ just following you around ._. Highly recommended game but be sure to get it for the Co-Op fun :D10/10			"

												The PAYDAY crew are here to rob banks, houses and hospitals.Featuring a colourful and funny cast of varying countries of origin and personalitiesHoxton the funny and my personal fav character from Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England.Dallas the calm, collected American member of the group and refered to by most as the group leader.Wolf the psychopathic member of the group, from Vallentuna, Sweden.Chains another american who is ex military and this games support.The game is incredibly fun and like its sequel is full of re-playability and brilliant gameplay, I personally love the co-op in this game and its a great way to spend time with friends and have a good laugh .9/10			"

												Overall, this is a very fun game. The missions are quite balanced and give you a sense of accomplishment after making it to the end. Level design is varied and interesting. You have the ability to change your masks each round - something that most other games would charge extra for via DLC. The No Mercy tie-in with L4D is pretty spiffy as well. This is not a Counter-Strike clone by any means.The ONLY drawback is trying to play by yourself is near impossible for some missions. You quite literally cannot complete all tasks. Why? Because your computer-controlled teammates CAN shoot the enemies, but they CANNOT complete any of the mission objectives. You will be the one placing the saw, scooting the hostage along, placing the C4, etc. While this is possible in some missions, it is near impossible in others. For these, you MUST be playing with human players (and preferably ones that know what they are doing). :)Graphics 9/10Gameplay 10/10Sound/Voices 8.5/10Overall 9/10 - Worth every penny!			"

												Payday The Heist. In my opinion, one of THE best tactical co-op FPS out there. Yeah sure it's a bit old, but that's because most devs don't pay attention to their old games, but us gamers do. It has very positive effects of skills, weapons, missions and masks. Although the stealth IS a bit dumb, after all it wasn't made to be stealthy, it's still fun. I recommend this game purely because the community cares about it, plus it is fun as hell with friendos!

												There are few co-op only FPS titles. Even L4D has ""infected vs survivors"" mode. My first impression of Payday was ""juggalo FPS""; that alone made me NOT want to play it. Indeed, I always pick the raptor mask. If you hit Level 145 (ha!), you get the President masks from Point Break!See, this is a grand homage to robbery heists in contemporary crime drama cinema. The levels consist of a multitude of objectives, with a bit of randomness at points. Co-op here means more than Team DM. You NEED the voice chat, preferably with friends, and you need 4 people. Even then this game WILL kick your♥♥♥♥♥ If you don't coordinate with everyone AND plan things right, you WILL lose. Sure, you keep your XP (gain levels, get perks/guns/etc), but the devs keep adding content for the higher difficulties! I wish they'd make a tutorial. Mechanics aren't tricky, but you gotta figure out a lot.Shooting zombies, Nazis, & aliens is getting old. Shooting THE PO-LICE is where it's at. Especially with THIS music.			"

												Pro's- You get new weapons each time you level up. - It almost never gets boring playing the same mission.- Co-op is available, so you get to play with other people or buds.- Although this game isn't recent, OVERKILL made a new game as a sequel to this. (Payday 2, so more gaming is available).Con's- When someone is joining your game. (Already started) You'll have to wait a few. (Depending on their internet connection.) But you can disable that.- Payday The Heist isn't getting updated due to the recent game that OVERKILL released (Payday 2).In general, this game is awesome, and very fun to play with others. If you liked Payday The Heist, check out Payday 2!			"

												GAYDAY™ The Heist lets you become a professional gun toting manchild who aims to become the best there ever was in robbing banks. Gotta' Rob 'em All and Gotta Catch All the Gay Clown Masks, because once you're a demi-god capable of dispatching an entire city's worth of cops on a daily basis and having illicitly gained enough cash to buy a European country outright, it's hard to aspire to anything else sensible.

												This game is the 4-player co-op Left 4 Dead wanted to be!While in Left 4 Dead we were promised to get changing missions and alternative ways to finish them, they always stay the same - beside the different spawn(rate/places) of the enemies. In Payday the missions change: in lower difficulties only in details, but in higher ones you sometimes get other objectives.You get a nice set of different Heists to fullfil. Even a big homage to its main inspiring model Left 4 Dead by giving you the opportunity to play the non-canon events that leads to the outbreak of the infection.If you like such 4-player co-op games with real teamwork you should give this game a try!Not to forget it is a nice 'gun porn'. ;-)			"

												Great team based game. Fun levels and really challenging. The guns start off pretty bad, you miss point blank some how, but as you level up classes you upgrade them. To all good games, there must be some bad obviously. The AI are more stupid than dirt.. You run to the next objective, turn around, they are outside getting sniped.They are really slow to picking you up, so 1 small mistake with people (like say, getting hit by a cloaker) can be a huge mistake with AI teammates. Because they will run head first into him too..Also, on First World Bank there is a annoying glitch my and my friends keep falling into. Where you randomly slip through the floor and get stuck in walls. No way out as far as I can see.. 


So Overkill is like Valve and doesn't fix their bugs? All I did was Melee a cop and fell through the level and kept falling. 
A Screenshot of PAYDAY: The Heist
By: Munkee




 <--- What I mean.Also, this isn't a stealthy game.. They have Diamond Heist which is my favorite, where you sneak around hacking alarm boxes, but hardly stealthy since you have a 50% chance of still triggering the alarm.Now if you don't mind not stealthy, wanna just chop down swat team and show the cops who is incharge, buy this game. I like Stealthy games, but this is still amazing to play.8/10-2 because the FWB glitch, and how terrible the AI are.. Worst than l4d bots. lol.			"

												Payday: The HeistOne bloody good thrill.Your criminal methods are cruel and straight forward, this makes it all the more effective. You spare no time for dilly dally, your team quickly comes up with solutions to solve the issue at hand to complete the heist.Ever wondered how the zombie apocalypse started in Left 4 Dead? Well the answer to that is.... You. Yep, you bloody started it all... Do you feel like a criminal yet?  "

Fast paced, four player co-op, awesome weapons, and a ton of random variables in each heist that you have never seen, even after 100 hours of gameplay, and pop-up for the first time.

I like games that you can be a so called, ""hero"" and ""criminal"". The best way I can describe this game would have to be, just totally amazing. Thats it, just totally amazing.The only bad thing(s) about this game are, you must buy the DLC pack, ""Payday: The Heist Wolfpack DLC"" if you want to play the best maps and have the best guns, which is only $8,49 to buy. The other bad thing is, so many noobs! This isn't bad but, if you don't want people always getting down, don't play with noobs.Other than that, good game!

Yet after playing and enjoying so much payday 2 I started thinking that Payday The Heist... which started everything, should be rather good.I am honestly playing more Payday the Heist, more than I'm playing Payday 2, not for the graphics, but the game itself, it's harder. That's it actually, cops are smarter, weapons work better actually, missions are way better (surely if payday the heist had the ammount of missions payday 2 has people would still be playing it as much as they play the 2nd) and tougher, I'm enjoying The Heist much more than payday 2.

												This game is in my opinion almost BETTER than the sequel! Its much more fast, and requires more ""movement"" in the sense that a lot of the heists are ones that you'll need to move to different locations to complete them. It also has a great replay value just like the sequel. I recommend this to anyone who has the sequel already, as for everyone else I would recommend getting the PAYDAY 2 first just in case you don't enjoy this one.			"

												I was playing this game long time ago,on a pirate version,and now got it on Summer Sale 2014.I didnt enjoy it so much,when i was playing offline on pirate version,but now with friends,its so much better experience!I was playing PD2 a lot since now,because its also a good game,but requires more player skill than this one.+Verry easy to start playing,cuz you dont have much to care about.You got weapons,time on drill and hordes of cops,so what else you need in a robbery game :D+Does not require much time to level up and gain upgrades and peks for player.You also can upgrade any ""tree"" because at a point you will have all the skills in each tree.(sorry if im wrong at this part,didnt play the game so much)+A lot of fun with friends+Diference between dificulty levels is realy nice,since it truley awards players with more cash ;-) +Very replayable.I played in most part First World Bank mission,because i like it the most,and i didnt get bored,because i always gor something new for leveling up,new weapons,mods for them,new equipment,its upgrades armor upgrades,crew bonuses and other cool stuff.+Kind of hard achievements,wich make some kind of special ""mission"" for me and friends.+Chalenges for weapons and different actions,which award with money.This is even cooler because that makes some sense in changing your loadout.-Sometimes Specials are kind of owerpowered,for example Tasers are just a pain in the @ss if i were running around with locomotive and then get tased from middle of nowhere,and my friends are too far to help,or im just in wrong place.I cant blame anyone but myself,but sometimes they get realy annoying.-Graphics in general are not that BAD, but guys look at those masks,they are so low-poly and low-res textured,that cool looking heisters (in theory) look kinda....meh.Stock masks in PD2 are much better and look the way how it was suposed to be.-Shoot indicator.Sometimes is hard to realise where da hell from cops shoot at you.The screen just gets kind of red,but no indication of where are you been shot from.(Yes i now its not CoD but c'mon guys,wheni get shot from back and cant realise that its really sad)At final i would say the game is not bad,but i wouldnt recomend buying it at full price.Better wait for a sale or discount from Overkill,which they do quite offen,along with free PD2 weekends.P.S. Dont forget to buy Wolfpack DLC whic adds quitre cool stuff in the game.Hope this helps someone ;-)			"

Good price for this game. Payday: The Heist in my opinion is much better than Payday 2. The Payday 2 heists are short while in Payday 1 these heists can take up to 20-30 minutes, on normal. So, enough said, if you want an amazing cheap action game, get this game. Trust me, it will be worth your $$$$$			"

												This game is an amazing co-op shooter for a very moderate price. It's reasonably easy to learn, and yet takes quite a bit of practice to master the top difficulty!The two main goals of the game is to complete heists, and by doing so, earn ""reputation"" (XP) to unlock new weapons and gear, and upgrades for those weapons and gear. There's also plenty of challenges to keep you busy long after you hit max level! The Wolfpack DLC adds a new set of stuff, and also two new heists, so is well worth it. (Note: you can still join a game that's hosting a DLC map if you don't own the DLC, but you need to own the DLC to host those maps yourself)So buy this game, steal money, level up, and maybe, just maybe, you can get golden masks, if you're good enough. ;)			"

												It is a pure and simple FPS with those basic commands that we 've met players of this genre. Shoot, if copper works as a team to take down the enemy in the eye and sends bullet ammo again. It's a simple game mechanics, with standard gameplay that appeals greatly. I did not see difficulties or weaknesses in this regard. Beautiful graphics, no harm done. But the biggest storylines of the usual FPS is that you are the good guy. Go there and do good deeds, saves the day, saves the world. You can also be a criminal, which is part of a top-secret organization or fight in a place far away, for reasons unknown to the character. You are a common greedy villain of the big city. Your goal is to get out at predefined sites performing robbery ( as the name ' heist ', which means assault says ) with his group organized in co-op (online or with artificial intelligence). There are goals in the game, it's not just arrive and shouting "" hands up ! "" ( ! ) In the first phase, for example, before giving voice assault, it is advisable to find the bank manager to access a key that is required during this phase.

The game is not only exceptionally challenging, but has everything I would look for in a shooter. Awesomeness and good multiplayer. Since this game has a lot of both, this is an awesome shooter. Definetely buy it, it is worth a lot more than 20 bucks when you play it.10/10			"

												Going back to play Payday The Heist after a haitus of of playing Payday 2 you see a solid game on par with the sequel, The Heist excels in everything it goes to accomplish except possibly Animations, But this was an early title for the company off the Xbox 360 so one would make a few exceptions for it looking a little stiff, What you come to see is an expertly crafted Horde Shooter with the horde being Common Cops to Swat that are hell bent to take you out on every heist you go on by throwing numbers over fire power at you in an attempt to take your gang and yourself out, On the flip side your set out with a standard pistol, and assault rifle to work towards unlocking other weapons and upgrade them by unlocking more for it to continue to progress yourself by taking money as a main replacement for XP, The game features 9 Heists with entirely different scenerios for each with each having their own enviorment to work in giving you room to breath and room for the cops to come at you, If your wondering if Payday: The Heist is worth checking out after playing Payday 2 and having enjoyed it then you will most likely enjoy this as well, It holds up to be on par in the same aspect as L4D1 is to L4D2 since both titles share the same systems and enemies.The Game has 1 DLC in the form of the Wolf Pack, It includes 2 Heists a new Tree for unlocks [Weapons/Skills] and that's the extent, While seeming limited on the surface it is worthwhile to look towards getting this DLC on sale, Or simply with your purchase since it offers 2 compitent and well made maps that offer more to the expierence, Aswell as it gives you DLC for the second title Payday 2 in a similiarly named Wolf Pack that includes the same Maps and a Grenade Launcher  with a special Nail Gun as a melee.Note: The Heists for The Heist are currently being ported over to Payday 2, While being similiar they often take twists on the old maps to make them better, Or simply update them as they take them over, If your willing to wait eventually all the heists from 1 will be in 2 at some point, Currently there's 4/9 Heists on 2 as of this review.TL:DR: Payday: The Heist is a solid game and worth your time if your looking for something to play from time to time in the form of a horde shooter, It is on par with Payday 2 and holds up as it's own.

												It is a pure and simple FPS with those basic commands that we 've met players of this genre. Shoot, if copper works as a team to take down the enemy in the eye and sends bullet ammo again. It's a simple game mechanics, with standard gameplay that appeals greatly. I did not see difficulties or weaknesses in this regard. Beautiful graphics, no harm done. But the biggest storylines of the usual FPS is that you are the good guy. Go there and do good deeds, saves the day, saves the world. You can also be a criminal, which is part of a top-secret organization or fight in a place far away, for reasons unknown to the character. You are a common greedy villain of the big city. Your goal is to get out at predefined sites performing robbery ( as the name ' heist ', which means assault says ) with his group organized in co-op (online or with artificial intelligence). There are goals in the game, it's not just arrive and shouting "" hands up ! "" ( ! ) In the first phase, for example, before giving voice assault, it is advisable to find the bank manager to access a key that is required during this phase. That done, you have another set of goals that involve illegal activities to be performed for the success of the ' bad guys ' you control. While time passes, the police will appear at various levels. Securities local, public police, special police and SWAT Then the beast will catching! The peculiarity of the game is exactly this. Political correctness in the modern world totally left out.

												The first Payday is a solid 4 player co-op FPS. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead in some ways. I prefer the graphical style and gameplay in this to the L4D series. Loads of stuff to unlock as you level up your character and plenty of challenges to complete in either single or multiplayer. Its been overtaken now by its successor, but remains a very playable game. Although clearly not designed as a single-player game, I think its still pretty good as a single-player game, better than L4D single-player IMO.			"

												Heisters, put your gloves and lets hit the bank!.Payday The Heist puts you in the shoes of 4 bank robbers, Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. You'll complete several missions involving bank heist (duh), diamond robbery's, drug dealers, or even blood transplants!. You have to survive waves of cops, swats and special enemies in an attempt to stop you and your 3 teammates. However, you don't have a large amount of weapons and gadgets to fight, but its not that much of a problem.  The game could be unforgiving and it's very hard in higher difficulties.The graphics aren't great but they are not bad, sound assets are quite good and animations are great. Sometimes, A.I is dumb , especially your A.I teammates. Yes, you can play this on singleplayer, but you won't get the same experience as in multiplayer, so if you want to play this game properly, get 3 friends and start having fun.The game doesn't feature a campaign, so I only recommend this if you're going to play multiplayer (the multiplayer missions are the same but with a better game experience). The music fits very well on every situation. The only big problem I could see in this game is the fact that it can get very repetitive very soon, as it only feature like 6 missions and they play the same way almost every time you replay them.

												My crew and I have entered the bank and scoped the place out. Two of them find the bank manager, who has the keycard that we need; while I wait in queue at the tellers, and another teammate is upstairs with a view of the whole room.PRO:+ As a nice touch, killing civilians is a big no-no+ Your respawn timer is longer for each civilian you’ve killed.+ There are even some special police that require you to work together(co-op) to take down.+ Upgrades opening up as you gain reputation levels by collecting money+ It's even fun when you fail a mission and have to strategize with your team to figure out how to do better next time.+ Payday has some of the best music at the start and end of its heists that I’ve heard in a while.CONTRA- A major lack of communication- I had to use a Steam Forum to find out how upgrade system works- During the heists, there are a lot of objectives where you have to wait for something, but the game doesn’t always tell you how long you have to wait for.CONCLUSION:Stealing stuff has never felt this cool.

It seems like after PayDay everybody is trying to implement the same kind of experience. What makes PayDay so successfull is the element of authenticity. Its also higly addicting and makes you wonna try to do the whole thing over again without a mistake.			"

I'm not saying the game is bad the games is pretty good. With Payday 2 coming out 2 years later this game would've pretty fun for back then. Being an indie company and the game insipred from Batman the Dark night opening scene where the joker robs the bank (you can now do in pd2) this game is really fun. Although the drill is stronger than most high school relationships it's pretty much a drill made in china. There is the no mercy hospital which i found to be the coolest of the missions.

												PAYDAY:The Heist, it's a very great game I love the game I could't really tell how good PAYDAY: 2 is because of the lagon my laptop but I can't say PAYDAY:The Heist is better, Drills jam alot which makes me pist sometimes, but the weapons are amazing and gameplay, my fav episode or chapter of the game is (Panic Room), I will be getting a better gaming computer soon so I might be able to play PAYDAY:2, but for PAYDAY:The Heist I can say the game is great and very enjoying I will give it 9/10 if drills worked better I will give it 10/10, The Co-Op is great but online players should work as a team more then running around, YES I recommend this game because it's very fun too play, the game has lot's of detail to it not as much as PY:2 but has a lot and sprinting backwards is a first, Warning do not play infront of you parents they will freak, Lol.

												Badass game. Personally, I think the graphics are perfect along with the heists. The heists in this game are pretty much easy, I even did OVERKILL with one friend. Good price for this game. Payday: The Heist in my opinion is much better than Payday 2. The Payday 2 heists are short while in Payday 1 these heists can take up to 20-30 minutes, on normal. So, enough said, if you want an amazing cheap action game, get this game. Trust me, it will be worth your $$$$$			"

												Much more realistic than PD2 in a very good way. No grinder, no armor, no perk decks. Feels more like actually pulling off a heist and as well as much harder. Overkill in this game is way harder than DW in PD2. Only downside is like nobody plays it anymore.			"

												I was playing this game long time ago,on a pirate version,and now got it on Summer Sale 2014.I didnt enjoy it so much,when i was playing offline on pirate version,but now with friends,its so much better experience!I was playing PD2 a lot since now,because its also a good game,but requires more player skill than this one.+Verry easy to start playing,cuz you dont have much to care about.You got weapons,time on drill and hordes of cops,so what else you need in a robbery game :D+Does not require much time to level up and gain upgrades and peks for player.You also can upgrade any ""tree"" because at a point you will have all the skills in each tree.(sorry if im wrong at this part,didnt play the game so much)+A lot of fun with friends+Diference between dificulty levels is realy nice,since it truley awards players with more cash ;-) +Very replayable.I played in most part First World Bank mission,because i like it the most,and i didnt get bored,because i always gor something new for leveling up,new weapons,mods for them,new equipment,its upgrades armor upgrades,crew bonuses and other cool stuff.+Kind of hard achievements,wich make some kind of special ""mission"" for me and friends.+Chalenges for weapons and different actions,which award with money.This is even cooler because that makes some sense in changing your loadout.-Sometimes Specials are kind of owerpowered,for example Tasers are just a pain in the @ss if i were running around with locomotive and then get tased from middle of nowhere,and my friends are too far to help,or im just in wrong place.I cant blame anyone but myself,but sometimes they get realy annoying.-Graphics in general are not that BAD, but guys look at those masks,they are so low-poly and low-res textured,that cool looking heisters (in theory) look kinda....meh.Stock masks in PD2 are much better and look the way how it was suposed to be.-Shoot indicator.Sometimes is hard to realise where da hell from cops shoot at you.The screen just gets kind of red,but no indication of where are you been shot from.(Yes i now its not CoD but c'mon guys,wheni get shot from back and cant realise that its really sad)At final i would say the game is not bad,but i wouldnt recomend buying it at full price.Better wait for a sale or discount from Overkill,which they do quite offen,along with free PD2 weekends.P.S. Dont forget to buy Wolfpack DLC whic adds quitre cool stuff in the game.Hope this helps someone ;-)			"

												This game has brilliant game play along with beautiful graphics. Absolute stunner! The online is surprisingly good. The level up system is easy to increase your level, the weapons depend on your Rep (level). There are  many different weapons to choose, the support pack is useful for you and your team mates. The down sides are online players, some will kick you if you are a low level. So be prepared to rage a lot. I would recommend using the private match feature, feel free to invite me.			"

-Quick Review-PAYDAY: The Heist is a first person shooter developed by OVERKILL Software and released in 2011. The game can be played solo, or as 4-player co-op, you get to Heist 6 zones/areas and depending on events that occur within the game your play experience will change.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  There isn't much to say about the story behind PAYDAY: the Heist, it's basically four robbers (Wolf, Dallas, Hoxton, and Chains) who teamed up to Rob the ""First World Bank"".Game Play: As has already been said, the game plays as a FPS but instead of just mindlessly gunning down civilians and cops, you need to be careful about who you shoot (You are penalized for killing civilians), and the game is objective oriented. In other words, ""You could just kill cops for days, and your game would never end, or you can kill as little as possible and get experience faster.""There is a level system within the game, you gain experience from picking up money/gems/currency, as you level up you unlock new weapons, tools, and armor.Achievements: The achievements on PAYDAY: the Heist are TOUGH, most of these require a solid team to play with, or a lot of determination/practice/luck. I haven't taken the time to start working on these achievements yet, I'm only sitting at 7 out of 56 achievements (05/18/15). I intend to try for more achievements, but most of them require specific conditions to be met, and ""must be there at the start of the heist"".Price: PAYDAY: The Heist is priced at $14.99, I personally picked up my copy on the 24 hour give away October 16, 2014. I recommend waiting for a sale to purchase this game. However if you're really into 4-player FPS's this is your game, and you can easily pump 20+ hours into this game, thereby justifying the purchase at full price.Conclusion: I've always felt that I'm not the best critic of these types of games since I spend most of my time playing by myself, or with one other friend. I enjoyed playing PAYDAY: The Heist, however I only played single player or with one friend.I would recommend this to people who already have friends they play 4 player games with, I could see Left 4 Dead fans easily getting attached to this game - if looking for a different flavor of 4-player-FPS.

												 ""Players will embark on a spectacular crime spree of six heart stopping heists, including blasting their way through a downtown bank vault robbery, managing hostages in an armored car hijacking and even a midnight infiltration of a top-secret, high-security facility. Additionally, PAYDAY: The Heist challenges players with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics - meaning no scenario will ever play out the same way twice. Teamwork is essential to ensure crew members provide cover under fire, guard key access points, break through various security measures and keep civilians in check. Survive wave after wave of the best that law enforcement can deploy as they shift strategies in response to player actions and gameplay style. Collapse"" 7/10			"

												Ok, I'd like to mention that the first time I played this was on an aweful computer, and it didn't actually work. It was also on one of Steam's free weekends. So imagine my delight when I got Payday 2 for the Xbox, and it worked. I loved the second and I wanted to experience the first game again, when it worked. So with a new computer, I bought the game and I absolutely love it. The missions are fun and you get stuck in (possibly too stuck in whilst robbing banks), and the missions are rarely the same the next time you play them, as different things can go wrong or right, and you never know what it's going to do until it's happened.Overall I love the game and would recommend it to any FPS fan... or proffesional bank robber, but that's not the point...

Posted: August 15, 2014
												This is an extremely addictive and challenging first-person shooter. It isn't necessarily the best game around, but it definitely is fun to play. There is a lot of farming involved with leveling up, but as you farm, your character gets better and you get more improved weapons. There is never a dull moment. Due to the randomization of the enemy spawn locations, no two levels are exactly the same. A guard could burst through a door in a level where that never happened before. The game keeps you on the edge of your seat, and it has the classic effect of making you want the rage quit once you die. However, the main setback of this game is that the AI (or your teammates) are absolutely terrible. They run about as fast as a rabbit with two broken legs, and you have to stop sprinting in order for them to keep up with you. Also, when you are down and are bleeding out, you usually have to shout out to them in order for them to actually come to your aid. But, setting this drawback aside, if you have friends to play with, the game will still be a fantastic co-op experience.My overall rating for this game will have to be an 8/10. It's not the best game in the world, but it is FAR from being the worst.			"

I am recently typing this out in a penitentiary because law enforcement does not know what ""Restart Mission"" means. Aside from it leading to my arrest in real life, this game is pretty fun. Just don't rob banks, though. The cops in real life are not nearly as easy to evade as the cops in the game.			"

												At least this game doesn't have a couple dozen paid DLC packs, the last few of which are pathetic cashgrabs. At least this game doesn't have microtransactions a couple years after they promised it wouldn't. This game was in a time before Overkill decided it would be great to nickel and dime their loyal fanbase. This game, wasn't ruined by a greedy man named Almir.I supported Payday 2 for a very long time, and had previously never touched this game before due to getting a PC after this game was already left behind. Looks like now is a good time to start and see what it was like in a time before shelling out DLC and microtransactions like they were the latest drug.			"

												I'll give it a 4.5/5 rating.Even as an old game, and abandoned by Overkill to serve as a relic before PAYDAY 2.I recommend this game because of it's CO-OP style of gameplay and action shooter.It's like Left 4 Dead 2, but with guns, heists, and more♥♥♥♥♥♥to fight.Enemies may get a wee bit annoying, but it's what adds up to the difficultyThe downside of this game that i had to remove 0.5 ratingIs because of the constant cheaters or hackers, they mess up the gameplay and some people don't find this fun and competitive at all.Which is pretty bad, and the DEVs should add minor updates to fix this game that has some few broken things. I feel they should fix this game and update it alot more.That's my review.			"

												The first Payday is a solid 4 player co-op FPS. I think it's better than Left 4 Dead in some ways. I prefer the graphical style and gameplay in this to the L4D series. Loads of stuff to unlock as you level up your character and plenty of challenges to complete in either single or multiplayer. Its been overtaken now by its successor, but remains a very playable game. Although clearly not designed as a single-player game, I think its still pretty good as a single-player game, better than L4D single-player IMO.			"

What is PAYDAY:The Heist and why should I get it ?PAYDAY: The Heist is a fantastic game, and it's 10 times better with friends. Personally, I think the new Wolf Pack DLC is worth it, as you get new weapons and gadgets (including a sentry gun and grenade luancher). The game might not look as stunning as PAYDAY 2, but in my own personal opinion, it is a tad bit better. You better be wary of hackers though, they lurk in the deepest depths of the servers. Intense combat and interesting heists, there's never a dull moment. Unless your trying to repair a drill with half your crew lying on death's frontdoor. The game has many pro's, but it's not perfect.Pro's You get exactly what you paid for. Wide viriaty of weapons, gadgets, heists and enemies. Extremely satisfying gameplay. 4 playeble characters each with a set of unique masks. Skill trees (Assualt / Sharpshooter / Support / (DLC) Technician). Amazing soundtrack. Smooth textures, the laws of gravity apply to objects most of the time. You can cause law enforcers to surrender and cuff themselfs. Actually have to plan instead of mindlessly storming in, gun blazing. Or you can just plan to storm in mindlessly, gun blazing, BUT in a fashionable order. You have to take hostages to trade in your friends from custody (if they die or are cuffed) Good enemy A.I.Con's You need human players to interact with objectives, take hostages, grab money ect. Bad ally A.I. I'll understand if the drill jammes one or two times but jamming almost 5 times per heist is rediculous. Heroic civileans get in the crossfire between you and the feds. I don't know if this is a glitch but you can revive and use explosive/medical/ammo bags through walls. Cloakers are one hit kills, bieng able to incapitate/cuff you with a simple kick. Stealthing is nearly impossible without a legitemate team that communicate. Paintings fall on top of trip mines and render them useless. Those same painting's have somekind of superpower of not moving once shot again. Feds are on steriods, they never get tired when scaling buildings or parkouring from roof to roof. No awesome music while stealthing. Hackers, hackers everywhere.... Bugs that cause people to become Hoodini or something, bieng able to shoot a law enforcer, than they take a one-way ticket to space, Shooting a law enforcer and then they swan dive through objects, or getting downed and glitch under the map.Conclusion.I highly recommend this game if you have friends to play it with, and if you really want to, then you can add me to join you. The excitement of getting away with 25,000,000 $ feels amazing, but the suspense builds up to that last moment where you just need to get to the escape vehicle.... Now two things can happen at this point: A. You make it and then you're, well, as Bain puts it ""We're set for life guys"" and B. You can get horifically murderd by swarming cloakers, bulldozers, or the Tazer-brigade. This is a must have for anyone that likes to plan, play, execute and succeed if you play with a team of friends. The last time I checked this game isn't getting updated anymore, but it's good as it is. ""Speed is key"" a wise irishman once said, but that only applies to Heat street. The best way to go is ""Sneaky-beaky like"". If you have $15 dollars to spare, then be sure to pick this up and join me in my quest to steal cash/gold/blood/diamonds/cash molds. ~~Ashe~~ "

												After playing every level (including DLC), I have decided to make yet another review. This game is basically Criminal Simulator 2011. You can choose from four criminal masterminds: Dallas, the Assault; Hoxton, the Sharpshooter; Chains, the Support; Wolf, the Technician (Wolf Pack DLC). Each character has special items, such as trip mines, a sentry gun, and cable ties. You can play six campaigns (two more with Wolf Pack) ranging from trying to catch a traitorous burgular who has stolen your money, to stealing counterfeit money, to a classic bank robbery. A customization option is the masks. You can have the classic ""Clowns"" or the rotting ""End of the World"", or perhaps the random ""BEEEEF!"" mask (my favorite). The best thing is that the masks change depending on which character you pick (besides End of the World). I got this game on sale for $1.50 and the Wolf Pack DLC for a buck, but as I played I figured out that the original $15 price point is perfectly fine! This game will entertain you for a while, and is unlike any other FPS. I highly recommend this game and challenge anyone to get to the reputation max (with DLC), which is 193. Good luck!			"

												Although being very difficult, Payday: The Heist does a great job at making co-operation an important part of completing a heist. The AI in this game have their ups and downs (like doing suicide runs if someone is downed) but is not a problem as the game is designed for (and in my opinion, more entertaining with) human players. So if you are looking for a co-op game that is fast-paced aswell as being challenging, this game could be for you.			"

												Heisters, put your gloves and lets hit the bank!.Payday The Heist puts you in the shoes of 4 bank robbers, Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf and Chains. You'll complete several missions involving bank heist (duh), diamond robbery's, drug dealers, or even blood transplants!. You have to survive waves of cops, swats and special enemies in an attempt to stop you and your 3 teammates. However, you don't have a large amount of weapons and gadgets to fight, but its not that much of a problem.  The game could be unforgiving and it's very hard in higher difficulties.The graphics aren't great but they are not bad, sound assets are quite good and animations are great. Sometimes, A.I is dumb , especially your A.I teammates. Yes, you can play this on singleplayer, but you won't get the same experience as in multiplayer, so if you want to play this game properly, get 3 friends and start having fun.The game doesn't feature a campaign, so I only recommend this if you're going to play multiplayer (the multiplayer missions are the same but with a better game experience). The music fits very well on every situation. The only big problem I could see in this game is the fact that it can get very repetitive very soon, as it only feature like 6 missions and they play the same way almost every time you replay them.

												this is one of the most touching stories in my whole life time. It is about two clowns that seek the true act of funniness, the must go to funny school first. So they rob a bank.  But it is really sad when a couple of the crew died (the USA and Brain Faced one). They were a true family. They died while stealing a drill. From then on, The Clowns never got another drill, so they had to use a CRAPPY DRILLLARGHHDRILLSTHATNEVERWORK!$!@$!@$this is the story of how unreliable drills are11/10 would get my drill stuck again			"

												Theres nothing i love more than killing glorified tax collectors and thats all this game is, kill as many cops as possible and while youre at it go ahead and complete whatever mission they throw at you. Its super fast paced and really challenging at times. I dont like the menu layout very much and the missions are limited but still, i can play the same one 50 times and not get bored with it.			"

												- many cheaters- sometimes AI- more and more players start play payday 2 +/- bugs (It´s up to you if you use it or not like: Helping your downed friend through the wall)+ Prize and also DLCs (only 2)+ 4 characters, and each with funny quotes+ a lots of different types of masks+ COOP for 4 players+ 145 levels (193 with DLC)+ weapons, crew bonuses, bags ( - less than in PAYDAY 2)+ many types of law forces+ steam adds (interesting achievements, trading cards, statistics etc.)So, I am very big fan of this Coop game, where you take a role like one of the 4 robbers (Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf). You start with M4 and M9 pistol like level 0 (there is reputation, not level) and you will stealing jewelery, gold or money in 8 maps (with DLC). Yeah, the true is that if you played PAYDAY 2 I think you won´t like it, cause here´s only a few weapons and upgrades, bonuses, and not a RPG part like in payday 2. But If you won´t play PAYDAY 2 or If you was big fan of Payday 2 and you wanna take a look How our group looks before Hoxton gets to Prison you should buy it. All in all: 92%			"

												Through this game I have gained experience in robbing banks, much so that I have attempted to rob a bank myself. I am recently typing this out in a penitentiary because law enforcement does not know what ""Restart Mission"" means. Aside from it leading to my arrest in real life, this game is pretty fun. Just don't rob banks, though. The cops in real life are not nearly as easy to evade as the cops in the game.			"

Additionally, PAYDAY: The Heist challenges players with dynamic environments and adaptive enemy tactics - meaning no scenario will ever play out the same way twice. Teamwork is essential to ensure crew members provide cover under fire, guard key access points, break through various security measures and keep civilians in check.

-Quick Review-PAYDAY: The Heist is a first person shooter developed by OVERKILL Software and released in 2011. The game can be played solo, or as 4-player co-op, you get to Heist 6 zones/areas and depending on events that occur within the game your play experience will change.-Detailed breakdown review-Story:  There isn't much to say about the story behind PAYDAY: the Heist, it's basically four robbers (Wolf, Dallas, Hoxton, and Chains) who teamed up to Rob the ""First World Bank"".Game Play: As has already been said, the game plays as a FPS but instead of just mindlessly gunning down civilians and cops, you need to be careful about who you shoot (You are penalized for killing civilians), and the game is objective oriented. In other words, ""You could just kill cops for days, and your game would never end, or you can kill as little as possible and get experience faster.""There is a level system within the game, you gain experience from picking up money/gems/currency, as you level up you unlock new weapons, tools, and armor.Achievements: The achievements on PAYDAY: the Heist are TOUGH, most of these require a solid team to play with, or a lot of determination/practice/luck. I haven't taken the time to start working on these achievements yet, I'm only sitting at 7 out of 56 achievements (05/18/15). I intend to try for more achievements, but most of them require specific conditions to be met, and ""must be there at the start of the heist"".Price: PAYDAY: The Heist is priced at $14.99, I personally picked up my copy on the 24 hour give away October 16, 2014. I recommend waiting for a sale to purchase this game. However if you're really into 4-player FPS's this is your game, and you can easily pump 20+ hours into this game, thereby justifying the purchase at full price.Conclusion: I've always felt that I'm not the best critic of these types of games since I spend most of my time playing by myself, or with one other friend. I enjoyed playing PAYDAY: The Heist, however I only played single player or with one friend.I would recommend this to people who already have friends they play 4 player games with, I could see Left 4 Dead fans easily getting attached to this game - if looking for a different flavor of 4-player-FPS.

I enjoyed playing PAYDAY: The Heist, however I only played single player or with one friend.I would recommend this to people who already have friends they play 4 player games with, I could see Left 4 Dead fans easily getting attached to this game - if looking for a different flavor of 4-player-FPS.

												I'll give it a 4.5/5 rating.Even as an old game, and abandoned by Overkill to serve as a relic before PAYDAY 2.I recommend this game because of it's CO-OP style of gameplay and action shooter.It's like Left 4 Dead 2, but with guns, heists, and more♥♥♥♥♥♥to fight.Enemies may get a wee bit annoying, but it's what adds up to the difficultyThe downside of this game that i had to remove 0.5 ratingIs because of the constant cheaters or hackers, they mess up the gameplay and some people don't find this fun and competitive at all.Which is pretty bad, and the DEVs should add minor updates to fix this game that has some few broken things. I feel they should fix this game and update it alot more.That's my review.			"

												At least this game doesn't have a couple dozen paid DLC packs, the last few of which are pathetic cashgrabs. At least this game doesn't have microtransactions a couple years after they promised it wouldn't. This game was in a time before Overkill decided it would be great to nickel and dime their loyal fanbase. This game, wasn't ruined by a greedy man named Almir.I supported Payday 2 for a very long time, and had previously never touched this game before due to getting a PC after this game was already left behind. Looks like now is a good time to start and see what it was like in a time before shelling out DLC and microtransactions like they were the latest drug.			"

Definitely hits the point of being a robber, but sadly no grenades available, something that seems to be the problem to every robbery in this universe. :vThe issue, though, is fixed (well not entirely) by adding a GL40 weapon (as DLC) and I'd recommend y'all to get the game + the DLC when on sale.Another thing: GET THE SEQUEL AS WELL.

												So, Payday 2 feels too casual or you just hate its irrational weapon balance? Welcome to the roots!So, here, like in PD2, we have:- Our favorite specials:-- Dozers: simple Dooo.... Wait, WHAT?! HE'S SPRINTIIIIIIING!!!-- Cloakers: nothing to worry about in the silence of the night... AAAHHH!!! Get away from me! GET AAAWAAAY!!! HELP!!!-- Tazers: just Ta-a-a-a-a-azzzzzzze-e-e-e-erzzzzz!!! ZZZ! ZZZZ!!! *on the ground, no ammo*-- Snipers: yes, those little black dots far away out there! You mean which red lazers? Naah, that couldn't be so easy, could it?- Difficulty levels:-- Easy: or is it?-- Normal: no, you really should start with easy!-- Hard: oh, yes, you, courageous one! Heard of loud Death Wish yet?-- Overkill: would you like your a$$ served you on a plate rare or well-burnt?-- 145+: well, oh well!.. Now you will die! ...and die! ...and die...And, unlike PD2:- The FPS are great, but the network code is soooo sloooow.- There's no wrong ""bound-to-fail"" setup - you can make any one work, even with a ""wrong"" weapon.- Skill-trees, that you gradually unlock - feature by feature, no skipping, but you'll eventually get them all for every tree (don't forget about that <Tab + 1...4> button combination during heists).- You have no ""gray screen"" for the last down before custody, but you can tell it is by the health you get back (with every down on lower difficulty levels it decreases: 75% -> 50% -> 25% -> go get your medbag heal NOW!).- No First Aid Kits, so either you go down and hope your buddies will get you up (no Inspire either!), or screw your team's medical supplies (and get kicked for being selfish!)!- Fast-paced raw hardcore experience, where you can only win with skill and team effort on anything harder than Normal.- Yeah, no weapon skins!Give this one a chance! It might just be your thing!			"

												Payday is a fun co-op game, but it lacks polish.The maps are of uneven quality and difficulty. There is frequently a feeling of ""what do I do next?” with inadequate guidance from the game. It helps to play with experienced players, but when you do, you're dragging your team down because you don't have all the levelling perks that they do.There also seem to be many ways to game each level. Beating levels seems to be less about adapting on the fly, and more about knowing exactly where to hide out while you're waiting for events to happen. And you do spend a lot of time in this game waiting for stuff to happen.But past the flaws, Payday is a game with a cheap $20 price tag. There is a certain breeziness to the gameplay that's just a rollicking good time.  The harder difficulty levels require teamwork and planning, which I appreciate. Payday delivers a satisfying co-op experience, of which there are too few today. Really – if judged solely for its “co-op-iness”, this game is top-flight… playing on a well-coordinated team is a great experience.I want to mention that you kill a lot of cops in Payday. A lot.  There's no stealth element here. Through the years, shooters have given us a variety of enemies to gun down of increasingly human-like appearance:  Aliens, robots, zombies, soldiers. Criminals occasionally appeared, especially mobsters. But cops? These aren't even ""corrupt cops.” Call me squeamish, but I find this ... distasteful.All in all, Payday is a good game, even if it’s a bit rough around the edges. The soon-to-be-released sequel appears to be a much more ambitious effort. I hope the developers will be able to apply what they’ve learned from this game to the new one. "

												Super fun game. I enjoy how I get to level my character and unlock items and abilities. Super fun to play with a full party of friends. Interesting levels, the difficulty settings are good. I particularly enjoy difficult settings and play on hardest difficulty whenever I can, this game certainly can be difficult on harder settings and is no easy feat.I was gifted it when it was on Sale a friend bought a 4 pack for like 6 or 8 bucks an I was lucky enough to be gifted it. It was so good, I bought the game on a 2$ coupon sale I unlocked from a badge I made with steam trading cards, and gifted a friend, who then in turn gifted HIS friend a copy as well so we could all play together. WILL be uploading some expert level heists onto my YouTube channel hopefully in the next couple weeks. Great game, hope I am lucky enough to be able to play the second one as well. Well worth the deal, would still even pay 10 bucks for it.8/10			"

It has enough variety to keep you entertained for hours on end.You can play stealth in the Diamond Heist... or all out aussault in the Bank Heist. It's not a completely level based game, if you start you can easily learn the controls and become adept quickly.An overall good game. I would recommend to almost everyone. 9/10			"

												PAYDAY The Heist actually delivers the atmosphere that PAY2DAY lacks; now you actually feels like group of robbers instead of 4 people running around killing cops.

												I was soo pumped when this game was coming out to steam! I purchased the game on day one.. The game is fun but believe me when i say this, the game is tough!! Teamwork is a must and sticking together is another must.. Ai is terrible on singleplayer and you really cannot sneak on any missions while playing single player. Online mode is where you will be playing this game on.The game is def worth 4.99!!  Ps:  Payday the heist is no where similar to payday 2. ProsLeft 4 dead no mercy mission on hereeaster eggs/Hidden secrets in the gamemissions long and hard!!Swat,police, security, fbi, and dozers are on here. Every type of secruity division is on here.Maps generated with new things, depending on missionsConsAI teammates  are terribledrill takes foreverNot many missions			"

												This game is for everyone... you can play it as many times as you want and play it differently every time. It has enough variety to keep you entertained for hours on end.You can play stealth in the Diamond Heist... or all out aussault in the Bank Heist. It's not a completely level based game, if you start you can easily learn the controls and become adept quickly.An overall good game. I would recommend to almost everyone. 9/10			"

												Im grateful i never had the chance to play payday 2 becayse i cant compare the first with the second. All i can do is take this game for face value and let me tell you, for 1.50 on sale you get a game that is a helluvalot fun. extremely team oriented madness. If you're a fan of any co-op game then i suggest you pick this game up immediately, sale or not.			"

												The easiest way for me to explain PAYDAY: The Heist is this: Its a game that encourages teamwork. This game is still playable, even to today's standards of gaming. One thing I like about PAYDAY: The Heist is that it makes you feel more vulnerable. When I say more vulnerable, I mean you can't be as tanky as in PAYDAY 2. If you like references to Left 4 Dead, Army Of Two, Jurassic Park, and even Battlefield, then you'll like this game. They have other references in the game as well, but they're a little harder to understand since they're based off memes and so forth. All and all, PAYDAY: The Heist is awesome and I would reccommend buying it when it goes on sale. It usually goes on sale around the end of the year or so. Also pick up the Wolfpack DLC if it goes on sale. It gives you more things to level up, as well as the heists Counterfeit and Undercover. Other than that, there's nothing else I can say about this game, its just that much fun. This has been Spectral Destroyer 65, and I hope you all enjoyed this review. Take care and have a great day.

												Everyone deserves a Payday but are you up for a challenge ? In payday you can play as four charecters Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf And you have to pull of the perfect heist. This game doesnt have any real story to it  its just random heist that have theyre own short story to them. This game is really fun and has really tight shooting controls. The sound effects is what really makes this game way more fun. You can here realistic gun sounds and awesome adrenaline pumping soundtrack that makes you want to go on a murderous rampage. The game in itself does get difficult but thats okay because i would believe robbing a real bank in the real world wouldnt be easy. This game also offers 4 player co op action which is alot of fun if you have friends to play this game. Overall the game is really fun with a bunch of little and simple things that make it way more fun i would give the main game a 9/10Now lets talk about the Wolfpack dlc. It adds two new heist Undercover and Counterfeit. Undercover is really hard so i would suggest having a good with you.The dlc is really good and if you purchase the main game you really need to get the dlc im giving this dlc a 7/10			"

You might not play it for a thousand hours but for the few hundred you do play it it's well worth the money and you get to understand what the start of payday is about.  Currently play payday 2 and going backwards might not be what your expecting but you can appreciate some of these missions.			"

												Back to the roots of Payday.  You might not play it for a thousand hours but for the few hundred you do play it it's well worth the money and you get to understand what the start of payday is about.  Currently play payday 2 and going backwards might not be what your expecting but you can appreciate some of these missions.			"

9.5/10 ExcellentPAYDAY: The Heist is a co-operative, ""cops and robbers""-themed game, except you always play as the cool robber. It has a very high fun factor.Slightly more of a shooter than it's successor, with a decent amount of content (additional content is available with the purchase of the Wolfpack DLC) and virtually endless hours of fun and challenge, and despite a very small number of trivial glitches/bugs and a relatively limited playerbase, PAYDAY: The Heist is here to steal your heart.I cannot help but recommend it.

												As Payday 2 soon arrives, I highly recommend  playing Payday The Heist, not only to get the feel for the series, but also to experience this amazing first person, tactical shooter. Payday has hours of gameplay promise, and if you put the time into it, you can get guns, supplies, and other items to help you in the many heists you will be encountering! For the price, no game matchs the unique payday!Concept: No storyline at all really, but each heist has a different feel to it. 80/100Graphics: I like the way its presented, it feels very easy to get the hang of, but a lot of the items in the game have low detail and low resolutions. Not to mention there are barely any different character models! 70/100Sound: Sound effects are very detailed and crisp, and everything sounds very HD. 85/100Playability: Gunplay feels fantastic and keyboard/mouse is implemented nicely! 90/100Entertainment: The game is just extremely fun and very unique! Worth a few playthroughs! 100/100Replay Value: Very highOverall Score: 85/100			"

												This game is pretty good. Somewhat realistic heist system, other than the fact that they send the whole US Army/SWAT Team/Police Force against 4 guys robbing a bank.....And destroying cameras limits assault waves to almost zero. This game has almost no replay value if you're playing by yourself, and playing with random people can really ruin it. I say get a group of people you know, start a voice chat of some sort, start the game and start robbing, this way you can direct orders without stopping to type.....Its also really hard without the assistance of at least 1 other person. The first heist is so much easier if you have a second real life person with you so that they can pick up the extra can of thermite, and package money with you.Its fun, can be a real rage game at times....like if you play overkill mode....or try to go stealth and fail. Good game though. Wait for it to go on sale before buying it though....$20 isn't a good price for this game. Do like I did and get it when its about 5 dollars. Maybe even 10 or 15.			"

												This game is definitely worth buying, even though it's true that there is a very short amount of maps / missions to play. The experience also massively improves when playing with friends. I played some missions alone, but the AI isn't too good objective wise, therefor playing co-op improves the game experience positively. Although there aren't many levels for this game, the ones that are there all provide an unique and fun playing experience. It's safe to say that all the levels are very good, not only graphics wise but also gameplay wise. Not only is it ver hard to complete the levels, even if you do they still stay challanging. You'll find yourself playing the same levels multiple times without being bothered too much, and if you do get bored there is also a second version of this game :).The combat is decent, you might have to tweak around with some settings to prevent mouse lag but when everything is running smooth then you'll have no problems moving yourself around in this			"

												This is yet another post-millennium LAN-only game that will likely lead the developers to doom; since this game requires far too many coordinated, available players for it to be a mass-market success. It's unfortunate, as Payday The Heist is a fairly solid and enjoyable game, but ONLY if all of the players use voice chat and have some clue as to what is going on. This game is otherwise insufferable with random groups of trigger happy nubs. I suggest buying this game for a LAN party, otherwise pass... And that's unfortunate. This game would have been a gem in the LAN gaming age.			"

												The orginal Payday is a fun and exciting game. I have met a lot of cool people while playing this game. Very addictive and fun, unlike payday 2 where there is too many DLCs, I feel that the DLC investment here is very good, it doesnt modify the game too much while at the same time adding excitement to the game. I would probably say I like Payday over Payday 2. Either if you like 1 or 2 better, the Payday serries is a fun game and I highly encourage if you have not tried Payday 1 or 2 before, to give it a shot, you'll love it.			"

												Having bought this game during it's fantastic 90% off sale, This game is a tremendous amount of fun. Obviously no game is without it's flaws, which in PAYDAY consist of sometimes tedious gunplay and very very undetailed texture models on certain characters within the game. However, the co-op elements help the game move past these issues very well by utilising fun heists which must be pulled off with stealth and precision. All in all, If you're a fan of tactical, fast paced, co-op FPS's, then this game is a must have. 32/37 ChiggStars.			"

												Payday: The Heist is an amazingly fun game. I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out.Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. When a Rambo tries to run into the open, and play the bad♥♥♥♥♥ they end up getting horribly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arrested, and then left behind as his teammates progress through the stage. The game just has a really intense feel as you yell at civilians to drop to the floor and shoot out surveillance cameras in preparation for police arrival.I have seen quite a few complaints about the AI being 'too sentry,' but imo, it is very realistic. The task force units feel professional and trained as I would expect any officer charging into a bank heist, or general hostage situation, would be. However, they are quite careless about shooting around civilians and you will often find yourself feeling like you are trying to save innocents from a reckless police riot. This game is made to be a Pure Teamwork Tactic and it's very important to make strategy and then excecute the plan, overall. Don't buy this game if you don't have friends to play with, sincerely you'll face having a hard time in heist. I recommend you should play in Co-op with your friends because of the needs to stick together, tactics and teamwork.Rated: 9.4/10 "

There's a level progression tree that can earn you weapons, equipment and upgrades. 5 memorable heists with a DLC on the way. And Endless replayability. It's just 5 heists but they are worth replaying over and over. Your skill gets better everytime you play. I recommand this game to anyone who likes co op games/ or a big L4D player. The community is small, only to have at least 400 active players but they are dedicated and the community should last for a while.8.5/10			"

												This game makes you rely on teamwork and planning to pull of difficult and rewording missions. Each heist is different and require different stratagies to beat. To set yourself apart from other players their are three branching skill trees. Each time you level up either by combat, objectives, or beating a heist you gain a upgrade or item in your skill tree, making you truly feel like a badass heister. The combat is difficult and without bugs. Hostages are a interesting feature, if one of your men are captured you can trade them for a hostage your took. Objectives are interesting and fun. I would say the main drawback is how often during heist you put a drill to a lock and protect it from wave after wave of enemies, which gets repetitive after a while. If the game is on sale, buy it for a friend and play together, co-op is increadably alongside a true hommie.			"

It is a little hard at first, but I was able to complete the bank heist my first try. This game has no cons, and if you buy it during the Steam Summer Sale (like I did) its only $1.49.

												This game is bad, if you have to play with bots, but if you find three other people, a good first person action will wait for you. There are six original heists. Its not too much, but there is DLC, which adds two more challenging heists.Weapons are okay, M308 and AK are better than in PAYDAY 2 and GL40 is really useful here to kill large groups of enemies, because you dont have any grenades or molotovs.The hardest difficulty is a real challenge and without cooperation is impossible to beat it (Deathwish difficulty in PAYDAY 2 is piece of cake against OVK 145+).Bots are stupid (nothing new), they don´t listen to you, if you call them and they are weak. One positive here, they at least kill snipers (in PAYDAY 2 they don´t).If you´re playing with bots - 3/10If you´re playing with friends - 8,5/10			"

												It's one of the best cops and robbers game I've ever played.The storyline is alright but it's a bit short. Not so much plot or other things, just basic ""you got a job to do, do it silently or go all in"" The gameplay is great and not boring.Music is awesome! its not repetitive and fits the gameAI is alright for the AI Coop but the police AI is a bit idiotic at times.But the strongest point in this game goes to the Co- Op.you really need to co operate well with your teammate in order to achieve your goal. If your co operation failed the mission will fail! unless one of you is a hacker (FIX THIS)stealth cooperation is very hard to achieve and need good communication to do it prooperly, but the sesnse of achievemment is very rewarding.

												Recently bought the game as i wanted to play with a friend i have tried payday 2 and gameplay is a bit better but my god the replayability in this game is amazing. It has never been so fun just doing the same heist again and mastering them. And no micro transactions ;). I fell in love with the game right at the start. However, if you want to play online with other people this is not your game. So many people have left this game for payday 2 so there are little to no players hosting a game. However, if your a person who likes to 100% complete game achievements, this is your game this game offers the hardest achievements to unlock( In my opinion) but when done brings a lot of satisfaction to one self. Take it from me i recommend this game to anyone looking to play with friends on game night or just spending some time killing off waves of AI. Just keep in mind online gameplay isn't the strong suit of this game anymore but out of everything i give it a 8/10 for 2016.			"

												One of the sleeper hits of Steam, I really enjoy PAYDAY. Coming from over 2000hrs played of Left4Dead 2, I was looking for something in a similar play style where you have to really rely on your teammates. Although this misses out on any form of versus play, the cooperative mechanic is dead on. You are rewarded for precision hits against the AI, and at times that precision is required (I HATE BULLDOZERS). The goal oriented objectives puts a unique spin on cooperative play...but better yet are the options to stealth missions. Being able to stealthily acheive your goals without alerting police takes patience and practice, not to mention 3 other Player Characters that you can count on. Microphones are a must for stealth, and a real joy to play. The game is easy to learn but challenging to master, but well worth the time investment. Huge re-playability in this game.			"

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a 4 player co-op FPS made by OVERKILL Software.In this game, you assume the role of one heister in doing multi-million dollar heists, including robbing a bank, to stealing a multitude of diamonds.The game has a limited span of weapons for use, and only has the AMCAR (M4/M16) and the b9-S (silenced pistol). The game has 145-193 (depending on the DLC you have) levels, all suited for full completion of the 4 skill trees. These specalize in Assault (damage), Support (Medical), Sharpshooter (Snipers, and accuracy) and Technician (Grenades, fixing stuff).The game has music made by Simon Viklund, and are unique to each heist.The heists, even if there are few, are very fun and unique. First World Bank - Robbing a bank Heat Street - Chasing a helper gone rogue through a city Green Bridge - Rescuing a Chinese Prisoner via blowing up a bridge. Diamond Heist - as the name entails, stealing diamonds, and one of the few stealth missions. Slaughterhouse - Chasing an armored van filled with gold into a slaughterhouse, where you drill it open and steal said gold. Counterfeit[DLC] - Going to Florida and stealing someones counterfeiting plates. Undercover[DLC] - Stealing an IRS server for the money. No Mercy - Stealing blood from a patient, L4D crossover.The game is, however, without flaws. The games graphics are eh, and use an outdated engine from 2001. The game is easy to hack and mod, however custom heists don't exist (and probably won't but a man can dream). Heists can also get repetitive, grinding up to 145/193. This game can get very VERY difficult when going into OVK 145+.I would reccomend this game, but get the game with friends to experience the game together. And if possible, buy the Wolf DLC.			"

Fast paced non-stop action from beggining to the end. Survive waves of enemies while you try to accomplish your objectives (drill a safe, explode something) then bag the money or jewels and run and shoot to the getaway! Good graphics, good gameplay, even better if you play with friends (lookin at you Chillz :)) BUY IT! With the Wolf Pack DLC, you get a new class and weapons, so make sure you buy it also.			"

												Got it at a bargain price of $1.49, and got to say the game is sexy! The game greets with dark, thirsty-for-money kinda music which makes you break bad, real bad and start the heist, and take out as many of those wicked badass cops as possible. With sweet level up rewards in the form of guns and stuff makes you wanna keep leveling up. The higher leveled you are, the stronger damage you impose. Good luck, and get 'em mother fockin' dollas yo!			"

Yes!!!, then this is not the game for you, in this game getting shot is unforgiving, escaping with the money is illegal and the damsel in distress is the woman you just shouted at and then zip-tied, however if you do like intense FPS games where teamwork and cooperation are key whils't you pull of some pretty intense heist's then this is the game for you.

												Fast paced, team based (sp/a.i. or mp) game built around bank heists. Created by Overkill and published by SOE, this game released only to PC via Steam and Ps3 download. There are multiple objectives for each heist and the pressure stays on the whole mission, you can't cake walk through this one. If you like a fast-paced, first person, team based game that relies heavy on team work (rambos need not apply), then I suggest giving this game a try. The devs are in the Steam forums always getting community feedback and supporting their game and even recently added more free content -a new map/mission that they did with Valve (No Mercy- L4D level done the payday way ;) ). I love great games like these, (I've never had a bug)  that are released and not abandoned by the developer shortly after release. This one is still getting the love. Single player is fun and mp is still alive and well, no problems finding games.			"

If you have 2 or 3 friends to play with, the title Overkill is a highly recommended purchase. Our congratulations to the developers for the insight: we hope to continue to support their creature with new additional missions and already we dream a sequel with an advanced AI and techinal sector.

												Payday: The Heist is an amazingly fun game. I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out.Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. When a Rambo tries to run into the open, and play the bad♥♥♥♥♥ they end up getting horribly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arrested, and then left behind as his teammates progress through the stage. The game just has a really intense feel as you yell at civilians to drop to the floor and shoot out surveillance cameras in preparation for police arrival.I have seen quite a few complaints about the AI being 'too sentry,' but imo, it is very realistic. The task force units feel professional and trained as I would expect any officer charging into a bank heist, or general hostage situation, would be. However, they are quite careless about shooting around civilians and you will often find yourself feeling like you are trying to save innocents from a reckless police riot. This game is made to be a Pure Teamwork Tactic and it's very important to make strategy and then excecute the plan, overall. Don't buy this game if you don't have friends to play with, sincerely you'll face having a hard time in heist. I recommend you should play in Co-op with your friends because of the needs to stick together, tactics and teamwork.Rated: 9.4/10 "

												This game is good, it really is. Don't get me wrong, it can be pretty fun when playing with close friends and a mic, but it has some serious glaring issues. One of them is this game can be extremely frustrating. Let's set up a scenario, okay?*So you have to go and put some hacking devices on some cameras. SO what happens is these devices stop working every 5 seconds, you have to backtrack all the way to where the devices were, kill some heavily armed guards. Just repeat that step 3 or 5 times until they are hacked.* If you can put up with an insane amount of backtracking, then this game is perfect for you. Gameplay wise, it's basically what I just said, and lots of shooting.If you have any friends (As I don't-Forever Alone) then this game is very fun.VERDICT:Past the glaring issue(s), this game is great.8.9/10			"

												PAYDAY puts the player in the shoes of a criminal (Dallas, Hoxton, Wolf or Chains) who are bent on making a living for himself by any means necessary. This includes robbing banks, raiding druggies' houses, stealing diamonds, and robbing a patient of his blood. You can level up 3 different skills (or 4 if you have the DLC) Assault, Sharpshooter, and Support. It is a solid FPS, and my only complaint is that there is a bit of mouse lag, which you can fix anyway as there are a few guides on the community for that. 8/10			"

												PAYDAY is, without a doubt, the best shooter to come out in 2011. I've put more hours into it than I have into Skyrim and PAYDAY only has five levels. It's a great shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously and you'll be mowing down police officers like a Grand Theft Auto protagonist in no time. I liked this game so much I bought a friend a copy. Worth every penny.			"

												I really like this game from the start, but there are a few things I don't like and many people would care to disagree with these statements. I have heard that Payday 2 got some bad reviews after the ""microtransactions"" thing, but this game is better. First, we have the rank up system. It takes forever to rank up and get cool stuff; my friend bought me the DLC ""wolf Pack"" and I immediately thought I was going to already have the new weapons and equipment unlocked. that was not the case. Second, I would like to point out that the starting weapons are Peashooters and you can't get a kill with any of them (you get a crappy assault rifle and supressed pistol). Third, even on the lowest difficulty, you get killed too easily and that makes the game repetitive because you have to rely on other people (and AI) to help you up and you don't get your health back or anything else. Fourth, threre are a lot of glitches. On multiple occassions, I have seen enemies flying around like the have ""noclip"" on and enemies running through walls and barriers, which can be either frustrating or funny. Lastly, the game could do with a few more ""heists"" because the ones that are there now get repetitive because there is only about 7 of them and they consist of you: shooting cops and SWAT team members, dying, grabbing money (gold, Diamonds, etc.), tying up hostages, accidentally shooting Civilians because you thought they were cops, and objectives the require you to repetitively run back and fourth. I know this review sound negative, but I think this game is fun. I would like to see more work done with this game, even though Overkill probably won't add to or fix an old game, but it could have more ""heists"", more types of enemies, more weapons, a new (and better) rank up system, and possibly better (or different) starting weapons. Overall, I think it's fun to play with my Friends.			"

												Tight gunplay, decent graphics, so-bad-it's-good voiceovers, and killer music [by the always incredible Simon Viklund] make this game a standout. It's kind of like L4D without a versus mode; only teamwork is genuinely required here. If your team doesn't have it together, good luck trying to clear a heist even on Easy.With 145+ levels to upgrade and three different class branches to flesh out, six heists in-game [In locations like a bank, a gang hideout, and even major city streets in one heist],and more promised via cheap DLC; plus free events & difficulties being added via patches, this game is a gigantic steal for $20. If you're looking for a new zombie-free co-op game that will put your group of friends through the wringer, this is it.Friendly warning: Watch out for the Bulldozers. :P			"

												One of the sleeper hits of Steam, I really enjoy PAYDAY. Coming from over 2000hrs played of Left4Dead 2, I was looking for something in a similar play style where you have to really rely on your teammates. Although this misses out on any form of versus play, the cooperative mechanic is dead on. You are rewarded for precision hits against the AI, and at times that precision is required (I HATE BULLDOZERS). The goal oriented objectives puts a unique spin on cooperative play...but better yet are the options to stealth missions. Being able to stealthily acheive your goals without alerting police takes patience and practice, not to mention 3 other Player Characters that you can count on. Microphones are a must for stealth, and a real joy to play. The game is easy to learn but challenging to master, but well worth the time investment. Huge re-playability in this game.			"

Gameplay: FantasticControls: GreatStability: GreatGraphics: Very GoodDifficulty: GoodSounds: GreatMusic: FantasticStory: N/APAYDAY: The Heist is a tactical First-Person shooter game where you play as a robber and comeplete various heist missions wither it's robbing a bank or stealing diamonds from a gallery whilest fending off of endless waves of cops, swat teams and FBI soldiers. The game features a large ranking system so it keeps you occupied to completing it for a very large amount of time.PROS/CONS+ Play offline with up to 3 bots+ Runs very smoothly+ Ranking system with 120 levels and 3 sepertate builds to unlock perks, weapons and upgrades+ 4 Special enemy types+ Challenges included to earn bonus XP and achievements+ Various masks to personalize yourself+ Various eqiupment, perks and weapons used for assisting teammates- Slightly poor stealth system that isn't used often- Achievements are a pain to unlockCONCLUSION:Very fun and satisfying to play, playing this with friends would be a blast.RECCORMENDED FOR THOSE WHO PLAY:Left 4 DeadNOTES:- There is a sequal to this game (PAYDAY 2)- This game features a DLC pack for more weapons, equipment, heists and upgrades.- This game has been out for quite a while, there may not be a lot of players online to play with.

												AW HELL YEAH. Great game. Like HEAT and Reservoir Dogs rolled in a Left For Dead paper and smoked. If you haven’t seen HEAT and like a good movie with guns – go watch it now. In the game, you attain reputation which unlocks extras for you such as guns, armor, med bags and other perks. 4 person Co-Op. FPS. Lots of “hold this point” moments to simulate intensity. Works. Music is pounding and when you eventually succeed – the thrill of a con pulled off can be pretty satisfying.Kids, don’t try this at home. "

												HANDS UP! ON THE GROUND! PAYDAY: The Heist is one of the best co-op experiences I've had in my life. Even though it has a very limited amount of heists to perform, it has a great value of re-playability. Many of the primary events in each heist are randomized to make each game different.Regarding the engine, it is superb. Loads really fast, looks good, and feels great. It may have some bugs but considering this was all done by an indie company this is an outstanding job. The concept behind the game is simple, yet never seen before-- I can't believe they never made a game like this one. There are different heists, one at a bank, with a lot of shootout, other in a secret vault raid in the middle of the night, which has to be silent without setting off alarms, and so on. Each one is played in a different setting.It also has a great deal of collectibles; there are several masks which can be unlocked throughout the game by doing stuff like reaching a level, finishing a mission, completing a challenge, or finding an Easter egg or a secret.What's the best about this game? The Easter eggs and references to other elements in pop culture. The first mission is like the movie 'Heat', there are other elements which remind you of 'The Dark Knight'; but the most remarkable of them is the joint operation done by OVERKILL with VALVe to bring a mission set in Left 4 Dead's Mercy Hospital, which hints the beginning of the zombie outbreak.OVERKILL also designed many Alternate Reality Games inside the game. For instance, the PAYDAY Secret, also known as OVERDRILL, was one of the most important events in the game so far; and the rewarding feeling that many players had while unraveling the secret, is now paid by OVERKILL with a commemorative plaque inside the so called Overvault, with the names of the people who first discovered the secret.Overall, and even though the game is short and maybe not graphically perfect-- yet it looks very good--, this game is an excellent game and a must have. And if you get the Wolf Pack DLC it's even better, because it expands the game with two more missions and a whole new class to level up, as well as 48 new levels.Go and grab it on my mark... MARK!

												This game is great, it's really entertaining for the Crime/Action scene, it follows the Masterminds of Modern Crime, Dallas, Wolf, Chains and Hoxton. They are in there early to mid-thirties, but are the pinnacle of crime. You can rob banks, extract VIPs, and just let loose and have fun with your friends. I recommend this game to anybody who loves to have fun with their buddies, or just want to know what's it like to rob a bank, in a videogame of course. This is a really fantastic game! Also consider buying the second, as it is basically a better version of this too.			"

												A well thought out co-op first person shooter with plenty of replay value, Interesting heists and plot twists and turns.Similar in style to left 4 dead and a worthy companion piece, if you have friends you play left 4 dead with, it's worth getting this and playing with the same group			"

												Warning: Extremely addictive. It's like Left4Dead where the survivors are robbers and the zombies are policemen. Main objective: steal something worth millions and gtfo! Fast paced non-stop action from beggining to the end. Survive waves of enemies while you try to accomplish your objectives (drill a safe, explode something) then bag the money or jewels and run and shoot to the getaway! Good graphics, good gameplay, even better if you play with friends (lookin at you Chillz :)) BUY IT! With the Wolf Pack DLC, you get a new class and weapons, so make sure you buy it also.			"

												This game could be described as: Left 4 Dead meets Kane & Lynch and Call of Duty.It managed to include best elements of 3 games and something more. Defninetly if you love any of these games, you will love PAYDAY, if you love all 3 of them, your love multiplier will be 3x. For such a low price it offers a lot of fun. Just dont judge this game quickly, you will need 15-30 minutes to get used to it and understand how good its, dont make your final judgement until you u have at least 1 hour of play time.			"

The game greets with dark, thirsty-for-money kinda music which makes you break bad, real bad and start the heist, and take out as many of those wicked badass cops as possible. With sweet level up rewards in the form of guns and stuff makes you wanna keep leveling up. The higher leveled you are, the stronger damage you impose.

The game also provides you with various roles . Along with these roles you get various tools and boosts to help you on your heists , that can range from robbing a bank to stealing money plates.

												Maybe one of the best games I've bought this year. It would be a run-of-the-mill FPS were it not for two things: One, it's huge replay factor. The same heist played twice, while exactly the same AT FIRST, never turns out exactly like the first; you're always kept on your toes for the next surprise. The other thing that makes it unique is the skill tree, which can be changed in-game, during a heist, and does not need you to focus on a single class for you to have good enough perks and weapons for a successful heist.All in all a great game and, while not perfect in every single aspects, I'll say again it was perhaps one of my best purchases this year.

												Killer Game, highley recommended - absolutely worth the purchase. Sooo much fun squadding up with mates/randoms and having a go at cracking the missions. However, (Bad Stuff), like many game releases these days, this title lacks further development in certain areas of gameplay which detract from it being a truly monumental FPS. Equally, there needs to be much more content(!!!)... This is one of those games that would be seemingly successful on Steam should the dev's release a multitude of DLC content.. On a final note, there are various bugs/updates/exploits that don't look like they're ever going to be ironed out, but it's essentially a must-have title IMO. Get it, come play.			"

												Throw Left 4 Dead and the 1995 movie Heat and you got Payday : The Heist. This isn't really just L4D with cops. It's got it's own original gameplay than was L4D has. There's a level progression tree that can earn you weapons, equipment and upgrades. 5 memorable heists with a DLC on the way. And Endless replayability. It's just 5 heists but they are worth replaying over and over. Your skill gets better everytime you play. I recommand this game to anyone who likes co op games/ or a big L4D player. The community is small, only to have at least 400 active players but they are dedicated and the community should last for a while.8.5/10			"

If your co operation failed the mission will fail! unless one of you is a hacker (FIX THIS)stealth cooperation is very hard to achieve and need good communication to do it prooperly, but the sesnse of achievemment is very rewarding.

I must warn you though, I was like you, careless, breaking the rules, but I must say, there are consquences. I heard of these vehicles called bulldozers, little did I know, people then hunted the Bulldozer species, and mocked them by making costumes out of them. Be very careful, your Dulldozer could be next. Long story short, great game especially with friends. If you don't have any, make some so you can play this game!10/10 ☺ "

												Payday: The Heist is an amazingly fun game. I like how simple, independent games like these always manage to get me to sink many more hours into it than any of the higher budget titles that are out.Unlike most shooters out, Payday forces you to play realistically. Your goal is not to rack up a body count, but to perform a heist. When a Rambo tries to run into the open, and play the bad♥♥♥♥♥ they end up getting horribly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ arrested, and then left behind as his teammates progress through the stage. The game just has a really intense feel as you yell at civilians to drop to the floor and shoot out surveillance cameras in preparation for police arrival.I have seen quite a few complaints about the AI being 'too sentry,' but imo, it is very realistic. The task force units feel professional and trained as I would expect any officer charging into a bank heist, or general hostage situation, would be. However, they are quite careless about shooting around civilians and you will often find yourself feeling like you are trying to save innocents from a reckless police riot. This game is made to be a Pure Teamwork Tactic and it's very important to make strategy and then excecute the plan, overall. Don't buy this game if you don't have friends to play with, sincerely you'll face having a hard time in heist. I recommend you should play in Co-op with your friends because of the needs to stick together, tactics and teamwork.Rated: 9.4/10 "

												Having bought this game during it's fantastic 90% off sale, This game is a tremendous amount of fun. Obviously no game is without it's flaws, which in PAYDAY consist of sometimes tedious gunplay and very very undetailed texture models on certain characters within the game. However, the co-op elements help the game move past these issues very well by utilising fun heists which must be pulled off with stealth and precision. All in all, If you're a fan of tactical, fast paced, co-op FPS's, then this game is a must have. 32/37 ChiggStars.			"

No lag, looks sweet, feels even better..I wish COD was atleast half as fluid in controls\gameplay\shooting & precise hit detection as this game, real fun & amazingly looks without any lag - impressive engine in the game O_O . The only thing somewhat ""bad"" - $$$ DLC's like alot of them coming, but IF youll love the game - how is that a bad thing ? :D worth it for me - will get them all ! More HEISTS more GUNS more masks and new class and even more HEISTS ! Hell Yes ! PS. start from easy difficulty lol ;) ""wink""9/10  (If I dont get tired of it - 10/10 & I get all dlc's for sure (discounted or not) , we shall see)  Im impressed, at last a breath of  fresh air in shooter gallery ! >:) Rewatch movie HEAT and grab Payday.

												It is quite a good game, which I recommend you to buy if you like games about heists. The cost of this game is deserved and if it is on sale, take it if you like this kind of games. But if you have more money, then you can better take PAYDAY 2 as it has much more content and other features.

												One of the better games that i've played.Pros:-No microtranscation [Check]-DLCs that are actually worth it [Check]-Over the top heists [Check]-Superb teamwork based games [Check]-Super low price [Check]-Superb soundtrack that never seems to grow old [Check]Cons:-Cannot respec trees without resetting levels-Way to little heists, even with the dlcs (Which adds 2)-Too little guns-Inability to customize weapons or at least downgrade them, if you do not like the sight given to you via the upgrade, too bad. Reminds me of saints row 3 and 4 upgrades which is a bad thing.-No way to go stealth, some heists give you the illusion of it but eventually you are gonna fight those dem cops.-Ai's have an IQ lower than 80. Play single player to observe the wondrous AI :DDespite listing more cons than pros, many of the cons are pretty minor and can be overlooked easily. Ultimately, payday the heist is a fun an addicting game especially when played with friends. In my opinion, this was the game that gave overkill a name of their own. The time where overkill actually cared for their fans, unlike the cashwhoring mentality they have now.Verdict:BUY THIS GAME!!! If you are tight on cash, buy it during a sale, its dirt cheap then.

												The orginal Payday is a fun and exciting game. I have met a lot of cool people while playing this game. Very addictive and fun, unlike payday 2 where there is too many DLCs, I feel that the DLC investment here is very good, it doesnt modify the game too much while at the same time adding excitement to the game. I would probably say I like Payday over Payday 2. Either if you like 1 or 2 better, the Payday serries is a fun game and I highly encourage if you have not tried Payday 1 or 2 before, to give it a shot, you'll love it.			"

What I expect from this game is ""feeling of robbing a bankand do bad stuff"" but I don't get those feeling...what i felt on this game is.........just shoot and stay alive till the end i dont feel like a terorist or bad guy.This is my opinion.....Go try search further info abt this game if u plan to buy this game......for me this game is 60/100 "

												Fast paced, team based (sp/a.i. or mp) game built around bank heists. Created by Overkill and published by SOE, this game released only to PC via Steam and Ps3 download. There are multiple objectives for each heist and the pressure stays on the whole mission, you can't cake walk through this one. If you like a fast-paced, first person, team based game that relies heavy on team work (rambos need not apply), then I suggest giving this game a try. The devs are in the Steam forums always getting community feedback and supporting their game and even recently added more free content -a new map/mission that they did with Valve (No Mercy- L4D level done the payday way ;) ). I love great games like these, (I've never had a bug)  that are released and not abandoned by the developer shortly after release. This one is still getting the love. Single player is fun and mp is still alive and well, no problems finding games.			"

												I was once like you, browsing the Steam store, I was told about this game called ""Payday"". I must warn you though, I was like you, careless, breaking the rules, but I must say, there are consquences. I heard of these vehicles called bulldozers, little did I know, people then hunted the Bulldozer species, and mocked them by making costumes out of them. Be very careful, your Dulldozer could be next. Long story short, great game especially with friends. If you don't have any, make some so you can play this game!10/10 ☺ "

												This game is great, it's really entertaining for the Crime/Action scene, it follows the Masterminds of Modern Crime, Dallas, Wolf, Chains and Hoxton. They are in there early to mid-thirties, but are the pinnacle of crime. You can rob banks, extract VIPs, and just let loose and have fun with your friends. I recommend this game to anybody who loves to have fun with their buddies, or just want to know what's it like to rob a bank, in a videogame of course. This is a really fantastic game! Also consider buying the second, as it is basically a better version of this too.			"

												It doesn't matter how many times I play the same maps I absolutly love every minute of it. Each level has a series of random events that range from how the cops enter the building to get you to how specific events are done. The heists range from bank robbery to a druggies panic room to helping a convict escape.With the addition of the Wolf Pack DLC you get more guns, two more heists and a whole new technition tree to level up in. You don't need to own the DLC to play the new maps too, just join someone else who is hosting them. You just dont get the new stuff.Another awesome thing about this game is that the devs are really involved with the community, and do take into consideraion what the users want and have implemented changes that the community wants.This game is a must have for everyone!

												Hordes of various police agents keep you on your toes and force you to think very strategically. People say it's Left 4 Dead 2 with cops. I disagree.Left 4 Dead 2 requires you to get to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ exit as fast as you can while you run shooting at stuff that can't shoot back. In here, stuff does shoot back and with deadly accuracy. And you don't run. You hold your positions against huge waves of swat and everything. Even when it's time to book it, you can't simply run like the wind. What will happen is you will get buttsexed by snipers and various other law enforcment agents. That said, there's still a ♥♥♥♥♥on of action. Games a solid must have.

												I really like this game from the start, but there are a few things I don't like and many people would care to disagree with these statements. I have heard that Payday 2 got some bad reviews after the ""microtransactions"" thing, but this game is better. First, we have the rank up system. It takes forever to rank up and get cool stuff; my friend bought me the DLC ""wolf Pack"" and I immediately thought I was going to already have the new weapons and equipment unlocked. that was not the case. Second, I would like to point out that the starting weapons are Peashooters and you can't get a kill with any of them (you get a crappy assault rifle and supressed pistol). Third, even on the lowest difficulty, you get killed too easily and that makes the game repetitive because you have to rely on other people (and AI) to help you up and you don't get your health back or anything else. Fourth, threre are a lot of glitches. On multiple occassions, I have seen enemies flying around like the have ""noclip"" on and enemies running through walls and barriers, which can be either frustrating or funny. Lastly, the game could do with a few more ""heists"" because the ones that are there now get repetitive because there is only about 7 of them and they consist of you: shooting cops and SWAT team members, dying, grabbing money (gold, Diamonds, etc.), tying up hostages, accidentally shooting Civilians because you thought they were cops, and objectives the require you to repetitively run back and fourth. I know this review sound negative, but I think this game is fun. I would like to see more work done with this game, even though Overkill probably won't add to or fix an old game, but it could have more ""heists"", more types of enemies, more weapons, a new (and better) rank up system, and possibly better (or different) starting weapons. Overall, I think it's fun to play with my Friends.			"

However, I do think that OVERKILL, should expand this game, with more masks, guns, and heists for the simple fact that payday 2 is all about micro purchases.

This game is a game that has given me hours of fun because I can do all of this with my friends in a excellent first person shooter created by the minds at overkill software. This game is one of my favorite games of all time because it manages to make a correct mix of shenanigans and seriousness in the way that you have to do the objective quickly and with precision in order to do the mission and get your money (watch out for hidden suprises).

												PAYDAY: The Heist is a 4 player co-op FPS made by OVERKILL Software.In this game, you assume the role of one heister in doing multi-million dollar heists, including robbing a bank, to stealing a multitude of diamonds.The game has a limited span of weapons for use, and only has the AMCAR (M4/M16) and the b9-S (silenced pistol). The game has 145-193 (depending on the DLC you have) levels, all suited for full completion of the 4 skill trees. These specalize in Assault (damage), Support (Medical), Sharpshooter (Snipers, and accuracy) and Technician (Grenades, fixing stuff).The game has music made by Simon Viklund, and are unique to each heist.The heists, even if there are few, are very fun and unique. First World Bank - Robbing a bank Heat Street - Chasing a helper gone rogue through a city Green Bridge - Rescuing a Chinese Prisoner via blowing up a bridge. Diamond Heist - as the name entails, stealing diamonds, and one of the few stealth missions. Slaughterhouse - Chasing an armored van filled with gold into a slaughterhouse, where you drill it open and steal said gold. Counterfeit[DLC] - Going to Florida and stealing someones counterfeiting plates. Undercover[DLC] - Stealing an IRS server for the money. No Mercy - Stealing blood from a patient, L4D crossover.The game is, however, without flaws. The games graphics are eh, and use an outdated engine from 2001. The game is easy to hack and mod, however custom heists don't exist (and probably won't but a man can dream). Heists can also get repetitive, grinding up to 145/193. This game can get very VERY difficult when going into OVK 145+.I would reccomend this game, but get the game with friends to experience the game together. And if possible, buy the Wolf DLC.			"

												Tight gunplay, decent graphics, so-bad-it's-good voiceovers, and killer music [by the always incredible Simon Viklund] make this game a standout. It's kind of like L4D without a versus mode; only teamwork is genuinely required here. If your team doesn't have it together, good luck trying to clear a heist even on Easy.With 145+ levels to upgrade and three different class branches to flesh out, six heists in-game [In locations like a bank, a gang hideout, and even major city streets in one heist],and more promised via cheap DLC; plus free events & difficulties being added via patches, this game is a gigantic steal for $20. If you're looking for a new zombie-free co-op game that will put your group of friends through the wringer, this is it.Friendly warning: Watch out for the Bulldozers. :P			"

												Payday The Heist is yet another four-player-coop shooter.I in no way mean that as a bad thing.The introduction of Left 4 Dead near-single-handedly paved the way for a new genre of games, and Payday helps by continuing to lay down asphalt.Playing a heist alone is one of the most boring and grindy experiences one can find in modern games, but the moment you get a friend to join you, it is ridiculously fun.While I don't believe $9.99 is a perfect price tag, it's not a bad price tag. This game is easily worth two sandwiches, if not three.The upgrade system is unique and thus very fun to play with: every time you level up, you gain an upgrade in the skill tree you have selected, but at certain junctures you are forced to temporarily switch skill trees. As a result, you are forced to multiclass between Assault, Sharpshooter, and Support. Each class has its own three weapons, player upgrade, and tool.There is a fourth class, Technician, but it's a $9.99 DLC. The DLC costs as much as the game itself, and I am of the opinion that that is beyond ludicrously stupid.Play Payday if you can get a friend to join you.Average playtime: 25 hoursPrice: $9.99$/hour: $0.40Final Score: 8.5/10Letter Grade: BVerdict: ""Easily worth two sandwiches.""

No lag, looks sweet, feels even better..I wish COD was atleast half as fluid in controls\gameplay\shooting & precise hit detection as this game, real fun & amazingly looks without any lag - impressive engine in the game O_O . The only thing somewhat ""bad"" - $$$ DLC's like alot of them coming, but IF youll love the game - how is that a bad thing ? :D worth it for me - will get them all ! More HEISTS more GUNS more masks and new class and even more HEISTS ! Hell Yes ! PS. start from easy difficulty lol ;) ""wink""9/10  (If I dont get tired of it - 10/10 & I get all dlc's for sure (discounted or not) , we shall see)  Im impressed, at last a breath of  fresh air in shooter gallery ! >:) Rewatch movie HEAT and grab Payday.

Very addictive and fun, unlike payday 2 where there is too many DLCs, I feel that the DLC investment here is very good, it doesnt modify the game too much while at the same time adding excitement to the game. I would probably say I like Payday over Payday 2. Either if you like 1 or 2 better, the Payday serries is a fun game and I highly encourage if you have not tried Payday 1 or 2 before, to give it a shot, you'll love it.			"

												Really fun and challenging CO-OP shooter. You MUST play as a team or else you won't be able to get past higher difficulties.There aren't as many weapons or unlocks as in PAYDAY 2 but the art direction and the atmosphere makes PAYDAY: The Heist look like a comepletely different experience (and a much better on imho). The levels are much longer and make you feel like you are taking part in an action-packed movie, unlike its sequel where stages are dull, short and unmemorable.Very much recommended if you are looking for a fine CO-OP experience or taking a break from PAYDAY 2.

												One of the sleeper hits of Steam, I really enjoy PAYDAY. Coming from over 2000hrs played of Left4Dead 2, I was looking for something in a similar play style where you have to really rely on your teammates. Although this misses out on any form of versus play, the cooperative mechanic is dead on. You are rewarded for precision hits against the AI, and at times that precision is required (I HATE BULLDOZERS). The goal oriented objectives puts a unique spin on cooperative play...but better yet are the options to stealth missions. Being able to stealthily acheive your goals without alerting police takes patience and practice, not to mention 3 other Player Characters that you can count on. Microphones are a must for stealth, and a real joy to play. The game is easy to learn but challenging to master, but well worth the time investment. Huge re-playability in this game.			"

												I really like this game from the start, but there are a few things I don't like and many people would care to disagree with these statements. I have heard that Payday 2 got some bad reviews after the ""microtransactions"" thing, but this game is better. First, we have the rank up system. It takes forever to rank up and get cool stuff; my friend bought me the DLC ""wolf Pack"" and I immediately thought I was going to already have the new weapons and equipment unlocked. that was not the case. Second, I would like to point out that the starting weapons are Peashooters and you can't get a kill with any of them (you get a crappy assault rifle and supressed pistol). Third, even on the lowest difficulty, you get killed too easily and that makes the game repetitive because you have to rely on other people (and AI) to help you up and you don't get your health back or anything else. Fourth, threre are a lot of glitches. On multiple occassions, I have seen enemies flying around like the have ""noclip"" on and enemies running through walls and barriers, which can be either frustrating or funny. Lastly, the game could do with a few more ""heists"" because the ones that are there now get repetitive because there is only about 7 of them and they consist of you: shooting cops and SWAT team members, dying, grabbing money (gold, Diamonds, etc.), tying up hostages, accidentally shooting Civilians because you thought they were cops, and objectives the require you to repetitively run back and fourth. I know this review sound negative, but I think this game is fun. I would like to see more work done with this game, even though Overkill probably won't add to or fix an old game, but it could have more ""heists"", more types of enemies, more weapons, a new (and better) rank up system, and possibly better (or different) starting weapons. Overall, I think it's fun to play with my Friends.			"

Gameplay: FantasticControls: GreatStability: GreatGraphics: Very GoodDifficulty: GoodSounds: GreatMusic: FantasticStory: N/APAYDAY: The Heist is a tactical First-Person shooter game where you play as a robber and comeplete various heist missions wither it's robbing a bank or stealing diamonds from a gallery whilest fending off of endless waves of cops, swat teams and FBI soldiers. The game features a large ranking system so it keeps you occupied to completing it for a very large amount of time.PROS/CONS+ Play offline with up to 3 bots+ Runs very smoothly+ Ranking system with 120 levels and 3 sepertate builds to unlock perks, weapons and upgrades+ 4 Special enemy types+ Challenges included to earn bonus XP and achievements+ Various masks to personalize yourself+ Various eqiupment, perks and weapons used for assisting teammates- Slightly poor stealth system that isn't used often- Achievements are a pain to unlockCONCLUSION:Very fun and satisfying to play, playing this with friends would be a blast.RECCORMENDED FOR THOSE WHO PLAY:Left 4 DeadNOTES:- There is a sequal to this game (PAYDAY 2)- This game features a DLC pack for more weapons, equipment, heists and upgrades.- This game has been out for quite a while, there may not be a lot of players online to play with.
