												Somewhat of an underappreciated gem, The Club is a great third-person shooter that combines aspects of old-school arcade shooters with the modern TPS games that we see so much of today, and that alone makes it worth playing.			"

												Its sad, that many people rated this game down only becouse they dont understand what is this game about. This is not about touching storyline and about milions of missions. Here , you are suposed to choose your character and do the best score u able to do. Many cool modes of game from defending of your position, runing laps or just find exit from map in limited time, while waves of enemies comming and trying to kill you. Game is about repeating same level until you are PRO. If you do not like this type of game dont buy it, but dont say its not good, becouse this game is awesome and unique.			"

												I dont really understand why everyone hates this game i honestly think its one of the funnest games ever seriously if you go to the gunplay mode then give yourself a set of events (try to make the list huge) give yourself awesome guns and youll have a blast playing this. Plus its a great game to play if you dont know what to do and just wana pass the time i often find myself coming back to this game when i get bored and it always cheers me up, (usually i play it on xbox though) the character selection is good SEAGER is awesome and NEMO is a crazy guy.i rate this game 10/10 some may think why and not take my opinion seriously but i give it this score because iv had nuthing but fun from it iv had zero issues with GFWL either			"

												Too bad this game wasn't a hit, both financially and critically. One of the few 'high score'-based games that I actually enjoyed playing. It was really addictive with lots of characters, all with their own weaknesses and strenghts. Creating combos and keeping them as long as possible kept this game fresh. The idea was to walk through a level killing one enemy after another as quick as you can while maintaining a combo. But not just run-and-gun mind you (well, a bit); you had to kill them with style (headshots, explosive barrels, you name it). A combo meter would then build up and you could score massive points, which was ultimately the goal of the game.Ah... good times :D[Rating: 83/100]			"

												What's better than shooting people? Running and shooting them at the same time! Welcome to the Club!The Club is 3rd person action packed shooter focusing heavily on run and gun gameplay. I have never seen game that would focus on run and gun as much as this game in single player mode. Whole game is designed around combo system. If you kill a guy, you get x points (depends on where you hit him, and which type of enemy you kill, as well as distance from which kill is scored). If you kill another one before your combo ends, you get 2x more points, and then 3x. The higher combo, the faster ""downtime"" (time before combo ends). So yeah, if you don't like to kill fast and move a lot, this game is probably not for you.Otherwise game is well optimized from performance point of view. However menus are very sad, they are designed for gamepads, and if you have one you should really use them in menus instead of mouse and keyboard. Also there's no way as far as I'm aware, to change FOV, which is not very high (I think it's around 60).Another sad thing is, that they designed split screen, but removed it in PC version. There's online multiplayer, but not active anymore. But you can still play it if you get a couple friends in the game, it's a lot of fun in my option.Game is using Games for Windows Live. Yes dat DRM. 98% of people play this game only for single player, and that's why I think you shouldn't worry about GFWL as you can:a) create offline account and just play without MS accountb) install xlive which removes GFWL, and lets you enjoy the game without DRMThere's no coop, but there's gunplay. Gunplay is gamemode designed to be played against friends. You basicily select maps, and weapon you want to use in that level, and try to get as many points as possible. Then your friend plays, and his goal is to score more points than you. This mode can be played with up to 4 players, and it's fully compatible with X360 gamepads, so if you have 2 or more, you can each play with your own gamepad.			"

												Here you go, just to save you time if you dont want to read full review, look below if you want to read full review: "" The Club is Fast paced , fun and chaotic 3rd person shooter. Its all about trying to get best possible score in level. Biggest problems this game has are GFWL and Somewhat repetitive gameplay. Could still recommend for people who like old-school games and want to try something new""General-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Club is very unique and refreshing Third-Person shooter, its not story driven game , but instead its all about the score.You get points for each enemy you kill, depending on where you shot him, how difficult was the kill etc. You also have combo meter ticking down and each kill refreshes it and adds more combo. There are also other ways of getting combo points (shooting skull signs on the walls). So the whole point of the Game is to do stylish kills and chain them for maximum point gain. The stages also play out always the same way, requiring you to memorize enemy locations for best possible points. There are different characters and they all have different stats (health, speed etc) , but differences are quite small and you unlock new Characters by playing Campaign. Campaign --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Main Gamemode is Campaign, where you are taking part on these Club Bloodsport tournaments altough there isn't really much story going on here, you have AI opponents and your goal is to beat their time/score depending on the mode, sometimes you can only stay in chalked are or you will blow up, sometimes you need to reach end of level in time, but they are all essentially the same, all about score and time. This is how the campaign plays out pretty much from start to end, you have different locations where you play, prison, bunker, venezuela , factory .. etc and it brings decent enough variety to the levels. Campaign doesn't seem to be that long ,about 3-4 hrs long, without retries. But you can always try to get better time, or crank up the difficulty, which is the point of the game really. As said, the campaign mostly plays out the same way, so it does get bit repetitive at the times, but its good in short burtsOther Modes----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You have also freeplay mode where you can replay all these missions and try getting better time and the game also has versus mode, but atleast i didnt get it to work.Also worth noting is that the game does still use Games for Windows Live, which means that some players might have problems launching/playing the game. I Didnt have thoes but its been reported that this might cause problems to some.Gfwl also seems to affect said versus/multiplayer mode and you cant play online anymoreSummary ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+ Fast paced, fun and hectic+ Great level layouts+ Varying Locations+ Good in short bursts- Still bit repetitive gameplay- GFWL- Lack of Different gamemodes			"

												What this game lacks in story, it makes up for in decent gameplay. It runs well and all, however it does have a few issues:- You must sign into Microsoft's ""Games with Windows Live"" Sign-In App to be able to play the game with the save data of that said game. That is pointless and unfair because for most games on GOG, Origin and Steam; you don't need to sign into ""Games With Windows"" just to play a PC game. If I wanted to play a game on xbox, I'd go and do so. - There's no way to run the game in windowed mode, and I've checked the settings. This is a huge downer for me :(________________________________________Now if you can get find a way to bypass these issues, then you're golden. If you can't, then its best to avoid this version of ""The Club."" I'll leave with that to make your own choice. Anyway, thanks for reading and stay batty my friends.			"

												The Club is, in a nutshell, Battle Royale meets the 100 Meter Dash.  It's a third-person shooter where the point is to run from point A to point B as fast as possible while staying alive and killing as many enemies as skillfully as possible along the way.It's not big on depth, doesn't have a lot of multiplayer features, and you might get some mixed replay value out of it...but it's currently on sale for $2.99 and shouldn't be missed at that price.  It's strangely unique, and if you're a twitch gamer it'll push your skills to the limit.			"

												It's a nice game to break the monotomy of flashy multiplayer fests and singleplayer giant stories.It's simply you, a couple of guns and lots of mindless thugs to kill in speedruns to achieve the best score possible.Despite being flawed by a standard PC port and having lots of issues due to Games for Windows Live (you must install if you want to play it), it is a nice underrated game. For the price of 4,99€, it's worth it.			"

												From the creators of Project Gotham Racing. They bring quite an unorthodox video game. It's a game that your main focus is achieving the highest score rather than progressing through any form of plot. Except the characters' brief backstory, and an ending in the same shortness of earlier fighting games.8 skilled killers have been taken into an organization called 'The Club'. Whether they wanted to be in it or not. They fight in several tournaments of ultraviolence to reclaim their freedom or what they desire.Each contestant has unique attributes to them.  How fast they move, how much damage they can take, and how much damage they dish out. It allows for some experimenting to see who can rack the best chains of kills quick as possible in various events regarding survival, moving through the level at a quick pace, or sustain damage better when health is scarce.If you like score attacking video games, just killing your foes stylishly and quick as possible. This game is for you. If you want plot or deep storyline. Don't expect it in this game.Please note to use the patch fix guide on steam, when you finished installing.Pros:*Can be as very tough or very easy as you want it to be*Art style aged decently for a 2008 game*Good pacing for the action*Decent music*Has a skill ceiling required to get the best scores. AI does their best to disrupt your scores or to overwhelm you.Cons*Multiplayer is probably non existent by now*Could've been at least some more lines for the characters in their endings. I think they deserve to at least say something for killing for their freedom.*May get repetitive for some.7.5/ 10 Would recommend to anyone who likes arcadey gameplay or third person shooters, and can live without a plot rich storyline.

The game is a solid arcade shooter with a different levels of challenge, from ""casual"" to ""real"", and they do a great job in keeping the game fresh offering a good challenge. Try the demo, and see that chase camera, see the game flow, see the graphics and then decide. I bought this game for cheap and I don't regret it.			"

												If you enjoy running and gunning gameplay then this is the game for you. That is pretty much the whole point to the game. You run and gun to keep up your combo and to get the max score on the leaderboards. The gameplay is fun and keeps you moving the entire time. The thing that makes this interesting is the many gamemodes it has like survival  laps, and race to the finish. On each map you get the same set of gamemodes for each map. The only difference is the location you are put on each map and the different location and everything with each gamemode you play. It can feel repetitive and annoying to do the same thing over and over again on each map. You run and kill everything in site. The game is very easy to beat and is not very long. The reward in the end is you get a nice ending and all the unlocked characters to continue playing if you so desire. Online play is totally dead but I could imagine it would be very fun with friends. I would suggest to get this game when its on sale,			"

												The Club is one of those games that you'll randomally find in a $5 cheap bin at gamestop, buy it because your bored, then find out it's actually ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. Not even partially looked at its released, this is a hidden gem. Anyone who's played Tony Hawk Pro Skater will enjoy the living ♥♥♥♥ out of this game. Reason why? It shares almost the same exact score system, just instead of doing tricks to get combos, you get kills! Every single round played is around 2, 3, to 5 minutes long, so it feels like an arcade game right inside your home. (It's perfect timing for listening to hardcore pump up music too) The weapons/shooting are extremely satisfying to use, while the gameplay is your addicting, ""Well... JUST ONE MORE ROUND"" type. It's a unique combination  put together extremely well. Totally give this game a look. If the $15 price tag is to much for you, check it out on Amazon. I heard it was $2.50 with free shipping from a friend not to long ago.			"

All of them have a story why are they competing in the club but all of the campaings stay the same. That really wastes the potential that this game had but all it is just a boring shooter. The game has wonky controls that dont feel right, the aiming is off and its hard to aim for a headshot. This game has a sport element. Bassicly all you do is run around the levels try to rack up kills and get the highest score possible and beyond the easy difficulty setting is near beyond impposible to rack up points.

												If you haven't already, do NOT buy this game. Firstly, you have to jump through hoops to get it to work (read the forums). Secondly, it is a bad port -- they leave the Xbox buttons in the UI instead of changing them for PC for example. Then, once you start playing it, you realize how lacking of substance it really is. One thing going for it is the character designs and the CG videos look good.If you're really dead-set on getting this game, read the forums first to evaluate for yourself if it is something you'd want to go through the trouble of playing.

												I sank hours into this game on Xbox when it came out. Copped a lot of flak when it was released but it's a really fun arcade shooter where you have to run through a course shooting grunts as skillfully as possible before your timer or combo meter runs out. Other scenarios have you surviving siege situations whilst trying to nab as many kills and targets as you can. There's plenty of levels and characters to play through. Each character is slightly different to play as and it's a fun challenge in the higher difficulties. Only issue is you need to have windows live installed, there are plenty of instructions on the steam community forum. Basically download windows live, sign in (at the bottom of the main menu) , download the update and manually install it (which was a bit tricky on windows 10 but i worked it out with the help of the community boards and i'm awful at that kind of thing). Then you need to download a cheat tool for your pc to slow it down because it's running a bit too fast on windows 7 and above, drop it around to 80%. It's still playable without changing the speed but it'll be pretty hard get a high score on the higher difficulties if you don't.Overall a fun game to distract you for a couple of weeks, or in my case, a very long time if you want to beat those high scores.
