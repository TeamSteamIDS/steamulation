												IMO, one of the better COD available to PC. Had a rough launch but Treyarch seems to be the only activision COD developer who cares about PC gaming; rolling out bug fixes quickly and including FOV slider.This has true Dedicated server support and support of unranked modded servers. The community has very much diminished, and most of the lower latency NA servers are mostly Nuketown forever game types with almost no servers hosting DLC.Buying DLC for this is only justifiable if you desire to play the Zombies game mode; which is an absolute blast, especially with friends; going for those higher levels and finding all the easter eggs.My favorite part of this COD is the gunplay. Trades in gunfights tend to go to the more skilled player rather than the player who sees the other first (like we see in newer COD titles).In summary:Pros:Twitch Shooter with skill oriented gun playTrue Dedicated Servers with Mod Support on unranked ServersZombies gametype with tons of replayCons:90 FPS Cap (Old Quake engine bugs when running over 120 FPS)Lack of Eyefinity or Surround multi Display support (Flawless Widescreen or Widescreen fixer solves this)Small CommunityNuketown everywhereNo point of buying DLC unless you like the zombies game type			"

												s great. One of the last Best CoD's you can get.Complaints1. The price... $40 for almost a 5 year old game?!2. Connection issues: since it is a 5 year old game, the servers are starting to come down and have tons of problems with the connections..3.Can't play SOLO without a connection: When I want to try and get the high level of zombies I cannot because TreyArch makes the game *Always online*. Now just to be clear when you are on the STEAM page. It does not say anywhere that you MUST have an on-going connection to play the game.Postive comments1. Great community: I have never played with a CoD community who are ""mature"" than kids on the digusting consoles. Never really any complaints but if somebody did wine the server would tell you to ""Stfu"" xD2. Create a Class: It's not bad consider you can buy ANY of the equiment you want instead of unlocking all by killing everybody, plus they are some great snipers and assualt rifles.Do I reccomend this game? Yes and no. The reason I am keeping it as a negetive is the price and the server issues. I mean think about it? Advanced Warfare is about $60USDs and this game is about 40USDs. Not worth it completely because it is a 5 YEAR OLD GAME TreyArch. But anyways I would say about a 5/10 because online is good, once you get it to work, but again, this price needs to be lowered to $20USD instead of this price. Thanks for reading...			"

												With all the uncertainties surrounding the Activision/Infinity Ward debacle that took place back in March 2010, many pondered an inevitable fall from grace for the Call of Duty franchise. With Medal of Honor's impending preempt release, that speculation was still debatable. However, hardly anyone ever considered the opposite. Except for maybe those who were hard at work behind the doors at Treyarch. They were given an opportunity to prove to the naysayers of the Infinity Ward fan club that they could bring the franchise to bigger and better heights. Even with that skepticism, the team at Treyarch knew what was at stake and have made their point very clear.Call of Duty: Black Ops took a lot of risks by stepping away from the norm, particularly in terms of storytelling. Players primarily take the role of Alex Mason, a man who is being held captive and interrogated for information concerning the Ascension Group. A seemingly random sequence of numbers is being broadcast at an unknown location, and his captors believe he has the answers to unravel their mystery. It's hard to speak too much on the plot's topic without giving away any spoilers, but I will say this; their new formula was a huge success.The story still has plenty of the blockbuster elements that the franchise is known for, but manages to portray itself in a much more intelligent light. It's not just the typical action for action's sake type of game. The story has a well-written narrative that conspiracy buffs will surely love. Not only that, but the main character has a more vocal presence than any previous Call of Duty. The developers even decided to take a slightly more cinematic approach with the addition of a few cutscenes, rather than having dialogue throughout loading screens to help with the pacing. They managed to keep a good balance between set piece moments as well, which are just as intense as ever. Some of the most brutal melee kills are executed during stealth segments, and I imagine that's why they included an option to turn off ""graphic"" content at the start of the game.The single player campaign wasn't the only bold evolution that took place, as the multiplayer component had its fair share of alterations. The most prominent is the new currency upgrade system. This new progression method allows players to earn ""COD"" points in addition to experience points during matches. Not only is this improvement leaps and bounds over the old, but it also gives players a level field by having all perks and attachments available for purchase at the start. Also, once you've unlocked the appropriate categories through ranking up, you can acquire any kill streak reward you wish or invest in an insane amount of customization options. Higher-tier weapons are still unlocked at certain ranks as well, but the advantages they once held are now an issue of the past.This new Combat Training simulator lets you practice Free-For-All or Team Deathmatch modes against AI opponents. This is a great way for new players to work their way into an online multiplayer setting at their own pace, and will be a perfect way for clans to map out and plan new attack strategies. If that wasn't enough, Treyarch even included an in-depth Combat Record to give a detailed look at how your multiplayer stats break down. It includes everything from kill/death ratio graphs, individual weapon stats, to heat maps that show the main spots of activity. The training mode can even be played cooperatively online or locally with split-screen through all fourteen multiplayer maps at your disposal.Although the campaign doesn't support co-op play, the now-famous zombie mode certainly does. Even though fighting off the walking dead can be fun alone, it's even better with up to four players and is as frantic as ever. There is even a random zombie surprise that appears after the credits roll once you finish the campaign. Call of Duty: Black Ops is certainly not without its faults. The game has some decent looking graphics but is hindered by poorly rendered two-dimensional textures. This becomes even more apparent when you play the game in stereoscopic 3D, which is fully supported if your TV is also capable of this functionality. The 3D aspect obviously grants a better depth of field, but feels more like an attached gimmick than anything else. Fast camera movements become easily blurred, and the overall presentation gets a huge downgrade when it's turned on.But aside from those minute missteps, Treyarch did an amazing of proving they can innovate within this franchise, and not be held back by their publisher's ongoing dispute. Their new vision for the Call of Duty series is definitely a bold step, but it's a step in the right direction. This game is jam-packed with content that is very well worth the price tag they're selling it for. The campaign is roughly a 7-8 hour ride, and a great one at that, and the multiplayer has a shelf life that will likely outlast the console it's played on.In all honesty, the multiplayer component is so well thought-out that it could have been released as a stand-alone experience. The new upgrade system, the statistic tracking, and the vast amount of customization is enough to keep players engrossed for hours; and that's not even part of the gameplay. The real fun is getting to play with all the new kill streak rewards. They range anywhere from the incredibly entertaining RC-XD remote car bomb to a pack of gruesome attack dogs, and all are as satisfying as ever. It'd be hard to argue that Black Ops is anything less than phenomenal. The campaign is thrilling from beginning to end, the competitive multiplayer is as addictive as ever, and there are plenty of zombies to be slaughtered for all the co-op junkies out there.			"

												With all my respect to COD games that were released before COD 4 and that have made the COD franchise that far, this is one of the most PC friendly (besides COD 4) and the best Call of Duty for PC (played all COD`s from COD 4 except WAW on PC), Dedicated Servers for best multiplayer experience, balanced weapons every weapon has different recoil type, variety of maps from big (Jungle) to small (Nuketown), mostly mature community (not like MW3 or MW2), unique singleplayer with an interesting excited story played in cold war, authentic soundtrack  that is much different from average military fps games, Zombies is also fun to play from time to time. The bad things, slightly framerate drops in multiplayer (dont worry, doesnt happen too much) but if its happen sometimes you want to kill someone at the same time its annoying. Chopper Gunner Killstreak in multiplayer is so overpowered and its worst thing that can happen to you, even with M.O.A.B i can deal with it in MW3 but not with CG in BO1. What i also dont like is, the massive action in singleplayer, they could have been lowered the action so you will not be bombarded with weapon noizes all the time and massive explosions also. Sure its cool and something that belongs to COD games but sometimes its too much.If the games age (2010) doesnt matter, buy this COD if you are planning to buy your first COD on PC.			"

However, i've been playing zombies all day for the past 5 days because this game brings back so many memories and good times. I really recommend buying this game especially if you usually play zombies on a console. (P.S. I decided to stop being a ps3 gamer and become a PC gamer recently, so you can kind of take my word for it when I say that zombies is much more fun on a PC)			"

""MY NAME IS VIKTOR REZNOV""It's been 6 years since I played Black Ops for this first and my last time. During those years I've played all of the Call of Duty games repeatedly over and over again. I don't have exact count, but I can assume each game 4-5 times except Black Ops 1. Why? As far as I can remember, I just didn't want this game to be like others. So for 4 years I didn't play it because I didn't want to, but I can remember that last 2 years I didn't play it because I couldn't. However thank to those 6 years of Black Ops absence in my gaming life, I have recieved even better gaming experience these days than back in 2011 and one of the best gaming experiences during last years. This is how Call of Duty is supposed to look like, and this is how FPS game is supposed to look like. Storytelling is whole new level for entire Call of Duty universe and you cannot deny that. I love the way how even 2 seconds flashback in like 3rd mission gets explained in the end just by one sentence, without even showing that certain flashback to remind you.You can argue that story is not really that deep. Yes, I know that surely there are way way way more deeper stories than this one, but for mainstream game, for AAA game and for Call of Duty, this one is really deeper than usual. I am talking a lot about it but why not. For me it's more important than gameplay and whole interaction with the world.I also do know that this review is not objective at all, because my rating will be really high, and also every gamer have something that he loves in particular. Either it is era, persons, countries and of course events. And maybe that is why I admire Black Ops 1 - it has all what I love in particular. Also I do like that usual and standard feature called ""Mission Select"". I just love it when it is in game. It helps you with achievements, to get them faster, and also you can reply some significant missions without having to play it all over again. I also like the way they put music during the missions. Yeah, I'm talking about Creedence Clearwater Revival.Locations you'll visit are very-well picked. From wet jungles of Laos and 'Nam to cold Ural Mountains to hot cosmodrome in Baikonur. Notable real characters for me: Fidel Castro & JFK. Notable missions: EVERY. The variations of missions and nature of what you'll do is just absolutely awesome. I love every single objective you have to do and I love every single step you have to do. People complain about price point, but let me tell you this - cry about every other COD game that goes after BO1.That's it.  I know that my reviews for AAA games are usually not great at all and I do struggle with them, but that's the way it is and I'll try to improve it as much as I can.Things I won't comment either because I don't want to or I'll in future: Graphics, Downloadable Content, Zombies, Multiplayer.Bonus Point: Alex MasonRating: 10/10 "

Kicking a couple of barrels stops the spawns. The game doesn't tell you to kick the barrels.Later on, there are civilians. If you shoot one you lose.

												Now this game is a great game, even if it is old and because it has multiple modes I will make different sections for each one.Singleplayer:The Story in this game was very unique and catching. I enjoyed it alot more than any other story of any other Call of Duty. The Controls where easy and the voice acting was great! The only annoying thing was that the default fov is 65. But if you look around on the internet you will find a guide that helps you changing it into 90. The Most annoying thing by far was that for some reason it didn't read my save file proper and after restarting the game I had to restart also the story. But after all the problems have been fixed I could enjoy the singleplayer like no other. It was worth going through that as I really felt some of the characters growing to my heart!Zombiemode:The Zombiemode in this game is alot different from the second, it is harder and also in my opinion alot scarier than Number 2. If you happen to play on your own you can have 90 fov but as soon as you play online and/or with your friends it will stay on 65 fov. Which I find personally annoying. But it is still a good game mode to play in singleplayer mode. It is alot of fun.Multiplayer:Unlike other Call of Dutys this game has an actual Serverbrowser where you can search for a server of any kind to join. Most of them do not have any admins anymore but it is still alot of fun to play on them. In the Multiplayer mode you can change and keep your FOV from 65 up to 90. All in all this game is amazing, the graphics are still good looking and I had no problems running it on the highest setting. Although there is one thing I would like to mention. If you are german you will get the cut version because of Nazis and the Hackenkreuz. I do not know how much they cut out but I am pretty sure it must have been quiet a bit. I recommend you getting this game uncut from a key website. You will have the same fun as anybody else for a cheaper price!Which is one of my last points. This game has a great singleplayer, story and zombie mode. But for the fact on how old this game is and that hardly anybody still plays the multiplayer (compared to more newer cods anyways) I recommend to get this game on sale.			"

												I jumped back in and have been having a blast. I really forgot how much fun Black Ops Multiplayer was; It's not as balanced or unique as 3arc's CoD5 World at War (the best in the series with co-op Singleplayer up to 4 players; co-op Zombie mode and 64 player Multiplayer over many game-modes with larger maps that included Tanks which had been balanced perfectly to work in the CoD MP style).While black ops does not have any of these things; it does what was asked by Greed-A-Vision-Blizztard and near perfects the formula that is ""Call of Duty"". The ""Infinity Ward"" titles (if we can honestly saw Infinity Ward they barely do anything - Raven Software completed both MW3 and Ghosts' MP and majority of SP / ""Arcade"" modes)I dig it; I've been having fun. Here's a video of one of my first games back...

												I vividly remember the hype over Call of Duty: Black Ops. Black Ops was going to be the next best thing. It was going to be great, and fix all the problems in the previous Call of Duty games. I wasn’t a COD player at that time, and had a bit of a more balanced view of the release. I knew that Black Ops wasn’t going to be the impeccable masterpiece the COD community was hyping it to be. I believed that, like the games that had come before it, Black Ops was going to have its own fair share of problems too.I vividly remember the community backlash when the game came out and players finally realized this. Most of the prominent members of the COD community grumblingly played Black Ops because it was the popular thing to do--until they eventually abandoned it and looked back to previous games, waiting anxiously for Modern Warfare 3 to come a savior. The golden age of Call of Duty seemed to be over. Fortunately (or unfortunately to some) this is not where the story ends; for me, it was the beginning.I started to play Black Ops in its prime, a few months after it came out. It was my first real Call of Duty game (my only previous experience with the series was Call of Duty 2) and I was excited to play the game most people were playing. I discovered that the communities’ extreme reaction to Black Ops was a bit uncalled for.I originally braced myself for a pretty awful single player experience, but was pleasantly surprised at the story, plot, and characters. The single player is nothing revolutionary, but the characters are memorable (especially Woods) and the plot was compelling enough to make me sincerely want to see how it ended. I also found the missions, specifically the Vietnam missions, quite fun. Vorkuta is also highly memorable. In short, is a single player experience I could definitely see myself playing yet again.Co-op is almost equally as fun. Taking out endless waves of the zombified Nazis and other undead, aided by Perk-a-Colas, random mystery box guns, and Pack-a-Punched power weapons is a blast every time. Play with a group of dedicated friends, and let the good times swarm! I don’t like all the maps, but if you have people willing to play with you, then the expansion packs could be worth your money; with that many maps to choose from, I believe it would be difficult not to find at least one map that you all will enjoy playing together. Just a personal thought of mine though-- I wish that there were some kind of progress system in zombies--not just a ""lets see how many waves we can get through in one game"" approach. The amount of points earned in each match could be used as experience points to level up--more like the multiplayer experience. Just an idea, but this could have created a deeper gameplay experience. Of course, any Call of Duty player knows that the multiplayer is what makes or breaks an installment, no matter how good or bad the single player and/or co-op experiences are. For everything that Black Ops multiplayer does well, there are an equal number of points that flag for improvement. I think my favorite parts of the multiplayer are the emblems/playercards. Players have the ability to craft almost anything they want as a symbol for their playercard, and creative/ artistic players have the shapes to create some beautiful pieces of artwork! The contract system is a fun way to gamble for extra CODpoints to spend on your custom classes. They are completely optional, and you can choose ones that conform to your personal skill level, but the greatest rewards come with the highest challenge. Daring players may also gamble with their hard-earned CODpoints in wager matches, but hardly anyone plays these modes anymore. CODpoints are new to the franchise, and I found it nice to spend cash-like money on equipment that I wanted. While weapons still unlock at certain levels, perks, grenades, and other equipment are all yours to buy as soon as custom classes are unlocked at level 4. I find all of the weapons unique, easily recognizable, and fun to experiment with--almost characters in their own right. I don’t like to use all of them, and players could definitely debate whether some of them are balanced. Certain weapons seem to be the go-to choices, but I don’t personally don’t feel any of them are “over-powered”. All of them have their own checks and balances: The M60 can tear through players, but is quite inaccurate; the Skorpion is devastating at point blank range but damage falloff is incredibly sharp; and the Commando is the king of assualt rifles, but doesn't unlock until level 44. The list can go on, but I believe with all these safety measures put in place, every player should be able to find at least one weapon he can enjoy using.The maps are one of the biggest areas that need improvement. While I actually enjoy them all, Treyarch could do well to experiment with a different color pallet. When white, green, and brown are all the maps come in (the exception being Nuketown), these colors get old very quickly. The expansion pack maps are much more aesthetically exciting, but don’t expect to find too many servers that have them in the map rotation. If you really want to play them, gather some friends and start a custom game.A few other more minor things could use some tweaking. Hit markers were terrible when the game first came out, but have since been patched to the point where there are few issues with them, although I believe hitboxes tend to trail a tad too far behind the player. There are a couple of things that were never patched, however. Napalm strikes often have an invisible fire effect. Depending on the terrain over which the strike was laid down, there may be patches of earth left physically untouched by the fire, but players will still be killed if they run over these areas. Napalm and mortar strikes also have the bad habit of killing players in sturdy buildings when the strikes are directed on the roofs. I also wish that players weren’t allowed to make an “invisible” class. I don’t usually complain about weapons or equipment in this game (except Second Chance, which I hate with a passion) because I believe they all have the right to be used since the developers put them in the game, but it seems far too unbalanced to be allowed to run Ghost (Pro), Ninja (Pro), and a suppressor on both primary and secondary weapons. I do have to admit, though, I have only encountered a handful of players who use this setup.Overall, I find Black Ops a unique, but lukewarm experience. The weapons are striking and lively; the maps are not as exciting, but fun to play nonetheless. Contracts and CODpoints are interesting additions to the series, although some killstreaks can be frustrating to deal with. And both player emblems and custom classes can be beautiful or ugly, depending on the taste of the creator. All of the things done right mix with almost an equal blend of mistakes, creating an experience that is neither great nor bad. Ultimately though, I believe that COD players who approach Black Ops with an open mind, as the new branch of Call of Duty as it is, will find a lot of fun here. New players to the COD series may also enjoy Black Ops, although they should be prepared for a steep learning curve--this is still Call of Duty, and the gameplay is as fast and furious as it is deadly. Was Black Ops the next great thing to happen to Call of Duty? That would depend largely upon who you ask, but my answer is no. Does it deserve to go down in history as the game that ended COD’s golden age? Again, my answer is no. It may not continue the legacy of the games before it, but Black Ops is not an ending; rather it is the beginning of a new age of Call of Duty. And in my eyes, from what I have seen through my time with Black Ops, that age is looking surprisingly bright.			"

												Call of duty black ghost 4 is the sequel to everybody's favour shooter, Transporter 3. With new next-gen graphics all from 2007, a deep and compelling story from the greatest man on earth, Uwe boll and the same content you've been wanting since last yearWhen you first start the game, you'll be in the menu, but when you click ""new game"" you're thrown straight into the actions. Right away the opening cutscene will amaze you with life-like visuals and sounds that make you feel like you're right there in the room. After you've skipped through that crap, you finally get to shoot stuff and save the world. At this point I closed the game and uninstalled because violence offends me.For $90 you can't deny that this is a bargain and you should buy at least 3 copies for yourself and others. A masterful movie with great actors, superb sound, explosions and russians, I give this banana 10/10. Would bang.Best. Review. Ever. You just won my heart today sir!			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops’ campaign mode has a genuinely interesting, psychological thriller style narrative and fun gameplay set pieces. I ended up finishing the campaign on ‘Veteran’ difficulty which changed my whole perspective of the game.It’s now my opinion that ‘Veteran’ difficulty is the best way to experience this campaign. It fits perfectly with the dark and gritty tone of the game’s design. Which caused me to become much more immersed in the action. The music is really cool too which also helped to pull me into the world.The ‘Zombie’ mode is, of course, also great here and most of these maps have become classics. I didn’t play too much of the Multiplayer but the maps look great. I’m always amazed with the high quality visuals and attention to detail in Call of Duty Multiplayer maps.This is an innovative and amazingly dark game which is loaded with replay value. The Call of Duty series has become completely mainstream now and receives a lot of criticism from gamers for being generic.  Black Ops is just as interesting and immersive as any other great game. It’s a total classic and I highly recommend that you go back and play through the campaign on ‘Veteran’ difficulty.			"

In addition to being some of the best in the series (Blackbird, B-52, Huey, dogs), killstreaks are just flat out better than scorestreaks. Yes I understand scorestreaks reward objective based gameplay, but this is CoD, not Battlefield or Team Fortress.-NUKETOWN (better than 2025 but WAY better than Nuk3town/2065, that♥♥♥♥♥♥is a nightmare to look at).-Gold camo that actually looks like ♥♥♥♥ing gold unlike pretty much every other game to exist with nasty flat metallic yellow that looks half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and covers the entire gun (CoD 4 is a notable exception).Cons:-Price. $40 for a 6 year old game?

												Campaign/Zombies ReviewQuite simply, this game has one of the best campaign plots I've ever seen. The 1960's, CIA Black Ops in Russia and the Vietnam War, conspiracies, and a diabolical political plot to topple nations... all taken seriously in a totally immersive and epic experience. The gameplay is varied, indoors and outdoors, from lush tropical jungles to intelligence headquarters buildings, in a number of different historical conflicts. No spoilers, but the whole story is about finding a hidden, classified truth that is as mindblowing as the warheads that threaten to destroy the world. This dynamic and interesting campaign is unmatched, certainly throughout the Call of Duty series, as well as all the games I've played. It may not be the newest game, but the plot is worth it, I guarantee.Although the plot and story elements alone are enough to warrant a purchase, it is as fun of an ADS FPS as I've ever played, with decent graphics, punchy weapons, and great levels. I've played through the entire game on Veteran Difficulty, the most challenging difficulty, and had an absolute blast. There's not an overwhelming amount of collectables, and they remain found after multiple playthroughs.The Zombies mode in this game is also great, probably better than Black Ops 2. It's not overly complicated like its sequel, and is just solid and hardy. I'm terrible at Zombies and still loved it. In one level you actually get to play as John F. Kennedy fighting zombies in the US Pentagon. Awesome? Awesome.One of my favorites! This isn't a review for the multiplayer, but it is also spectacular and they come together when you get black ops.

												It is really different than other Call of duty games. And i like it. It feel playing different game. Also zombie mode, Ardace mode new for call of duty players. Black Ops game giving more single play hours to buyers. If you can find good deal, try it but with Activision, only you can dream about %75 off =)			"

												Please lower the price of your DLC according with the price of the retail game. I only wanted Moon, but to do the easter egg on that, I have to buy two of your other DLCs. And I don't want to pay the price I paid for the full retail game for 2 zombie maps.Game is fun but I'm kinda tired of Activision being awful with their prices.Sorry this wasn't a full, in-depth review, I really don't think you guys need one for this.

												Important note: Steam shows that i played it ony 11 houts, but it's only Singleplayer. Currently i have 24 hours on Multiplayer, and it'll be more than 50 soon, i believe. (I needed a break lol, i have migraine)TL;DR -BUY IT, but not from Steam. You can get this game around 4 Euros from 3rd party sellers. If you're not from Germany, you can find it as ""Uncut Edition"". Steam price is totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It's a 6 years old game and Activision should stop raising this game's price because the third game has released. Yes, i see what you did there, Activision, you doubled the price last year. <end of TL;DR>I started playing CoD with CoD 2. That was a masterpiece, and if we' think about WW2 games, it still is. And then i played MW series. They were epic, too. But none of them was like BO. Black Ops was the Cod that i'm looking for. Second mp Cod i played was BO2 and it was ""meh"" for me. you know, if i want to play sci-fi shooter, i'd go and play Titanfall. (And yes, i did play Titanfall)Black Ops has minimal camper count, because it doesn't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t high-tech overpowered scorestreaks. Yes, some of them are overpowered, but it's playable.Black Ops does not have too much 12 yo kids who wants to ♥♥♥♥ your mom, because it doesnt have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t high-tech overpowered scorestreaks and weapons. Oh, same sentence, is it coincidence? Think not.Besides MW2 (i heard it has lots of cheats & hacks and stuff) this is currently the best Multiplayer Call Of Duty you can play without dying of cancer. Also, Black Ops 1's Scenario is my personal favorite. It's classic Call Of Duty ""interactive movie"" scenario, but it has epic mind♥♥♥♥s and good drama. You'll love it.Worth buying? - I answered that question at TL;DR partStill alive mp? - April 30th, 2016, yes, very active servers.Cheat? - Like in every mp game, but it's avoidable.Singleplayer? -MasterpieceMultiplayer? -♥♥♥♥ing enjoyableDo i need that game to understand BO2? -Not actually, But yes, it'll be better because the reason why second game's scenario is good is first game's scenario.Spoiler: Remember the day you've watched Fight Club. Where was your mind? Definetely.And don't forget those steps, they will lead you out of Vorkuta.1.Secure the keys.2.Ascend from darkness.3.Rain fire.4.Unleash the horde.5.Skewer the winged beast.6.Wield a fist of iron.7.Raise Hell.8.Freedom.

												I enjoy this game. There, I said it! This game is a good Call of Duty game. It is one I always go back to on console and would love to get back into on PC! I bought this and played WAY too much of it back in 2011 and loved every minute of it. Nazi Zombies is great fun, the campaign is suprisingly decent, and the multiplayer is superb compared to some other entries into this franchise. I have pumped 100+ hours into the multiplayer and 50+ into the single player on PC. It is NOT worth the price tag but I would grab this game on a sale if you want a solid multiplayer shooter experience!			"

												**Multiplayer online only, haven't played online zombies, only with friends.** Man I missed this game back when it came out on Xbox 360. The community is actually quite active still, and I have yet to see any hackers. Servers are VAC-secured and strictly watched for unsportsman-like conduct. People are very polite, contrary to popular belief. The gameplay style is COMPLETELY different from other shooters like CS:GO, so don't compare them, or else you're just looking like a fool. Word of advice for new players- type ""!rules"" when you get into a game, or else you could get insta-kicked for using a weapon not allowed or something like that, there's even servers where you're not allowed to move unless you're crouching. I've also heard about people getting VAC bans for using external chat services, so heads up on that.			"

Sounds, voices.all tip top.Production values are clearly highMissions are quite varied, you will drive vehicles, helicopters, boats, motorcycles, use stationary guns, explosives and more.For an FPS game, I actually cared about SP & characters and story which is great accomplishmentOverall: This is a solid addition to the Call of Duty franchise.Treyarch hasn't done anything bad at all.With a better plot and better graphics, Black Ops is better than Modern Warfare 2Treyarch has fantastic ideas, but unfortunately, could not apply the maximum into the game.

ForewordThe first Black Ops in the game series, it is not much different from the rest of the previous games before it. Only the settings and story is different.StoryThe story takes place in the 1960's, playing as Alex Mason, an american operative who is interrogated by unknown captors.They question his previous missions, which take place in various countries. The story heavily focuses on the Cold War Era, and there are several famous people during the Cold War who appear in this game, such as Kennedy and Castro.You can expect all kinds of classic CoD cliché's from previous games in this one, aswell as a twist.Gameplay & GraphicsThe gameplay is very, very much the same as previous Call of Duty titles. Despite this, the multiplayer feels different from previous and newer CoD MP games. It feels more ""grittier"" with turning, shooting and especially reloading. Not even Black ops 2 MP has this. Overall the animations feel more focused when firing and reloading.The MP of this game is no different from previous games, there are tons of different game modes, a fair amount of maps, lots of weapons and the usual killstreaks. Being a first (This was in 2010 again), you can customize your characters with face paints, and there are quite alot to unlock.Unlike previous MP's, you get ""CoD"" points each match that you can use to unlock everything with. The game also includes a Zombies mode, having up to 4 co-op players team up against waves upon waves of zombies. The aiming in this feels abit stiff, and sometimes when firing at a zombies head despite aiming perfectly well, the shots may miss.The settings and story in zombies mode is of a supernatural theme, with anything from zombies, ghosts and hounds from hell.The graphics, for a 2010 game, are very good. Back then, it was of course something really well made, graphics wise.Though if you are looking for something amazing for todays standards, you are going to be abit dissapointed.Would I recommend it? If so, why?Yes, I would, but only for the hardcore CoD fans. The MP side is great and what most buyers back in 2010 went for. Today, 2015, I'd say you have to see the story and zombies mode as a bonus when buying the game. The MP side of the game is still very active and has players on servers 24/7, even late night. There are also alot of achievements, both story mode and in zombies. MP there are only 3 achievements.This game is not worth its price tag of 39,99 though. It is 5 years old, and strangely the devs haven't lowered the price. Get it on a sale instead, but even then, you're lucky if you get it for 10.Praise & CriticismI really enjoyed the twist in the story mode.I was impressed by the menu, having not seen this style in any other game.I was not impressed by the DLC map packs, and it is very known these days that not many play the map packs anymore, leaving you with a waste of money, so keep this in mind.You can't review the DLC Map packs individually like other games have on steam. While there are some reviews on them, they are few, and simple, and no doubt done by the devs/friends of the devs, raising the question as to why the reviewing has been disabled for these map packs.Since I can't review the dlc by itself, it'll go hereFIRST CONTACT MAP DLC REVIEWThis review was written months before the main game one, and is mean't as a negative reviewTL:DR: DONT BUY THIS DLC, ITS OVER 4 YEARS OLD AND CANT BE PLAYED ANYMORE DUE TO LIMITED PLAYERBASE.Negative rating explained.One of the steep priced DLC's I've ever bought and regretted. It's surprising how this has so many positive reviews, but they are all funnily enough extremely short. No doubt some fanboys or devs decided to boost this dlc's rep by making such a short review.This dlc comes at full price, 13,99 euro, way to much for something that's over 4 years old by now from this review. A typical marketing strategy from the devs and their publisher, simply leave the price tag at full since launch, with very few sales.This dlc has 5 different maps, nothing more, nothing less. No bonus weapons and such.4 multiplayer maps and 1 zombie mode map.Now I bought this dlc simply for MP maps, not the zombie one, but I saw that as an extra bonus.Today I defently regret this, and this is no way worth its full price. It's a downright scam if you press to buy it for 13,99 euro, there is alot of other stuff you can spend your money on.So why the negative review? Because, all CoD games have this dlc problem pattern. When a new CoD game comes out, the playerbase moves on to the next new thing and abandons (75% of the players atleast) the previous game/s. This leaves a very little, staggering playerbase left, and thus the amount of players who own the dlcs can't find any new games to play these dlc maps. This is why there should never have been dlc map packs in the first place. I admit I fell for the trap. Not once or twice, but thrice, having bought a beautifull map pack in MW3 and BO2. Don't take me wrong, these maps are fun to play on, and are stunningly beautiful. The issue here is not being able to play the dlc anymore. You have to either find friends to start a game and play with, or simply try and hit daytime in hope there just might be a server or two. The chances are extremely low.The Maps.The Maps are detailed, entertaining to play on.Berlin WallA map based on the Berlin Wall, fighting in the snow covered streets of the german capital, the map features a ""restricted zone"" in the middle among the walls. Running through it will cause automated turrets in towers to kill you. Two parts of the walls have been blown apart and players are able to run between safely from the towers.DiscoveryA map set in the Antartica, an abandoned german base with thin cliff bridges that can be shot or exploded to cause humiliating deaths to players. Perfect for any snow/ice lovers, contains the Southern Lights.KowloonA map set in Hong Kong on building rooftops (You better believe it). Players clash with eachother throughout these large buildings filled with the classic stuff that every major, packed city has (signs, chimneys, antenna's etc). Surprisingly, the buildings still stand after the matches end and a good amount of airstrikes have been used. A good old CoD logic.StadiumA map set at a  hockey stadium in New York, the fights focuses around the outside of the stadium aswell as inside where the ticket booths are. You can't enter into the hockey arena. The map lives up to its name though, the feeling of being at a stadium is well received in this map. Has a large 'Earth' statue fountain in the middle of it.AscensionThe only zombie map in this pack, Ascension takes place in an abandoned Soviet Cosmodome. Instead of Hellhounds, zombified monkeys appear instead, straight from space! The WWII characters make their apperance in this map from the World at War Zombie cast.The maps are great, but for the price, it's simply too steep, counting the age of this dlc aswell. Not only that, but the chances of playing the 4 MP maps with other random players are slim.			"

												Black Ops is proof that CoD can be a fun series... When it's handled by Treyarch. Overall an improvement over Modern Warfare 2, while also serving as well written and well performed sequel to World at War. The combat is smoother, it (the game) looks slicker and is more colorful, and the singleplayer is probably the tightest in the franchise up to this point. The multiplayer also remains a highlight, being a huge improvement over the previous titles, and I'd argue better than any of the later titles. It's the single-most solid CoD entry, apart from the original and Modern Warfare. The few cons, though, primarily rest in the multiplayer. Although it may be the best laid out version of the famous game mode, there are some balancing issues in terms of some weapons; namely the FAMAS. Now, for the most part, if a weapon is over-powered, then use it. The issue with it is the whole leveling up system, which means that newer players either rely on luck, the also powerful MP5K, or try to find maps where there aren't too many FAMAS players. In addition, the CoD Points system is a great idea, but could have been better implemented. For example, what's the point of obtaining points when all of the weapons are still locked by level requirements? You might earn a  lot of CoD Points, but they're useless if you want a weapon you need several more levels to unlock with. EIther leveleing should open up more than one thing to buy, thus giving you more options to spend your money on at a time in the early and later games (Note that mid game more things do become unlocked at a stime, but this usually centers around different logo layers or reticules, all of which are cosmetic features). Note that when you do buy a weapon, you have all of the attachements unlocked. You just need to spend CoD Points on them. That makes sense, but why only the attachments? This mode could have worked better, but still does some things right. Overall, the redundancy of parts of the point system can still be overlooked. Ultimately, we're still looking at one of CoD's more solid modern gen entries, and I'd suggest picking it up. Good servers can be difficult to find (There's a ton of so-called ""Tactical Crouch Servers,"" and other servers ban game elements outright), but with or without, the singleplayer and the Co-Op Zombies mode are also very fun to play. (NOTES: Aside from the PC, I've also played this game far more extensively on the PS3 and Nintendo Wii, totalling more than a hundred or more hours)			"

												First of all, i would like to say that this review is pretty much entirely for historical purposes, since the multiplayer is dead.Black Ops 1 is a fairly good game. It pretty much kept the same formula as the one in MW2, but fixed all the major complaints.Balance fixesLike, noob tubes (grenade launchers), which could deal a max of 155 damage. They were extremely overpowered even back in COD4 and there were even perks that would increase the damage to explosives by 25%. In MW2 in fact, it was increased to 40%.What made that matter worse in MW2, is that you could replenish your ammo for those launchers, with Scavenger and One Man's Army. Well, the good news is that Scavenger doesn't replenish explosives anymore, and One Man's Army was removed. The explosives damage increase perk was removed as well. The damage was still the same - 155 (stayed like that since COD4), but they also returned a perk that should decrease the incoming explosive damage by 35% (actually it's 10% increase compared to COD4/COD5).Another big problem of MW2 was the perk commando, which would increase the knife range from 128 to 176. That perk was removed as well.Another issue was the nuke - 25 kill killsteak that would end the game. The problem with that is that kills with your killstreaks would count too. You could go 7-11-25 for your build, and easily reach a nuke. In BO1, not only they removed the nuke, but they also made a rule - you can only increase your killstreak by killing with your gun. That solved the problem of snowballing.That said, both knife and grenade launchers are very powerful in this game. In later games like BO2 - knife would be a 2 hit kill, and in MW3 - noob tube damage would be reduced to 110, while in BO2 to 130. In BO3 grenade launchers are completely removed.Comparison to other CODsOther than that, it is pretty much identical to MW2. The weapons are different, the maps are different, but other wise, all the mechanics of the game are more of the same.There are of course a few new things here and there. For example, they implemented a different leveling system. Before, you level up, you get your gear. In Black Ops 1, you get money for leveling up, which you can spend on weapons, attachments, perks, killstreaks and so on. There are a few level restriction for some gear, but the main point is that you can pretty much get the gear you like from the get go. They also added wager matches. You wage your money over there and you will play one of the 4 modes featured - gun game, stick and stones, sharpshooter and one in the chamber.All of them are very fun modes. There are altogether 6 players, but only the top 3 will get any rewards. The game kind of forces you to play those modes if you want to unlock everything.Another new thing was the theater mode - ability to rewatch and record your previous matches. It made its debut in BO1, and that feature continued appearing in all Black Ops games.Finally, unlike other CODs, all Black Ops games feature bot matches, so i guess you can still give it a go if you are interested in that sort of play.PC PortThe port for pc wasn't all that good when it was released. In fact, it's because of that BO1 had a pretty short lifespan on PC compared to other CODs.There were netcode and performance issues, and it took like a year till all of those were fixed.The game features dedicated servers, but no custom ones are allowed. They are rent-able, but only allow 12-18 players. I actually don't mind that. I really hate 64 player COD4/COD5 lobbies - they were completely unbalanced. Sometimes, giving too much power to the gamers is bad.Campaign and ZombiesAs for the campaign, it's your typical linear shooter. I wouldn't really blame them for it, since that's the way COD has been since the very first game.The game is set in the Cold War era, and even features a cameo from World at War. Basically, they just took a lot of Cold War events and just put their characters in there. The story got a lot of praise as well, and truly, you got to give them credit for that.As for zombies, there are 2 maps - Five and Kino Der Toten. 4 more come as DLC. The mode practically didn't change since World at War. It's basically a wave based survival game. Tons of fun and you can still play it since it doesn't really on online play that much - just find 3 friends and you are on.ConclusionOverall, it's a pretty good game. More of the same, but unlike the CODs to come, this one actually had balanced spawns. Personally, i think this was the time when COD started going downhill.It had a rocky start when it was released on pc, and it never really recovered, Also, just like all CODs, the numbers really start to perish when the new one comes out, so i can only recommend it to you for its zombies. Single player is okey, but not enough to sell you the game. You might want to buy the DLC zombie map packs though.			"

												This is without a doubt my favorite first person shooter ever made. But why?Campaign - Takes you through a fun adventure during the Cold War. Fun gameplay (Kowloon potentially the best CoD mission ever), great characters (Jason Hudson as portrayed by Ed Harris) and interesting story with a nice twist. Zombies - This is just a simply incredible gamemode. It has such an addicting factor to get to a higher round, but is also plagued with secrets and a lot to do within each map keeping it mostly fresh and it goes on and on. The Rezurrection also brought the old World at War maps back, which includes my personal favorite map, Der Riese. This rendition of Zombies was also improved from its predecessor, World at War. Although you cannot create your own maps this time, sadly, it provides for an excellent experience. All maps are good and worth playing and it introduces more legendary maps like Ascension and Moon to add to the collection. Multiplayer - The great thing about this is that its skill based, and encapsulates all methods of playstyle. Maps are a variety of sizes, and each map is its own unique adventure and a change of pace from the last. As much as I'm not a big fan of smaller maps that much, this game has 2-3 which make it a nice change of pace. Guns are balanced, and all do relativley the same thing so that you don't lose a fight simply because of circumstance. Recoil is in the guns, and many battles take place at medium - long range so you need to be good with the gun to get a kill. It moves at just the right speed; you can be in a fight mostly whenever you want but can also pursure flanking and you won't be in a clusterf**k all the time. WMD is also probably the best multiplayer map ever; representative of all playstyles, isn't too small and isn't too big. It also has CoD Points, the best the series has done yet from an unlocking perspective. It's the slow of the fast paced gameplay, exactly what I like. This game is just excellent. DLC's are just as great with maps such as Zoo, Hotel, Discovery and Hazard (remake of Cliffside from World at War). Bonus: An entire twin stick shooter game is within this game, known as Dead Ops Arcade. This is an absurd amount of fun, and really adds on to the package of this game. Also included is the text based game Zork, which can provide a great past time. In addition, the hidden intel and computer that lets you logon to characters profiles provides for great backstory and nice information for what happend before, during and after and insight into each character.This is just the best FPS ever. Get it.			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops emerges across all the doubts surrounding the Activision/Infinity Ward company that took place back in March 2010, in which many speculated about an inevitable fall from grace for the Call of Duty franchise. Beside that the hard work behind the doors at Treyarch proved that they could bring the franchise to bigger and better heights, although the risk of stepping away from the path, particularly in terms of storytelling, the story still has plenty of the blockbuster elements that the franchise is known for, and manages a much more intelligent light since it's not just the typical action for action's sake type of game. Call of Duty: Black Ops is a first-person shooter with stealth and tactical play aspect that puts players in the role of a shadow soldier, Alex Mason, fighting in a variety of historically representative fictional Black Ops missions of the Cold War era. The story has a well-written narrative and the main character has more vocal presence than any previous Call of Duty. It's also clear a good balance between set piece moments as well, the bigger cinematic approach and the addition of a few cutscenes, rather than having dialogue throughout loading screens manage to improve the gaming experience, beside that the graphics are pretty decent.The campaign mode is roughly a 7-8 hours thrill, and although the campaign doesn't support co-op play, there is the zombie mode which does, even though fighting off the walking dead can be fun alone, it's way better with up to four players.Apart from the singleplayer, the multiplayer component had its fair share of alterations. The most evident is the new currency upgrade system, this new method allows players to earn ""COD"" points in addition to experience points during matches, which gives players a level field by having all perks and attachments available for purchase at the start. Also, once you've unlocked the appropriate categories through ranking up, you can acquire any kill streak reward you wish or invest in an insane amount of customization options.There is also a new Combat Training simulator, allowing practice in Free-For-All or Team Deathmatch modes against AI opponents. If that wasn't enough, Treyarch even included an in-depth Combat Record to give a detailed look at how your multiplayer stats break down. It includes everything from kill/death ratio graphs, individual weapon stats, to heat maps that show the main spots of activity.Overall, the campaign is thrilling from beginning to end, the competitive multiplayer is as addictive as ever, and there are plenty of zombies to be slaughtered for all the co-op players. 75/100	 "

												Black Ops is easily one of the best games in the series and is infinitely better than all the futuristic, boost jumping and wall running crap than exists in Call of Duty these days.A great story, an awesome campaign that's full of action and explosions and Zombies will always be one of the best game modes I ever play.If you want to remember what a good Call of Duty game was like then grab Black Ops or any of the older ones when they're on sale. The new ones are nothing more than overpriced, crappy DLC.			"

I still play it and hate it at the same time.The only thing I really can't believe it's still 39.99, I got this for $20 on a sale.

												This is by far, the best Black Ops IMHO. I originally played this on the PS3 and made a lot of cool friends that I stayed friends with for many years, until I moved on to PC. Anyway, I loved it so much I got it again and all the DLC on Steam so I can play it at 1080p at true 60fps with no frame drops like there was on the PS3 when you took out at mob of zombies with the Thunder Gun or during an Insta-kill at any round.The great thing about this map is the re-playability. I like seeing players in the lobby when I want to play. I wish people would get the DLC because all the DLC is great and so much fun. Ascension is where PhD Flopper was first introduced...that has to be the easiest map of all the DLC. Call of the Dead was my absolute favorite. It too has PhD Flopper but it was the first map to have a lingering Boss...Georgy Romero. I met a lot of cool friends with that map as well. I think that map is what got me hooked on Zombies and when I became better at them.A tough map but still a lot of fun was Shagri-La. I still remember waiting until the very stroke of midnight in the US to download the DLC to my PS3. Those were the days. I know this review is coming in late...almost a decade after its release but like all things in expectation, it was like Christmas in November back then. By the way, before playing Shangri-La, I suggest playing Five a lot if you feel Shangri-La is hard or if you keep dying a lot. In fact, before the map came out, we found out months ahead that there would be tight pathways, so we practived with Five for a few months before the release...we were randked in the top 1/10 of 1% in the world for the first week it was out. I still have a screenshot of that somewhere from a Happauge PVR. Yep...ancient technology.I don't want to do through the list of the DLC maps but the other maps are great. I highly recommend this game and all the DLC for it. I can see this game being a long-living staple in the FPS Zombie community,			"

												Call of Duty gets a ton of hate for their franchise from more intellectual gamers.It's an undeniable truth - but this game in particular, and the ones before it, are where it was good. If you're basing your opinion off this game just because you played Black Ops II or Ghosts, you're not going to have a fantastic time. I find that the Nazi Zombies gameplay was greatly done. It was not over the top and it used original game elements from World at War, sticking to the original style and going classic, while at the same time adding lots of necessary and new features.The map packs are overpriced in people's opinions. I did not have Black Ops on Steam when it came out - I bought it here a couple months ago so I could enjoy it all over again. If I had to estimate, I'd say I clocked about 3,000 hours on the console version? (Dirty me!) It was fantastic. Owning all of the map packs the day they came out, I was addicted to Zombies. However, I did not enjoy the currency system applied on the multiplayer. Opinions are opinions, it was cool, but grew old quickly trying to farm so much XP.Overall - 8/10The multiplayer flaws are arguable. I cannot ignore them, so I will have to deduct a few points off as multiplayer is a large part of the game. However, Zombies was a very enjoyable and addictive experience that promised a unique experience, especially when you played with friends on a co-op game.			"

												To me Call of Duty: Black ops was the last CoD that was amazing and here is the reason why. The campaign I thought was excellent with likable characters. great storyline, and the era it takes place in. Another reason why this game is amazing is the well known co op game mode as Nazi Zombies. The zombie maps are amazing including the revamped version of the old 4 maps from World at War, the new maps as well is spot on with challenging bosses and many new wonder weapons. As for the multiplayer as well the multiplayer is amazing as you get to customize your character in the game and create fun  classes to use in the game, and the maps are just well done. Although a lot of people are against CoD this game truly shows how fun CoD can be.			"

												Hello, I have played this Game, since it's release and I am still playing it.I don't have that many Call of Duty Games, because they are very much the same, but this Game, is much different.I really like the server Browsing, because it is easy to find an Only Sniping server, or Knifing server.The Ballistic Knifes blew me away. I have played Only Ballistic Knifes for 5 years... (That's a thing)I even own my Own Ballistic Knife server and the Best Ballistic Knife clan as well.That wouldn't have been an option, if I didn't love this game so much.I recommend this Game, because it has many cool features... Server's with Only Sniping and Knifing. So cool! :)It's quite cheap as well, so go a head! The different animations are Amazing and realistic. Definitely could have been done better, but considdering, that this Game is from 2010, is just Mind Blowing! :) Thanks for the Game, many hours of Happiness.			"

Its easy to get into and it just flows, nothing complicated.The multiplayer: Is great too, this is a REAL Cod game, no extra ♥♥♥♥♥♥ functions, just gun to gun fight and no irretating useless perks.

												i preordered this game back in 2010. after that i swore i'd never purchase another game sight unseen and i have kept my word on that. this one is where they really blew it. i feel sorry for anybody who would buy this game in 2014. if you have a choice between this and world at war, choose waw because it was the last good game in the series, the last to offer an actual modding system. they removed that from the game in black ops and never looked back. they claimed from the start that they would provide mod tools but their idea of mod tools this time turned out to be nothing basically, a few tweaks for the multiplayer, no graphics mods, no new maps whatsoever because they wanted to sell their dlc instead of continuing to uphold their good reputation so they flushed mod tools down the toilet with this one game. so if the zombie game is what you're after, this game will give you a total of about ten laggy maps for an extra sixty dollars, four of which came from world at war and they run flawlessly in waw yet lag in black ops the allegedly superior black ops engine, wonder why that is. also in world at war there are hundreds of maps already made for nazi zombies that are entirely free for everyone and the game is actually playable and runs flawlessly. the choice is yours. if you want single player action, this game is also a bad choice because the single player campaign is mostly like watching a movie as i recall. anyway, even with the current sale it's only half what it cost at launch four years ago. so not worth it. sooooooooo not worth it. you'll be sorry if you fall for it...

												In my opinion, CoD Black Ops and WaW would be one of the last few Call of Duty games worth playing and buying.  The campaign in Black Ops is prettty good, my favorite portion of the campaign would be the Vietnam War.  For multiplayer, zombies is what makes it worthwhile to play.9/10 would kill zombies and the NVA again			"

												I use to pour hours into this game back when I was younger and on the PS3.  Multiplayer is a little different on PC given how we find the game lobbies but over all it is still the same old 'Black Ops' that you know and love. The campaign is classic, zombies are mint as usual and multiplayer can be tolerated. It is, without a doubt, my number one 'Call of Duty' game.			"

Great storyline with a few turn of events. Makes you wonder whether you can trust your mind or not when everything seems to be what you see.For the Singleplayer, the new storyline seems catchy and, awesomely, it meets a World at War famous character.No Spoilers, folks!Zombie mode hasn't changed much except for the content but it sure hell it is still damn fun when you are playing with your friends.

												Call of Duty®: Black OpsViktor Reznov's eight steps to escape the prison of Vorkuta:""Every journey begins with a single step. This is Step One!"" -- ReznovStep 1: Secure the Keys - Overpower the guard and get the keys.Step 2: Ascend from Darkness - Use the elevator to get to ground level.Step 3: Rain Fire - Use the slingshot to destroy the three guard towers.Step 4: Unleash the Horde - Use the prison broadcast system to rally the prisoners.Step 5: Skewer the Winged Beast - Take down the helicopter with the KS-23 harpoon.Step 6: Wield the Fist of Iron - Acquire a mini-gun from the vault with the help of Reznov.Step 7: Raise Hell - Storm the prison guards and fight your way down the road.Step 8: Freedom - Use the motorcycles in the garage to escape the prison.Do these steps sound familiar? Yes...it's the same steps used in Call of Duty®: Black Ops II Zombies - OriginsSounds exciting? Well, it might give you enough reason to buy this game (as well as Call of Duty®: Black Ops II). The campaign story line is epic and the plot won’t let you down. The characters are strong, well-crafted and dramatic moments give the story some intrigue and a tone of uncertainty allowing your missions to cover a vast diverseness of gameplay and geographics. Up until now I believe this game's campaign story is one of the best in the series.Call of Duty®: Black Ops offers an online Multiplayer mode where you can earn experience points while leveling up, unlocking custom class slots, weapons, perks, killstreak bonuses, emblems, reticles and more...And for those who want some more bang for buck, Black Ops offers a popular four-player cooperative Zombie mode. You'll fight to stay alive against endless waves of undead lusus naturae. It's a bold and bizarre endeavor, but with characters and personalities to entertain you through some bloodcurdling situations.Nevertheless, the game at its core is terrific and in my opinion Call of Duty®: Black Ops (and its successor) has stood the test of time.

												I play only single player and co op.The game is pretty much dead only servers with Nuketown are left and some S&D.The single player is amaizing as any CoD single player it's like a movie linear with a lot of cut scenes but it's an eye candy.Co op Zombies are epic if you have friends to play with that are good. Otherwise you will get sick from playing te first parts of the maps and then die. There are no public matches on zombies.Co op Multiplayer is only TDM and FFA against bots. It has different leveling than the Multiplayer part of the game. The dificulty of the bots only makes their aim faster and at some point it feels like a normal MW3 game (full of cheaters with aim bot) however if you play with your friends against a horde of bots it is ridiculously fun.I am giving thumbs up because it has dedicated servers! But if I have to rate it I would give it 6/10 because the co op part apart from the zombies is very limited.However this is probably the only actually good Call of duty game.			"

												This is my favorite call of duty of all time, and is probably top 10 for best games I've ever played. This game is still good to THIS day and can still be enjoyable. I've broken my review into each part of the game.CAMPAIGN-This campaign was pretty good, not only from an action/gameplay stand point, but the story in this game is really good and has good twist and keeps you interested. The length is pretty decent and is very enjoyable.Multiplayer-My favorite COD multiplayer out there. Many people worry about hackers, but there aren't many hackers on multiplayer on the PC version surprisenly, you choose servers from a list of servers and it's done pretty well, it stills holds up from 6 years ago.Zombies-The best gamemode ever made in COD, I know hundreds of people who only play this game for the zombies, and it's reasonable, this gamemode is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and is best played with friends, I don't really like this game when playing solo, I don't feel it's as enjoyable.Overall-This game still holds up everything it was when released 6 years ago and is worth the 40$ it cost.

												I am not a fan of the Call of Dutys, but I just can't get enough zombies! Zomebies mode is hella-addictive and the only thing I really look forward towards in the Call of Duty series. If TreyArch released a zombies stand-alone I would buy it without hesitation. If you like the zombies gamemode, this game is for you. The campaign is meh, but nobody really plays the Call of Duty series for those, and the multiplayer is okay as far a Call of Duty goes, but the wager matches are WAY empty.			"

												This is arguably the best call of duty to date. It depends wether or not you are a Treyarch fan or Infinity Ward fan. Most fans of Call Of Duty say Modern Warfare is the best one, but I always was more keen on Treyarchs version of COD. Dont get me wrong, I know that COD MW innovated alot and changed the multiplayer to the better and that their campaign were a thrill. I also know that COD MW also changed the genre, but when it comes to the best of the best I would say that this game is the best... of the best. The campaign is special and unique. I havent seen anyone else do the COD campaign like that. It got me interested from begining to end as it isnt just a war story about a soldier (as most call of duty games) but it also involves conspiracy theories, phsyciatric challenges and monkeys. Okey, the last one is not as important, but I am serious about the other things and really believe that this is the best campaign. Maybe that has to do with the setting. I fell in love with the cold war (not as in I liked the cold war, but more as in I like the story behind it). The only COD game that isnt modern/futuristic or about the second world war. I kinda hope it stays that way, because they did a good job and I dont really think they could make it better. I have heard rumors about Sledgehammer making a game set during the cold war and I hope its false. Would be nice to make a game that is set in the past, but make it about something else. Give us something new (and as most cod players mean with something new, give us more content dont change up the mechanics). To get back on track, the campaign is something that you have to try out for your self. The multiplayer was also pretty great. It stayed fast paced with memorable maps, nice weapon balancing and fun game modes. The perks werent too bad either, although I will admit that ""second chance"" perk was a bad one. Luckily most servers on PC has banned that perk. Killstreaks return and all of them serve a purpose. There is more focus on party modes and that is always fun. I really enjoy what they did with cod points. No, Im not talking about the latest version of cod points where you actually have to spend money on it. Im talking about the in-game currency that you use to unlock camoes, weapons, attatchements and of course face paint. You could play wager matches and gamble your money to maybe win more money. Those matches were intense, but no other COD game has tried to replicate it. It is a Black Ops only experience.While the multiplayer and campaign were exeptional in COD MW, the game still lacked a memorable and fun coop mode. Well, COD BO steps up their game with continuing on COD Zombies. The problem with COD BO2 and COD BO3 is that the maps are made for zombie fans. You might think that im weird for complaining about them making maps for the zombie fans, but what I mean is that the maps in those games were not casual friendly. I enjoyed the maps in those games, even my favourite zombie maps comes from those games, but I am a COD Zombies fan. I have an interest in it and I am patient enough to learn the maps. However, anyone who isnt like me will have a problem figuring out what is going on and what to do. The last maps are all about objectives. The steps you have to take just to pack-a-punch in those games are completely bonkers (yes I used the word bonkers to describe it). Playing public on those maps are so hard. You just have to hope that you meet a player that is also a zombie fan. For a casual game like COD, the maps in BO2 and BO3 were so so amazingly not casual that people just stuck to multiplayer and then got bored. I understand why they would complain too. COD is a 3 for 1 deal. You get multiplayer, campaign and coop. When you only get multiplayer and campaign, you can feel a little bit scammed. Like it wasnt worth the money. In this game they manage to keep the maps casual while also adding easter eggs, story and tricks for the Zombie fans. So a zombie expert could have just as much fun as a casual player. All in all, the game is good and I completely recommend it. If you like Call Of Duty, then you wont be dissapointed. Buy this game. The only complaint about the pricing is the DLCs. They can be expenisve, so just buy them on sale. There are no seasonpass on PC so make sure that you wait for the right time to buy them all. The DLCs is mainly for people who are interested in zombies. You dont need it either. You still got 3 fun zombie maps without it. At last, I do know it says that I have 3 hours on this game, but I played it a lot on console before switching to PC. I bought it again on steam because I just had to have this masterpiece in my steam library. Either way, I doubt that you will actually read all of this so Im basically talking to myself at this point. Just buy it and try it. You wont regret if you are a fan of the series.Edit: I have now many more hours into this game since I decided to revisit the game. I can tell you that I still stand by everything I have said in this review and it makes me recommend it even more.			"

												The single player campiagn is based on the cold war era and a little bit on the second world war. based on the reaction of nuclear warfare . Its very different to pass modern warfare series in terms of story and timeline but overall gameplay feels basically the same as a call of duty game . However the multiplayer does a great job at providing a great experience in fps shooter though the different atmostphere and settings it provides .Zombies is once again brought back to the cod franchise with some maps better then BO2 maps. I bought all the DLC map packs and think that they are all far superior then the BO2 map Tranzit , Die Rise , Mob of the Dead Exculding the map Origins and Buried. Great for Zombie Veterans for a comeback. Kino der toten , Moon , Shangrila , Call of the Dead Multiplayer pros and cons of Black ops.  Pros - Dedicated severs.- Interesting story which links to world at war - Nuketown map- Return of world at war zombie maps- Huge variety of weapons and attachments in both single and multi  Cons- Some Maps are to big and uneven for TDM- Unpopulated severs- Overpowered weapons			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops was released in 2010. It can be played in single player mode as well as Multiplayer Mode and Zombies: Multiplayer Mode, both of which are immensely fun. Having played it to 100% completion on the PS3 already, I can't give it any higher praise. Only games that I think are fantastic do I bother putting in the kind of effort to achieve 100%. You play as Alex Mason, a soldier who is being held and interrogated, as you progress through various black ops Mason went on over several years. I can't go into more detail without spoilers, so I will leave it at that.Call of Duty: Black Ops, plays the same way previous titles in the Call of Duty franchise, so if you like that style, Black Ops won't disappoint. Multiplayer is actually rather fun with Black Ops, as is Zombies Mode, where you can play on several Maps and must survive waves of zombies with a team of other players. Call of Duty: Black Ops has went on to be successful enough to spawn 2 sequels, which I have not yet had the chance to play, but that does speak volumes of how popular the game was and still is. If you like first person action/shooters, Black Ops is a must play.			"

												You'd think they'd test it with the latest hardware before shipping it.  Or maybe just test it at all.  I am still having problems with graphics hitching, which Treyarch has (allegedly) attributed to problems with the 400 series graphics cards from nVidia.  Three patches post release, and they still haven't addressed the problem.  Also, being unable to directly connect to a server that you've paid for because the server browser doesn't work correctly and they seem to have left the \connect and \reconnect commands out of the console... just make this game yet another cluster♥♥♥♥ in a line of cluster♥♥♥♥s.  If it wasn't for the fact that Treyarch was riding the wave of a successful franchise, or riding the wave of other franchises in general (such as James Bond), they wouldn't be a successful development house at all.I will reserve judgement on the game itself until I can actually play it.  Until then, I can only comment on its technical shortcomings.			"

												Definitely a good game, it's kinda outdated now that Ghosts is out and Advanced Warfare will be coming out soon (as of now).I really enjoyed playing this game back in 2011/12 on my PS3 so I thought that it'd be a good idea to have some fun on the PC version to see what's different, not much has changed but still we get to actually use chat now except no matchmaking lobbies on multiplayer (which is annoying when you want to play with your friends) unlike on the XBox 360, PS3 and Wii versions.If you're really into the Vietnam and Cold Wars, this could be an ideal game for you but if you're not into Call of Duty, I don't blame you because I prefer the older ones myself. Call of Duty 4 up to Modern Warfare 3 was pretty much the bomb at the time.However the only thing I would recommend you do if you plan on buying this game is to buy a cheaper steam key on eBay or something or wait until the game becomes at least half-price (like I did, as I bought the game during the 2014 summer sale) as the game isn't worth as much as £30, despite that the game is now almost 4 years old already.

												The last good Call of Duty in my opinion, I've played the recent ones and I wasn't impressed. This has a great single player and an excellent multiplayer, especially zombies, but like it is with any Call of Duty, you have the downsides, since this is an ""older"" game, it is less strict online and you already have people who cheat or hack the game (infinite ammo, invicibility, teleportation.)MW2 has people who cheat for their entire side (meaning everyone on one faction gets everything unlocked and gets super powers) which sometimes shows up as a hack even though you didn't do it.8/10			"

												The last Call of Duty to support dedicated servers on PC, so arguably the last Call of Duty worth playing on PC. There still reamins a small, freindly and dedicated community around this game which make it still a joy to play. The Visuals hold up well enough in 2014 and the gameplay is still enjoyable with many custom servers tweaking the experience to improve it. Virtually no one cheating which is a refreshing change from newer titles and some seriosuly good players left playing, so there challenge is there if you want it.I would still recommend this over every subsequent releases and in my opinion remains one of if not the best, certainly the last true Call of Duty title.

Since those days, we've all moved to the PC platform.I found a steam key of the game for only $10, so I decided to get it again for PC.I've always thought that Black Ops had the best singleplayer campaign out of all Call of Duty games. The story is very psychological and interesting, even though some critics say that the gameplay is too linear. The soundtrack is very good and fits the game's theme well. The PC port is decent.

												Oh man, I really don't want to do this, but sadly I must give Black Ops a negative review.  Mind you I like this game.  As a game it's top notch and worth playing.  However I'm quite annoyed at the actual PC version of this game. The problems stem from the fact that there's NO niceties and at least one VERY big flaw.   First the opening interface is HORRIBLE on PC.  You literally MUST have a keyboard for the game to work.  Even a mouse won't allow you to use the menu efficently.  So trying to play this game with just a controller  is a horrible experience.  In addition even though controllers work in game, they don't work well.   You can get all the functionality you expect in game, but on the pause menu the controller only works with the pause button.   You can't select anything with out a mouse or keyboard.  Even when the controller works in game, it doesn't work out of game, so the main menu still doesn't work, and will require a keyboard and a mouse if you are ever use big picture mode. That isn't a big problem, however the interface all over feels like a interface from 2005, even in a 2010 game this is outdated, but again I could live with this. However there's two major issues I have.  First the game does try to cloud save something but does a horrible job of it (nothing is stored in the cloud) but the worse problem is if you somehow run out of memory as you play the game (not impossible) the game will actually delete your save data.   I ended up losing my entire progress because of this when nearing the end of the game, a second time. I mean seriously? I had a save game that was quite far, and then there was a dialog telling me the game was out of memory, and when I quit to fix the problem, my save game was wiped.     Black Ops was one of the best Call of Duty games in years, but I'd recommend a console copy if you want to play it now for the single player.  The PC version is ok, but definitely showing it's age.   Of course if you want mouse and keyboard you'll have to play on the PC, but that'd be the only reason I'd recommend playing this game, It's not a bad game, but damn it, the game should be far better than these problems.

												Love annoying, racist kids, horrible hit detection, a boring story that would only take one hour to beat if the game designers decided to not put as many enemies on screen as posible until you computer crashes, spending hundreds of dollars on dlc for more lackluster maps that you only buy to play more nazi zombies and to get achievements you can only get if you buy said dlc that still shows up on the normal game's overview (not to mention this game is 3 years old and still costs $40 on steam) , guns that are simple reskins and do nothing different, a game so poorly coded every server has at least 3 hackers and you'll encounter an endless amount of glitches in the campain? If you do then this is the game for you!			"

												COD Black Ops is a good game but not worth the 40$ they have been charging for it.On the other hand I can't say the game totally sucks either.It's entertaining and worth recommending for anyone into military action games but I feelit's only worth at the most 20$.The zombie mode on this one leaves a lot to be desired, but then again I'm not into fighting endless hordes until I drop or quit out of boredom.I like acheiving a goal at the end and leaving with a sense of triumph, which I use to get fromplaying LFD 1 and 2.The graphics and the cutscenes are superb but obviously it takes more than that to make a game worth playing.I do think it somewhat better than it's other previous COD games like Modern Warfare 4 (especially this one) andWorld At War.But still for a game that's well over 3 years old this one should not be going for 40$ any longer.For this reason I cannot seriously recommend it.It's a good game but vastly overrated.

												4yrs old and still tryin to squeeze blood from the stone @ $40. I have a few friends that would like to own this game, but not at $40. Not even at $20. I think $15 is an honest price for a game this old. As a single player game it wasn't worth the $60 to begin with. 6 and a half hrs max of gameplay and it was over.@ the price of $40, no I do not recommend it.			"

												Campaign is fun and immersive, but too short. After completing and of course playing Zork, you can try out zombies, which is the second best zombies after BO2. Unlike the campaign and multiplayer, the gamemode never gets old. And, of course, 115 is a must-do easter egg.			"

												Treyarch can pat themselves on their backs for creating such an amazing game. With their pass game history of mediocre games (CoD 3 and CoD WAW). They have set the bar high with Black Ops. Black Ops comes out on top of MW2 with vast improvements and most importantly, dedicated servers for multi-player. As well, the online RPG leveling system allows players to purchase which perks they like instead of having to work through a pre-determined list of perks. Beautiful multi-player maps, balanced guns, and crisp controls make the multi-player experience unforgettable. The single player campaign is roughly 7-8 hours of story-compelling, non-stop action. A game that can deliver a good story while making the characters feel believable and alive is a rare occasion. If you are a CoD fan, this is a must purchase. If you like FPS, but dislike CoD games. This is still a MUST purchase.			"

												Most of the time, multiplayer is filled with blatant Nuketown-only, hardcore, and cancerous crouch-only servers that has dengenerated this game's population prior to its last free weekend back in 2010 when MW2 still had around 15k of players average daily. If you're still questioning my credibility I have the server list here[www.gametracker.com] which is more detailed. The only legit enjoyment out of this game is playing the Campaign, Zombies mode, and the very few standard Team Deathmatch servers. Another thing, DO NOT BUY MAP PACKS. It's worthless back then, but with the exception of exclusive zombie maps. If you're planning to buy this, save it for a console copy as some still play the game through there as of 2016.			"

												Playing Black Ops on veteran difficulty, you will......get blindsided by an enemy's melee attack while AI partners stand around oblivious to his presence...not use dual-wield weapons, for they are useless...get your aim thrown off by an explosion rattling the screen while your enemies remain unaffected...encounter NPC's frozen in place and restart your game...throw a grenade through what you thought was a hole, only to realize it was an invisible wall before blowing yourself up...spend at least two hours in those godforsaken corridors on Executive Orders(I mean seriously, Treyarch still can't balance a difficulty curve to save their lives. I looked it up - it is unanimously agreed upon as the hardest part in the game. The third mission. Second hardest part? Fourth mission. High fives all around the Treyarch offices, good work team)...still get killed by grenade spamming, because Treyarch never read any of the World at War reviews...wish Treyarch was sober when they placed the checkpoints...leap into the air like a mad banshee after sprinting to cover and trying to go prone, because Treyarch thought that mapping the sprint jump to the prone button was smart durrrrrrrr...get killed by stray bullets during CUTSCENES, seriously I can't even make that up...realize that unlike the last game, you can no longer restart a checkpoint from the ESC menu.

												READ THIS REVIEW. IT IS WORTH YOUR TIME! (Also, spoilers ahead.)---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This game is one of the best CoDs that I've ever played in a long time. From Storyline, to Maps, to Multiplayer, and to Zombies, this game truly has it all.Let's start off with the storyline: It is too long to cover in one go so I will sum it up breifly. You play as a CIA Operative known as Alex Mason. Captured by the (Russians or Germans, I forgot) you are put in a prison/holding area. You manage to escape the area but get recaptured. You are brainwashed to kill JFK but the brainwashing then gets changed to kill three of your biggest opposers. Cold War happens and then the story continues like normal. You kill the three people and save JFK and retire from then on.Now to the Multiplayer: There's a lot to say about the multiplayer. To sum it up: Maps-Good Guns-Good Gamemodes-GoodFinally to the Zombies: Storyline-wise, I can't give it because it is too complicated and long, but if you would like to learn about the whole zombies storyline (So Far), copy and paste this link to your browser: http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Zombies_(mode)/StoryBut I give the same opinion to the multiplayer segment. Good maps, Good guns, Good story, and really funny characters.Thanks for taking the time to read over my review, and in short, this game is worth the $40.			"

												Being a Call of Duty player since MW2 I was very impressed with the depth of the plot in the single player campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops. It's a story I would play over multiple times. The story obviously revolves around the Cold War and U.S. Special Forces who try to prevent mass conflict by confining it to small targeting ops and raids. The story leads you through several moments in U.S. Cold War history like Vietnam, Cuba, and Russia. If you are a fan of the Call of Duty series then this would be a good buy for you.			"

The gameplay is suprisingly fast, responsive and fun though the game can't stay the ♥♥♥♥ still and always needs to introduce some new setpiece mechaninc then discard it like we'll be bored if nothing happens every 30 minutes. Graphicly it's nothing really special, lots of low res textures but the gun models and facial animations are pretty impressive. The story is also really short and I didn't touch the multiplayer, however with a few freinds i can see the zombies mode being fun.Overall this is pretty much the Transformers of Video gaming, big, loud, dumb but it can be fun if you don't expect much or take it seriously, but i wouldn't pay full rpice for itAlso there is no FOV slider so i hope you like having the feild of veiw of a peasent			"

I love how it takes place in the 60's and not in the future, unlike Black Ops 2 and all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ CoD's that followed. Overall, I rate this game a 9 out of 10.			"

												[Friday, September 28, 2012] A very fun and addicting action game, there is alot of gameplay to check out and there is 3 diffrent gamemodes zombies,multiplayer,campain[Friday, April 29, 2016] Black Ops 1 in my opinion is the best of the three. Zombies is the gamemode that usually gets the most attention, however It's not the only good part about the game. Multiplayer on the PC offers a bunch of different game modes separate from the main three the game seems to originally offer, these allow variety and adds replay value to get you coming back for more. Similar to the earlier Call of Duty games the campaign is fantastic, It's so enjoyable in fact that you may find yourself replaying it numerous times. In the end Black Ops 1 is a great game and a great buy.			"

												I have played this game so much on EVERY console, even including the Nintendo Wii. This is possibly one of my favorite Call of Duty games alongside MW3, and I still enjoy playing it today. Yes, the multiplayer may have quite a bit of cheaters, but I have a lot of good memories on this game dating back to its release date. I have never dedicated so much time to a Call of Duty game before and it just makes me sad to see what Call of Duty is turning into now. Advanced Warfare looks like complete crap to me and I wish they would come up with something unique and original to give me the same experience that I had on the older games like this. Call of Duty: Ghosts already took it too far with the Aliens, and Advanced Warfare is going to take it even farther. I am going to wait for Treyarch's next realease and see what they do. If their next realease is horrible, then I am calling it an end to Call of Duty. It had it's time but it looks like it's drifting away.			"

												One of the BEST stories based on the Cold War and the Vietnam war.Pros:- One of the best stories in the many video games I have played.- Gameplay has some new features, such as flying a helicopter and rappeling.- Zombies in the Pentagon with some ol' buddies of JFK's.- It never gets old; I played through it 4 or 5 times.Cons:- At times, the story gives itself away.- (Not really much a con, but still) The graphics are old-ish, as the game was released in 2010. I, personally, would love to see a graphical remaster for this amazing piece of work, but, as we all know it, it's probably (and sadly) never going to happen.			"

												$40 USD or $20 when it's on sale? Not worth it. This game is quite old. However, there are still some active servers for multiplayer which are quite enjoyable. If you're going to get this game, get it purely for zombies, the multiplayer component of bo1 isn't very active anymore, zombies however is where all the action is focused. Still would recommend this game even though it's 6 years old.If you've got the cash, buy it. If you can find it somewhere cheaper, I'd recommend that.Overall a very enjoyable game, and I did not regret purchasing it.			"

												The most enjoyable multiplayer CoD for me, and I've played everything from BO1 onwards. BO1 has real dedics (MW3 had those too!), so crap like lag-comp or hacks are non-issue here (as long as the admins are ok, but you can always play on another dedic, which isn't exactly the case with newer lobby-only CoDs). Maps are fine, weapons are fine, killstreaks are probably fine. I simply have fun playing it.HOWEVER! Beware, because the game is quite badly optimized. I couldn't play it for years before I got 270x (which isn't exactly the top GPU, but not the cheapest either). On my old radeon 6850 (and even older nvidias I had) the game was simply unplayable. Insane FPS drops and a bonus mouse lag which made your sensitivity +- random. Not something you'd enjoy in a competitive FPS. Weird, considering BO2 never had any trouble on my previous hardware.

Call of Duty Black Ops Campaign ReviewCall of Duty Black Ops is when the series starts turning its focus and intentions in a very different direction. While Black Ops is the 7th Call of Duty game it is the 5th chronologically, which why I chose play it after World At War instead of jumping to Modern Warfare. Now I know that canon wise it really doesn’t matter, but I just like to see how the technology evolves in terms of guns and warfare. In Call of Duty: Black Ops gone are the days of a Call of Duty game feeling like an actual war video game. Granted you are partaking in the Vietnam war, but it feels less authentic than the other Call of Duty’s in a different way. You don’t “Hold the Line” or “Hold out for reinforcements” You don’t partake in actual war strategy. Now the other Call of Duty games weren't’ strategic war shooters, but while the strategies were preselected for you, I felt that it was interesting to partake in them. Making sure you popped smoke grenades or that you drove your tank close to the enemies because your tank was not powerful from long range. Now does that make Call of Duty Black Ops a bad game? No, absolutely not, but it does make it quite a different experience than well pretty much any Call of Duty before Modern Warfare 2. And it’s an experience that is action-filled and thrilling to partake in. It’s set-pieces are well designed and from an artistic view beautifully rendered. Call of Duty’s artists are definitely a talented bunch. Whether it be Infinity Ward, Treyarch, or Sledgehammer you can never really complain that they aren’t good-looking games. So how does the game hold up an action-movie like experience? Surprisingly well it turns out. Call of Duty picks up it’s influence from Half-Life or even Uncharted in the sense that you are always pretty much in control of the action, even in the bombastic set pieces. While these set pieces aren’t particularly difficult they are fun to play. Most of Black Ops’ campaign is fun to play while never really having a dull moment or heavy repetition, besides the fact that you are shooting all the time. I guess about the only negative thing I could level at the campaign is that it’s frustratingly short and ends a bit too quickly. I finished it’s campaign in about 4 and a half hours. Pretty much the same length of almost every COD campaign after the first Modern Warfare. Thematically COD is as strong as ever. The graphics while using the same engine are still improved. The environments and effects still hold up even in 2017, while it’s obviously no match for its contemporaries it’s still a good looking game. The soundtrack in the game is pretty good, while having some songs that, while are always used in the Vietnam setting, are great to listen to all the same. The voice cast is pretty darn impressive and seems to be the most extensively Hollywood COD ever. I mean you have Ed Harris, Sam Worthington, Ice Cube, and even Gary Oldman. I don’t think I’ve seen this much recognizable stars in a COD game before. The great thing is that they are good to great. Ice Cube and Ed Harris are easily the weakest, but through no fault of their own as they are only playing their type. Gary Oldman as always just disappears behind a role even in a video game. He’s easily the strongest. The most surprising however is Sam Worthington who definitely gives it his all in his performance. While he mostly is just sitting in a chair the whole time, anytime he has to show a bit of emotion he does it really well. I could feel his confusion, frustration, and pain of his character.Black Ops is definitely different from the World War 2 based shooters and follows after it’s modern brethren, but it’s still an entertaining action romp through the 60’s with all the bells and whistles  one expects in a COD campaign by now. Recommended if on sale.   Used in a Windows 10 Computer, with a GTX 970, and an i7 3820.    Game ran well, with no hiccups or CTDs whatsoever.    Collected all intel and gathered as many achievements as I could. As always don’t expect to 100% this game unless you are ready to fight through tedium and immense frustration. This is pretty much par for the course for any COD game.  "

												This Black Ops 1&2 stands out of the whole CoD series. This is a pc port optimised game from Treyarch. They showed their respect to pc gamers, especially compared with Ghosts, which insulted pc gamers, yet I still enjoyed playing a lot of it. So that makes me love Treyarch even more and feel appreciated for their efforts to make a better CoD experience. 9.5/10 for the attitude.			"

												This is a zombies review.I will review each map separately and then review all of them as one.Kino Der Toten 7.5/10-----------------------This map is quite easy but a very classical map with one of the best training spots at the stage not a very hard map due to dog rounds and the most overpowered Wonderweapon the ThunderGun. Overall a enjoyable map which is good for new players to learn how to train and sustain points with interesting art.Five 6/10----------This map is extremely hard. Due to there only being one training spot in this map which is expensive to get to and to make it work well you need to buy 2 doors or so. The boss is also painful to deal with as he can take away your gun but if you kill it you receive a Bonfire sale. The Winter's Howl is a bad Wonderweapon which effects the map. Overall the map is good with friends due to a fun camping spot in the elevators but solo it is hard to get to high rounds due to there only being one training spot.Ascension 8/10----------------This map is pretty sick. With the first kind of new way to receive pack a punch launching the three flight pads. The map was pretty easy due to the fact that you could train anywhere pretty well and having the Thunder gun, though it had hard elements of it such as the monkeys forcing you if playing solo to only really having 2 perks or so cause they would just steal them. Overall a great map to get extremely high rounds and enjoyable with friends.Call of the dead 7/10----------------------Ok call of the dead is very different to all maps. It starts off having fog which is a pain and dealing with the boss of the map George. This fellow gets in your way and if you attack him or are attacked by him he gains enrage and runs super fast and attacks you but calm-able by taking him to the water. The Wonderweapons are great the Scavenger is a great explosive weapon but PHD is needed or becomes useless and will kill you. The VR-11 Is good to take out George but making him calm and turns a zombie into a human like a moving monkey bomb. The map is good with a decent training spot and enjoyable oh though has annoying features like George and how far jug and the power is from spawn. Overall a good map and worth playing.Shangri-La 4/10-----------------Ok ok this map is a very hard and badly made map. Due to it being so close quartered there is no real good training spots but the fact you have the Baby maker does make it some how survival-able cause its a great weapon. The map itself looks amazing with cool looking textures and a amazing atmosphere with it being all tropical. Overall the fact the map brought cool new stuff like the water and new zombies it makes it enjoyable but it is unlikely to get to a high round on.Moon 3.5/10--------------Moon is one of those maps you really enjoy or dislike. For me its dislike I love the theme of the moon but the fact low gravity really does mess with you as you can bounce back into your train is annoying as hell. This map has a sick Easter egg blowing up the earth and empowering the Aether to Richthofen. The map has a nice feel to it but is annoying spawning on earth then going to the moon and how you have to do this 2 times to get jug unless your a skilled player. A map for people that are better at zombies but still pretty bad due to it being annoying hard to get basics.In the end buying black ops one is a good idea but do buy with all the maps. Its much harder then black ops 2 due to maps just being made worse and harder mainly cause training in most of these maps can be quite a challenge. Overall the game is 36/60 which is worth a buy.

												I played through the single player of this game many times (at least 4 times) and I was greatly impressed at the plot, storyline, weapons, etc. I have not played any other CoD game before, but when this one came out I was really impressed. 7/10 for single player. 8/10 for zombies. 7/10 for multiplayer. All round a good game, still one of the best Call of Duty games out there, will definitely reccommend it to anyone who wants to play.			"

												My friend got me this game for my birthday. I'm more of a Battlefield person because it has better graphics, audio and gameplay. So I started playing the campaign missions and after the first mission i stopped playing them because they are just bad the graphics were awful and the things i had to the were just stupid and too easy there wasnt any kind of challange for me. The battlefield missions are way better and harder. So i started playing only the Nazi Zombies mode and it caught my attention. It's actually not bad at all I enjoyed playing it. I kinda recommend this game though better get Battllefield or if you are a true Call of Duty fan buy a newer version. Rated 7/10!			"

Took me 2 playthroughs and a video guide to understand completely what was going on ;_;Pros- The game was fun- Had a great well thought out and complex story that also closed some things from the previous title COD 5: WAW- Plot Twists and conspiracy were a nice change to see in the series- Likeable characters such as Woods and Reznov- Great gun and grenade sounds, you really feel the Impact of a grenade going off- Veteran was a real trial and I got stuck on many parts and rage quit :D- Zombies with more perks and great locations like the moon with zero gravity- Multi was fun and didn't feel to fast paced compared to the newer titlesCons- Wager Matches are completely dead so to get the achievement ""In the Money"" you need help from the community-  Killstreak rewards didn't feel to... well, rewarding8.8/10 - Most In-depth story I've played in a COD game to date, Great Zombie modes and enjoyable but forgettable Multiplayer  "

												cod black ops is one of my most favourite cods ever. its because of the junglewarfare, the cool weapons from the time of vietnam-war and stuff. the gameplay is ok, i mean come on. its the same ♥♥♥♥in gameplay since cod4, but they added some new stuff in black ops which i realy like. the dolfin diving, the wager matches, the hilarious over-the-top-funny gunsounds..... oh and the zombiemode returns.  the graphics are old, end of story. they never were something that could be used as a selling-point in black ops. and i admit that they should have done better in this terms, but graphics are not everything. i like the gore-effects in singleplayer and zombies, which you only find in tray-arch cods, i like the maps very much, which offer alot of variety if you are a fan of snow, jungle, and cuban towns. i dont know exactly what makes black ops so special for me. i spent more than 200 hours on the ps3-version of this, got all prestige-lvls and im still playing it like mad. i mean ofcourse its not ok that a game from 2010 still costs 40 bucks and maybe even more, but if you see it for less somewhere else, get your hands on it. its defintely worth even if you borrow a console-version from a friend "

												I am currently replaying the Black Ops series in order to refresh my memory for the BOIII SP. I generally really enjoy the CoD SPs because they are really fun B Action movies. They aren't going to win an Oscar but they are a short, fun shooting gallaries. That being said BO1 stands out amoug them all up to ghosts(Never played AW SP yet). It's really fun, really interesting, and to date one of the best vietnam era games to come out. The story is much better in BO1 then any other CoD game. I highly recommend still picking this game up just for the SP. It's about 6 hours long.			"

												cod black ops is one of my most favourite cods ever. its because of the junglewarfare, the cool weapons from the time of vietnam-war and stuff. the gameplay is ok, i mean come on. its the same ♥♥♥♥in gameplay since cod4, but they added some new stuff in black ops which i realy like. the dolfin diving, the wager matches, the hilarious over-the-top-funny gunsounds..... oh and the zombiemode returns.  the graphics are old, end of story. they never were something that could be used as a selling-point in black ops. and i admit that they should have done better in this terms, but graphics are not everything. i like the gore-effects in singleplayer and zombies, which you only find in tray-arch cods, i like the maps very much, which offer alot of variety if you are a fan of snow, jungle, and cuban towns. i dont know exactly what makes black ops so special for me. i spent more than 200 hours on the ps3-version of this, got all prestige-lvls and im still playing it like mad. i mean ofcourse its not ok that a game from 2010 still costs 40 bucks and maybe even more, but if you see it for less somewhere else, get your hands on it. its defintely worth even if you borrow a console-version from a friend "

												I think this is one of the better Call of Duty games. Probably my favourite next to Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Sucks that this game doesn't go on sale often, but I definitely got my money's worth when I bought it at around $50 CAD. (~450 hours in multiplayer and ~110 in campaign/zombies, all DLC owned.)First the campaign mode. I think it's a really unique campaign set in a really interesting time period. Like most of the Call of Duty games, the gameplay is very linear and repetitive, and ramping up the difficulty only results in a mindless, unfair ♥♥♥♥♥how of trying to stay alive. Putting the gameplay aside however, I found the story to be really good. There were some great cinematic moments in the campaign, a really neat plot twist, some great locations and overall solid story. The zombies mode is pretty fun. Even though I mostly played it to get the achievements, it was still fun to play the maps on solo. I do find the two-hit-to-down system kind of unfair though; it really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off in a lot of moments when i didn't have Juggernaut, or a zombie just performs a double hit. But overall, the maps the base game come with are fun. The multiplayer is great. Fantastic maps, actual dedicated servers (meaning, community servers with a server list), great weapon balance and variety (though shotgun and sniper selection is pretty meagre) and mod tools. Occasionally, there are performance issues, but most of these were at launch and have been dealt with. It was the first Call of Duty to include customization of it's kind (with emblems, face paint etc.) and theatre mode which is awesome. There is still a very active and healthy population too.Overall, I'd give this game a flat 8.0/10. It's a great package; solid campaign, fantastic multiplayer and fun zombies mode. In terms of DLC, I guess I would recommend buying them if you are really into zombies and multiplayer as all of the DLC maps for multiplayer were really well done, and the same goes for the zombies maps. They are pricey, so I would get them on sale. I'd probably give each a 7.0/10.			"

												Enjoyable gameplay overall.  Call of Duty: Black Ops is definitley worth picking up.  Some of my personal favorite zombies maps are in this game. A few titles being: Kino Der Toten, Moon, and Ascension.The campain is entertaining for solo players and brings out brand new gadgets to try out.  The Multiplayer mode is mostly balanced and is very fun if you can find the right servers.  For a player new to shooters, the controls may be odd for the first couple of roundsm, but after a while you will see them to be very accessible.  The game is quite beautiful for graphic quality and shows the average person that not all COD games are 8bit.			"

												Old Gold. The most solid COD title to ever be on PC, despite the poor aging and un-competitive framerate. The story&campaign is also very well made, and surely will throw anyone off and give them a really awesome experience for what they are getting themselves into. Which by the way make almost every other campaign related to COD out there seem obsolete compared.9/10 - Mainly because campaign games never really perform super well either way.Finisher note: The COD franchise is pretty much dried up after MW3, coming from someone that has even cared to play the COD:AW one. But with a base line at 60 FPS, games like CS:GO give me what i deserve as a consumer more so than their 45-60 fps lameness. 200-300fps is where it is at on PC with CS nowdays, even though this unique blend sure has had it's good moments trough time.

												Simply put, this is one of the best Call of Duty games of all time. Period. I am really blown away by how great this game is. I have always been more of a fan of the CoD games set in Modern times, but this one is in the Cold War. On top of that, there are TONS of negative reveiws about the stutter. So naturally, my expextations were pretty low, but that all changed when I played it.First off, I am playing on a midrange laptop, and while it's not as powerful as I would like, it's still a nice little gaming machine. Even with my less-than-impressive computer, this game, which was said to have a stutter even on people's big custom ""console killers"", ran at a steady 35-40 fps with no stutter or lag of any kind, with everything all the way up except anti-aliasing (I always turn it off because it's such a fps killer).The Campaign is the best I've played, with a complex story that jumps around through time and plot twists that surprised the hack out of me. Nothing is repetitive, and everything you do really feels like it matters in the story and is't a filler. As an added bonus for Waw fans, two characters return (YAY!) The multiplayer is also very, very fun.About the price: As good as it is, it's a five year old game that is not worth 40 dollars. I recomend getting it on Amazon, because it's only 20 dollars there. Saving 20 dollars was worth the wait. Also, don't get it used, because the code will already be used and you won't be able to play it. The verdict: This is a great game that you really should get. Buy it new on Amazon for 20 dollars, get it in the mail, take off the plastic rap, shove that disc into your computer, dowload it, and then play like there's no tomorrow.			"

												This game is good in many ways, but has a couple problems. I still enjoy the !@$% out of it though.Controls (7/10)The Controls are not the greatest in the world. for example, you might accidently throw a grenade or a smoke and that can kill you, and in zombies, V is not the best for knife. I would recommend to use a Xbox Controller when playing this game.Gameplay (7.5/10)Even though I love zombies and maybe even multiplayer a little bit, but it gets very repetitive. Campaign is good, multiplayer is not popular and zombies are great, So don't expect the best.Graphics (9.5/10)Its great for Its time and still is today, the maps are highly detailed and explosions and other effects are good tooReplay Value (8/10)Zombies, Multiplayer, Campaign oh my! Like I said, all gamemodes are not the best, but you might like it!SummaryOverall, some parts of this game is not great and the controls aren't that good, but there is a lot of greatness in this game, and there is certain mods for multiplayer or zombies, so go pick this game up in a sale, because 40 bucks is too high for this game. 8/10 "

												After all the years I've played this game, I thought I'd finally review it. The other review I did was false, and I apologize for that, I was younger than I was now, but now I know what a ""review"" is. The zombies is great in this game, I think it was nice to see a return of zombies. The multiplayer is great, all the variety of mods you can use is just incredible. There's one of the mods that allows you to actually play survival in Black Ops. The campaign I haven't actually played much of. I haven't actually got all the DLC for this game, and I don't know why. This game is a great game for slaying zombies, killing humans and... yeah just killing humans. If you like shooting people online, then buy this game. If you like slaying zombies, also buy this game.			"

												В Call of Duty: Black Ops присутствует масштабная однопользовательская кампания. Сюжет игры позволит вжиться в роль бойца специального подразделения, которого будут регулярно отправлять в различные горячие точки нашей планеты.  В арсенале главного героя окажется не только привычное оружие, но и баллистические ножи, пиротехнические патроны для дробовика, арбалет с разрывными боеприпасами и другое. Мультиплеер может порадовать различными режимами, например, «Захват флага», «Бомба», «Командный бой» и другими. Моя оценка 7/10.			"

												Do you like using the noob toob? Well then oh boy do I have news for you! In this next installment of the popular franchise, Treyarch has truly outdone themselves with this one. It has all of the guns you could possibly want ranging from knives to even such more exotic types of weapony like assault rifles or grenades. In all of my time played I reached Prestige 15 by only using knife and noob toob and playing nuketown. If that's not a recipe for success for a game I honestly don't know what is. I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment of this truly outrageous franchise. 11/10 because no water level.P.S. I actually have 1,100 hours of in-game multiplayer time racked up but the hours played showed in the review is for the single player. Check the multiplayer in my library for the evidence. I know this game in and out and it's great trust me one of the best of all time and a must buy for any serious gamer that's worth their own salt.			"

												-OpinionI Really recommend this, not of the beacouse of the 3 gamemodes wich are like three different games beacouse its entertaining you can do different challenges for example ""Get 30 kills on Multiplayer"" ""Get to round 50 on zombies"" "" Complete campaing with out dying"" and if that wasnt eonugh u can get the dlc´s and play more. In a nutshell, this game is really great and better when u play with friends -WhySo, i got this game so i remember old times when i played when the game came out on my old ps3 (i dont have it anymore instead i have a ps4 tho) well i really recommed this game for a lot of people like Cod waw this are my favorite games of treyarch if you are a really bigh fan of the new call of duty games it might be dificult to get used to a non-modern style ""war"" but at the end i really recommend this game.-How and moreBut if you want to get the game cheaper than how it is ($40) if you want to you can go into ""G_2_A"",(did the low bar thing so steam doesnt censore the message) (not paid sponsorship message) for +$10 -$10 tho if u get an invalid key well sorry cant do anything :v unless you buy ""G2Ashield"" with your order you migh get a refund not really sure tho.if you dont want to then wait for the next steam sale. well we lead to the end of the review and here i need to tell you... its yout decision			"

Great game rofl.TL:DR HORRIBLE GAME BECAUSE OF MOUSE ACCELERATION.So I can't play this game at all. Along with black ops 2. Which I'm also going to write a negative review about.The Mouse acceleration isn't turned off even though you write in the command. It's literally unplayable, I can't aim!When I move the mouse it will sometimes lag and my aim will spin around like a mad man. So ♥♥♥♥ing mad that they havn't fixed it or said ANYTHING about it.			"

They aren't going to win an Oscar but they are a short, fun shooting gallaries. That being said BO1 stands out amoug them all up to ghosts(Never played AW SP yet). It's really fun, really interesting, and to date one of the best vietnam era games to come out. The story is much better in BO1 then any other CoD game. I highly recommend still picking this game up just for the SP. It's about 6 hours long.			"

												Best Call of Duty game to date -- Much better than any of the Modern Warfare games. The storyline may be over the top, but it was extremely well written and much more engaging than previous installments. The multiplayer is extremely balanced and ""CoD points"" are a welcome addition - You choose exactly what you want to unlock with the points that you earn from completing games and challenges. Even though Black Ops was released in 2010, it's the ONLY CoD game (aside from 4) that has had me playing it for more than a few months. I know I'll be playing this game until the release of its sequel: Iron Wolf.9/10			"

												Do you like using the noob toob? Well then oh boy do I have news for you! In this next installment of the popular franchise, Treyarch has truly outdone themselves with this one. It has all of the guns you could possibly want ranging from knives to even such more exotic types of weapony like assault rifles or grenades. In all of my time played I reached Prestige 15 by only using knife and noob toob and playing nuketown. If that's not a recipe for success for a game I honestly don't know what is. I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment of this truly outrageous franchise. 11/10 because no water level.P.S. I actually have 1,100 hours of in-game multiplayer time racked up but the hours played showed in the review is for the single player. Check the multiplayer in my library for the evidence. I know this game in and out and it's great trust me one of the best of all time and a must buy for any serious gamer that's worth their own salt.			"

Dragovich, Kravchenko, Steiner... these ""men"" must die.Call Of Duty Black Ops is one of my favorite Call Of Duty games in the series. While most people would prefer something like Call Of Duty 4 or Modern Warfare 2 mine is always going to Black Ops 1.Taking place in the 1960's during the Cold War and wars like the Vietnam War. The game is portrayed from the point of view of Alex Mason. A CIA Agent who was brainwashed by the Soviets to translate the numbers prior to the Soviet invasion of the United States Of America.I won't be getting too much into the details of the missions because i know that there are still some people who have not played this game. But the missions in this game are fantastic. Super enjoyable and set around different locations of the world. Some of the locations include area's such as Cuba during the Bays Of Pig Invasion. Or Vorkuta. A Soviet labor camp where you start an uprising. Or even during the Vietnam War with iconic battles like the Battle of Khe Sanh. This game has some of the best level design and they are super enjoyable. I finished the game on Veteran and while some of the area's in the game were pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t it was really fun taking things slowly and leaning out to do suppressive fire and then moving up. Crawling through the trenches of Vietnam or taking cover inside Castro's compound.The multiplayer in this game is still pretty active i didn't play much of it since i played more Combat Training as im no longer used to the multiplayer portion of Call Of Duty since i play more Battlefield and other games with more open maps and bigger maps. Apart from that i wouldn't mind playing it from to time but it's not anymore the thing that i used to love playing when i used to bang this game on the Xbox 360.The Zombies is one of the best mode's to play with friends super fun and addicting. But problem being is that if you don't have mods then there is only 2 maps for you to play on. They are Ok but nothing too impressive. If you can then buy the DLC although i suggest you to not do it as it is rarther expensive and you only get 4 multiplayer maps and one zombie map. Zombies can be fun with friends but by yourself. Ehhh it can get boring.I played this game back on the Xbox 360 that i have so many hours. Probably around 400 or 500 something. On the PC here i have around 48 hours. I put a ton of time into this game in my life and i still love it. One of the best singleplayer stories and some of the most enjoyable multiplayer and zombies mode. If you are looking for a great game set during the 1960's Cold War then pick this up when it's on sale. You will love it and will most likely put a ton of hours into this game.			"

												Enjoyable gameplay overall.  Call of Duty: Black Ops is definitley worth picking up.  Some of my personal favorite zombies maps are in this game. A few titles being: Kino Der Toten, Moon, and Ascension.The campain is entertaining for solo players and brings out brand new gadgets to try out.  The Multiplayer mode is mostly balanced and is very fun if you can find the right servers.  For a player new to shooters, the controls may be odd for the first couple of roundsm, but after a while you will see them to be very accessible.  The game is quite beautiful for graphic quality and shows the average person that not all COD games are 8bit.			"

												I bought this game because of the nostalgia of the Multiplayer and the Zombies. I did played the missions back when I used to have it for PlayStation but I don't really like replaying missions. When the game installed I jumped into it and the first thing I did went untoward zombies. The zombies was really good I played for about 20 - 30 minutes with an online group and we eventually lost. After that I decided to go the multiplayer section. Since it was my first time plain this game in a PC I wasn't used to looking for servers manually rather than the PlayStation or Xbox automatically putting me in one. From here is what it was a bit disappointing because There was no servers with normal team dead match , ctf, search and destroy, but rather 5 servers at most with 20+ people in each. And yet in those servers the game modes are not like the original.Once you go into the server it automatically downloads the mod needed to play the game. And it's infected with skins of zombies on top. I mean it's boring and nothing like he original. They're constantly trying to sell you something and you can't even leave in the middle of the game or else you get banned. That's one of the servers another is like a big survival  were you play agains bots with other players , I found that one to be the ""best"" one out of the bunch. The ones where normal like Tdm or ctf where very strict I mean like people taking the game to seriously. My own teammates where killing and the respawn time was like 25 secs so it was annoying. I got annoyed and killed one of the and I got banned. Maybe I got the wrong class or something but how the hell was I supposed to know. It said team death match So I joined but it turned out to be a strict boring server. Other lobbies/servers weren't any better. I think this game is great and is one of the best Call of Duties , but I think the reason why this game does better in multiplayer in consoles is because there's no custom servers with very strict rules. It's shouldn't be a hustle just to play team death match or Capture the flag.Also 40 bucks it's a bit much. I was able to get it for 20  because of the steam sale but either way.			"

												After all the years I've played this game, I thought I'd finally review it. The other review I did was false, and I apologize for that, I was younger than I was now, but now I know what a ""review"" is. The zombies is great in this game, I think it was nice to see a return of zombies. The multiplayer is great, all the variety of mods you can use is just incredible. There's one of the mods that allows you to actually play survival in Black Ops. The campaign I haven't actually played much of. I haven't actually got all the DLC for this game, and I don't know why. This game is a great game for slaying zombies, killing humans and... yeah just killing humans. If you like shooting people online, then buy this game. If you like slaying zombies, also buy this game.			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops takes the successes of Modern Warfare 2 and tweaks them to be a much better-rounded multiplayer game. Progression and kits still exist, with an extra level of the metagame surrounding getting paid in ""CoD Points"".  Weapons, unlike in Modern Warfare 2 are far more balanced overall, anti-cheat is strong with the dynamic duo of VAC-and-Admin, and dedicated servers return. Infinity Ward may have stumbled when taking care of it's PC playerbase, but Treyarch hasn't and has actually surpassed Infinity Ward's ability to develop for the PC platform.			"

												I liked the style in this game more than I liked the style in World At War. Less grey. Both are good games though but I did like this one better. It's over-the-top action with a good story, cool co-op zombie mode and fun multiplayer (way better than WaW since there are no vehicles). But it did feel different after all those hours playing Modern Warfare 2. I kinda expected the controls to feel the same, but they didn't (somehow it felt sluggish). But you'll adjust soon enough. Anyhow, the multiplayer will keep you entertained for months.[Rating: 92/100]			"

Definitely lots action, explosions Michael Bay style, and by far the best looking animations in a CoD game.The mulitplayer is super fun and addicting, the best PC CoD also, thanks to dedicated servers, changeble FOV etc., the only problems i have is too much HardCore and Nuketown only servers, and lets not forget the brownish ugly maps that this game has a lot.But definitely the reason to own any Treyarch CoD is the amazing zombie mode, i absolutely love zombies, and can tell that it has a even bigger replay value because of our undead friends!

												Campaign:-A rather intelligent and psychological story, with some twists.-Gameplay, although varied, is not particularly memorable-Several small sections were very frustrating as you would die over and over again-Action is quite over the top and unrealistic, and characters are thinZombies:-Solo zombies is a fun way to spend a few hours.-Practically no one to play Co-Op zombies with, though, which is a shame, as zombies would be much more enjoyable if you were playing with someone else.Multiplayer:-Perhaps the best part of the game, would definitely be if this game were much more popular.-I enjoyed it a lot at first, but soon got bored.-Good weapons, class and points system.-Rather easy to get into, doesn't take a lot of practice, unless you're new to shooters.-Only a few Australian servers, only one or two of which are popular. This makes it rather repetitive, playing Nuketown TDM over and over again.-Not very varied with modes on Australian servers (would be much more varied if you lived in a place where there were many popular servers and modes)Verdict: 7.5/10, worth buying at around 60-65% off ($10-$15)Campaign is good but doesn't really beg for a replay, zombies is something you might play occasionally on Solo, and multiplayer is great, but would be much better if there were more popular servers and modes, and hence, more variation.

												I can only recommend it only for the SinglePlayer Campaign... Its has a great scripted storyline with fancy explosions and many intense moments... But thats it . Multiplayed is dissapoinitng  , badly optimized  , you will  be very angry when trying to play on a high end  PC and see that you still lagg. Zombie mode  is a good addition with hidden stuffs and easter eggs. You will play it few rounds and then you will get bored  after  a while and then you will die being swarmed by overpowered zombies that takes a whole mag in the head to kill 1 of them.Singleplayer : 9/10Multiplayer:  6/10Zombies:  7/10Overall Package:  7    Its a good buy if you wait for sales.

												Note:I am not including negatives because they are so minorShort:It's a CoD game,they are all awesome and addicting.Long:Call of Duty Black Ops is probably the best CoD game Ive played out of all of the franchise.CAMPAIGN MODE:Let us begin with the campaign.The game takes place after World at War and is set in the cold war (1960-70) and you are Captain Alex Mason.While you are playing the events of his war experience,the story is greater as you are being interrogated by an old CIA handler of yours who is trying to get answers to stop the nova 6 attacks.It is crafted in a way that combines kick♥♥♥♥♥pure war action with a gripping set of characters and story which maintains itself in Black ops 2 and 3.MULTIPLAYER:Not really as big as it is nowadays,but it still delivers a fun experience to keep you occupied after campaign along with the bonus mode.It allows you to play a variety of game modes (in fairness some people don't play the objective) which gives you XP.Levelling up unlocks new weapons,attachtments,perks,equipment and personalization items.There is a fairly large amount of tactics you can use,wether it be quickscoping to knifing you can always find atleast 1 way to have fun.And don't worry,it gets better when you play the wager modes or team up with friends to dominate the other team.NAZI ZOMBIES:The famous bonus mode of treyarch games,nazi zombies is a fan favourite and an epic carnage to clear the gaps in the awesome storyline.In this mode you can team up with 3 other players/friends or solo to fight off endless waves of the undead,often being Nazis.As you gain points,you can access new areas,purchase badass guns,colas for perks and eventually reach pack a punch to upgrade your gun into a laser shooting super weapon.You can also explore the map to find clues to the eerie storyline or find the map objects that play epic songs to fight zombies to.The characters for each map are also epic,from crazed nazi scientists,to John kennedy to Fidel castro to Robert englund.How long can you survive?OVERALL:Honestly the best CoD game ever and another epic installment to the franchise.However if you have access,it would definetly say it is better to play on console (incoming PC master race weebs).

												IMO this is the last great COD game from a multiplayer perspective, considering the recent incarnations of the series have been somewhat disappointing in terms of the multiplayer.This game has ranked dedicated MP servers available for rent. That is what us PC players want. Not matchmaking, why won't you learn this lesson Acti/Treyarch/IW?The single player for this game has all the usual hallmarks of a Call of Duty storyline, however the story has a few plot-holes but if you aren't over-analysing the story too much, you will find it a pleasant experience.The multiplayer is really where it is at, fast paced and exciting. However there are some issues with the netcode and it isn't quite as polished from that perspective.

												Was really fun on Console and enjoyed it a lot, however on PC it is a mess. Imposible to find an unmodded server, everyone hacks and the ping goes over the roof half the time. If you can get past this♥♥♥♥♥♥then... um I guess its a good game? I'm not too sure I was young when I played this bull♥♥♥♥♥♥before.If you want to get the game for Zombies, like I did, then don't bother. Go get World at War instead. Much more content and decent mods (Not just aim hacking). Not to mention I got put with someone from the US when playing, this ment my ping... wasn't the best. Not to mention my internet isn't the fastest thing ever. Really spoils the fun.If you want to go back to the game and play it for a few hours to have some fun then go ahead and buy it. But don't expect to play it for very long.			"

Awesome plot twists and a satisfying ending that didn't leave me suicidally depressed. 10/10The controls and interface were simple and easy to acquaint myself with, and the gamepaly was fun, fast-paced and energetic- like I expected. Some parts of the game felt like a cool action movie. 8/10The game is several years old and the graphics are still pretty good. It's also not a very demanding game, so a lower-middle end PC should be able to max out the settings. 7/10Haven't played multiplayer. PvP isn't really my thing. NA/10Lastly, zombie survival mode.

Ive playied it  back in the day and in fact, played over 500 hours and I have no regets.This is liertily all I remember of my 2012 summer. Its muliplayer is also good, but ive barley played any of it. Bonus, it can play on most low -end laptops and pc's. This is my favrire COD and is a perfect welcome to any new players.But I do have one problem, and thats the price. The game has been out for 6 years, and its way overpriced. I reccomend waiting until its on sale, or if it ever gets bundled with a game or dlc.			"

												Probably the only COD review I'll ever write. Not groundbreaking, but definitely an original and intriguing campaign with a solid multiplayer mode.+ Great settings/environments, AAA voice acting (Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Ice Cube, Sam Worthington), fantastic color palette and lighting effects. Sound design and music is great. Lots of fun with a story that'll surprise you for a COD campaign.- OK textures, weird aliasing, random crashes, not a ton of weapons considering the era, flat antagonists.8/10			"

												I will talk about the campaign, because everyone already knows what the multiplayer is like.It's your typical COD game. If you forget all of the problems that this franchise has, than this is a half decent game. The story is interesting, and it's misteryous enough to make you wonder what is actually happening. Unfortunetly the game wasn't as epic as the previous ones. I didn't get all hyped up, and got that adrenalin rush that is usually present when playing a COD game. So I wouldn't recomment it if that's your thing.TL;DR : The campaign is not that bad, it's a good experience. I bought it for only 8 dollars in my local store, but I don't think I would buy this game for 40 dollars. It's way too expensive. Altough I would recommend buying it on a sale. "

												Comparing with other call of duty series. This version might be the second FPS call of duty that I always enjoy it with fellows and some real life friend. Graphic is great like black ops 2. I mainly do zombies. If you talked about zombies this might be the story mode as well follow at Kino der toten to the moon story is great by the way. I feel very impressed about this game. Also about Perk-A-Cola and Jingles of Perk machine is great!. They jingle almost every kind of songs. For example PhD Flopper = Funk , Stamin-up = blue and Deadshot Daiquiri = rock. So new perks! new guns! new maps! more fun!. They're viarable type of maps that you want to play like If you want to challenge yourself with your buddies and friends. You might go to Natch der Untoten. If you like spaces and challenging map. You might want to go on moon and Ascension. Walk in the jungles and beautiful eclipse moon. You might want Shrangri-la as well. So I played this game for about 47 hrs. past 2 weeks with my friends. I enjoyed this game as well as Call of duty: Black ops 2. It's great!.			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops takes the successes of Modern Warfare 2 and tweaks them to be a much better-rounded multiplayer game. Progression and kits still exist, with an extra level of the metagame surrounding getting paid in ""CoD Points"".  Weapons, unlike in Modern Warfare 2 are far more balanced overall, anti-cheat is strong with the dynamic duo of VAC-and-Admin, and dedicated servers return. Infinity Ward may have stumbled when taking care of it's PC playerbase, but Treyarch hasn't and has actually surpassed Infinity Ward's ability to develop for the PC platform.			"

												I liked the style in this game more than I liked the style in World At War. Less grey. Both are good games though but I did like this one better. It's over-the-top action with a good story, cool co-op zombie mode and fun multiplayer (way better than WaW since there are no vehicles). But it did feel different after all those hours playing Modern Warfare 2. I kinda expected the controls to feel the same, but they didn't (somehow it felt sluggish). But you'll adjust soon enough. Anyhow, the multiplayer will keep you entertained for months.[Rating: 92/100]			"

												R.I.P. Call of Duty, This is the last good game in the series. Black Ops 2 was Eh. Black Ops 3 is bad. Advanced Warfare IsGarbage. Ghosts made me want to kill myself. Pros:-Zombies-Multiplayer servers are still up and active-Quality Gameplay-Ok story-Graphics have held up for 6 years-Weapon Customization isn't limited by how many 'tokens' you had, like in black ops 2.-Controller Support-Multiplayer servers doesnt seem to have dlc maps (which is good if you are like me and dont own any dlc)-Active communityCons:-Only 2 zombie maps (not including the arcade topdown shooter) in the vanilla game.-Some servers have really dumb rules. (Such rules as *CROUCH* which means you have to be crouched and cant run, unless under direct fire.)-Game costs $40 dollars when its 6 years old.			"

												It's the last part of COD which I've been playing in, so basing on my experience I can say that the first Black Ops is very good game, where you don't fight in space and can't do double jumps etc, so it makes it more realistic. It's also very dynamic and in my opinion it's huge advantage because all what you have to do is just quickly re-spawn and show your skill, so you can't really camp in this game because you'll get killed in few seconds. I mean in the multi-player mod. The single-player has interesting plot and there is also zombie mod where you can have fun with friends or connect to random players. Surely I would reccomend this game even if it's almost 7 years now.			"

												Probably the only COD review I'll ever write. Not groundbreaking, but definitely an original and intriguing campaign with a solid multiplayer mode.+ Great settings/environments, AAA voice acting (Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Ice Cube, Sam Worthington), fantastic color palette and lighting effects. Sound design and music is great. Lots of fun with a story that'll surprise you for a COD campaign.- OK textures, weird aliasing, random crashes, not a ton of weapons considering the era, flat antagonists.8/10			"

												I will talk about the campaign, because everyone already knows what the multiplayer is like.It's your typical COD game. If you forget all of the problems that this franchise has, than this is a half decent game. The story is interesting, and it's misteryous enough to make you wonder what is actually happening. Unfortunetly the game wasn't as epic as the previous ones. I didn't get all hyped up, and got that adrenalin rush that is usually present when playing a COD game. So I wouldn't recomment it if that's your thing.TL;DR : The campaign is not that bad, it's a good experience. I bought it for only 8 dollars in my local store, but I don't think I would buy this game for 40 dollars. It's way too expensive. Altough I would recommend buying it on a sale. "

Ive playied it  back in the day and in fact, played over 500 hours and I have no regets.This is liertily all I remember of my 2012 summer. Its muliplayer is also good, but ive barley played any of it. Bonus, it can play on most low -end laptops and pc's. This is my favrire COD and is a perfect welcome to any new players.But I do have one problem, and thats the price. The game has been out for 6 years, and its way overpriced. I reccomend waiting until its on sale, or if it ever gets bundled with a game or dlc.			"

												It sucks that borderless window mode isn't an option. Whatever you do, don't alt + tab when you are playing zombies on Kino der Toten after turning on the power; the curtains will close again (you'll still be able to walk through it, but it is pretty annoying since you won't be able to see zombies on the other side of the curtain) If you need to exit the game at any point, just play in windowed mode setting. I've been having launch issues with the game. Whenever I open the game it crashes unless I change up the launch settings (have to switch between dx9 and dx11 everytime I open the game). Not sure if this is a common problem. Since this is an older game, it isn't worth the $43.99. I suggest buying the steam key else where for a cheaper price. There are no more dedicated servers so multiplayer isn't as great as it once was. This game is worth buying for the zombies game mode.			"

												Campaign:-A rather intelligent and psychological story, with some twists.-Gameplay, although varied, is not particularly memorable-Several small sections were very frustrating as you would die over and over again-Action is quite over the top and unrealistic, and characters are thinZombies:-Solo zombies is a fun way to spend a few hours.-Practically no one to play Co-Op zombies with, though, which is a shame, as zombies would be much more enjoyable if you were playing with someone else.Multiplayer:-Perhaps the best part of the game, would definitely be if this game were much more popular.-I enjoyed it a lot at first, but soon got bored.-Good weapons, class and points system.-Rather easy to get into, doesn't take a lot of practice, unless you're new to shooters.-Only a few Australian servers, only one or two of which are popular. This makes it rather repetitive, playing Nuketown TDM over and over again.-Not very varied with modes on Australian servers (would be much more varied if you lived in a place where there were many popular servers and modes)Verdict: 7.5/10, worth buying at around 60-65% off ($10-$15)Campaign is good but doesn't really beg for a replay, zombies is something you might play occasionally on Solo, and multiplayer is great, but would be much better if there were more popular servers and modes, and hence, more variation.

												One of the last decent games of the franchise Call of Duty®: Black Ops is nothing more than the linear shooter you've come to expect from the genre and series.It doesn't revolutionize anything gameplay wise so you might be thinking why is this any different than any of the other CoD games I've played? Well its main selling point for me was the very riveting storyline and narrative the game has to offer. This is in my opinion the epitome of good stories featured in the CoD series.The game will take you across several years of its timeline, featuring the war in Vietman, to the Cuban Missile crisis and even some late WW2 elements. The characters are there, over the top as you'd expect, with dialogue and voice acting fresh out of your American summer blockbuster (if you're a sucker for those look no further for your needs) but in truth it is really quite fitting and fun for the spirit of the game. There's twists and turns in the story as your delve deep into the depravity of war and the mind of the main character Mason, a CIA special operations agent who served during the Cold War . There's a lot to be said about the twist of the story, some might call it cheap and predictable but for me back when I played in 2010, I was pleasantly surprised and satisfied.There's a nice atmosphere in the game overall and the transition between the different playable arcs and environments is excellently done.Gameplay wise... well it's Call of Duty. It's as linear as it gets, it's aim down the sights until enemies die, it's the awkward vehicular combat (if you've played any of the battlefield series you know what I'm talking about), it's the 'shooting gallery' from a minigun/machine gun, it's the weird gadgets you'll use for a mission and then never see again. It's nothing new, it's nothing challenging but it's fun for a couple of hours. There's plenty of guns to use (side note, the sound design is pretty mediocre for most of the weapons) and there's plenty of enemies to kill and the level design is adequately done and some of the environments are part of a less explored theme in the FPS genre. I know it's a 7 year old game but if you're a die hard fan of the CoD series like I am, you'd be remiss if you somehow haven't experienced Black Ops. Furthermore the game features a killer soundtrack and it is guaranteed to keep your blood pumping through the action sequences. Before the downfall of the series began, before the over-saturation of the franchise, Black Ops stands like a beacon on how good Call of Duty used to be. These days might be long gone, but it's always nice to return to this after many years and see if it actually holds up to other titles. Naturally as years pass by this will steadily become less relevant but for a 7 year old game, it's actually not terrible visually wise. A great addition for your Call of Duty collection.			"

												В этой игре что касается одиночной игры так она нуу как все, опять русские плохие и их нужно убивать толпами, ну а мультиплеер- он почти такойже как и везде, только в игре есть валюта для покупки экипировки. На мой взгляд это очень прикольно ведь заставляют делать выбор того что тебе действительно необходимо, а не навешать на себя всякого ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥а и носиться как бешеный "

												While some of its maps aren't visually appealing and the multplayer offers exactly nothing new, the campaign is enjoyable and the zombies side mode is extremely fun and funny to play through. Like I said, its multiplayer can be repetitive and tiresome for certain people, it's still an undenaibly fun experience.			"

												I know I don't have much time banked into this game on pc but, I played it alot on ps3. I just wanted to say this is a great game. Servers are still fun to play on and not to hard to find. Story is also very fun aswell as zombies haha. I might end up needing to plug in a ps4 controller tho, it hard to get used to.			"

												This game is very well made I know I may not have the game hours on the actual game but on MP I do and yet im still satisfied. Anyways the game is very well made in its special kinds of ways. One of them is the art. When it does seem like its always shaded in with eaither black or grey it still seems satisfying and I still love it. Next is the gameplay the gameplay means most in my opinion so let me just say that it is amazing. I love the way it feels it feels smooth and It is amazing, now the price on the other hand its way too expensive. To be honest this game was made 3 years ago and yes it is well popularized but that dosent mean that there are other Call of Dutys out there and they are a lot better and yet I say the price needs to be lowered its not worth 40 bucks.

												This remains to this day one of my favorite CoD games. The story is great, and multiplayer can still be enjoyed if you find a server. The real reason to still buy this game; however, is the zombie mode, which remains as one of the best zombie games/modes out on the market. Wait for a sale or buy the physical copy though, as asking for $40 is a bit absurd to me, and this game can be bought for $20 or less if you look around.			"

I rebought the game and played through the campaign just to relive the game that I loved. Now im not going to write a very in depth review on the game. The game has been out for 6 years now and it will have its faults. The only thing I can say is that this COD has a good campaign IMO, better than the rest of the Black Ops games.			"

												One of the best Call of Duty games out there! It has an amazing campaign, great multiplayer, and amazing zombie maps! Honestly I would have to say this: DON'T BUY THE DLC UNLESS YOU'RE INTO ZOMBIES! Don't get me wrong the Multiplayer maps are greta in this game. The entire game runs of dedicated servers for Multiplayer and most if not all the DLC servers run off the official Treyarch servers. So why is this a bad thing? NO ONE PLAYS ON THE TREYARCH SERVERS! It's sad really. If you're really that interested in playing the Multiplayer DLC maps then get it on console. Anyway, another problem with this game is that dedicated servers have a lot of stupid rules, a lot of Nuketown 24/7 servers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ admins for the most part. Another big problem is that not a lot of people play the Wager Matches (Gun Game, Sharpshooter, etc). In general it's pretty hard to find a match of Multiplayer due to the fact not a lot of people actually play the PC version of Black Ops anymore. Which is a shame considering this is one of my favorite COD games! Anyway enough of me talking negative, let's talk about all the postitives! For one thing, these have amazing and memoriable maps! They're pretty basic due to the fact the entire game is set around the cold war. Some maps you may recognize such as Launch, Nuketown, Firing Range, and Stadium. The guns feel great and are fun to use! And just about every server is a Ground War server so it makes it even more fun! The more people the better right? If I'm not mistaken, this is the first COD game to introduce controller support for the PC. I know. I know. Call of Duty: World at War had controller support by typing in console commands, (Honestly I'm not sure about Call of Duty: 4 Modern Warfare due to the fact I don't have the game as of making this review) but it wasn't as easy as Black Ops. Black Ops gives you the controller options right at the options menu easy as that. Sadly, if you played this game for a long time on console (not me) there is not auto-aim assist what so ever. It's easier to use the Keyboard anyway so whatever. One last thing I have to say is that this is the last Call of Duty game to allow mods. The mods are really fun in this game! There's a mod called Zombie Annihilation mod to pretty much you can play Infected in Black Ops, A reverse and Hardcore Gun Game, and many more! The mods are only for Multiplayer however and not for Zombies, but it's still fun to mess around with!Overall this game gets a 9/10. I highly recommend it!			"

												Before I rate anything about this game, I'd like to adress an annoying graphics issue. There are no performance problems on my PC, and there better not be. But anyway, I noticed there is a lighting glitch with the graphics. There is a mission where you're in a cave tunnel with an ally with flashlight. And your flashlight casts light on everything like surfaces, etc. but not on any people or anything. They are literally a shadow when you shine your light on them. You can't see a single thing on them or identify who they are unless you recognize their voice. This made the game very difficult to tell what's what. I got this game on CD for much cheaper than what steam is selling it for which is currently $40. That's a crap deal by the way. This game is truly only worth more like $15 at the most.Other than that awkward glitch with the lighting, the rest of the game looks pretty normal, and the campaign wasn't the best, again part of it being that annoying graphical issue. but zombies is where it's at though.

												One, if not the, best part of the series. Very good campaign, great & entertaining multiplayer. The campaign can last up to 20 hours if you take your time, play at one of the elevated difficulty settings and try to go for all the hidden intel & achievements while you're at it. The story isn't bad, has many ""well known"" characters and incredible voice actors.Multiplayer has great variety. You can play your typical run&gun class just like a sneaky approach and be successful. Some maps are fairly large, others are almost tiny, but all of them are very well-made. Even with all the DLC, I'd say maybe one or two of the maps aren't among my favorites. They aren't bad, just not as good as the others. The rest of them is very good though and nicely detailled, almost as good as some of the old World at War maps.If you want a more-or-less current, highly-polished all around, part of the Call of Duty series, this should be the one to pick.

												This remains to this day one of my favorite CoD games. The story is great, and multiplayer can still be enjoyed if you find a server. The real reason to still buy this game; however, is the zombie mode, which remains as one of the best zombie games/modes out on the market. Wait for a sale or buy the physical copy though, as asking for $40 is a bit absurd to me, and this game can be bought for $20 or less if you look around.			"

												Before I rate anything about this game, I'd like to adress an annoying graphics issue. There are no performance problems on my PC, and there better not be. But anyway, I noticed there is a lighting glitch with the graphics. There is a mission where you're in a cave tunnel with an ally with flashlight. And your flashlight casts light on everything like surfaces, etc. but not on any people or anything. They are literally a shadow when you shine your light on them. You can't see a single thing on them or identify who they are unless you recognize their voice. This made the game very difficult to tell what's what. I got this game on CD for much cheaper than what steam is selling it for which is currently $40. That's a crap deal by the way. This game is truly only worth more like $15 at the most.Other than that awkward glitch with the lighting, the rest of the game looks pretty normal, and the campaign wasn't the best, again part of it being that annoying graphical issue. but zombies is where it's at though.

												The last decent Call of Duty. Still overpriced. Still selling the map packs for 10$ a pop. Activision is at best cheap and at worst  intentionally shady but all of that aside BLOPS 1 was a fun casual arcade shooter with cool guns,good MP maps, a really great zombies mode that hit it's peak in this title and possibly the best campaign in the series (THE NUMBERS MASON!). Graphically it's last gen but the art style is consistent and professionally done. It won't wow you but it passes. Having a reshade preset installed helps a lot if you have a nice pc and want to add some shine. Sadly it's years old now and it's seemingly impossible to get into a ranked multiplayer round but the game does have mod support and there are custom and modded lobbies to play in if you like that sort of thing.Grab it for the zombies or the campaign if you enjoy those modes but know what you're getting into with the MP and it being seemingly unsupported.

												Black ops, I had this game on my PS3 the bought it on the PC. Very fun shooter with decent maps, for the PC version alone, theres a server for everybody, regular no rules TDM/DOM, some weird modded server, or even a crouch tactical server. Zombies for black ops 1 was one of my favorites as well. The maps in zombies were open and had optional easter eggs to complete, had some good times on there but it can get a bit repetitive. Only advice I give you when going into this game is to watch out for the community, there's cool people, but the majority are out there to make you angry or sad or potentially make death threats... hehI guess that goes for anything on the internet :/8/10			"

The game has been out for 6 years now and it will have its faults. The only thing I can say is that this COD has a good campaign IMO, better than the rest of the Black Ops games.			"

												A few things i would like to tell you about this gameThis game was the last game treyarch bothered to take slowly the Call Of Dutys after this were utter crap and not realistic and i dont know how 1964 can go straight into 2025 they shouldve created a CoD before Black Ops II because it jumped too far.Community:By far this is the best Call Of Duty Community i've ever played with not the community today who are non-mature 7 year olds.The community is mature never seen a CoD Swear Battle a 8yr old vs a 7yr old swearing during my 680+ Hours.Players:Most of the pros such as pishizor and [Z-C] Jim Bowie and Lone Starr play this call of duty you know why.THIS COD IS THE BEST IN THE WHOLE SERIES THIS IS MY OPINION SO DONT START POOPING YOUR STUPID WORDS ON THE COMMENTS.Gameplay:Ten out of ten no horrible controls classic controls like WaW and good weaponsGraphics/LookGraphics look bad if you dont adjust it to the max in the settings other than that when you've adjusted the graphics in the setting they look so good just like the graphics you get in Advanced Warfare.Zombies Mode,If you like WAW you will love the new zombie maps which are amazing and have actual training places rather than the crap you get in Black Ops II Nuketown.By the way im not criticsing Black Ops II I like it it has one of my most fav maps Die Riese but i think they should've worken harder on the maps e.g NuketownIn ConclusionBuy this game enjoy it thats all i have to say.

Call of Duty: Black OpsThe game with the best Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies! On Steam the game costs 40€ but on 3rd party sites you can get this great game for just 10€!CampaignYou play as Alex Mason, part of the S.O.G on a mission to kill the cuban president.The gameplay is very smooth, all the 'maps' look great. They even made weapons that are only usable in the campaign. It has a lot of cool cutscenes and the story is actually really entertaining and action packed.MultiplayerThis is probably the reason you bought this game or you are one of the few people who bought it just for the campaign or zombies. Anyway, the multiplayer is really great. it has great maps and really cool weapons. Because this game is from 2010 and still 40€ the multipayer is bleeding to death. There are almost always 600 people online. So thats enough to enjoy this great shooter experience.ZombiesWith COD:BO you get 3 standard zombies maps: Kino der Toten, Five and Ded Ops Arcade. Ded Ops Arcade is just a top down shooter, can be enjoyable but its definitely not a great map. Five is in a military defense building where you play as four presidents. Then there is also this Jew-el called Kino der Toten, it takes place in an abandoned Naz¡ theater! This is the best map in my opinion. COD Zombies in just a 'kill until you get killed' mode. Endless waves of the undead!RATING 9/10 No need to bring up the numbers, we got enough already... "

												The first Call of Duty game I've played in years since COD4 Modern Warfare. As a single player and not interested in the multi player aspect I'm really not enjoying it. Basically it's just run and gun, it's Serious Sam. It's chaos. Continuous shooting, noise and bullets. No clear aim of what to do next, yet you are on rails with your hand held along the way by your buddies. It's Duck Shoot with modern graphics. It's repetetive and boring. Gave up after a few missions. Wolfenstein The New Order did it so much better in every way!The Call of Duty franchise is SO overhyped. Won't be buying any more.			"

												As a Call of Duty fan since the original back in 2003, I've seen the series go through its ups and downs. After the massive disappointment that was Modern Warfare 2, I was extremely skeptical on Black Ops. Good thing I was disappointed here too.The launch was extremely shaky on PC, but now that they've patched it a few times, the game works pretty well. What you'll find, should you choose to get it, is arguably the best Call of Duty campaign to date. It's dark. It's gritty. It's even disturbing. Most of all though, it delivers the trademark Call of Duty intensity whilst daring to be different. After you've gone through that, there's the return of Zombies mode (which I'm personally not a fan of) from World at War, and the deep multiplayer experience. In fact, Black Ops is the most well-balanced CoD game to date, wherein nothing is too over or underpowered and you have customization options like never before.Downside? It's the 7th CoD game. It's getting stale.			"

												My advice? Play it on xbox or playstation. Don't bother with this version, it's horribly ported and has so many bugs and glitches that it's almost unplayable anymore.Leave it to Treyarch to lose interest in the toys that they make and let it break itself apart.This game is amazing in it's own right, the campaign is lively and very well written, the multiplayer is exceptionally fun, and the zombies always gives that fun you could never replace.However, with the more recent times, Treyarch stopped caring about this game. It was one of the better and more successful games in their franchise yet they still chose to let it die. The zombies mode literally doesn't work anymore, you'll be sitting there for a few hours before you find an actual online match, and the private match doesn't even work so you can't play zombies with your friends like the good ol' days. All you can do is force your friend to bring his entire rig over to your house so you could HOPE that the LAN works. THis has been a problem for what 2 years now? And Treyarch not only has said nothing about it, but continue to pump out garbage sequels instead of fixing the games that are actually good for their franchise. "

												Black Ops is one of the best Call of Duty's to hit the franchise. I think it is rather funny that Treyarch makes better Call of Duty titles than Infinity War. The story in this game is quite well done, with some exciting plot twists and great action/set peices. The mulitplayer is solid COD twitch shooting with some cool tack ons,  in addition to the great SIngleplayer and fun multiplayer the Zombies coop mode is also good fun with friends, in which up to 4 of your friends call fight endless waves of zombies with traps, and weapons its good stuff. The only downside is there are only 2 zombie maps for the standard game mode. The rest are 15 bucks a pop for the DLC map packs. Which is pretty insane how old the game is but Activision doesnt seem to like to price down their games even years after release. Hence why Call of Duty is 20 dollars... Anyway I highly recommend Black Ops to any franchise vet who has not played it or anyone looking for an enjoyable singleplayer with a solid multiplayer accompanyment.8.5/10			"

												A really good Call of Duty game since MW2 ! I enjoyed it as much as MW2. This game was developed by Treyarch , instead of Infinity Ward. And Treyarch did really very good job with that game ! It is very diferent than the Modern Warfare and the older series. Graphicaly, this game have very good visuals, and they are better than MW3 (wich uses IW 4.0 since MW2) thankfully to the heavily modifed IW 3.0 engine and Demonware. But dont get fooled, thinking that it uses IW 3.0 the game will look like CoD 4 (MW1), and keep in mind : It`s heavily modifed + it uses second engine called Demonware .They maked the game in IW 3.0, because Treyarch have much aknowage on that engine, than IW 4.0I buyed this game because of the single-player not that much for MP. It`s really sad that many people are playing only the multiplayer, and they barely touched the single player.So is it worth buying it ?Definetly yes !			"

												Black Ops, hmh. It's the game where everything started for me, I had actually just started gaming back then. Black Ops had already been out for more then 2 years back then. I joined a FFA Sniper Server and in the start, I really disliked it. So I decided to play CoD4, after 80 hours on Sniper Only servers in CoD4 (I brought BO and CoD4 at the same time on Steam), I decided to try Black Ops again, and thats when I fell in love with the game. As I said, sniping was all new to me and Black Ops is different from the rest of the CoD's. Generally the old CoD's has more style over them, making them more unique and exciting to play. I spent alot of time afk in the game when I just started, hoping that more ""playtime"" on Steam would gain me more respect, my first clan was sh*t, since the leader was a lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I started my days out on the Rebel servers. When I just gained Prestige 15, lvl 27, I decided to try to join Aizen to see what kind of servers he was playing on when he didnt play on the Rebel HC SnD server. That's how my days in cK, eXo etc. started. I got into the softcore community on the SwMt server. I gained alot of new friends, people liked me and I loved the game. Theres alot of colours, especially compared to the other CoD's, they are bright and tempting. Black Ops has some bugs, bad hitreg unless you have a good PC + Net, lags, the reset bug wich made me lose 111000 kills, atleast I didnt lose my prestige and classes. But even thou Black Ops has some of these bugs, that really pisses you off and makes you angry, I still love it. The Black Ops community isnt the same to me anymore, alot of my friends quitted, plays rarely or moved on to another game. Theres alot of guys I dislike, theres alot of things I dislike about the game but I will always remember my golden days in Black Ops as the best in my gaming career.I might not play as much Black Ops as I used to, mainly because of my lags. I might play a bit more  again when I get my new PC working.But thanks to everyone in the Black Ops community for great laughs, games and fights. It's been awesome.6/6			"

												The absolute worst CoD you could buy on PC. Admin abuse, dead servers, (3 NA Nuketown 24/7 servers, 2 normal map servers, and dozens of crouch only hardcore servers) and not the best port. If you're looking for a classic CoD game to play, buy CoD4 or MW2. Only buy this if you're interested in Zombies (to play with friends of course, public zombies is also dead.)			"

												The story... Geezus, the story of Black Ops is far beyond awesomeness. I mean the Modern Warfare trilogy is damn good at the story as well, the 3 games give a big whole, but I think I slightly like more this one. I play Call of Duties for the campaign mode, I'm barely interested in the multiplayer. No doubt, killin' each other in CoD's multiplayer is very entertaining and a great fun, but I buy CoD's for the story most of all. I'm more like a co-operative person. Yeah, there are co-op modes in the latest CoD's, I know and I like the Spec Ops', yet I think instead of this it would be greater if we could play the story mode co-operatively (like World at War). Well... the other thing, the Zombie Mode. No, I don't like it. It's terrible to me and damn boring. And I hate the pointless survival type of co-op (yet somehow I really enjoy MW3's survival, dunno why, but that's cool). I love killing zombies, but not in CoD's. One more little thing. I started this game not long ago for the first time (yeah, I was late about 5 years, but who gives a damn...) and I played it after MW3, which was the next CoD after Black Ops. The funny thing is that the BO has more beautiful graphics than MW3. :D It doesn't matter, it's just strange. The other technical stuffs, like controls, sound effects, music, voice acting, animations are pretty good - so the usual CoD quality.AND THERE'S A SCENE WHEREIN YOU FLY A CHOPPA AND SHOOT/BLOW UP LOTSA ENEMIES AND OTHER CHOPPAZ!!!! There's no word how much I love it. I love flying attack helicopters in general, so that part of the game was really sweet for me. Yeah, actually there are two scenes of it, but the second one is pretty short and altough it was fun, too, not that big hit like the first one. The only problem I got with it is the controls. I really could use an ascend/descend movement, but it went automatically and sadly it made the aiming impossible sometimes. Anyway, I recommend this game for the great, exciting, interesting and intense 60's cold war story, it's really worth the play.			"

												It's the 1960's, Communism is somehow still around and people are eating people the dogs have taken over and no one can defend themselves. You find yourself in a chair being interviewed by CNN, you go through the 60's in a rampant rage of murica bullets and communism being thwarted. The 38th parallel is irrelevent. The vietcong have sharpened their sticks and♥♥♥♥♥♥on them. Spoiler alert, they're traps to infect you. Anyway about the dogs, they have become infected with madcow disease and are eating people now on with the people. The people have been infected with some sort of crazy chompy virus that is likely cousin to the madcow disease that the dogs are suffering from, though not confirmed. Okay so Fidel Castro wants some nukes and Russia wants to give it to them but thats not in this game so don't be hyped. America is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and there is a team made up with crayons and glitter called the Black Ops yeah legit they call themselves that gay asf, anyway the Black Ops is who you play as and guess what 1 person dies internal conflict you kill the villain and save the day.Oh btw were coming back in 2025.Edit:""Your rank has been corrupted, you have been reverted back to Lv. 22"" All youll ever see while playing, game is actually♥♥♥♥♥♥on PC worst disaster of dedicated servers known to man. Let this game R.I.P. it was never alive, only on crap console is it still played.Only reason why the game is recommended is because the zombies is very much playable with friends and the story is mediocre with limited likability.

												Well, there are lots of things to say about this game.1st. Black Ops Campaing was awesome, i was really sourprised.2nd. Multiplayer is great way to pass time with friends. (And also a good way of rage if you are bad like me)3rd. Zombie Mode. There are lots of things to say about this. Great maps, great to play either solo or Co-Op with friends or online. Really challenging, surviving endless waves of zombies until your hole crew dies, and you never get tired of it. You always want to get better at it! Zombie Mode is one of the only features i bought this game. Theres no need to pay for DLC's to have fun, you can buy them if you just want to have more maps to play with.4th. You are able to play against bots in multiplayer mode to practice.I totally recommend this game for everyone, youll enjoy it. I would just recommend to wait for sales, i dont really think its worth to buy it at $40.00			"

I didn't really get into the multiplayer as much as previous COD because i was too busy playing MW2 as i was in love with it and couldn't move on. From what i've experience it feels like a new Cod.

												Agrobal reviews yet another FPS :DThis is actually a Call of Duty that I like. This is a Call of Duty that I don't mind recommending. It seems Treyarch created a more engaging story. I was invested in the whole plot as predictable as it was. The writing is good for an action title and it doesn't ask more than mindless fun, which is exactly what it is. I enjoyed it for the most part but the only part I hated was how the plot twist was overhyped and explained over and over again. I can say for myself and a lot of players that it was predictable to begin with. Regardless, I am just surprised I liked this game. I still draw the line with zombies, just never was interested in the concept.			"

												Well, there are lots of things to say about this game.1st. Black Ops Campaing was awesome, i was really sourprised.2nd. Multiplayer is great way to pass time with friends. (And also a good way of rage if you are bad like me)3rd. Zombie Mode. There are lots of things to say about this. Great maps, great to play either solo or Co-Op with friends or online. Really challenging, surviving endless waves of zombies until your hole crew dies, and you never get tired of it. You always want to get better at it! Zombie Mode is one of the only features i bought this game. Theres no need to pay for DLC's to have fun, you can buy them if you just want to have more maps to play with.4th. You are able to play against bots in multiplayer mode to practice.I totally recommend this game for everyone, youll enjoy it. I would just recommend to wait for sales, i dont really think its worth to buy it at $40.00			"

												Honestly, this game was good. Emphasis on WAS. Now it's impossible to play multiplayer, unless you find playing against bots with access to only 3 classes fun. I don't know why they made it so you can only play on other's servers for multiplayer, but it absolutely ruined it. The only reason you should buy this old game is for the zombies mode, and campaign I guess. But really, zombies is the only redeeming factor the this waste of money. Don't buy this and expect to play multiplayer, it's terrible.			"

												I will not review the campaign, as I don't really remember it. Something about numbers. Who cares. I did, however, play a fair amount of Zombies with 2 friends. And it was a lot of fun. We killed tons of zombies. We sometimes struggled to efficiently co-operate, but put our differences aside and found our way to waves near 30-40. It was both satisfying in term of team work and shooting zombies. Pack a punch and perk drinks are ingredients that just make the mode tastier. Nonetheless, we missed a pause button because after 30 waves you often want to go to the head. Or to bed. Anyhow, it is a time consuming mode, where only little mistakes can cost you the round. But overall, most fun I had in Call of Duty Black Ops.			"

By taking historical events and adding a spin to them really makes for an interesting game.Multiplayer was ok. Good killstreaks. Good maps.

												Really awesome game, even though alot of people say it itsn't and it might not seem better than the CoD: Modern Warfare 2, but after the first 10 levels you begin to sense a better game, it not nearly or even close to be as bad as people had told me, in my opinion its a good game.			"

												This is one of my most favorite CoD's up to date and I always come back to play the Multiplayer and the Zombies occasionally. It does have a lot of replayability and if you have the DLC's there is a lot to explore in the Zombies maps and the Multiplayer also to explore new environments. If you don't have this game, GET IT. Don't get the most recent CoD because you might be disappointed with it. 10/10 Best CoD to date.			"

												Ooooh God. Thank you for this miracle that you've given to us. Still the best CoD game after 1st MW. The best nuance why i like cod games is a zombie mode. it was my first CoD game and i enjoy it a lot.Only one bad thing, guys, don't buy it on steam for £30. It doesn't worth 30 ♥♥♥♥in pounds. Best price ~£10.Also buy zombie maps pack, because original ones are getting boring in few hours.10/10			"

												Black Ops is a fantastic game. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this upon it's release.Why am I leaving a negative review then? Well I purchased this on PC so that I could play through some of the Wager Matches that I used to love. Unfortunately, NO ONE'S PLAYING THEM! You can still play regular multiplayer and zombies, but no wager matches, leaving out a HUGE portion of what made Black Ops so enjoyable.			"

												Честно говоря Black Ops - определённо не самая моя любимая часть этой серии. Мне не понравился не сюжет, не мультиплеер, не режим зомби. Если вы не фанат времен так называемой ""Холодной войны"" - то эта игра не для вас (я сейчас об экипировки и оружии в целом). Из плюсов:- Сюжет (да-да вот я тут обсираю сюжет и вдруг называю его плюсом)Сугубо фанатам он понравился, хотя я не нахожу его интересным.-ЗомбиСпустя 2 года Activision всё же его вернули. Думаю тогда для всех это было счастье - новые карты, оружие.Теперь о минусах:- DLCВ стандартные зомби карты вы наиграетесь как только дойтёте до улучшайзера. Что бы поиграть в самые топовые из них придётся купить парочку dlc. Также большая часть dlc содержит карты для мультиплеера, ктороые вообще мертвы. Т.е. игрокам не жалко 20$ на игру но жалко 10$ на дополнение.- Что простите?Call of Duty всегда была не самой реалистичной игрой, в который ГГ всегда захлёбывался в экшене. Кстати, СПОЙЛЕР. 1) Вы деретесь в тюрьме с каким-то бородатым мужиком (если я не ошибаюсь, то это 2-я миссия) и тут вы такие:- О Господи! Это что Резнов из WaW?! На момент действия World at War Резнову уже было по виду лет 40, либо Activision так представляют русских солдат. И тут на тебе - он, ни чуть не изменившись, пробывши около 10 лет в тюрьме стоит перед тобой.2) Русские придумали 6-ствольный пулемёт? Ммм, прикольно.3) ГГ что, ездит на мотоцикле и стреляет из дробовика как терминатор? Да это же пасхалка! Так всё 10/10.-Оружие Мне нравился Калашников MW2, MW3 и его верся в BO2. Но при его виде в MW и BO1 у меня начинались рвотные позывы.			"

C'est donc sur ces terres de mangeurs de pastèques que nous passeront le plus clair de notre temps et non dans les contré de la République Démocratique du Congo utilisé déjà dans le volet ""Modern Warfare"".

Looking online Ive found similar complaints, but no solution except get a better CPU.Black Ops was my favorite CoD in the series, but this is such a pain to play.			"

Where only the admins and friends benefit,Another thing, if your buying this for zombies. Save your money. It doesnt work properly. trying to join friends private lobby with their invite and we are put into online zombies games with randoms, the party system does not work. Zombies doesnt work.

												Black Ops is a fantastic game. I thoroughly enjoyed playing this upon it's release.Why am I leaving a negative review then? Well I purchased this on PC so that I could play through some of the Wager Matches that I used to love. Unfortunately, NO ONE'S PLAYING THEM! You can still play regular multiplayer and zombies, but no wager matches, leaving out a HUGE portion of what made Black Ops so enjoyable.			"

												Честно говоря Black Ops - определённо не самая моя любимая часть этой серии. Мне не понравился не сюжет, не мультиплеер, не режим зомби. Если вы не фанат времен так называемой ""Холодной войны"" - то эта игра не для вас (я сейчас об экипировки и оружии в целом). Из плюсов:- Сюжет (да-да вот я тут обсираю сюжет и вдруг называю его плюсом)Сугубо фанатам он понравился, хотя я не нахожу его интересным.-ЗомбиСпустя 2 года Activision всё же его вернули. Думаю тогда для всех это было счастье - новые карты, оружие.Теперь о минусах:- DLCВ стандартные зомби карты вы наиграетесь как только дойтёте до улучшайзера. Что бы поиграть в самые топовые из них придётся купить парочку dlc. Также большая часть dlc содержит карты для мультиплеера, ктороые вообще мертвы. Т.е. игрокам не жалко 20$ на игру но жалко 10$ на дополнение.- Что простите?Call of Duty всегда была не самой реалистичной игрой, в который ГГ всегда захлёбывался в экшене. Кстати, СПОЙЛЕР. 1) Вы деретесь в тюрьме с каким-то бородатым мужиком (если я не ошибаюсь, то это 2-я миссия) и тут вы такие:- О Господи! Это что Резнов из WaW?! На момент действия World at War Резнову уже было по виду лет 40, либо Activision так представляют русских солдат. И тут на тебе - он, ни чуть не изменившись, пробывши около 10 лет в тюрьме стоит перед тобой.2) Русские придумали 6-ствольный пулемёт? Ммм, прикольно.3) ГГ что, ездит на мотоцикле и стреляет из дробовика как терминатор? Да это же пасхалка! Так всё 10/10.-Оружие Мне нравился Калашников MW2, MW3 и его верся в BO2. Но при его виде в MW и BO1 у меня начинались рвотные позывы.			"

												I'll try to tell you the short version of the story.You are Mason, a US soldier tortured by your fellow CIA agent because you have knowledge about 'the numbers'. The numbers are codes for sleeper's agents, some kind of brainwashed soldier controlled mainly by three people, in this case your main target.Now, you are a sleeper's agent, but apparently you can't comprehend the numbers. This is later revealed because you were being sabotage.Okay. What I like from this game is, this game is the first CoD game that has a mission that allows you to control helicopter (a.k.a. Hind). Overall, this is that kind of CoD where you won't regret buying, buy when it's on Sale.			"

Since the first launch of the game, it will take you directly into the atmosphere.Main menu just gives you the pure atmosphere of all game!My favorite part of history is the cold war, so this game is filled with every shadow and soundof the one world important historycal period known as cold war.The story is very interesting and blood thriling. It is very interesting that  the game gives you the feeling of COLD.I mean that when you play it, the atmosphere is so dark and cold that you starting to recognize the pressure between world greatest countries.I'ts sad that this is the last cod that gave me such an experience.

CoD: BO is one of the few games I actually love. I have played it since 2012 and I'm coming back to this game ever since. I remember playing this game with friends all the time, especially when we all got the map packs, we played tons of hours on Moon, Der Riese and Ascension.. it was great. After that period, the new consoles were coming and I was migrating myself to the PC market, so I said goodbye to my love. I re-bought this game about a year after I built my PC, together with three map packs. At first, I was a little nervous, because at launch, the PC version didn't seem to be treated well, with many issues and optimalisation problems. However, after some time, the port actually became a bit better and it shows. I'm back with my love, and now that I have the time to play it (after a lot of personal issues), I'm really stoked and I already got some friends to play this with. I got some of my old friends to pick this back up and we're really enjoying it. The graphics are amazingly still up to par on most games, and because technology changes every second, it's really easy to run nowadays and it runs really well. So well, that still a large playerbase is playing this game on a daily basis and it's amazing to see other people joining the fun. You can still find matches online, and thanks to the addition of modded servers on multiplayer, it's still really refreshing. Zombies is really slick as well, people are still playing and it's still as fun as back in 2012. The story is great too, making this one of the best Call of Duty titles to come out and, in my opinion, it's still worth it to this day.The controls are rebindable, you can play with any Xbox 360 or XInput controller if you'd like to, but the keyboard/mouse combination is fine if you don't own a controller. + Graphics are still good, even up to this day;+ Fun story, really well executed, great narrative and quite realistic;+ Multiplayer is still alive and kicking (!);+ Zombies is still here too, and it's fun as heck to slay some zombies!+ Having the option to use an Xbox controller is amazing in my book;+ Great performance on modern machines;+ DLC is still being played, and especially with zombies, it's worth it!= Price is too high, 40€ is just too much, and especially if you'd want the expansions, it costs a fortune;= Mac version is a little weird, two completely different versions, with no way of playing together, so the Mac version is dead atm;= There is a bug where if you play on a modded server, your multiplayer rank may not be saved, so keep an eye out for that!Final score: 8/10It's a great title, and even it's age and some bugs cannot blow this, in my eyes, masterpiece, away!However, wait for a sale, otherwise you're just blowing money away for a 6 y/o-game :)If you have any questions or if you want to play some zombies, be not afraid to drop something in the comment section below or add me as your friend, I'm here to help! :)			"

												Wish they would make a follow up of the original Black Ops in a time when this game was set, absolutely love this classic and it's great on PC. This game deserves a bigger player base for the multiplayer and zombies portion of the game, but the server browser let's you always have servers to play on with people.			"

												This was a♥♥♥♥♥♥game. I played the single player once, and never went back. Why? Because it was short, boring, and had WAY too many cut-scenes. It seems that every good title these days gets sucked into the multiplayer and cut-scene vortex. If I wanted to watch cut-scenes, I would have put on a ♥♥♥♥ing war movie.So now, they sacrificed good single player play ability for multiplayer and too many cut-scenes. I'm sorry I spent the money. Again,♥♥♥♥♥♥game if you are playing single player.			"

												Call of duty Black ops is my favorite game in cod series.This game got some sort of a true shooter game spirit for which old cods are fame.  Since the first launch of the game, it will take you directly into the atmosphere.Main menu just gives you the pure atmosphere of all game!My favorite part of history is the cold war, so this game is filled with every shadow and soundof the one world important historycal period known as cold war.The story is very interesting and blood thriling. It is very interesting that  the game gives you the feeling of COLD.I mean that when you play it, the atmosphere is so dark and cold that you starting to recognize the pressure between world greatest countries.I'ts sad that this is the last cod that gave me such an experience.

												No offline LAN, no mods, no proper command console, you can't even play singleplayer zombies while offline and pretty much a copy paste clone of previous cods as always. Buy World at war instead since you can download 1000s of zombie maps for it, unlike this game which only has a few paid dlc maps. Plus world at war is actually future proof...			"

												OYUN GENEL OLARAK; Oyun Soğuk Savaş döneminde geçmektedir. Oyuncu SOG adında gizli bir ekibin üyesidir. Bu ekip Laos, Küba, Vietnam gibi yerlerde varlık göstermektedir. Oyunda Call of Duty: World at War'dan Sgt. Reznov da yer almaktadır. Call of Duty oyunlarında klasikleşmiş araç kullanmada ise oyuncu bir SR-71 Blackbird ve Mil Mi-24 pilotu olacaktır. Çok oyunculu modda ise Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 ve Call of Duty: World at War'daki özellikler birleştirilmiştir. Oyuncular kendi silahlarını ve perklerini yaratabilmektedirler. Yeni ""killstreak"" olarak napalm füzesi ve uzaktan kumandalı bomba arabası açıklandı. Zombi modu oyunda bulunmakta fakat haritaları sadece veteran ve hardened versiyonlarındadır. Oyun ilk çıktığı gün sadece PlayStation 3 platformu için 1 milyondan fazla satmıştır. Zombi haritaları Call of Duty: World at War'dakilerden farklıdır. Treyarch Call of Duty: Black Ops için bir harita paketi duyurdu. İçinde 4 yeni çok oyunculu haritası ve 1 zombi haritası vardır. KARAKTERLER Yüzbaşı Alex Mason: Ana karakterimiz ve oyunun başrolündeki karakter. Call of Duty serilerinde aynı zamanda hem sesini duyabildiğimiz hem de yüzünü görebildiğimiz ilk oynanabilir karakter.Çavuş Frank Woods: Rütbe olarak Mason'dan daha düşük rütbede olsa da bize liderlik eden karakter. Kravchenko ile birlikte öldüğü düşünülse de serinin ikinci oyununda yaşadığı görülür. Mason'la aralarında komutan-asker ilişkisinden çok kardeşlik bağları vardır.Onbaşı Joseph Bowman: Yine Mason'dan daha aşağı rütbededir ancak ara sıra bize emirler verir. Tıpkı Woods gibi kardeşlik bağı vardır.Ajan Jason Hudson: Diğer bir oynanabilen karakter, Mason'un CIA'deki sağ kolu. Aslında Mason bu adamı çok sevmez. Üst düzey ve yetenekli bir CIA ajanı.Ajan Grigori Weaver: Rus asıllı bir CIA ajanı ve Hudson'ın en iyi arkadaşı. Kravchenko'nun gözüne telsiz antenini saplamasıyla sol gözü kör olmuştur.Yüzbaşı Viktor Reznov: Mason'un Vorkuta'da tanıştığı, II. Dünya Savaşı gazisi, eski Kızıl Ordu askeri. Vorkuta'dan kaçarken ölmüştür ancak birçok görevde karşımıza çıkar.Dr. Fredrich Steiner Nova gazını yaratan Nazi bilim adamı. Aynı zamanda Mason'ın beynini yıkamıştır. Mason tarafından infaz edilmiştir.Albay Lev Kravchenko Dragovich'in sağ kolu. Tıpkı Woods gibi öldüğü sanılır ancak serinin ikinci oyununda ortaya çıkar.General Nikita Dragovich Sovyet ordusunun ve Nova Projesinin başındaki karakter.. Hedefimizdeki düşman. Yine Mason tarafından infaz edilmiştir.			"

												Worst Port for an xbox game I've ever played. It crashes all the time. The opitmizer thing puts all the settings at lowest when I can run the game at the highest settings. Game crashes whenever you change video settings. Controllers don't work on menu's. The UI sucks. Whenever you launch the game annoying pop ups... Pop up. Game is split into two different launchers which is stupid. Bad modding support. Console broken in SP. Game is poorly optimized but runs fine on my PC.This game is barely worth 5 bucks. And the DLC price is horrible. DLC should be like 2 bucks each. 10 bucks for everything.When you are actually in a game: Good enough. No crashes here.I give this game a rating of minus Zero. Yea It's that bad!			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

												The only reason I bought this game on pc was for the multiplayer, I thought it would be different from console as in ""No more screaming kid's"".... Well.. It isn't. It's just as bad, Accept instead of screaming kid's.. You have aim-bots and adults with annoying voices yelling at you.. And their still is kid's, Just not as common. No point in buying this for the multiplayer. And the campain is crap also. I also tested this game on a lower end machine that could run bf3 on medium graphics 40fps.. I was dropping to 10fps on lowest settings in the main menu. Anyway, I don't suggest this game for any aspect. Unless you like being yelled at being called a hacker while those people have 30 kills with 0 deaths...  So what's the point.... Just stick to games you know are fun.Few years on since I made this review, man I was salty haha.			"

												Great game, but Tryarch gotta fix this game. By fixing it I mean the way it performs on PC. Many people including me are getting low fps compared to other games. I get over 100 fps on Black ops 2 compared to Black ops 1 I get lower than 40. It's a cool fun game. But Tryarch just needs to fix the way it performs on PC.EDIT AFTER UPDATING TO WINDOWS 10: After updating from 8.1 to Windows 10, I see a huge FPS boost, and improvement! Highly recommend for Windows 10. Runs like butter.			"

												I would say CoD BO I gives you the best single player Call of Duty experience. It has the best story of a CoD Game with a lot of thrilling, unexpected moments. The sound is decent. The controls are as common always just AAA-Class title. And the graphic is still great comparing it to new games from 2013/14. And for all 3D vision gamer out there, the support is native excellent and not only that they say it, it really is, I didn't experienced any shader/ ghosting problem at all. Respect for this support! The MP seems to be really popular either, considering that the servers are still full of players. Even if you think that you don't like CoD (because you believe the ♥♥♥♥♥torm without playing yourself), just give this game a try and I'll be sure, you are going to have an absolutely AAA-gaming experience. 8,5/10 and the game deserves it!!!

												**77.8 Hours as of this review**          To be honest, I find it rather difficult to + or - this game for it has major ups and downs. The Multiplayer appears sustained at the moment as there is a server browser. I found the Single Player campaign to be interesting. But Zombies, the selling point (to me) is undernourished as the player base even reaches flatline 0 at times, but with friends it has the ability to prove very fun. The game is obviously not worth its current price of $39.99 and should be a $19.99 as it is aged and slightly underoptimized. The DLC, I feel is overpriced as well ($14.99) but Treyarch will be Treyarch and Activision will be Activision, to my dissapointment.EDIT: There is a server browser as previously stated, yes. However, the Multiplayer GAMEPLAY is significantly unoptimized. The slightest of detail costs 10 frames, its inhumane that dudes with Bachelor Degrees failed do stablize this after 4 years. I'll give them pity points at the very least.			"

												This game wasn't all bad. In fact, it was a nice change of pace in comparison to the games I usually play. Singleplayer and multiplayer were both pretty exciting while they lasted. ""While they lasted""; that is the biggest problem I'm having with this franchise. After experiencing the singleplayer campaign, I don't feel like I'd like to go through it again, and the multiplayer experience only lasted one year until they've released a new game - now the servers are dead. I believe this game is just far too much for something that lasts only a year. I even see the newer games that cost over $100. This is my first and last time I'll ever purchase from this franchise.

												First of all, I have to say that I haven't played either the campaign or the multiplayer, because I only bought this game for the ""zombies part"". So, here I go.I'm not enjoying this game. Why? Because I find it extremely difficult. I don't want to have a master in this game; I just want to relax and have fun, but I can't: zombies are very fast; yes, they are annoying so soon: in wave 3 they already start running. WTF?! I don't want to be stressed playing a game! And don't tell me I don't know how to play, because if knowing how to play implies going in circles or doing eights to get all the zombies together, wave after wave, I don't want to know how to play this game. Is that strategy? Really?I'm not saying either that the zombies should be slow. I'm just annoyed I cannot choose how challenging I want this game to be. Haven't the developers heard about something called ""difficulty level""? Well, a lot of games let you choose from easy to increasing difficulty levels. Is this something that couldn't be added in this game? Really?Besides, why does it always have to be an endless horde mode? Why can't the game end with something different from dying? Why not missions that could end with you escaping alive? Spec. ops. in Modern Warfare 3 is a good example: you can play a mission which has a starting point and a finish point, of you can play survival: YOU CAN CHOOSE.By the way, why have you ripped some fantastic features COD World at War had? I'm talking about custom maps, cooperative campaign, LAN support and the PPSh among other fabulous weapons. Do you know how fun and polished some WAW fan-made maps are? Do you know that thanks to that customization the community has been able to correct some flaws the game has, like no FOV slider, which cannot be corrected in Black Ops?What does Black Ops' zombies do better than World at War? Slightly improved graphics, original maps plus some more (dlc's), most of them well designed, more perks and some new ideas (like the easter eggs).Apart from the things I've said I don't like of this game, it is still very expensive.

												Thought I would get this game to reminisce. However, I am very disapointed by the fact that:1 - There are almost no zombie games active, so when trying to play the zombies mode in multiplayer, it usually doesnt work and makes you play single player instead.2 - It uses only private servers on the multiplayer part, meaning that unless you want to play Nuketown 24/7, and I mean 24/7 as there are no other servers, you are out of luck.No point buying this game in my opinion			"

IntroductionAs a fan of the CoD, mostly because of Modern Warfare, i couldnt skip the new series.Story(No Spoilers)The main character is Alex Mason, a CIA operative during the cold war, and the story centers on his participation in black ops, in an attempt to uncover a Communist plot to destroy the west. Game TimeIt takes about 8-12 hours to complete.In detailProbably the most interesting single player campaign in a CoD game so far. However, Multiplayer and the Zombies didnt fulfil my expectation (i'll explain later)Pros+ Great storyline in a very interesting era+ More atmospheric than any other CoD entry so far+ Great voice acting, and nice cutscenes.+ New timeframe, new weapons!+ Zombie Mode Cons- Graphics not satisfying enough, not to mention the fact that some specific settings cause glitches.- Worst multiplayer in a CoD series, from my point of view. A complete failure. Everything is poorly designed, the maps, the weapons-attachments, the killstreaks. It hasn't been a nice experience.Neutral*The zombies are fun and Treyarch did a great job implementing this mode into this new series. However, its predecessor was way better.Concluding, it's not a bad game overall, but since i was completely satisfied by the 1/3 of the game i cant recommend it.5/101. Dont touch it even if it's on the house [0-3 / 10]. 2. If you are bored of every other game [3-5 / 10]. 3. Grab it whenever it's on sale (or pay the full price if you are wealthy enough) [6-8] 4. Must Have [9-10 / 10]			"

												This was my first CoD game, and I don't think I'll be buying another.Pros: Zombies is pretty fun and had some decent comedy to it.Tomahawks, using these in multiplayer with scavanger was a cause of alot of my deaths because I'd try to use one against someone who was more wisely choosing to use bullets, still they're hillarious to use and you feel great after you manage to nail someone with it. Makes for a good final kill cam sometimes.Cons:Singleplayer story is pretty stupid.Multiplayer, nuketown... maybe I started playing pretty late in the game but I was playing before the next CoD game came out, still, almost every match was on the same map, it's small and chaotic which is fun but the same map repeatedly is bound to get old.Killstreaks, this is more a complaint with the series itself, I guess, but I don't understand how it makes sense to give someone who's already doing good enough to kill 10-20 people without dying a gunship that allows him to mow down everyone on the map, I started bringing anti air as my secondary just to stop the constant helicopter assualts and apparently that's not good form or something because people were hating on me for it.I played a free weekend of black ops 2 multiplayer and honestly it's the same game in my opinion. It seems a thing with shooters now to take the last game, change the guns a bit, add/remove various maps, change the name and resell it. Additionally, the constant releases of new games in the series means that if there's a newer game out buying an older one is pretty much pointless, most of the community will have moved on so multiplayer becomes more limited so you end up with 90% 24/7 Nuketown servers.

												After very good Modern Warfare this is the decline of Call of Duty series. I was frustrated by the story becoming more and more impossible with rambo-like heroes. In Black Ops the story isn't bad at all but on the other hand not really great either. What iritates me most is the price of every CoD game for which you get 6-7 hours of singleplayer story in exchange. This is where I'm saying bye to CoD series and playing only good old Modern Warfare. 6/10			"

												IGN: 8.5/10GameSpot: 9/10Metacritic: 4.5/5This is why I have trust issues and that is why I never trust reviews and I make my own opinion of the game instead.How can people be such sheeps.After 5 years, the game is still 43.99 CAD.The game was and will always be ****.How can people like this piece of junk? Sorry not sorry but seriously, how?There are great games such as Half-Life, S.W.A.T., Rainbow Six, Ghost Recon, Star Wars Jedi Knight, Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, Battlefield 1942, Battlefield 2, etc etc... Just in the FPS category, I could say at least a hundred of games that are better than this piece of trash and the others that follows it so let's not talk about every other games that exist on this planet.No recoil, hitmarker, wallhack intensities (the stupid ""tactical"" aimpoint/scope), hackers, ****ty multiplayer, ****ty community, ****ty campaign, everything in this game is bad! The campaign just doesn't make sense at all and I paid to play a game not to watch the same cinematics everytimes, even LEGO games has more replay ability than this.What's wrong with people? Do you guys get money to give them a good review? I hope so because Activision, Treyarch and Infinity Ward should just quit, Call of Duty was great, Call of Duty 2 was great, Call of Duty 3 seems nice, Call of Duty 4 was okay, Call of Duty 5 World At War was okay, Call of Duty 6 was okay, Call of duty 7 (this one) is a pure joke, Call of Duty 8 (Modern Warfare 3), do I even need to talk about this one? Call of Duty 9 (Black Ops 2), they did it, they made their ****ty game even worse than before, well the good thing is that It can't be worse anymore then Call of Duty 10 (Ghosts) was released, they did it, they made it even worse, Black Ops deserves 1/10, Black Ops 2 and Ghosts being worse in every aspects, It's impossible to give this game a positive or even neutral review which means something like that -5/10, let's not forget about Call of Duty Advanced Warfare who came out not long ago, I don't even want to download a demo or even the full game on any sites just to try it a minute, It would be a waste of bandwidth and a waste of time.You guys can hate on my review but it doesn't matters in the end, this game is utterly trash that you like it or not.They release the same game every year but by making them even worse, It's like making a nice game then rereleasing the next year but by removing the nice stuff (health pickups instead of regeneration for example) and changing some stuff for the worse (weapons, maps, pretty much everything).I could say a lot more but I'll stop it here, sorry If i offend any of you with some words but this game is pure trash, I just can't believe kids and people pay full price for those games, I wouldn't even want it for free, I hate myself for having bought this trash.As an hardcore gamer, I'd prefer to go outside play sports and do stuff that normal people do instead of playing this trash but since I have the choice, I'll just stick to the good games that are worth playing and workout to stay in shape.1/10Don't like my review? I don't care, facts are facts after all, I couldn't care less.If you like the game, that's good for you, I hope that you're having fun on this overpriced piece of junk.The only way of having fun on this piece of junk is to play with friends or even your girlfriend but even so, I'd prefer to play games for mans than a game that was made for the 10 years old kids new at video games.If you compare an orange with an apple, it's just a question of personal taste right?But then if you compare a sh** to 5 dollars.Well, it should be logic to say that the 5 dollars is worth more than the sh**.In this case, Black Ops is the sh** but people still pay for it and way too much, I paid less than 30$ and I feel cheated as heck.Even if they would have gave me this game for free, I would still have feel cheated.Honest review, honest facts, if you can't stand it then uninstall Steam and never get on Internet again.I must admit that, even though the game is utterly bad, having bots is a great addition to the game, unlike EA who decided to downgrade their new games by not adding the bots again instead of making them better.

												The story is quite good but the Zombies and Multiplayer is where this game shines!The Zombies has some of the best maps of the series but I think a few of the Blops2 zombies maps are better. Sadly not many people are playing the zombies, online. (I've only been in one online zombies match.) But there is Solo though!Zombies: 9/10The Multiplayer has been quite fun but Blops2 Multiplayer was a lot better with the Pick 10 System! Blops1 has a server list which means you can pick which servers you go on, meaning there is alot less posibility of lag if because you can pick what Region you go on!Multiplayer: 7.5/10Overall the Zombies is the star of this game! I hope you enjoy!Full Game: 8.25/10 "

To make things worse the multiplayer (while adding nice features such as jumping dive and dedicated servers) sucked♥♥♥♥♥The campaign mode was not even as exciting either... I mean lets be real this game was the worse COD in my books. If Ghosts sucks as bad as this.. then I'll personally give Infinity Ward a medal and a baked cake.			"

The only servers youll be finding are crouch only, which is search and destroy and you can only crouch and play tactical. And Nuketown 24/7. Just get the game on console (if you have one) because there are more servers there instead of dumb admins kicking you because they think you cheat.			"

												This game is crazy. You run around, shoot people, everyone yells at you what to do because they can't hit anything themselves. You can choose two weapons but they're almost all the same. Assault rifle 1, assault rifle 2 and 3, it doesn't matter. Just keep shooting.You shoot Vietnamise tank with TOW-missiles from ten meters. That's crazy. There are all these helicopters around, flying at the altitude of two meters and doing these crazy strafing runs. Everything is so close quarters. Sniping enemies from 50 meters. Awesome.You kill so much people that you'll lose your humanity and in the end, can't feel anything.The developers were so bad♥♥♥♥♥that they won't let you use your controller in the menus.10 euros - this game ain't worth even that.

TL;DR @ the bottom!About the Singleplayer campaign I have not much to say: It's been fun and violent and gory and all. Sound and Music design is also good. Graphics are pretty sweet and beautiful. I played the map 'Array', and loved how the sky and terrain looked. Storyline is also good. I enjoyed this Call of Duty for some degree but the most fun I have in Black Ops is in Multiplayer.Love Second Chance Pro!Sadly the mutliplayer is almost dead and the servers aren't so many. And some servers are hosted by dikcs, which will auto-kick any player using Second Chance, Chopper gunner and stuff, that the admins do not like.Earlier I was playing Black Ops on the console of my cousin, when I wasn't able to get Black Ops for PC for shi† reasons. I played well on the PS3. When I (years after) finally got Black Ops  on Steam and played the PC version multiplayer, I experienced how my skills got ported from console (boooh!) to PC. What's missing? The claim, that I hack. And probably your hate and jelly-being /trololoZombies? Many like them. I don't. It's not my zombie-playstyle if the zombies are chewing bullets like lunch. I prefer L4D2 or Killing Floor for mass-slaughter. Just my opinion!TL;DRIt's Call of Duty. Need I say more ;) ?			"

												Call of Duty: Black Ops is a great game, but the pc port of this game is not very good and is poorly optimized, campaign and zombies dont even work  for me as it freezes after the cutscene and the screen goes black when i try to change my resolution in singleplayer, multiplayer is okay but their a small bit of lag at times and my pc has to use alot of energy, i even have an i7 processor and 8gb of ram and it still doesnt do they best, and i have not got any fix with singleplayer, i would recommend buying this game on console as this game was really not meant for pc. Will give it a better review if i can play game modes on  singleplayer			"

												Its probably my most favorite game out of the CoD series but there arent enough servers. The only servers youll be finding are crouch only, which is search and destroy and you can only crouch and play tactical. And Nuketown 24/7. Just get the game on console (if you have one) because there are more servers there instead of dumb admins kicking you because they think you cheat.			"

												This is THE BEST CALL OF DUTY MADE! It's fun, the multiplayer doesn't make you think this series is crap, and zombies is super fun.

												Despite the painful 40 USD price tag (even more in some countries due to awful Steam Currency Conversions), Black Ops still has what it showed off back in 2011; The gritty, fast paced Vietnam special ops action that we all know and love.Multiplayer still seems fairly populated, for what it's worth, and zombies is always fun. Singleplayer is a great experience if you're into that. The only question I can't answer is, the numbers. What do they mean?			"

I think 85 of the hours is spent on the zombie mode. The easter eggs is awesome as well as the killing. The multiplayer on pc could use a liitle bit work but it's fine.

												Not recommended only because it's $40 with DLC that, collectivly, is almost $60. This is game is great and the zombie modes are great but this game is not worth $100. wait for a sale that is atleast %50 off. because $20 is about the right amount to spend on this game. Plus, if you are trying to get your friends together for zombies, buying yourself and them copies for just the Rezzurection DLC and the base game (which sill doesn't have Shnagri La, Call of the Dead or Ascention) it will run you an upward of almost $200! Seriously? and it's almost $300 for all DLC included. You really need to wait for a serious price drop on this product.			"

												An incredible campaign, which in my opinion is comparable to Assassin's Creed(sorry CoD-haters if I gave you cancer). Not really being a part of it and play it, but experience it. Epic cold war era action and a thrilling story. But my most played part of the game; Call of Duty: Zombies. Crushing undead skull all night, side by side with you comrades. The multiplayer is allright I suppose, it's not much different, except the weaponry. The only con is though the unavailable function to have a secondary attatchment when you have a underbarrel-one, using the Warlord-perk.			"

												Multiplayer/zombies are okay, however single player, not so much.

												In my opinion, Black Ops was very fun. This was my favorite game for 2 straight years. I loved the zombies mode, they really shook things up with it. Campaign was great too, the cold war era setting was  great to experience. As of multiplayer, Treyarch tried hard to change it, but it died very quickly. However, there are dedicated servers up.			"

												Bought it in the activision sale. I am thankful i got it. Hands down best CoD. the community is unlike any other CoD game. This is awesome. Buy it. Be sure to favourite servers, people usually come back and you can really make a nice community. Campaign is enjoyable so you'll like that part if servers are empty. Zombies is a great addition and is the best zombies of all 3 games, of course talking about with all the DLC.			"

												The Singleplayer Campaign was pretty interesting. Although the Veteran difficulty in that game was extremely tough, but doable. It is like the hardest difficulty you can possibly play in any call of duty game. The AIs have high accuracy, they see you, they shoot you, you die, reload checkpoint/save. The Zombies game mode was fun, but gets boring even on the new maps. Not many people play black ops zombie, can hardly find anyone in lobbies. 9/10, the difficulty was harsh.			"

												So lets start this off. I bought this way back in 2010 for Xbox 360. Got close to max prestige and beat the campaign on Normal and Veteran difficulty. Now some people would wonder why you would buy this game again 3 years later. Well I honestly it is for the Zombies. Treyarch really hit it big in that department. If your looking for something to play with friends stick to the zombies and you will have a blast.			"

												2015-04-25 - Someone has wisely chosen to split the campaign game review from criticism of the multi-player game.  They are certainly two completely different games.There is a potentially interesting story here if the decision was made to focus on scripted drama instead of video gameplay, where choice and free-will are the implied drivers of the narrative.  Instead, we are spoonfed gameplay on rails where if you do not follow the lead of the puppeteer, you are, more-or-less, destined to failure and repeating the same scene over and over until you ""get it right"".  This, of course, shatters the immersion and turns an entertaining romp killing ""bad guys"" into a chore as you try to figure out the appropriate stimulus required for the response to move forward.If you are expected to follow a script and did not receive it before the curtains were drawn...well, that is not a recipe for success.The older I get, the more precious my time is.  I have not stopped playing a game for any other reason than lack of focus before I came upon this game.  To be fair, this realization was a cumulative understanding of the series, but the fact remains: this is the first game I uninstalled from my computer with no intention of ever completing that also actually incentivized me from uninstalling the sequel without even playing it.  Tar and feather me if I ever play another Call of Duty game again.If you enjoy the growing trend in single player action gaming where player reaction is defined more by responses and key presses irrelevant to the normal mechanics of the game, then you will be at home with Call of Duty: Black Ops.  Otherwise, I would recommend you avoid the game as any interesting narrative is likely to be lost behind the repetition of getting the dance steps right.			"

												This is a really good FPS better than mw2 and mw3 put together for the campaign. Treyarch also did a very good job with the dedicates servers, no hackers/ cheaters etc. so this is the best call of duty game ever and this proves that Treyarch is a lot better than Infinity Ward. The fact that mw2 can be illegally downloaded and played on a list of reverse engineered dedicated servers for free means that modders/hackers can do a better job at cleaning up the mess IW created and do what IW didn't do and fix with their games.

Overall I liked it but definitely a step down from Modern Warfare 2.  The Zombie functions are stupid. As I went along I really liked this story and that is what kept me in it. If they would of had better graphics and sound then it would have been a major step up. Still recommended. How can you step down in garphics in a newer game than MW2?			"

												this game is just the same as every other CoD so here is a recept for apple pie :D enjoy,Pastry2 cups all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon salt 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons shortening 4 to 6 tablespoons cold water Filling1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar 1/4 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon salt 8 cups thinly sliced peeled tart apples (8 medium) 2 tablespoons butter or margarine 1) In medium bowl, mix 2 cups flour and 1 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).2) Gather pastry into a ball. Divide in half; shape into 2 flattened rounds on lightly floured surface. Wrap in plastic wrap; refrigerate about 45 minutes or until dough is firm and cold, yet pliable. This allows the shortening to become slightly firm, which helps make the baked pastry more flaky. If refrigerated longer, let pastry soften slightly before rolling.3) Heat oven to 425°F. With floured rolling pin, roll one pastry round into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly against bottom and side.4) In large bowl, mix sugar, 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, nutmeg and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Stir in apples until well mixed. Spoon into pastry-lined pie plate. Cut butter into small pieces; sprinkle over filling. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1/2 inch from rim of plate.5) Roll other round of pastry into 10-inch round. Fold into fourths and cut slits so steam can escape. Unfold top pastry over filling; trim overhanging edge 1 inch from rim of plate. Fold and roll top edge under lower edge, pressing on rim to seal; flute as desired. Cover edge with 2- to 3-inch strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.6) Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until crust is brown and juice begins to bubble through slits in crust, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Serve warm if desired. "

												Nicely made, certainly one of my favourite CODs. I just really like the style of this game. Although looks come with a cost; the FPS rate is terrible for me (only for multiplayer) and that's because so many people are on their servers (I guess). It's a nice shooter for people looking for one. The campaign is also very nicely designed. Zombies is also a very fun mode to play with your friends, same with multiplayer. Although I kind of perfer the console port better than the PC version. Still a nice shooter. 8/10			"

												The Singleplayer Campaign was pretty interesting. Although the Veteran difficulty in that game was extremely tough, but doable. It is like the hardest difficulty you can possibly play in any call of duty game. The AIs have high accuracy, they see you, they shoot you, you die, reload checkpoint/save. The Zombies game mode was fun, but gets boring even on the new maps. Not many people play black ops zombie, can hardly find anyone in lobbies. 9/10, the difficulty was harsh.			"

												Gameplay 3.5/5Soundtrack 3/5Multiplayer 4/5Characters 5/5Zombie survival 4/5An overall great game. I recommend getting this. Even if you are not into First person shooter games, this is a great start. The single-player is great. It has strong characters and memorable moments. It is set during the cold war and involves an american (alex mason) being interrogated about ""the numbers"" and a russian named ""Dragovich"" who is working with the cubans. The multiplayer is great with balanced weapons, A great set of maps and no sweaty 5 year olds being *****. Unfortunatly people only play the map ""Nuketown"". The other maps are good aswell and there is a large variety, and even more in DLC! The best maps are Cracked, Nuketown, Launch and Jungle. The zombies mode has 3 maps. The first one is ""kino Der Toten"" (german for theater of the dead) which has our 4 main characters (tank dempsey, nikolai belinski, takeo masaki and edward richtofen) fighting zombies after they arrived there from Der Riese (in COD world at war) The second map is called ""Five"". Zombies broke into the pentagon and the 4 characters ( JFK, Fidel castro, Richard nixon and some other guy) have to survive as long as they can. The third map is a suprise (Im not gonna tell you). I highly recommend you get DLC for zombies, Especially the Ressurection DLC because that is all Zombie maps.			"

												2015-04-25 - Someone has wisely chosen to split the campaign game review from criticism of the multi-player game.  They are certainly two completely different games.There is a potentially interesting story here if the decision was made to focus on scripted drama instead of video gameplay, where choice and free-will are the implied drivers of the narrative.  Instead, we are spoonfed gameplay on rails where if you do not follow the lead of the puppeteer, you are, more-or-less, destined to failure and repeating the same scene over and over until you ""get it right"".  This, of course, shatters the immersion and turns an entertaining romp killing ""bad guys"" into a chore as you try to figure out the appropriate stimulus required for the response to move forward.If you are expected to follow a script and did not receive it before the curtains were drawn...well, that is not a recipe for success.The older I get, the more precious my time is.  I have not stopped playing a game for any other reason than lack of focus before I came upon this game.  To be fair, this realization was a cumulative understanding of the series, but the fact remains: this is the first game I uninstalled from my computer with no intention of ever completing that also actually incentivized me from uninstalling the sequel without even playing it.  Tar and feather me if I ever play another Call of Duty game again.If you enjoy the growing trend in single player action gaming where player reaction is defined more by responses and key presses irrelevant to the normal mechanics of the game, then you will be at home with Call of Duty: Black Ops.  Otherwise, I would recommend you avoid the game as any interesting narrative is likely to be lost behind the repetition of getting the dance steps right.			"

												CoD Black Ops is really fun to play! The campaign is really intense, the muliplayer is fun and the zombies are awesome! The zombies mode is fun and exciting. When you buy the game, you get the map 'five' (which is in the pentagon), and a map (my personal favourite) 'kino der toten' which translates to theatre of the dead (the map is located in an abandoned nazi cinema.I'd rate the game: 8.5/10			"

												Having played it on the Xbox 360 for a large amount of time (1000+ hours overall), I would recommend this game to fans of the series as well as someone who is inexperienced with FPS games. Like most games in the CoD series, the game is fairly self explanatory on how to play. The depth however that arises in the balancing of weapons is far greater than most players would think however. Quick Scoping is viable but difficult to perform in comparison to other games, and the assault rifles are fairly balanced for their ranges. While some guns are obviously better than others, it's entirely possible to have fun with every one of them due to the variety in attachments and class system that Black Ops provides. The zombies mode in this game is definitely the best one out of the CoD series since 2015. The sheer amount of content that Treyarch puts into these zombie maps should be a good enough reason to buy them. I remember spending hours and hours doing the easter eggs in order to uncover the plot and bonuses that each zombie map had. Learning the strategies for surviving based on the amount of players you have is also a great experience. The DLC maps provide new zombie maps (as well as some multiplayer maps) that contain new perks, guns/gadgets, easter eggs, and value from the time you will spend playing them.			"

												This game is awesome. The campaign and the zombies are fairly fun but honestly they get boring pretty fast. What I like the most is the online multiplayer. The gameplay is fast paced and competitive. There aren't many active servers nowadays but the few that are offer some real competition. Basically everyone that plays now is an elite killer so noobs will get destroyed. If you want a real challenge, try playing online. It is an experience you will never forget.			"

												Now, this game runs terrible on my PC so I am not reviewing my experience on the PC, but on the Xbox 360. The campaign is one of my favourite Call of Duty Campaigns, other than Modern Warfare 2. The multiplayer is fun to play and the ability to buy the attachments you want for a gun instead of grinding the hell out of it makes the game more enjoyable in some aspects. The vanilla zombies is my favourite Call of Duty Zombies, that I have played, but if it were the zombie mode in general, I pick WAW zombies on the PC because of the endless amount of mods. This is a great Call of Duty. If you are spectacle about it, wait for it to go on sale because the $40 it costs now is a bit much for a 6 year old game.			"

												Beat the game on Hardened in ~7 hours.  Didn't do any achievement hunting, and didn't notice any collectible intelligence tapes until I was about 2/3rds through the game.  4 missions in, I very nearly stopped playing because I wasn't having any fun. I would only recommend this game 1) if it was a deep discount and 2)you really want to be a completionist for the Call of Duty series.The drop off from Infinity Ward to Treyarch is very apparent with this game.(I had just finished Modern Warfare 3 and immediately started playing Black Ops.)Treyarch simply isn't as good as Infinity Ward when it comes to this series.  Their writing and level design are ok, but if you put them into close comparison with IW (again, I literally finished MW3, uninstalled it, installed Black Ops, and started playing it) there are huge gaps.  AI is a great example - with IW, the AI serve to guide your character along, fill in plot points, and generally not get in the way of you having fun.  In Black Ops, the AI basically stands around and say the same 4 or 5 lines over and over (such as Enemy Down. That's a confirmed kill.  You're getting shot up, get to cover.)  What a waste of Ed Harris, Gary Oldman, Ice Cube, and Sam Worthington.AI is monumentally stupid as well - they are completely dependent on your character and will just stand around occasionally shooting until you get far enough ahead that they run up after.  Meanwhile, enemy AI will run right past them and kill you while your squad does nothing.  Enemy AI is almost singularly focused on you.  There was one level ""Khe Sanh"" where marines would be scripted to literally stand in a line at the top of a ridge even though there was a barrier 5 feet to the right.  If you stand near these marines, the enemy from all over the battlefield would take shots at only you, and when they charged right up the hill shooting at you, the marines would stand there.  This behavior was standard - enemies could frequently run right past your squad to melee or shoot you. Level objectives are often unclear - they don't appear on screen and what exactly you need to do isn't always told to you.  The Khe Sanh level is a good example.  You are being overrun by infinite enemies and there are two napalm barrels you need to puncture and knock over for some reason.  There is nothing to tell you that you need to do this (the AI mentiones they haven't been buried yet, but that's it), though sometimes the AI will yell ""We need to improvise, Mason!"".  There are no objective markers on the barrels, no ""target"" floating over them like other levels.  They aren't glowing, and shooting them does nothing (but apparently your knife will punch right through the steel).  You have to get right next to them before the prompt appears for interaction which has your character stab them with your knife and them kick them down the hill.Level design is sparse compared to the IW entries in the COD series.  Lots of small alcoves and staircases that end in closed doors which were purely there to give them a place to spawn enemies to pour out of, but also invisible barriers in tall grass and knee high rocks that you can't scale...hallmarks of level design that doesn't organically guide the player through the game.  In comparison to MW3 where you found that they filled levels with a lot more detail.  There, you can move through a burned out apartment building that actually looks like an apartment building.  Black Ops is very much an On Rails game.The game has many aspects that you'll find familiar in the COD series - controlling a gunship, riding and shooting in vehicles, regenerating health, invisible checkpoints you need to cross to get enemies to stop spawning, planting explosives, and so on.  Some weapons have different types of ammo you can switch between, or different firing modes.  For some reason, they have a crossbow as one of your military-issued weapons.  No idea why except maybe they thought it was cool?  Personally, I'd rather have a scoped dragunov.  You can't say the purpose is to have a silent distance weapon, since you are literally told to use the explosive bolts when you first get it.  Again, give me an M16 with an m203 ""Thumper"" under the barrel instead.The story of this game was interesting, but Treyarch was much more interested in the sci-fi delivery of it than actually telling it.  The premise is that you're being interrogated and are reliving all the missions as memories.  This is a jarring break when you're in the middle of evacuating a base in the middle of enemies and the screen goes to black and you hear the voiceover chime in ""That's how you escaped, but what happened to...."" and you find yourself pulled out of the action.  This is basically makes it a poor version of Assassin's Creed but without any attachment to the character.  The President literally tells you that are ""The Best. Anywhere.""  But I never felt like that in the game's story.  I was an idiot surrounded by bigger idiots.			"

From breath-taking grenade physics to stunning numbers, Black Ops has it all in spades.To call it a videogame is quite frankly an insult to the passionate developers at Infinity Ward for Black Ops is a financial investment into ""fun"". With a campaign and FOV that leaves you dizzy in all the right ways, Call of Duty®: Black Ops throws out the book on traditional first-person shooter mechanics to be later sold as DLC. 8.5/10.

												DISAPOINTED.Well, all the good from Call of Duty series is there but, this game is a tad frenetic and, many times you are doing things without understanding the goals, maybe because audio isn't located to my mother language.Sometimes, the action is so confussing that you have no time even to watch the scenario, you shoot, you are being shot.Missions were more interesting in the early Call of Duty series and, in Modern Warfare.As per the title, I was expecting some kind of mother spy or elite commando doing black operations but, the history is all focussed in the 60's with al lthe topics: vietnam, russians, etc.			"

												Truly one of the last good CoD games. The time that it's set in is great, it's like the perfect mix between legacy military combat and technology. It's a shame that more wasn't done in this cold war era. The zombies was great too, maps like Ascension and Call of the Dead were some of my favorite maps in the whole of the Zombies timeline. They were simple, well designed and the gimmicks and Easter eggs they contained were in-depth and great!The multiplayer also had some quite abstract, but well executed ideas, I liked the currency system first of all, it was different and it gave you a reason to play other than just to level up, you could earn more money which could be spend on new calling cards and attachments for weapons or even just new weapons themselves. Also, if you wanted to, you could try your luck in gambling, interesting game modes like “Gungame” and “One in the Chamber” were a great way to compete to win other people's money, I remember losing like 10,000 points on one of the high stakes modes and I was gutted, I actually cared about it, which is something I can't say for more recent Call of Duty titles, they lack innovation, I mean sure, you can call all of this future jetpack s*** innovation but really all it does is detract from the experience, the future is overdone and boring, I liked playing the campaigns in Call of Duty games because they took you to conflicts that happened in the past and created a story based around said conflicts, when you take things into the future all you do is make it generic and uninteresting. Who cares what happens in some futuristic fictional war that will never happen? I sure don't.In summary, I like Call of Duty: Black Ops because of its use of recent history, you get to see places like Vietnam during the war and I think that's real swell. Also most of the multiplayer maps were based around areas that had seen conflict during the past at some point, which gave it a good historical feeling. I do think that this is the last game so far in the CoD series to do this (I've played every one apart from Ghosts), and I just wish that the devs at Treyarch and IW would take my criticisms into consideration, I know they won't, but it would be really nice to see a return to the basics next time it's CoD season.I'd give this game a 8/10, not that my rating carries any weight or anything, I mean I'm just your standard game player (I'd say gamer but as of late the connotations of the word in the realms of pop culture make me cringe too much to consider myself as a gamer.)Side note: I'm talking mostly from my experiences on the Xbox 360 version of this game, just a heads up in-case there's any inconsistencies in this review. Give us a rate if you enjoyed my insight or whatever.			"
