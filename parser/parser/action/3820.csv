""Listen to them: The children of the night. What music they make!""Dracula (1931)BloodRayne Round 2 - Fight!The Combat-System of Bloodrayne 2 doesn't looks different as BloodRayne 1. Oldschool Hack & Slay and everywhere is blood. You have your typical bladed weapons but unlike part 1 you have only one firearm which has multiple firing modes and thus mimics several weapons. With your harpoon you sometimes have to finish mini-games to get further, by catapult opponents somewhere which can be really annoying. Special skills from part 1 still exist and help you again in the fight against different types of opponents. Unlike part 1 of the BloodRayne-saga, Bloodrayne 2 has some acrobatic parts like Prince of Persia where you jump from pole to pole. The checkpoint-system isn't so annoying as BloodRayne 1. Here you have special checkpoints in every level, so you don't have to repeat the whole level, only the part where you die. The graphic of Bloodrayne 2 looks ok for such a old game, at least better than part 1.To bring it to the point: As cool as BloodRayne. 7,5/10In summary:  Pro Contra   + has still its sexy main character - annoying harpoon mini-game   + Checkpoint-System   + still funny   + still bloody PS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point. I hope it will help you in your decision. "

												The game has a lot of potential and  could've been a gem like Devil May Cry if it was in the hands of a competent team. The game is playable and fun for what it could be, but I just wish Platinum Games could buy the license for this or something and remake it into what it's supposed to be. So play the demo first before getting it. I got it for $2 and it's not a bad price to pay for what you get.The controls are atrocious. It can be really annoying to jump on the platforms and throw enemies at objects at places where the game wants you to open doors and stuff. And most importantly, there is no way to set up a controller with less than 15  buttons (excluding the triggers) to play with this. I used Xpadder to use the triggers as  buttons and not as the z-axis.There's also a lot of bugs that are encountered at a rate of 1-2 per hour of continuous playing. None game-breaking so far; they're just funny. What's wrong with the game:-Animations are just horrible.-Controls.-Blade attacks are slow.-Moves, apart from the feeding fatalities, are so unimaginative.What's good:-Rayne's attitude and the dialogue (not the acting though).-The gothic theme.-Enemies are dismembered as the blades hit them at the right places (happens often).-Blood sucking and its creative fatalities/finishers.Again, it's such a shame that this game can't be remade by a more capable development team. Such a shame.UPDATE after finishing the game:-3-5 game-breaking bugs encountered, as in you have to retry so that you can proceed with the mission.-The gothic theme only lasts for the first mission.

												I had a lot of fun playing through BloodRayne 2. I remember playing the demo in the early 2000s when at the time this was one of the most demanding games on the PC. It was nice to finally play through the game past my memories of the demo stage! Despite being a dated DX8 engine, modders have released an ""HD patch"" for it that lets you set custom resolutions, increasing resolutions of the textures and even installing some HD ones. Besides some minor glitches in widescreen, the game looks great when applied. The gameplay feels very ""2000s action game"" when every game was abusing slow motion with fast-paced action. The vampire twist is what makes it interesting, as your health is solely dictated by drinking the blood of your foes, including all your guns which are ""reloaded"" the same way. The game is very violent, with decapitations, impalement, burning, etc. Story is spoon-fed to you as you go along, with a few pretty FMV sequences thrown in to highlight major plot points. The combat is fairly simplistic, though the developers tried to liven it up by adding a ""combo"" system depending on the sequence of buttons placed in addition to directionals. The game also heavily uses the environment as a means to the combat flow, requiring you to launch enemies into environmental hazards in what otherwise would be endless enemies to progress the game. The game also contains some basic platforming, but nothing overly challenging or frustrating.Difficulty wise, the game is easy, especially once you learn to abuse dodge in combination with your ""blood rage"" which essentially gives you infinite health and damage instead drains your blood rage meter. Replay value is also low with completion of the game just unlocking new costumes for Rayne. The game is by no means amazing and even for its time would be considered a typical action game, though Rayne's character and personality, as well as the gothic and vampire lore is enough for me to give it a recommendation!

												After an agonizing wait BloodRayne 2 has made the move from console to PC and the end results are somewhat of a mixed bag. For those who are out of the loop, BloodRayne is the sexy vampire agent who works for Brimstone Society. Just think Lara Croft with fangs and a sexier wardrobe. BloodRayne 2 wisely adopts the traditional gothic stylings that make vampire lore so cool, taking us well beyond the 1935 WWII setting of the original game. Set in current times or perhaps a near-future, Bloodrayne, being a dhampir (half human, half vampire), is still going strong in a more modern setting.Born of a vampire and a human unholy union, BloodRayne declared war on her evil father Kagan, a Nazi collaborator. With his death, her siblings maintained Kagan's legacy, keeping evil in the family business, which culminates in their greatest scheme of world domination; The Shroud, a massive shield made up of millions of gallons of blood harvested from the homeless.The game opens with the obligatory training level set at a fancy dinner party where Rayne gets to flex her bloodletting skills while wearing the latest in evening gown fashion. Not only does this show off the dynamic cloth modeling, but we also get ample leg and thigh exposure.The console version of BloodRayne 2 had some of the best and most intuitive controls of any action game to date. It took less than an hour to master the controls and you were killing with maximum grace and style. While the PC version offers support for a gamepad, the camera control sucks with only vertical movement. Using a keyboard and mouse restores full camera control and you are free to map the limited controls to any keys you wish, but something just doesn't feel right when playing with a mouse and keyboard, and it certainly doesn't feel right with the gamepad.While not an RPG in any traditional sense, players do get to upgrade their character by finding different weapons like the Carpathian Dragons, which apparently focus vampiric energy into actual deadly projectiles. Unfortunately, these guns don't seem to have much of an affect whatsoever against enemies, so you'll most likely rely on your trusty blades and harpoon for a majority of the fighting.Take a look at the in-game move list and you will see dozens of different combos and moves available to our sexy little Dhampir. But while the list is long, and sports exciting names like Rising Thorn and Sinistral Bloom, in the heat of combat they all sort of look the same after a while, especially when your main tactic against bosses becomes dodge-and-attack, dodge-and-attack, blah-blah-blah. This takes the wind out of the sails of the whole experience system that rewards players with bonuses for especially fancy moves and attacks.Although where you really get some sense of satisfaction is in the finishing moves and fatalities that Rayne dishes out like a heavily armed, psychotic gymnast. And I mean fatalities. There's so much dismemberment happening on a regular basis you start to crave it, which is as disturbing as it is satisfying.As if the hand-to-hand combat weren't interesting enough, Rayne also obtains various dark gifts that give her even more of an edge against her enemies. There's the Blood Fury mode that increases both offensive and defensive powers, a time affecting mode that slows everyone else down while you whip around them like a tweaker with a set of Ginsu knives, a Ghost Feed mode that lets you suck blood from a distance, and a revamped Aura Vision that reveals important hidden portals, even from other rooms and floors. While these modes could've been left out, they do add a nice visual flair that's hard to ignore.Level design is fantastic with plenty of interesting locations full of gothic details and unique designs, many of which are obvious setups for the numerous arena-style battles you will find yourself fighting. There seems to be an abundant source of sharp objects lying around waiting to skewer a vampire.Character designs are excellent with some amazing animation that is fluid and lifelike. Even in death, the rag doll physics are eerily realistic. Special effects are in full use with rich lighting and shadows, reflections, volumetric fogging and plenty of particle effects. Shadows are particularly important since Rayne must avoid direct sunlight on some of the outdoor levels.The music ran from interesting and appropriate to some annoying heavy metal combat music. It's not terrible, but it could have been better. The music that scores the cutscenes was excellent while most of the gameplay soundtrack is forgettable. Sound options allow you to tweak all the various sound levels, so you can tune this out if you want.Sound effects kick ♥♥♥ even though most of the time you will hear the metallic whine of your harpoon followed immediately by the sickly wet crunch of an impaled target or the splatter noise of a dismembered body and the splash of a few gallons of blood as it paints the walls and floors.Speech is phenomenal with great performance by all the leads and most of the supporting cast. There were a few bosses with some B-grade readings, but the banter between Rayne and her handler set the perfect tone for the game.The difficulty is pretty easy for the most part with the only real challenges coming from the sub-bosses and end-level bosses. The game has a tendency to give away a lot of the solutions to the environmental puzzles through cutscenes, so you know you are supposed to toss bad guys into the garbage masher or drop a chunk of wall on them.In the end, BloodRayne 2 provides a viscerally enjoyable experience pretty much from beginning to end. The game certainly has its blemishes, and it's definitely not the deepest or headiest action title you'll ever experience, but underneath those problems is a stylish and gory action game with enough kills and thrills to keep you entertained. If you were a proponent of the original BloodRayne, or if you're even just a fan of good old-fashioned stylish action games, BloodRayne 2 is worth checking out.			"

												More of not quite the same. - The combat is more indepth than BR1 since theres an actual movesets now, with evasive and attack moves aswell as finishers.- You can increase your health and rage (vampire magix) meters by doing environment kills like tossing enemies out of windows, onto spikes, exploding them and other similar fun things.- Weapon system got changed aswell, you dont pick up guns anymore but unlock them and then level them up by usage which means more ""ammo"" and power.- Feeding on enemies doesnt only give health anymore, theres a choice between getting increased rage by doing a finisher or feeding your guns to get ammo back aswell. Its possible to milk an enemy for more than one ""resource"" but youll never get equal shares - draining them for mostly health means less ammo or rage and vice versa, introduces a somewhat tactical elementIt suffers from the same technical problems as BR1 (controller setup, glitches if the systems too fast), can be fixed in the same way tho. Unfortunately it doesnt give a good first impression. The starting cutscenes are obviously the ones with the lower budget and the first/tutorial level is the worst of the game (imo). It gets better quick.			"

												BloodRayne 2. What can I say? Is it old? Yes. Is it a little cheesy at times? Yes. With that being said, it is still one of my favorite games of all time. I still own this game for the original Xbox. Probably one of the best vampire games out even though it is super old. If you like vampires, girl protagonists and violence then this game is for you. I would for sure recommend this game. It's an old game but still is very enjoyable. If I had a complaint about the game it would be the horrid keyboard controls. For me it was pretty much unplayable until I used Pinnacle gamer profiler so I could use my Xbox One controller. After using that program, all is well. Hope this is helpful.			"

												Alright here goes...This was a really antisipated game from the 1st somewhat success first one. In the original you were searching for your vampiric father Kagan who murder you mother and whole family. Now almost 60 years later you're taking out what left of his vampiric family one by one. And it absolutely bloody.Graphics are splended, controls are great and combo moves that you can control via keyboard and mouse or gamepad. And you still have your half vampire powers like Aura vision, Blood Rage, Slow Time etc. On the plus side the story is really well done and co insides with the first game and you get really engrossed in it and there are alot of plot twists and turns in the game. The only downside to it is that it is just the sequel to the first and a third was never put into production due to the fact that for some ridiculous reason Activision had to go ahead and meddle in Majestico's great franchise and sue them for copyright infringement stating that they had the right to the BloodRayne franchise which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I've previously owned both games and on the game manuals I had not once seen any credits mentioning Activision. Pity for Majestico as these 2 games were rewally fun to play. Beside that if you like hack and slash games and endless and senseless gore definitely get this game. It's well worth the money! :)			"

												Bloodrayne 2, is an older game to what i'd normally play. But my penchant for vampires in film and games won out. This game was made before vampires became pansies, and the character player, Rayne, shows this by being what you'd expect. She cuts people apart, and seems to try and appear as sexual as possible.I can't say much for the plot, it's -very- generic, and the environments get old very quickly. The abilites are alot of fun to use, i personally favored those abilites which altered the perception of time. The rank three of such abilites is drastically overpowered, but alot of fun.Enemies serve as healthpacks, Rayne can latch on and drain their blood to heal herself, and she's got a large amount of dodges and flips in her arsenal. You'll never get anything more than guns and blades, but these can be sufficently amusing.The main issue with Bloodrayne 2, is the camerawork. It is TERRIBLE, and can/will get you killed due to some sadistic edge the developers had. My using a 360 control fixed this, but not everyone would have that choice. This game isnt amazing, it's old style generic, and we really lack this kind of game in the current day. It's fun mostly due to nostalgia, and the sensation of playing something different to the standard War FPS.			"

												Prolly my favorite out of the two. It has a better story, better controls (thank god), better graphics and is overall a lot more enjoyable to play. Both are amazing games and you really should play the first, but if you absolutely refuse to play the first you can skip it and not be lost on the story.

												This is one of my favorite series since the first one in 2002, i do prefer this one over the first unlike many players, mainly bc combat got more interesting, you had the finisher combos, about 12 diferent ones, isnt much but enough to spice the gameplay and graphically, the game is more beautifull but also have much more gore that the first.Some of the boss fights are awesome but dont really require much tough to overcome, but still better that some recent games, this isnt a game for all audience, but people that like hack slash games would certenatly find some fun playing this series, and the gothic feeling give a nice touch to the scenery.The only thing i feel the need to point out is, besides some bugs and glitches like instant death without nothing to cause it, sometimes get stuck in scenery after combo, i didnt had any problem playing this games here on steam, not even with my retail version of it, but some users are experiencing some issues like sound and black screen on cutscenes, lack of support for widescreen and newer gamepads.So i really advise you to research a little to see in what configs do this problems arise, if you arent in mood to fix them on case they appear for you, if you dont have any issues with this kind of workaround, here is link that may help you out  (http://www.coopdb.com/modules.php?name=BR2fsaa&op=Download), i definetly recomend this game since there isnt many with this setting and its shame the problems that Magesco had at the time so Terminal Reality wasnt able to make the third installement that was suposed to give some continuation to the Rayne story.

Thus, not recording game time.This is definitively much better than the original BloodRayne. It is the right step of improvement. However, the game has not aged well. Nonetheless, It is still a great game.I would recommend this game to those who like Third Person games in general. I had a great time. P.S. I love the Schoolgirl and Full Armor Costumes.

												great disappointment as compared to bloodrayne 1.main cons:- the game is more of an arcade/platform game rather than action game. 50-60% of the game is jumping, climbing and pulling things with the chain. It's so annoying when you are doing the jump for the 12th time, because you fell down the other 11 times. It's definitely not what it used to be in b1- rayne is half-vampire and yet here she jumps like an ordinary human. So instead of just jumping two floors (like it was usual in b1), you have to do many boring acrobatics - see first point :)- Rayne barely uses normal guns (only some machine guns if encountered on the map). Instead she has some blood guns firing with her blood [sic!]. Why can't she just pick up the guns left by the opponents?- unlimited number of enemies in specific areas due to the fact that in these areas you have to use their bodies to proceed in the game (so why not grant unlimited number of ammo also? wouldn't make any difference to game's realism)- I highly recommended to use a gamepad because unlike in bloodrayne 1 here it's quite hard to play with key+mouse - the storyline is soooo poor, boring and unrelated to story from bloodrayne 1- I'm half way through the game and there are no Nazis ;(to be fair there are some minor pros as well:- more blood spilled as compared to b1- slightly better graphics- more moves and fatalitieshowever, all in all the game is just a time-waster.

Keep in mind that you can target any grunt and toss them around, but only in a general direction, if it lands where you need it or not, that is another thing.Adding to that, a harpoon puzzle on almost every level, some boss section even require you to use the harpoon without explaining it.

												The follow up on the epicness of BloodRayne I is a little saddening for me, theres a lack of the same atmosphere the first game had, but hey we all need to move on.one thing i highly dislike is the constant objectives you need to miracoulesly pull off, such as harpooning an enemy onto a wallmounted rhino head four times to open a door.... *♥♥♥♥ logic*But this game has its own charm, i sadly rushed it with ingame cheats ... i did not have the patience to complete each and everything. so im not going to put a rating on this since i cheated to reach the end.... :(      (8/10 ...... )			"

												The game is very fun and cheesy with some really solid gameplay and voice acting, though the AI can be a little unfair at times. Be wary of playing with a controller, for in my experience the trigger buttons do not work with my Xbox One controller. Recommended for purchase on sale if you enjoy vampires and B-movies. 7.7/10.

												Rayne, a half human, half vampire, is the female protagonist for the sequel of one of the coolest video games with vampires in history. If you played the first Bloodrayne and liked it, you have a pretty accurate idea what this game is about - although there were some slight changes in game mechanics and the story is much different. This is a title a Bloodrayne fan hungry for more probably doesn't want to miss.			"

 We're in the 2000's, a edgy, foul-mouthed half-human/half-vampire  who's been wearing the same clothes for 60 years straight  is looking for her half-siblings for the only purpose to end them   for revenge   but instead gets caught up with a newly created vampiric cult  (made by her siblings! How convenient!)  who's looking to eradicate all humans. Now if this  mildly copied & horrible  description actually got you interested into seeing more, then you certainly want more of the first game. Which it is.Overall standard story, your normal run of the mill humanoid vampire enemies for most of it, hack'n slash your way through a  multitute of  single scenery  within a small city  but not without two handfull of rage-inducing nonsense puzzles,  of course...  All the mindless bore of a bland sequel only you're playing instead of watching. It's a simple easy-to-get-into narrative with an average 8-9 hours of gameplay, a good purchase if you have small amount of free time and/or get it on a sale coupled with the sequel (which also as around 8-9 hours of contents).But is there more? Abdolutely! Instead of improving upon BR:1, they've made it worst by adding the most filler of ''puzzles''. At various points in while playing, you'll get stopped by the game in a room where an obstacle blocks the way to the next area. All of these moments where the game stalls you consist of throwing enemies (that spawns endlessly until your done) at objects blocking your paths, objects mind you, that are laid out in the most nonsensical of ways. And on top of that, the grapling-throwing mechanic has a horrendous semi-automatic aim that makes any of these puzzles a living hell.Besides that... It's pretty much the same as it was before, a neat bloody hack'n slash with slightly better visuals over the first instalement. If you liked the first one, chances are you'll like this one as well, just not as much.			"

												BloodRayne2 is a hack&slash goodness . If you like bloody gore and cuting of limbs of helpless enemies this game has more than several ways to please you. You got to love games where your character feels overpowered .You will have to fight camera angles a little bit . Its one of those limited budget games but I played so many that it is like second nature . Cutscenes do not show up for some people and my controler does not work properly .There are different skills you need to utilizy to find certain objectives but in terms of puzzles there is nothing that stands out as hard or thought provoking .If nothing else this game is held up by Rayne herself with her sexy grabs that are deadly to her enemies and yet may make you a little hot .The story revolves around getting revange which always seems to be a rewarding experience as you will meet and kill those who taunt you . Cutscenes and cinematics are pretty cool and will keep you hooked .There are some strange leveling mechanics that I did no like . You will need to to thraw enemies using hook to level up your life which is odd way to get stronger .Like most games that focus mainly on combat it may get a little boring by the end but this just reminds me the kind of arcade like style where you kill enemies and move to the next area .

												One of best games ever made. Sexy dhampir who cuts into pieces bad guys and does it with style. There is crazy amount of combos, grab executions. Tons of gore, something that modern games no longer offer. The graphic is bit off, but gameplay and fun is what matters. I've spent countless hours playing BloodRayne1 and 2. Recently grabbed them all on sale. Time to play it even more. I highly recommend thia game to everyone who value huge amount of fun and replayability value over graphics , mini-transactions and overpriced dlc's.			"

												I can't recommend this game. First this game has absolutely nothing to do with first Bloodrayne which I like very much and second this game suffers from technical issues. Where I should start? Graphics are good for 2004 but does not fit to game atmosphere, it is too candy. Also game has no widescreen support and has problems with shaders and reflections (I use fairly good graphic card Nvidia GTX 550 Ti FYI). Sound is average overall and also it is problem with environmental positioning (I use ASUS Xonar DGX sound card but I think it is game sound driver fault not sound card). When I played first Bloodrayne I had no problems with sound and used the same sound card. In game there is no such good music like in first Bloodrayne (music in first stage is awful, old Yamaha FM synthesis music for Princess Maker 2 written in MML would better fit, no offence Masahiro, I like your PM2 soundtrack very much). Voice acting and other sounds also does not impress. Worst part of this game is gameplay, in almost all stages enemies are respawning which hinders game very much. Controls and fighting system are also bad, there is many moves but it is hard to learn them and acrobatic elements also are very frustrating. Cup of bitterness exceed terrible physics and ragdolls, worst thing is to aim enemies in various environment elements like fan or fireplace. I don't know what Terminal Reality thought, this game is bad, far worse than first part. No One Lives Forever 2 was much better although also was far worse than original NOLF. If you like first Bloodrayne, better don't buy this game if you did not play it yet. Trust me, you will be disappointed.Fortunately you don't have to play this game to see Bloodrayne model. I found very useful and simple to use program called XNALara Posing Studio and you can find Bloodrayne model for XPS (I like Rayne but not this game).Update: I managed to run PS2 version of this game on PCSX2 emulator (I don't own PS2) using Genesis P58 game controller (PCSX2 does not support mouse) compatible with original PS3 and PC. Game looks worse than PC version but sound is incomparable better (it has good environmental positioning unlike PC version but has problems with sound interpolation if FPS counter drops under 60). Unfortunately game has the same terrible physics and fighting system although with game controller controls are much better. But it does not change fact that I won't recommend this game. Even obscure japanese slashers for PS2 like Onechanbara series (if you like half-naked cute girls fighting with sword I recommend) are much better than Bloodrayne 2.			"

												This was a game which grew on me. The controls and conventions annoyed me initially but once I got the hang of it, it is really a great little game, sort of like Tomb Raider on crack. Once you master the special moves, it is amazing how creative you can get dismembering people.

												I knew nothing of the BloodRayne franchise before buying both BloodRayne 1 and 2.I really liked BloodRayne 1, old but gold. It had its quirks but the bad sides were easily counterbalanced by the good ones.I can't say the same from BloodRayne 2.It gave me cancer. I couldn't find a single positive thing to say, maybe except the graphics were better than the first game.The combat was terrible: the character is not a badass sexy vampire anymore but some kind of weakling that cannot be ♥♥♥♥♥ to hit hard enough to knock back basic enemies as they have no issue unching through your combos to flatten you on the ground.I really felt like I was playing a 8 years old girls trying to fight John Cena.Then comes the throwing/aiming mechanic that is just plain luck-based. Nothing more to add. Just have luck on your side when you need to throw an enemy somewhere particular.It's really sad to see they turned such a good game into a piece of whatever this is. 23/100			"

												Reeks of a bad PC port (though I wasn't expecting much) I played the game originally on PS2 and enjoyed it back when it came out... but it's on my PC. There's no option for a resolution that fits my display without looking stretched (I have a 1920 x 1080 monitor) and when I got into the actual gameplay, my camera was stuck looking at the ceiling and couldn't be adjusted at all. (I was using a wired Xbox 360 controller) I kinda just gave up after that... hence the .2 hrs on record. So in short I recommend the game, however I cannot recommend the port. Uninstalled it for now, don't feel like fighting against a game to get it to work.			"

We've seen vampire theme done before but this game does it well.Hate:-Mechanics and controls. Good luck landing on that platform or sucsessfully grabbing onto the correct pole you wanted to.-Cutscenes don't work, -Had to install a 3rd party fix for the resolution, and cutscene fix-Bit difficult, sometimes you have to kill all the bad guys in a room, sometimes you have to chain grab them to interact with objects.

												On first glance, it looked like a fun game, an upgraded version of the first game. Lots of moves to play with is always nice.But as I play on, weird stuff happen, bugs and glitches everywhere, inconsistent mechanics, weak moves that cant even defeat regular goons. Poor Rayne has suffered much: can't jump as high as the previous game, her blades are weak and can't be upgraded (takes ages to kill regular goons), plus even if she hits first, some goons can fight back and knock Rayne to the ground - with bare fists! Rayne feels really weak in this game. The camera is bad, story is boring and lack direction, pathing is crappy (Rayne keep getting stuck or jerking in stuff), even Laura Bailey sounds bored. She's a great voice actress, and i actually bought this game and Bloodrayne 1 because of her. I don't expect much from old games, but this game is beyond terrible.			"

												I may have given this a yes but honestly this game is crappy port. First of all, the cut scenes don't work. I had to watch them all on youtube. Secondly, the game freezes, constantly. Every time you use the menu, the game freezes and you have to wait. Thankfully, if you wait, the game does go back and doesn't crash as it looks. I restarted the game several times thinking that. I couldn't of beaten the game without using god mode 3 times. Also the puzzles are all the same. You grab people with the chain, and throw them into something. Its cool the first few times, but after awhile, it gets ridiculous. Also the boss fights are a bit lack luster. The guns are absolutely useless because eating people is so much easier and everything requires blood. The worst part is the platforming. The platforming is absolute garbage! It is next to imposable to use it sometimes and it doesn't help your getting shot at while doing it. The pro's to this game? Well, the story is really good and this game has some of the best voice acting for the main character. Also some of the minions have some pretty hilarious dialogue. On a game system, this game was probably great but on computer, it sucks. So, don't play this game here. Heck, Bloodrayne 1 doesn't even work on steam. Still, I enjoyed the game with its problems and I hope the developers make a Bloodrayne 3.			"

												For latest computers, if this game freezes and there aren't videos loading, I recommend to use the FSAA Patch.I always loved the first Bloodrayne game, so I wanted to buy this second title with sales. When I played it, I immediately notice there was an increase on fighting skills and graphics and I appreciated it. I'll list below my thoughts below.PRO:1. New combat skills (blades, kicks and - new - Carpathian Dragon pistols with different projectiles)2. Special attacks and combos3. Better graphics4. Special powers (freeze time, blood fury and more)5. Awesome bosses, except ninjas'AGAINST:1. Compared to the first game, the path is linear and isn't very explorable2. Jump height is reduced and there isn't the awesome mid-air kick - just a little detail XD3. Fighting enemies may be sometimes annoying, expecially if you encounter a large group and you need to use them to destroy machineries to proceed in the levels4. When you're stuck on a level/boss, try to use the harpoon - it may save your life!I would recommend this game for action game lovers and for the fans of Bloodrayne (that's obvious). This game may be more playable with a controller, for the rest HAVE FUN! "

												Kinda meh, imo. Cutscenes are worst than in-game graphics, for some reason. It's fun, but at some point it becomes really hard. Taking the fact that it is really old, and you play it just for the story/ to see how the story unfolds, one would like it to be a bit less difficult. Of course, if you wanna praise yourself as a hardcore gamer, then you'll play it with no problem. If you are a fan of Vampire games, then I recommend this game.			"

												After spending probably an hour trying to make this game playable, it continues to have framerate issues, texture bugs, and some of the cutscenes are still missing, but... This game is just... It's a nostalgia trip back from when vampires were actually creepy, gothic creatures of the night. Lurking in the dark corners of the earth... *wink*, *wink*. However, seeing how this is a 10 year old game, some parts of it don't quite hold up nowadays. In BloodRayne 2, you once again take the role of Rayne, a dhampir set to destroy the rest of her father Kagan's offspring, and her half-siblings, that have formed ""The Cult of Kagan"" and are trying to make it so, that vampires are once and forever able to walk the street during daylight, by using ""The Shroud"", a substance rendering the sun rays harmless to vampires, thus creating a new era of vampiric supremacy in the process.  Combat in BloodRayne 2, as the name suggests, is bloody great fun! You've got Rayne slicing and dicing everyone and everything, with body parts flying everywhere! Besides from the iconic dual blades, Rayne can kick, dodge around, has a pair of blood dragon pistols and poseses an aray of abilities, including drinking the blood of her enemies. Rayne is faced with fighting various enemies. From Marilyn Manson look-alike goons to gone wrong vampire experiments. The controls play well for the most part, they're standard for a third-person hack'n slash game, but some false targeting and the awful camera can at times ruin the experience. The game's atmosphere is at all time complimented by its graphics. After applying the mandatory HD Texture/ Widescreen patch BloodRayne 2 just shines... The varied levels, from a night club to a meatpacking factory, show off the game's artstyle. The simple ragdoll physics and prerendered cutscenes, typical for the time, are also featured.  The soundtrack of the game can be heard throughout the story. It varies from classical piano melodies to 2000s techno music. The different compositions can really set the mood and are reminiscent of the Hitman:Contracts soundtrack. Overall BloodRayne 2, similar to its predecessor, was and still is pretty good for its time. Although it does not completely hold up today, you should still give it a try, just for the memorable concept. However... if you are planning on getting it, expect to have to deal with a handful of problems. BloodRayne 2 has never been meant to be played on newer systems, and not all workaround methods do the proper job of fixing this game! All in all this is still a solid game, deserving of your time! ;)  Why you should play it: 
Unique concept                                     Bloody fun combat                    Nice 2005 gothic vampire setting  Why you should skip it:  Controls/camera don't always function properly  Very problematic on newer systems  Verdict: A solid 7/10 ! :)			"

												One of the best Vampire games I have ever played. Truly a cult-hit phenominon, BloodRayne is one of those series that needs to continue because it's such a fun experience and as many vampire games as there are, even the ones you play as the vamps themselves, it's never truly as much a fun action experience as this.Fun, stylized, graphic-novel styled, sexy, and gratitously violent; BloodRayne 2 is a game for a fan of anything good.Though I do recommend picking up the original game that takes place in WWII instead of 2005.

												Rayne is back, and continues to slice and dice her way into the 21st century. It’s nice to see her again but the experience was rather frustrating.At the ground level BR2 looks a lot better than the first game did, there are major graphical improvements and the game looks quite nice, although you are unable to go above 1600 x 1200 resolution and there are no AA options which detract from the overall experience. When I first played it in 2005 I didn’t care about the AA options or about the resolution cap as I only had a 1280 X 1024 screen.The game play hasn’t really changed very much from the first game. As Rayne you hunt vampires and minions who serve your “father” Kagan and Rayne has been hunting them for a long time. The same dismemberment features from the first game return, and there is a lot more blood and effects as well as new finishers. The game has completely removed all other weapons and now only allows you to use a particular set of bullets that are all blood related and can only be used in a single specific gun. The limited amount of ammo you can carry makes them pretty much useless although they are required for certain boss fights.Although the game is pretty…the grappling hook/grapple shot was obviously not intended for mouse and keyboard. Trying to aim the hook after you have latched onto an enemy is a very tricky process and often results in death. This is especially frustrating when some of the bosses need enemies to be tossed at particular locations in order to damage the boss, and you often have to toss enemies into machines or places in order to proceed in the level (the game doesn’t tell you that you have to throw enemies in there so it can be quite confusing sometimes). You have a rage meter which is necessary to enable the super powers that Rayne gains after defeating enemies. Only a few of them are really useful and the rest can be hard to remember how to use. Defeating enemies helps power her up and increases the life and rage meter allowing you to survive longer. Some of the fights really boil down to just luck and timing.While it is nice to see Rayne again, and there are considerable improvements in the graphics and physics…the camera works against you usually and when you combine that with the poor accuracy of the grappling hook things can get very difficult. Once again the game can be very repetitive so you’d better like cheesy dialogue and listening to the same conversations over and over each time you die. If you loved the first Bloodrayne and desperately want more Rayne then definitely pick this up, but while it has aged fairly well the controls on the PC port have not.Maybe take a look at the PS2 version and see if the handling is any better.So to sum up…more redhead, more blades, more blood, and a really frustrating hook/camera. I suppose it’s also a classic now so If you like vampires and hack and slash check this out when it’s on sale.			"

												I really looked forward to playing this game, but once again an old game gets screwed up by Steam for reasons I don't understand. Based on the research I've done, you're better off buying the game from GoG since they've got an updated version of the game, where Steam has the vanilla version, meaning no patches have been added to the game. I'm highly disappointed because it's a sloppy mistake, and though the game didn't cost much, it's still money being paid for a game that you hope will function.Only one major problem was encountered, and it only happened from time to time: at times when you jump, Rayne gets stuck in the air, and there's no way to get down that I know of, neither can you load the checkpoint from main menu, meaning you'll have to restart the level. This is enough to bring the worst out of someone playing like myself, especially after struggling to defeat the first boss in the first level.In short, don't buy this game if you're in the mood for frustrations. I don't know if this problems applies to every user, but none the less I don't recommend buying this game from Steam.			"

Goods:- It works with Win 7 64bit and X360 Controller, widescreen is supported but stretched a little.- It remains a lot of PS2 era game designs and I found it is still fun to play nowadays. - The character model is well created and so enjoyable to watch it fight. - Some background objects can interactive to perform fatalities.- Rayne has a nice body and she performs bloody fatalies to her rivalsBads:- The X360 controllers LT RT is recognised as Axis instead of button- The default control scheme not optimised and you need to reconfigure it everytime you start the game- The hitting is not ""attached"" to the target and not felt being hitted- The Voice acting is just meh and the sound effects is bad, the explosive sound is awfully loudTotal: 7.5/10			"

												Here it is... my review. Well, I had this game for my old X-Box. Felt I needed to get a copy for my pc for old times sake. Do I like it....kinda. Lets face it for a game like this you need to have a controller. Do I have one... no! Stupid me. There are so many move combo's that it is a real b*$%^ to play on the Pc with a keyboard and mouse. IS it possible... yes. For me not so much. About the game. It's an old X-Box game so keep that in mind (they did release a pc version as well which this must be it). I think if you can bare that in mind when it comes to mechanics and graphics you will probably enjoy this game. There is no complex puzzles here, Some are frustrating to complete yes. If you have a controller that will work with the game it should be a lot of fun in that old hack and slash way. Bottom line... Are you old enough to remember playing BloodRayne? Then you should probably get this. It does bring back some good memorys. Do you love vampire games... then yea I would pick it up cause you will probably enjoy it.Not so sure or don't have a controller.... then you should probably wait for it to go on sale. Just in case you don't like it or cannot do well with the mouse and keyboard.Have fun sucking those goth girls (and for you ladies the goth guys) dry. Oh and you gotta do the finishers before thier dead..... good stuff.			"
