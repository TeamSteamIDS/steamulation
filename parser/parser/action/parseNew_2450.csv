												Bloody Good Time is what I consider one of my (albeit many) guilty pleasures. Do I recommend it? Well... sort of.First and foremost, what all potential buyers need to realize is the game never really finished development, may as well be considered 'dead' in terms of the online play (though there are a few groups that do planned game nights), and is far from perfect.That said, it can be a very enjoyable game to mess around with now and then, as it does have bots for singleplayer experiences. Is it the ultimate in difficult or varied gameplay? Absolutely not. Is it stunningly beautiful with some kind of mind blowing story? Hardly (though I'm quite partial to the graphical style). But CAN YOU HAVE FUN IN A UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT AND EXPERIENCE? YES.I think most folks that bought BGT initially were expecting a much more expanded experience from the developer's previous game: The Ship. However, the development was prematurely ended. They had *no chance* to make this a game that would meet expectations, so complaints about that should be summarily tossed out in my opinion.What the game DID end up providing was a framework that is fun to play, unique to experience, and a base of inspiration for future developers.So here's the low-down:GraphicsPretty good (I'm a huge fan of the style, personally, but I'm kind of weird :P). Nicely stylized and well-themed. Not AAA standard, but who cares about that nonsense.SoundAnother ""pretty good"". Not a lot to say here, as it's a pretty straight forward game that doesn't have a whole lot of chances to show its chops.GameplayI REALLY like the gameplay, and while it could have definitely been expanded upon, the version available isn't all that shabby. There is a good amount of weapon variety, map layouts, environmental traps, game modes, etc. Certainly not infinite potential, but a fair amount (depending on price). The bots aren't exactly the smartest AI in the world, but if you intentionally prevent yourself from exploiting their shortcomings they can be quite fun.DifficultyThis is kind of a toss-up. It really depends on how you play and how much you exploit mechanics that will *never* be fixed. Basically: you can have as much fun as you allow yourself to have... if you get greedy and elitist, you'll find that fun-factor and difficulty plummeting quite quickly.MultiplayerAgain, the game is 'dead'.... but if you have friends at a LAN party or whatever, this can be an absolute blast to play. Just don't expect to find any random pick-up games outside of dedicated Steam Groups that hold organized game nights.Overall I'd say the game is fairly good if you're looking for something new and interesting to mess around with now and then. If you have friends that you can play with, the game can be freakin fantastic.. but bot play will work in the short term (though will definitely get tiring after awhile). But hey, depending on the price it may be worth it for something you can install and play a few hours every now and then (like I do).Is ""The Ship"" better? Yeah, most likely... but BGT is quite a bit different in theme and style, so it's hard to compare. If you want the ultimate in 'murder party' experiences, go with The Ship... if you want a more deathmatch-y, ridiculous setup go with BGT (or just go with both and have all your desires satisfied).This review makes me wish Steam had a ""sort of"" recommendation option, because it really is kind of a 50/50 chance that you'll enjoy it.

												TL;DR:This is a simplified, faster-paced successor to The Ship. If you're not familiar with that, think of it as a cartoony, multiplayer Hitman game for 8 players/bots on small maps. It can be a Bloody Good Time, but unfortunately, it has just 3 maps and suffers from dumb bots, a lack of instructions and some cheap weaponry.Full review:Bloody Good Time is a simplified, faster-paced successor to The Ship, which isn't surprising because it's from the same developer. The meat-and-potatoes of this game is called ""the hunt"", a gamemode requiring you to murder a different target each round, all while avoiding guards, cameras and your own hunter. To do this, you can pick from a large roster of weapons spawned throughout the map, each with a randomly-assigned star value which changes every round. This means you have to pick up new weapons often in order to stay on top of the scoreboard. Whoever has the most stars at the end of 12 rounds wins the game. In addition, you'll find ""murder aids"", which do just what their name implies; they can either be used to assist you in a murder or to defend yourself in a bad situation. There's a glue gun to freeze someone for a few seconds, a holographic decoy to mislead your hunter, even a camera to steal stars. You also have to take care of your ""needs"" - sleeping, pooping and eating, respectively - and if any of these gets too low, it lowers your speed, defense and strength. You're pretty much defenseless while taking care of these needs, but when fully refilled, they give you an added stat boost. There are also traps littered around each map and while difficult to pull off, the reward is high.Your target moves all around the map during the round, indicated on your HUD's mini-map by a red crosshair if they're off-screen or a flashing yellow area if they're in proximity. Each gives you an indication of the area they're in, rather than an exact position. This is another important thing the game fails to explain. Also indicated on the map are weapon spawns with different colors indicating star values, and when one of your needs is low, places to take care of them also pop up there.Every few rounds of ""the hunt"", the director throws in a random mode to mix things up. ""Scene stealer"" grants you stars by holding an award and you're defenseless as the other players try to take it from you. ""Hunt the leader"" pits everyone against the 1st place player in an attempt to level the playing field again. ""Infection"" is like a game of tag where the infected must bump into a clean player to pass on the disease, then avoid the same happening to them. ""Deathmatch"" is a free-for-all - also a gamemode of its own - allowing you kill anyone for stars; just don't get caught by the guards or cameras. Besides ""the hunt"", you have the aforementioned ""deathmatch"" and ""revenge"" gamemodes. Revenge first assigns you a random target, but the more you kill, the more will be pursuing you.The graphics are cartoonish and fitting and the characters, maps and weapons all adhere to that style, which works in BGT's favor. But not all is well in BGT. It took me two sessions to actually enjoy start enjoying it and it seems I'm not alone. It has a ""how to play"" section, but could have really benefitted from a tutorial level. Far too little is explained, resulting in confusion and frustration for new players. It does explain how certain weapons and murder aids are used when you first equip them, but fails to explain things like when it's ok to kill someone in self-defense, which is a massive oversight.The bots are dumb; even when I played on hard difficulty the first time, not really trying to maximize my stars, I ended up beating them by a stretch. The main problem is they seem to pick up whatever weapons they stumble across, not caring about their value. Therefore, this game is best played with friends.But despite that, getting killed by bots often feels unfair, thanks to a plethora of unfair weapons. The bat, frying pan, tazer and more freeze you in place once hit and though they take several hits to kill you, there's no window of opportunity between them for you to retaliate. Bots also activate traps with literally no one in their proximity, ruining your chances to actually make use of them because they need a moment to recharge.The game also suffers from having too many controls and not explaining how useful they are. FYI, you only need shoot, use, draw/holster, switch hotslot, change weapon and change murder aid.I've had a lot of fun with Bloody Good Time, but a fair amount of frustration as well. The lack of maps is a big obstacle to its replayability, but that could have been added as well as some balancing changes. It's too bad Outerlight Ltd went under because both The Ship and BGT did some things very well, pulling off unique, yet flawed visions of multiplayer murder mayhem.			"

Bloody Good Time is a spiritual successor to The Ship. The best way to describe it is as a murder party FPS set at a movie shooting location. There are several game modes (Hunt, Elimination, Deathmatch...), but the goal is always the same in the end: kill the other actors. The player has a vast array of weapons (katana, revolver, exploding remote-controlled mouse, flamethrower...) and tools (gluegun, lullaby sheep...) to help him in this task. However, I think the game really shines when it is played against other human players rather than the AI and unluckily there is almost no one that still plays the game. The game uses the Source engine, so it'll run on most computers. On the other hand, it isn't particularly good looking though the cartoon theme is well done and matches the game's athmosphere. As for the soundtrack, it is decent but forgetable.TL;DR: Buy this game if you enjoyed the Ship and/or if you have friends to play it with. Its humor is greatly decreased when played against AI.If you want to read a more thorough review, check out my blog post[gaming.jlcdk.com].			"

												Do you remember The Ship? A game that put you a cruise with weird owner who started strange competition where people hunted each other? It's practically the same. It just looks like a silly cartoon with stupid weapons and characters. The Ship looked similar but rather serious. This is supposed to be cool. It's a fun game, but has exactly the same mechanics - you have to satisfy your character's needs and you have various weapons that give different amounts of money on kill, so kill your prey, don't get caught (guards/cameras) and don't get hunted. Simple as that. The only problem with this game is just 3 maps (yes, three). It has 5 games modes and what is very important in the light of no human players online - it comes with decent bots. That's it. HF.			"

												A pretty innovative game (although see also The Ship and a couple of others in the same ballpark) that has its flaws, but can be pretty fun once you get the hang of it all. Basically you play an actor that needs to kill the other actors in the movie so you can be the star. Although there are a few game modes, the core is The Hunt - you have one opponent to kill, while someone else is tasked with killing you. So essentially you have a FPS version of Chompy Chomp Chomp and you rush about collecting weapons and items to help you, heading to where your target is on the minimap (or you get regular notifications when they move to a new area of the map), while trying to avoid traps and other people who might be out to kill you themselves.The learning curve is pretty steep - you really need to know the maps intimately, including what each area is called, and what the quickest routes to get there from where you are is (there are usually dozens of routes as there are ladders, stairs, doors, corridors - pretty much every room/area has 4 or 5 ways out, and many have 10 or more. You also need to know where the weapons and traps are and how to use some of the more esoteric weapons like the rat bomb (and when to use it), and how to best use the bonus items which can be game changing when properly applied. Plus you need to know where all the traps are, and critically where they can be triggered from so that you know when it is safe to pass through. And then you need to track which weapons are currently good to use, as well as knowing the ins and outs of the different game modes, which will be switched every few minutes.The weapons are not really balanced, but this is kind of as designed - this is mitigated somewhat by the scoring system - the good weapons usually get enough use they rarely ascend to a being a high scoring weapon after the first round, but in practise getting an easy kill for average score beats a strategy of trying to successfully use every awkward weapon in a cycle as they get to 5*. Another issue is the Blood Money round, which basically scores way to highly, such that most of the rest of the game often becomes a tie breaker between the people that did well in that one round.Once you have the hang of it, and have some friends who also do, things finally click and you will probably start having a Bloody Good Time, but I can see plenty of people deciding that getting to that point isn't worth the payoff, as even then this game is quirky, flawed and not particular well balanced.

												(If my english sucks balls, it is because english isn't my first language)Bloody good time is a FPS game with four diffrent game plays like ""Deathmatch"", ""The Hunt"", ""Revenge"" and ""Elimination"".Players can choose one of the eight available characters like The Surfer, The Beach babe, The Goth, The Bunny girl, The Showgirl, The Clown, The Gambler and The Stoner.You can kill in many diffrent wayss from back stabbing them to flush them into the toilet. There is also traps you can activate when the player is around that spot.You also have to take care of yourself by eating, sleeping and go to the bathroom. If any of these are low, your either having low attack, speed and defense... So take care of yourself!Also be sneaky when you killing your victims, the guards might catch you!-----Alright to my opinion about this game... I really love this game, this has a special place in my game collection and is a very big fan of this game. Biggest problem with this game is, this is an unfinished game. The developer Outherlight was not able to finish it to 100 %, it was expecting to be gore, splashing and probly more levels. Otherlight is faumos by making the game The Ship which is one my favourties too. I know what Outherlight wanted with this game. But they were not able to do it and the company is shut down. Now Ubisoft got to own Bloody good time and do not put any love in this game because they believe this game wont earn anything.I am pretty sure that if this game, got more love, time, make it less glitchy, levels and more challenges, they can earn alot. This game has alot of potential and can be easily a top game.I know many people might wont agree with me but having this point of view of this game and hope for something better in the future. It might sounds impossible, but I believe in this game and always will.			"

												This game is exactly as the title states; it's bloody fun to play. The rules are simple (kill or be killed), and the gameplay is easy to pick up on and fast-paced. There are several game modes with varying levels of difficulty, but I tend to play Deathmatch most often. Basically, you're an out of work movie actor/actress looking for a part in a new film by the hottest horror movie director in Hollywood. This director demands bloodshed with style; he will constantly critique your kills and advise you on your techniques. You can choose to kill any way you want, and whomever you want. However, if you don't pay attention to which murder weapons are considered ""hot"" at that time, you won't earn as many points per kill. Your true goal is to become the director's darling, after all. As far as weapons go, the variety is as fun as playing in a more twisted version of Tom & Jerry: there's anything from katanas, axes, syringes, stun guns, flamethrowers, frying pans and more at your disposal. There's also a multitude of ""murder aids"" (like mines, lures or lullaby-inducing sheep) that can be helpful. The environments themselves can also be used to your advantage, with plenty of creative traps to use on your victims. Another fun mechanic is the fact that you have to pay attention to your current state of energy, hunger and...need to use the bathroom for lack of a better term. It will effect your speed and performance, so be sure to catch up on sleep, eat, or use the toilet when needed...just don't be surprised if someone catches you in a moment of weakness.  From the characters to the settings, the game itself is a parody on the horror genre, and a throwback to all the ultra gory and cheesy b-movies I love. There's nothing deep to this game, nor should there be. It's a guilty pleasure kind of game, satisfying and simple.			"

												If ever a game deserved applause for attempting to do something different with the well-worn ""first person deathmatch"" sub-genre, this would be it.  ATTEMPT being the operative word.     Unless you enjoy being nabbed by security guards every few minutes whilst trying to kill your opponents, this may not be the game for you.  Then again, I'll be the first to admit that I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥at these deathmatch games, so maybe it was just me.     Frustrating, confusing, and not exactly a game which lives up to its name...but at least they didn't just stick a bunch of soldiers or space marines in a war-torn battleground and tell you to plant some flags.Verdict: 4.5/10.

												Why is multi-player dead for this game? It doesn't make sense! It's a Bloody Good Time!Heh heh Get it? Cause it's the name of the game? -_- Fine moving on. You are an actor in a movie but in order to rise to the top, you must kill your target and avoid being killed yourself all the while taking care of your needs. There are guards on the prowl so beware of their watchful eyes. The weapons that are available to you to get the job done are worth varying degrees of stars. The more stars you earn, the faster you rise through the ranks. There are several modes to choose from and a few maps. It has a very simplistic gameplay that you can pick up very easily without knowing exactly what you are doing. All in all, it's a fun game to kill the time with, even if all you're killing is computers. (Because like I said, online multi-player is utterly dead.)			"

There's also a multitude of ""murder aids"" (like mines, lures or lullaby-inducing sheep) that can be helpful. The environments themselves can also be used to your advantage, with plenty of creative traps to use on your victims. Another fun mechanic is the fact that you have to pay attention to your current state of energy, hunger and...need to use the bathroom for lack of a better term. It will effect your speed and performance, so be sure to catch up on sleep, eat, or use the toilet when needed...just don't be surprised if someone catches you in a moment of weakness.  From the characters to the settings, the game itself is a parody on the horror genre, and a throwback to all the ultra gory and cheesy b-movies I love. There's nothing deep to this game, nor should there be. It's a guilty pleasure kind of game, satisfying and simple.			"

												Bloody Good Time isn't an awful game in itself, but the price tag tells most of the story. Bloody Good Time was the result of Ubisoft getting Outerlight (the developers of The Ship, the game this was a spiritual ""successor"" to) to make an Xbox Live Arcade game. There are only 3 maps, it only supports 8 players, and the needs system from The Ship has been reduced to just 3 needs (sleep, food, and bathroom). The maps are pretty good and have more trap variety than The Ship did, and there are more weapons with special functions, but they can't save the game's stripped down nature forever, and if it was any more expensive than $5 there would be no reason to buy it for how long it will entertain you. Shortly after the game's release Ubisoft threw Outerlight out to the wolves, they promptly went out of business, and Ubisoft decided to just steal their Hunt gameplay concept and stick it into Assassin's Creed's multiplayer. Currently The Ship is being revamped into The Ship Remasted by new developers, but really The Ship, Bloody Good Time, and The Ship Remasted are all pretty dead at the moment, with The Ship Remasted having the strongest playercount. When BGT goes on sale it might be worth buying with friends for an afternoon or two of fun, but it's no substitute for what The Ship was or should be now, putting all three games on the list of creative multiplayer concepts that have no players because the mass market would rather play bland war shooters.

												A frantic, frivolous murder-go-round beautifully built on the Source Engine. The unconventional ruleset (kill a single target while fleeing from someone who's hunting you) is an absolutely refreshing, lighthearted alternative from serious shooters. It's also $5. The best value of 2010.			"

												Such an joy to play.The basic premise of the game is centered around the idea that you (tha player) will be controlling any actor from the movie that you like, altho the vast majority of them tend to be pretty generic in it's own sickening way, there are some than can actually get a couple of laughs out of you (such as the clown ironically enough).As you enter to different maps that are diverse and unique you begin realizing that the idea of the game is to murder everybody in different ways in order to get more stars, the stars serve as points, more points, more score, therefore resulting in you, beating all your other opponents.Basically you keep finding weapons around the stage that even tho after a while they may get repetitive they're still fun to use, besides, there are so many of them.There are certain weapons wich cycle as you play the game in real time, What their cycling? You may ask, the level of stars you get when you kill other player with them, again, more stars, better for you.There are also traps wich you can use to even get more points (let's call them points from now on), sadly a lot of the traps don't work nearly as well as some may expect, but it's a minor complain in such an enjoyable game.I must say that i was pleseantly surprised that i enjoyed my time with this game as much as i did, i wasn't expecting it to be a joy. It's like a more complex Team Fortress without really sacrificing much of it's charm. Oh, it has a bunch of options for pc and runs extremely well in case you're asking.			"

												Really a bloody good time. Uses the source engine with have cartoony graphics, like Tf2, but still looks great. I dont know why noone plays this anymore, its really addictive and has all kinds of weapons. Although there is only a couple maps, they are medium-size and the guards may get annoying at some times. I just move around that and hide at a corner and wait for a bot to come my way. At 5 dollars, its really a steal. It couldve been like 10 dollars if there was more players online, but im not whining, and even on most sales, this is usually price-cutted. The metascore shouldve been higher because i have seen worse games at this rating. maybe an 80-89 or even a 90. Truly a hidden gem.			"

Yep, I'm a maniac, I love crude Humore and Violence in videogames.But... this is a sad story for a game.There aren't server in this game. To play with my friends I had to use Hamachi or Tunngle.Why there aren't players?Because They are too busy with their CODs or other commercial Sh*t......very, very sad...8.5/10			"

												Good game. It's like The Ship but with a more cartoon-y look that is beautiful, and the singleplayer is pretty fun with 4 gamemodes, but gets pretty repetitive and boring after a while because of how easy the bots are. You will just keep on winning without any real challenge. The game comes with 8 playable characters and 21 different wepons.The 3 maps that exist are beautiful and limited, but rather big with some areas that the AI pass through every once in a while which kind of makes you fight in certain main areas. The multiplayer is like the singleplayer but with someone there to actually challenge you. I have rarely been experiencing it since there's very very veeeeery few people playing it. You'll be incredibly lucky to find someone on the 2 multiplayer servers. There's always the same gamemode (deathmatch) running on the multiplayer servers, and I don't know if you can change that in any way.If you want my advice on whether or not to buy the game, I'll have to say don't (but if you do do not pay full price, wait till it's on sale) UNLESS you got multiple friends who would like to play it with you, otherwise you will just play it alone, and if you're lucky every once in a while you will find someone who is playing on the multiplayer servers. The game is basically dead and at this moment there are no plans of adding new maps or anything to the game since the company that made the game, which was Outerlight, no longer exists. Hopefully someday the game will be revived because all-in-all the game has great potential and is incredibly fun to play which makes me give it a thumbs up.			"

You can use many weapons, like the knife, fire axe, taser, rocket launcher, and even a laser gun called a ""Rad Gun"". You can even assasinate people! This game, unlike Halo or Call of Duty, has some comedic relief. It is almost like a looney tunes cartoon. Please, make this game popular. Right now, not many people play it. This game is just shoved to the corner in the steam store. You will not regret buying it, though. This game is actually really amazing. Truly a Bloody Good Time.			"

												Summary: A dead multiplayer-only game that isn't worth your money.Sale Price: $2.50Unfortunately, this game isn't really worth reviewing fully. The developer was shut down right after the game was published, and with no ongoing support the online multiplayer hit essentially 0 within a year or two. The simple fact is you can't find a multiplayer game with people playing 95% of the time. You could try joining a server and hope people join, but it really isn't worth your time or money. I would recommend Outerlight's earlier game ""The Ship"" instead.As for the actual game, it's a somewhat simplified and streamlined version of The Ship that is much more frantic and much less about stealth than the earlier game. It's fun to play, but it doesn't make you laugh out loud like The Ship does because it tries too hard to be funny. Still, I would recommend it if people played online.			"

												I got this game a while ago when it was on sale, expecting a few cheap laughs and a bit of a placebo for my dearly departed ""The Ship"" game*. So after a quick download (as it is a rather small file) I was thrown into a pixar-esq world high on the promise of comedic violence...Does it deliver?...kinda...sorta... not reallyThere isnt really a dedicated tutorial, you are left to piece together a basic control scheme through a quick ""loading screen button mapping"" picture and through occasional tool tip pop upsBut even when you get past the awkward controls you find that most of the budget for the game was put into the weapons (that dont come with instructions). There is a good assortment of weaponry ranging from the several generic melee weapons, all the way to the esoteric ""sleep sheep"" (that you will have no idea how to use, or even what it is)There are 3 maps total, and they feel too big... and at the same time too small.They feel far to big to only have 8 people max playing at any one time, and you will find yourself lost pretty easily.But they feel so small because you keep backtracking to the same spots over and over again to spam a deathtrap or to pick up a weapon that doesnt require you to be right next to your victimThe characters are full of life and their own personal charm, with nobody feeling like a reskin or palate swap of another. Thats  a two edged sword as it makes it INCREDIBLY easy to find your prey... but also makes evasion boil down to ""bring bigger weapon against your attacker"" or ""run in hopes of losing them""So between an awkwardly specific cast, confusing weapons and set designs, as well as a totally dead online, I cant in good faith reccomend this game````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````TL:DR VersionDid you like The Ship? If yes, you will probly hate this game, because it is only like its older brother in premise alone. It fails to  make itself memorable, or even enjoyable most if not al lof the timeIf no, then you will still probly hate this game on principal.			"

												This game is bad. I tried to play it with friends, but I couldn't join their server. Then I tried to join a public server with no people on it, and it said the server was full with 152 PEOPLE! HOW DOES THAT EVEN WORK! No body plays this game, not even you can play it.			"

												I recommend this game for any one who is interested in purchasing this. The premise of the game is like a sims game and a free for all game. The sims aspect stems from the fact that you must constantly watch your hunger, sleep and ""peepee"" bar. When even one of these fall short you begin to weaken i.e you dont hit as hard or you are slower. And it's a free for all with 8 different archetype horror movie characters such as the stoner the jock the clown but the characters themselves are just models that do not impact the game in any other way. It is a great game that I recommend, but there are some negatives I wish to point out. The online is kind of dead but there still is a single player mode that is quite fun. My main problem with this game is that there are only three maps with 0% chance to ever have a new one, but that is not to say that they are not fun. FInal rating 8.5/10			"

												Bloody Good Time is a spiritual sequel to The Ship, which I have not played. In this game you're an actor who is cast in 1 out of 3 movies by a director who, in 1998, was charged with killing his actors. The case was dropped because there was no evidence. Present day he goes by Director X and is making 3 movies, as previously mentioned. You can play as 8 different characters, including a Goth, Clown, and Surfer. The story is original, as well as the game. A factor in this game is the meters. There is one for eating, sleeping, and pooping. Yes, pooping. The only complaints I have are there are no servers, and not a lot of maps, which is okay for a $5 game. What would I rate this game? 8/10. Worth playing, but if you don't like comedy and First-Person Shooters, you will hate this game.			"

												For $5 this game is ok. Hunt mode is pretty fun at the first time (hunt your target while beware your hunter), but after that it gets boring. Recommend to buy with friends or else you'll be playing with bots forever because nobody plays the multiplayer. (but if you lucky you'll find 1-2 playing servers with high ping.)			"

												It's FPS multiplayer with a twist: you have to plan your kills and indiscriminate murder doesn't net you the most points. It's all about situational awareness and keeping on the move. It's a fun little game with a great aesthetic and neat play modes. Weapons are a little weird to operate and movement seems a little floaty, but it's still good fun. The AI put up a good fight on Normal. It might take a while to get used to the inventory/weapon switching and unsheathing, but it's worth it.			"

												Another game made by the team that made The Ship.  Very similar.  You either hunt a particular player, or just play deathmatch.  Clever weapons.  Also, you have needs (although less than The Ship) like going to the bathroom, sleeping and eating.  There isn't much community so your options are playing with bots or friends.			"

												I find this game REALLY fun , its basically a re-done version of ""the ship"" its faster paced and has a quik learning curve where you start of just dying a heap untill you get the layout of the maps.. However once you do its really great to play.I do however have one problem with this game ( other than the actresses atire.. ) and that is the lack of maps..  you only get three !! its really upseting as this game is great fun, i havent played enough for it to get boring for me yet which i believe is because i have currently 2 other people to play it with, but if i was playing only single player i think it would get old quik..i have looked around and havent found anything on custom maps other than one half working map..

												The game delivers on its title, or should I say - delivered - for a short period of time after release.  The community died off quickly due to poor developer/publisher support.  The game shipped with only a few maps, which limited the replayability severely.  No future plans are in the works for this title as I believe the developer and publisher have parted ways.There is a single-player mode with decently intelligent bots that can offer you a fun experience.  There are achievements, so you'll probably get in a little extra time obtaining those, as well.  Otherwise, this game could have gone a lot farther with a little more support behind it.  Who doesn't love running around and killing randoms with random weapons?			"

I don't think there's any other game out there where you can kill your opponent by stuffing them down the toilet when they're taking a♥♥♥♥♥♥ There's several different game play types, but the main one is where you're given a person to rub out and there's one person that's trying to kill you, but you don't know who it is.  It seems simple enough, but you also have to take care of eating, resting, and pooping, which all leaves you vulnerable to assassination.			"

												Essentially a sequel to ""The Ship"", it's a fun little diversion; a video game version of the childhood game Assassin. You're given a target, and you're someone else's target. Take out your target with no witnesses, and avoid being murdered yourself; you also need to maintain some Sims-like needs, so you need to keep moving to sustain yourself. It's all-in-all a pretty clever set-up, and a fun change of pace.			"

												A great arcade concept but there are games that do the exact same thing but are more enjoyable with friends such as The Ship. If you do get this game make sure to have a few friends to play with, or solo if you just want easy achievements, and on sale.Kill your friends with a multitude of weapons to pick up while you try to coax your target into a trap or just stalk them until the coast is clear. You can even wait until they need to sleep, eat, or go to the bathroom to make your move. Nothing like killing your adversary while they're on the toilet.There's really no reason you should own this game unless you enjoy multiplayer murder games with a twist.			"

												What the game looks like: Mysterious Director X is collecting fresh faced talent to star in his new movie. He is notorious for going overboard to get the results he wants. You plus 7 other hopeful actors are in the running to get the role of a life-time, if you have what it takes to take on/out the competition. This is the abridged version of what is written on the store page for the game. One of the game's listed key features is , ""Be a deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Flush your enemies in the toilet, crash their heads on their plates when they eat, do whatever it takes to maim and kill other competitors in nasty and unexpected ways! ""After reading all of this plus watching the trailer, I'm stoked. I assume I'm going to be getting a game that's somewhere between The Haunting: Starring Polterguy and Tecmo's Deception. The player must decide the most inventive, zany, creative ways to kill off the competition. You're given the option to use environmental executitions OR just go at them with whatever weapon you find lying around.What the game actually is:The humor and story of the trailer is no where to be found in the beginning ""cut-scene"" as you are treated to a 30 second text and still-image intro. No dialouge yet. It tells a vague story of a director who made movies so graphic that they HAD to be real. Do you want to be a star? This is where I started to get concerned.I'm taken to the main menu, trying to figure out my options as an annoying as F**K voice over spouts taglines on repeat. Think Spider-Man based on the 2000 film ""Did I hurt your tusky wusky"", except more frequently.After messing around with the various game modes in Arcade mode I realize that the game is nothing more than a ""theme shooter"". There is no story mode, no plot or linear gameplay. It's either join a fps server or play fps with bots. The entire ""plot"" is just to flavor the character choices, weapons and stages. It's completely superficial.The ""deceitful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" feature you might be wondering about refers to different traps that populate the level. You literally camp by a button, wait for someone to walk over the ""white X"" on the floor and then activate the trap. That's it.The graphics have a nice style to them and the levels are well designed. However, the music is annoying, the sound effects are obnoxious and every once in a while the ""director"" shouts a stupid catch phrase.I'm sad I'm out $3.24 but I'm thankful I didn't spend any more than that on this empty shell of a game.

												What an awesome idea for a game. You get dropped into a huge location studio littered with potential weapons, traps, and gadgets to play with, and you have to kill your way to the main role of the next film. My favorite mode is Revenge: You have a target, and you must kill them in the most fantastic way possible (ratings for each method change regularly). If you die, your own murderer becomes your new target. It's unique, it's fun even in single player, and it's ONLY FIVE DOLLARS. GO. PLAY. IT.			"

												Okay, good news and bad news time.Bloody Good Time is a fun cheap cartoony multiplayer FPS that while lacking the intregue and tense hunting flair of The Ship (also made by these guys) and the Multiplayer in Assassin's Creed is a genuinely enjoyable game with enough flair and complexity to be worth your time and money.Bad news. The Multiplayer is dead. Literally. There are no dedicated servers, no servers to even speak of actually. If you buy this game, you'll have to play with bots whom are slightly weird in their patterns and lack the complexity that other human players possess. You can still play with your friends though. Also, variety is kind of lacking as the game feels like it could run several game modes for each individual round (a game is about 9 - 18 rounds, mostly of the game mode you chose, broken up with the occasional bonus round). There's no option (or at least I haven't found it yet) that allows for a selective mix. If you don't mind playing with bots and don't feel like picking up The Ship or play Assassin's Creed's Multiplayer mode, here's your poor man (but still enjoyable) alternative.			"

												This game is essentially a slightly more streamlined version of 'The Ship', (and made by the same developer) with a set of distinctive characters as opposed to a much larger variety of 'faceless characters' - and therefore also limiting the disguise options to essentially just changing your player model to that of a different character, for a period of time - and with significantly fewer maps. (Which could actually be a good thing, so you actually wind up learning the locations of things, rather than being clueless the whole time)As for the main addition, there's now another category of items on top of the regular weapons, which are 'Murder Aids', which perform a variety of functions, such as putting your opponents to sleep, or giving you various buffs.However, I haven't yet played this game multiplayer, so I can't comment on that department. Although, I'd be willing to wager that it would be in your best interests to set up games with a group of your friends.			"

												Been with this game since it's inception in 2010 on Xbox 360. Finally transitioned to PC and it's still just as good, way forward ahead now in 2014! This game is fun. It's interesting. It's fresh. Essentially it has a murder-mystery-esqe ""Clue"" feel to it, with it's sneaking around and killing only certain people (in the main gamemode, DM and other gamemodes are also available). The exuberant art design is almost similar to the newest Bioshock (Infinite), but a little more zing to it. It also has over-the-top, British style comedy - i.e. being a pothead stoner, being able to eat food, sleep and take sh*7$ in the game, and even fart on the corpses of people you backstab. With various awesome weapons, from frying pans, sleeping darts, katanas, to .50 cal sniper rifles - the tools are available to you to hunt your prey. This cartoony murder-spree simulator will leave you wanting to come back, even if you play with just bots. 10/10 buy this now.			"

Blood-sporting, explosive, adrenalized shooter with your favorite Clown in the middle. You get it all in this nifty little game. ;)			"

												A truly underrated game! There are several game modes, but the main one is The Hunt. You have a target you must kill, and someone else has YOU as their target. Blend in, act normal, get close to your prey, then STRIKE THEM DOWN! This game also has wacky RPG elements where you have to keep your actor well rested, full, and refreshed by sleeping, eating, and going to the bathroom. While doing these things leave your incredibly vulnerable, they are necessary and reward great buffs! Great variety of weapons, tools, traps, style, and humor. So is it really a Bloody Good Time? Definitely.Just make sure you get some friends to play with you since the online is pretty dead...			"

												It's FPS multiplayer with a twist: you have to plan your kills and indiscriminate murder doesn't net you the most points. It's all about situational awareness and keeping on the move. It's a fun little game with a great aesthetic and neat play modes. Weapons are a little weird to operate and movement seems a little floaty, but it's still good fun. The AI put up a good fight on Normal. It might take a while to get used to the inventory/weapon switching and unsheathing, but it's worth it.			"

												I bought this looking for an FPS that was a bit different and it is a nice twist on the usual shoot everyone as much as possible. Each weapon has a star value that changes though the match and it is the most stars earned rather than most kills. Also some modes have give you one target and you only get stars for killing that target. There are traps and you need to eat sleep and pee, which leaves you vulnerable. Once you get used to it does provide a different and enjoyable gameplay experience. There are only three levels which is a shame but since knowing your way round the weapons and traps is they key to winning this means there is less to learn.			"

												Bloody Good Time is a first person shooter that takes a new and irreverent approach to multiplayer mayhem by putting players on a Hollywood set, where they get to choose their thrill. From a spring-break beach house, to a hotel, players will discover the merciless world of movie studios where anyone can star in a Hollywood blockbuster film as long as they are willing to kill for the role. The game is set up for a max of eight players online or via LAN play, giving it a multiplayer experience like no other.  Gameplay In the game, players can be as devious or ruthless as possible by killing other competitors in nasty and brutal ways. Players can use an arsenal of toon-esque weapons including guns, a frying pan and even an exploding remote-controlled rat to throw the movie set into true mayhem and chaos.Players will be able to choose from a variety of stereotypical B-movie characters, such as the bikini beach babe, the creepy clown, the reject ninja girl or the super jock. Each character is unique enough to not feel as if they are all clones of each other.During gameplay, the players are tasked with killing their ""prey"" without getting caught by the security team.This can be accomplished by multiple means...Ever wanted to ambush someone while they were on the toilet? Well, you can do that!  Using a chainsaw perhaps?In fact, the game encourages you to be as devious and under handed as you can possibly be. Art The art style is very close to another game in the same genre named ""Spy vs Spy"" except here, the style is more anime based.The beach babes and reject ninja girls are beautifully animated, with amazingly funny boob physics and a number of other amusing antics.Bloody Good Time is very cartoony without being super unrealistic, similar to how Team Fortress 2's art style works.  It just adds to the fun of the gameplay. Sound Sound plays less of a roll than in other games of the genre.Apart from the announcer who comes in the form of a movie director, nothing really stands out, apart from the satisfying clang of a frying pan connecting with someone’s head in a dark corner of the movie set…All of the guns have unique sounds and you can easily locate a firefight just by audio queues.Firing a gun can be dangerous as it gives your position away and indicates that there are no security members around. From there, its war! Final verdict: Bloody Good Time is… well… a bloody good time with its cartoony art style, unique concept, unique characters and a bucket of humour thrown in for good measure.It has all the makings of an awesome party game and is a must play with friends.Unfortunately, multiplayer is semi dead as of this review, but I hope a sequel comes out one day.This is a must buy for people who enjoy the “Murder” game mode found in Garry’s Mod, as it is very similar with unique characters with their own reasons for wanting the role. Score:8/10  (Awesome with friends.)  "

												I recommend this game for any one who is interested in purchasing this. The premise of the game is like a sims game and a free for all game. The sims aspect stems from the fact that you must constantly watch your hunger, sleep and ""peepee"" bar. When even one of these fall short you begin to weaken i.e you dont hit as hard or you are slower. And it's a free for all with 8 different archetype horror movie characters such as the stoner the jock the clown but the characters themselves are just models that do not impact the game in any other way. It is a great game that I recommend, but there are some negatives I wish to point out. The online is kind of dead but there still is a single player mode that is quite fun. My main problem with this game is that there are only three maps with 0% chance to ever have a new one, but that is not to say that they are not fun. FInal rating 8.5/10			"

												Bloody it's not, but I sure do have a great time playing it. A nice take on what the sourcemod ""The Ship"" did (and from the same team) that sort of turns multiplayer first person games on their head. You're assigned a specific target, and given a plethora of ways to kill them. You're penalized for killing anyone who isn't your target, and the Sims-like stats that you need to manage, as well as the guards roaming the maps, make this game a very interesting, and fun, use of time.

												""A criminally underrated game. It's kind of hard to describe, but think some weird mix of The Sims and Hitman. More people need to play this game."" - Original ReviewII feel like my original review doesn't do the game justice. This is a marvel of a game, with an iinteresting premise, that keeps things fast, fun and wildly enjoyable with it's many game modes and iuse of a point system. As the follow up game to 'The Ship' by the now defunct studio Outerlight Ltd. , this game improves on it's predecessor in many ways. While the main draw of the game is mostly the same, it's much faster paced now. There is no figuring out who's killing everyone, just who killed you and how can you get the most points for killing them. Do you use a trap? A high rated weapon? It's up to you, across a handfull of maps. Make sure to keep your needs fulfilled though, as you'll need to make sure you eat, rest and use the bathroom. Don't get caught though, as it's the perfect opportunity for your opponents to nab a four star kill!There's not a whole lot I can say about this game that hasn't already been said. Sadly, it's a dead game. It was fairly dead when it released several years ago, and this hasn't improved. It's even more dead than before, actually, as the sole person keeping the online community alive hasn't touched the game in ages. This is in fact, a tragedy. As it's a fantastic multiplayer focused game that deserves so much more than what it got.If anyone does pick this up during a sale, or after reading this review. Feel free to add me on Steam, as I'd love the chance to play this game again!			"

												Pessimo Jogo.3/10.Até valeria a pena comprar se tivesse pessoas jogando pois você consegue se divertir nesse jogo o problema é que não teve nenhuma update desde o seu lançamente(eu pré-comprei ele --"" )e ninguem isso mesmo NINGUEM joga ele os poucos servers que você encontrar ou vai estar vazio ou com bots.

												Should definately try this game super fun for how much it costs. Kinda like a quake arena mixed with comedy. Tons of weapons, and tons of special gadgets an items. Plus there is traps, and your people have needs like bathroom, food, an sleep. Which gives you a perfect opportunity to kill them in even funnier ways.			"

												It's still a good game with a freinds on a LAN especially at a low price; I cannot find people are playing on hosting servers theses days. As a stand alone game with AI's it is still pretty fun. However there is a sever lack of maps, even ""Ship""; a much older game with similar mechanics had more. If someone came out wih a giant labyrinth(esque) free for all like BGT with more weapons and character styles I'd never leave I still love this style game.			"

												I'll start off by simply saying, this game is cheap! At only £3.99 it's a great buy even if it has it's downfalls.Good points - Good and Comedic Idea, Fun Gameplay, Good variety of Weapons to add to your arsenal and good game modes. Oh and of coarse its cheap!Bad Points - Gameplay gets boring and with no story mode your stuck doing the same thing over and over again. With only 3 Maps you will soon get bored. And my final bad point is the Multiplayer, this is what i really bought the game for only to find NOBODY plays the online. Last time i went on 17/02/11 FIVE people were online.Gameplay - 7Audio - 8Graphics - 7Overall - 7.5			"

												I bought this looking for an FPS that was a bit different and it is a nice twist on the usual shoot everyone as much as possible. Each weapon has a star value that changes though the match and it is the most stars earned rather than most kills. Also some modes have give you one target and you only get stars for killing that target. There are traps and you need to eat sleep and pee, which leaves you vulnerable. Once you get used to it does provide a different and enjoyable gameplay experience. There are only three levels which is a shame but since knowing your way round the weapons and traps is they key to winning this means there is less to learn.			"

												I love this game so much but is a HUGE shame that it has gone dead. During the weekend you may find that there are many servers and some mainly full, but if you are living in areas such as UK and Ireland, the servers are mainly active at late hours such as 23:00 GMT. Overall, a fun game which never gets old			"

												This game, by The Ship developer Outerlight, contains all of the strengths of that title and none of its weaknesses.  The only downside is the modest number of maps on offer.  However, due to their size, ingenious design and variety, Bloody Good Time should live up to its moniker.			"
