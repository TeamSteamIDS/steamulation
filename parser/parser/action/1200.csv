												Favorite FPS overall. I still prefer it to Red Orchestra 2. I wouldn’t say it’s popular, but it isn’t completely dead either: there’s at least one active European server that gets full every day. There’s one in the U.S. too. Even the development process isn’t entirely dead. Modders from  The Darkest Hour  team have released a number of major updates in 2016 and will continue the development in 2017.

			Multiplayer Gameplay from Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 and the mod for it, Darkest Hour. I used Fraps. Acer Aspire 5733Z Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit Intel(R) Pentium(R) CPU P6100 @ 2.00GHz (2...		

(video by Joe Smhoe)Pros (compared to RO2)Slower pacing. People don’t tend to run around at breakneck speeds quite as much. Twitch reactions are not as important, and this game is noticeably easier to play for me. Weapon balance. Weapons have a lot more recoil and sway when shooting from standing or crouching position. This means that resting your weapon on random objects for support is very important and players tend to use cover more. Simple bolt-action rifles are incredibly powerful: they do a lot of damage and are significantly more accurate than semi-autos. You can either have good rate of fire or good accuracy (RO2 semi-autos, by contrast, give you both, and an SVT-40 is almost always better than a Mosin). One could argue that this isn’t very realistic, but it makes playing as a rifleman fun, whereas in HoS it can be very hard and frustrating. Or maybe I’m just hopelessly bad at playing rifleman in RO2.No spawning on squad leaders. You have to actually walk or ride from spawn to the capzone. It increases the value of your life and value of life of your enemies. When you kill someone, he’s not going to respawn in vaguely the same place in 10 seconds. You won’t see him again in at least half a minute (or more for large maps). And it helps to avoid the situation where if you spawn on SL, you're likely to immediately die, but if you don’t, you’re not in the capzone, you’re not helping your team cap, you’re not protecting your SL. Survival in situations like these depends largely on luck: if you happen to spawn behind cover, you’re good, but if you spawn in the open where one of the enemy machine gunners can see you, you’re boned and will have to try again. This can be very annoying in RO2. Darkest Hour (a mod) has one of the best spawning mechanics I’ve seen in this type of game: MDVs (Mobile Deploy Vehicles). Basically, an MDV is an APC with a spawn point inside. You can park it anywhere, but it’s bulky and noisy — hiding it behind enemy lines can be tricky. When you spawn in it, you can have a look around and hop out when you think it’s safe-ish. Or, if it clearly isn’t, you can try moving it to a better position. It’s vulnerable to satchels, panzershrecks and whatnot, so the chance to die immediately after spawning is still there, but at least it’s not random and it’s very rare.No stat grinding or unlocks. When you start playing, your weapon is identical to the ones used by players who have played this game for years. They won’t have faster running speed, faster reloads or resistance to suppression. Joining a winning team won’t make you level up faster, and blatant team stacking is fairly rare. Most matches feel more balanced.No UAVs. You can use vegetation and ruined buildings to hide for a long time and nobody’s going to find you unless they see or hear you. Unfortunately, people can still fly around as spectators when they’re waiting in a spawn queue. There’s a mutator that blacks out the screen when the player is dead, but most servers don’t run it nowadays.Plenty of large combined arms maps with open design, including some really huge tank-centric maps. There’s an achievement for destroying a tank at 2000+ meters. And popular servers actually run these: it’s not like Counter-Strike or TF2, where there are thousands of community maps available, but most servers stick to stocks like de_dust2 and cp_dustbowl.Huge variety of weapons and vehicles. You can play as Soviets, Germans, Americans, Brits, Australians, Canadians, Romanians, Italians, Hungarians, Poles and Finns. Some of the vehicles included: BA-64 (aka the clown car), Panzer II Flamm and OT-34 (flamethrower tanks!), ISU-152 (152 mm self-propelled gun), Sturmtiger, Sturer Emil, Marder III Ausf. M, SdKfz 234/2 “Puma”, BMW R71 motorcycle (with or without sidecar), ZiS-3 truck, Willys and Volkswagen Kübelwagen, STZ-5 (although it’s used as an infantry transport) and even a farming tractor. Not to mention a good number of Italian and Hungarian tanks (even World of Tanks doesn’t have these). There are AT and FlaK guns, boats, planes you can paradrop from, mortars you carry around and setup wherever you like. You can also use tanks to transport infantry.Tank crewmen can get out of their vehicles and get back in. It adds immersion, allows you to park your tank in a safe place, get out and gather intel with your binoculars (silhouette of a person with binocs is nowhere near as noticeable as a tank on the horizon). It also makes it possible to bail out and continue fighting on foot or join a different crew when your tank is damaged. Tank crew frantically getting out of a burning tank is something you’ll never see in RO2. Team-tanking is fun and useful, whereas in HoS you’re often better off with bots even if you use voip. It’s just faster to press W and have your tank move forward immediately. In RO:Ost, it is faster to switch to driver and press W too, but you won’t be able to reload the gun at the same time. Or keep an eye on the enemy. So, a fully crewed tank with voice comms is likely to outmaneuver a solo tanker, which isn’t true in RO2.I love the way you have to turn the tank turrets using keyboard, not mouse. Having to control each axis separately is more immersive than just pointing at the target with a mouse cursor. It feels more like turning two separate cranks.Your character won’t give away your position by making random loud remarks while you’re trying to sneak.There are doors you can open and close. Even Wolfenstein 3D had this feature, but RO2 doesn’t. Cons (compared to RO2)
Low population.Automatic weapons arguably have too much recoil and are hard to use.Weaker physics. Bullets and shells don’t penetrate objects. Vehicles can occasionally get stuck on flimsy obstacles like picket fences. Nonadjustable sniper rifle scopes.No squads, no fireteams, no tactical view. You can’t mark enemies on the map.Many of the really cool features are only available in  DH, and most popular servers for this mod are in the U.S. (high pings for players from Asia).Tank interiors are not as detailed, there’s no animation for individual crewmen.No way to kick people out of your tank if you don’t trust them.No Japanese, no maps set in the Pacific, no jungle. No flamethrowers for infantry, swords, booby traps.Every character on your team has the same voice, and the number of lines they can say is very limited.P.S. I’m not saying Red Orchestra 2 is a bad game, it’s definitely worth getting too.			"

												I bought this game the day after it came out, it's one of the best games I ever purchased.  It put you on the frontlines of battles that have been fought in countless other games, and in battles that only existed in history books, in photographs, in survivors stories,  and in the numbers of lives lost. Some of these battles were never put into a game before.The game itself was a huge achievement, and it went on to inspire many successful and fun mods. What more can I say after all these years and fun? Play this game, that's what.			"

												Hands down my favorite first person shooter of all time. Run and gun rambos need not apply. Recoil and ballistics are realistic. Single hits to the chest, neck, or head from rifle caliber weapons almost always result in death unless it just grazes you. Rounds drop over distance and short, controlled bursts are required if you wish to remain on target. There is no magical ammunition pool. If you reload half-way through your magazine all the time then you will have a pouch full of half full mags.You can't run forever. If you sprint for a while your aim will suffer as you gasp heavily until you have caught your breath.  Rest your weapon on your elbows while prone or on a window sill to steady your aim. Accuracy suffers when standing. Its better while crouched and even better while prone or rested on an object. The is no magical zoom button. What you see is what you see unless you have an optic.Theres nothing like having your weapon shot out of your hands as you run to take cover behind some sandbags. Then wondering if you should risk going back to try to retrieve it or wait and try to find a weapon from another fallen soldier.The graphics are dated and the bots are very dumb, but the multiplayer gameplay is still so good it makes up for it. The tank warfare can be fun too but much of my time was spent with my boots on the ground.Steam only shows 41 hours on record for me on this game but I had many hours on this game prior to when steam began tracking game time. So many late nights. The thrill of a short range firefight between 2 rifleman, both run dry and with no time to reload they rush to stab or butt-stroke(lolz) the other. So many great moments with nothing but an M44 in my hands and some panzerfausts I had found laying about as I waited to ambush a passing german tank. I had so much fun playing with the humble bolt action rifles I ended up buying a real M91/30 and M44. I was mighty fond of that lovely SVT40 though......Play this game			"

												Slow-paced realistic tactical shooter with heavily depressive atmosphere and predominantly bolt-action which makes it unique experience.Shooting is the hardest in genre because there is no magic eye with built-in zoom and sway making aiming without stabilizing gun very tricky which is not very realistic but serves the gameplay right.There won't be new RO.

												As it started out as a UT2004 mod, I did play it in early stages. Back in the days of UT2004 I didn't really care too much for the mod because it didn't explain what you are supposed to do. This version is much better while retaining the same feel of the original mod so this version of RO is kind of a small nostalgia trip for me. RO is a WW2 shooter like no other. You capture objectives and or you kill all the enemy forces until they have no more reinforcements. The game is extremely realistic. There's no crosshair and when hip-firing your bullets do not go to the middle of the screen. The gun moves freely in hip-firing. Best way to get accuracy is to aim down the sights. The guns all feel fantastic and the sound design is wonderful (although I can't stand the music). For COD fans, I can't recommend this game because it doesn't suck and it isn't casual. It's pretty hardcore. I love it.			"

												This game is NOT, I repeat - NOT.. dead. The graphics may be old, no where near Ro2 or any other fps out there - but that's not the important factor. In this game, you can immerse yourself fully, and it has that realistic feel to it that cannot be achieved by other games that are this old - and even first person shooters now. There's something special about this game that makes it unique.It's great for those who love WW2 Realistic shooters. There are also mods, such as Dark hour, which people still play - and in those mods you can parachute from a plane and into german territory, or experience D-day as you charge into enemy fire whilst machine gun fire, smoke, explosions and screams surround you. If you're interested in buying this game - do it while it's still on sale! You're our only hope in making this game come back to it's full potential as a multiplayer game and is nothing without great, enthusiastic players. Tell your friends, family or whoever and get playing!As for players, servers are usually packed around 4pm GMT onwards and it rises significantly from there. We hope to see you soon.			"

												The Red Orchestra series is the Best WWII games on the market and Ostfront 41-45 is no exception. You play as a nazi or Russian soldier using authentic weapons and fighting in historic WWII Russian/Polish warzones. If you are new to the series there is a practice mode that helps you get use to the controls and feel for the game, But if you are feeling brave feel free to hop right into multiplayer. The Servers are good though you may have issues finding a good game to join. Overall, A really good FPS. Hope to see you in the warzone. 10/10			"

												Part 1.Super game. The most realistic game of all time, there are shoals of small, but otherwise the game супер.Very much types of guns, tanks etc.The predecessor of Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a modification of Red Orchestra: the Combined Arms for Unreal Tournament 2004, created by enthusiasts, who later organized the company Tripwire Interactive.Modification participated in the contest «Make Something Unreal», conducted by Epic Games, creators of the games «Unreal». Due to the subsequent victory, the command Tripwire Interactive received the prize pool and a license for commercial use of the game engine, Unreal Engine 2.5. Later it was decided to move the modification of the format of individual games, elaborating some elements.The game takes place on the Eastern front during the Second world war and covers the period from 1941 to 1945. The player is given the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of events as for the Red Army and Wehrmacht troops. The game is targeted primarily at the network mode, but there's a single-player game against the bots. Each location (map) is a real historical area.In multiplayer mode, the player can take any direction - both Soviet and German soldiers. In addition, there are several types of slot classes with their own unique capabilities and skills for the use of certain weapons. There is a possibility to manage a real military equipment, such as tanks, mobile artillery, artillery guns, armoured troop carriers.For Red Orchestra was done many custom modifications, such as the sets of cards, a variety of game content or full total conversion.Below is a list of published or under development projects:Carpathian Crosses - focuses on the participation of Romania in the Second world war. No longer supported by developers.Mare Nostrum - focuses on the Mediterranean theater of operations.Darkest Hour: Normandy 1944 - focuses on the capture of Normandy.After-Hourz Community - includes several new vehicles, new tanks and anti-tank weapons.Defence Alliance 2 - ported by the authors of UT2004.Part 2.Red Orchestra concentrates mostly on the multiplayer aspect of the game, although there is a singleplayer ""Practice"" mode available. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 features an advanced ballistics system for both small arms and tank rounds - incorporating bullet drop, flight time, and tanks with more realistic armor properties than most games (featuring: penetration and deflection, in relation to range and projectile trajectory angle). The player's movements are realistically modeled, giving them the ability to lie and move prone, sprint (while standing or crouching) and to deploy machine guns on objects.Red Orchestra is notable for its emphasis on realism in comparison to other World War II-based FPS games. There is no ""crosshair"" for a player to aim with in the middle of their screen; instead, the player must either aim down the three-dimensional iron sights, or aim from the hip using the game's free-aim system. The former requires compensating for the breathing of the character and natural sway from holding the gun, while the latter is much quicker but accurate only at very short range. The player must also keep track of their ammo usage mentally unlike many other FPS games, most of which use an ammunition counter. Additionally, the player's health status is not represented by ""health points"" as many other games use, but by a diagram of the player's body with reddened sections that show where he or she has been wounded; there is no way to recover from wounds, although after a brief period of time, the player will function at 100% again. Receiving wounds will temporarily slow the player down, especially if they receive a wound to the legs or feet; receiving a wound to the hands causes the player to drop their currently held weapon on the ground. Rifles usually kill players in one shot if they connect with the torso or head.Vehicle support is also a prominent feature of the game. The player can operate the combat vehicles as one of the crew members. Most tanks, for example, can accommodate up to three crew members (a driver, a commander and a machine-gunner) to make them fully effective in close city fighting, however it is easy to crew a tank solo and simply switch to different positions as needed. When grouped together in a vehicle, all players in the vehicle receive points for their actions and for the actions of their fellow crew members; for example, if a player is driving a tank and the tank commander destroys an enemy tank, both the player and the commander will receive the appropriate number of points for that kill. When operating a tank solo, the player can only perform one of the roles at a time; this prevents a solo player from being able to fire, move and reload all at the same time (reloading is a task performed by the commander). The game also features artillery support in some maps which can be utilized by both squad leaders and tank commanders.The game received generally favorable reviews from critics. On the review aggregator Game Rankings, the game had an average score of 81% based on 22 reviews. On Metacritic, the game had an average score of 81 out of 100, based on 22 reviews			"

												Late reviewI had played this since release, met alot of people, made alot of friends along the way on servers, even formed a clan with a close friend, and then a realism unit, been to tournaments, realism campaigns, many matches, training, and skirmishes, done alot of editing, even done my own maps, this is a very fun game when it was in its prime, and still is good if your new to it.i would reccomend it, coordinating your efforts on a team is fun, and really adds to the experience.As for the gameplay itself, it has a ton of maps to play on, even alot of custom maps, you can even download maps from here: http://www.red.orchestra.pl/archiwum/plug.php?e=maps&game=redorchestrathey have maps for RO, DH, MN, and CC - Carpathian Crosses.The game is not limited to RO, the are total conversion mods for it, one being very popular and i think still updated is Darkest Hour, its based on the Western theater of the war, so you can expect USA, and British there.MN is Mare Nostrum thats based on the Africa theater, adn Capathian Crosses is the Romanian front.The gameplay overall is fairly realistic, its arcadish in some respects but for realism its first person, there is no crosshairs, the rifles are manual rebolt, and many other things. Alot of fun, I played this game to death and tbh idk I dont have over a 1,000 hrs as much as I played, dont matter, there are some active servers, you can play against the bots, even in practice mode, but server activity against other players vary on time of day so dont expect full servers or active servers 24/7 they are there.

												Red Orchestra is without a doubt the quintessential World War II PC game, one that not only provides a satisfying and authentic shooter experience, but also involves players in the seldom seen part of the war: the horrific and bloody Eastern Front. It has a slower pace than your common shooter; players must plan their shots, take cover when necessary, and use teamwork to successfully capture objectives. The community has been amazing, with modders creating the Western Front (Darkest Hour), the Romanian Front (Carpathian Crosses), and the North African campaign (Mare Nostrum). Red Orchestra II has unfortunately failed to capitalize on the successes of its predecessor, and therefore the original game still remains one of the best World War II games of all time.			"

												First: RO:Ostfront isnt the game everyone likes. Its quite old, so there are just a couple (about 300) people still playing it and because of its age the graphics arent the best too (for me its ok but thats a subjective point). Then its very realistic and slow so you just cant rush somewhere in CoD style, instead you need tactics and a good communication (wich can be a pro argument if you like stuff like this) to make a good round.One of the good points is the atmosphere: especially in the maps of the destroyed germany where the last germans fight for a already lost war, defending the last strongholds eg. the Reichstag, you really can believe how much war sucks, so the game doesnt give the view of a war that is cool and spread with heroism, instead you can die already by 1 shot. Another good thing for me is that there are no perks or sth like that, so the enemy is always totaly equal to you, you will survive or die because the you or the enemy just was BETTER in shooting and not because he hacked or payed allot of bucks to get benefits. So Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a very special game which the ones like and the ohers dont. If you want to play fast game where you can rush all the time this game wont be the right game for you. If you instead are interested of a very realistic WW2 shooter and shouldnt be interested of RO2 or just want to chekc out the first game of the RO serie, this game can be really funpros:-athmosphere-allot of weapons-giant maps with epic tankbattlesneutral (you can decide for yourself if its a pro or a con):-no perks-very realistic-hard recoil for all weapons-you nearly always die after 1 hit- very slow gameplaycons:- low graphics- small community			"

												What sets this apart from other multiplayer co-op first person shooters? A strong emphasis on realism and historical accuracy. The closest comparison to this game might be Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but Team Fortress and Counterstrike are in the same genre. Basically you've got two teams and you've got to attack/defend various objectives within a time limit. But those other games are far more forgiving; if you get shot you can just use a medkit, if you get a baddie in your crosshairs just pull the trigger.Well, in Red Orchestra there are no crosshairs for most guns, and there is no health regeneration. If you get shot even once you're probably dead. Expect to die a lot in this game. Fortunately the respawn times are short!Other realistic aspects include significant recoil and reload times for most guns. In Team Fortress you'll be spraying bullets everywhere without worrying about aiming or ammo. In Red Orchestra you've got to make every bullet count, because there's no auto-aim and ammo is limited. Even if you end up with a machine gun you'll get much better results firing short controlled bursts rather than spraying bullets everywhere. Realists rejoice!There's a large number of maps to choose from, all of which are based on or at least inspired by real World War 2 battles between the Germans and Soviets. A great amount of work went into making sure the uniforms and equipment were historically accurate, and even that the interiors of the tanks looked realistic.TANKS! Yes, there's more tanks than you can shake a stick at in this game. Tanks are very hard to destroy and can easily mow down waves of attacking infantry, but they are not invincible. On many maps the gameplay will involve trying to destroy the other team's tanks, or getting your own tanks to the objective. Tank armor is strongest in front, weaker on the sides, and weakest in the rear. So a lot of tank battles involve trying to sneak up on enemy tanks from the sides or rear. It helps that tank crews have a restricted field of view, so it's easier than you might think to ambush them!There are some other vehicles too but they are mostly transports with a secondary anti-infantry role. The realism may put off some players. As a WW2 history buff I know that a Tiger tank is much better than a Panzer III tank, but a casual gamer offered the choice of getting into one tank or another couldn't be expected to know that. The fact that there are so many tanks and they mostly look alike compounds the problem, although it is realistic. Did I mention this game is complicated? There's a key to fix a bayonet to your rifle, a key to change the barrel of your machine gun if it overheats, a key to pop open the hatch of your tank to get a better field of view...need I go on? Expect a steep learning curve.My main complaint is that teams can become unbalanced rather easily. A game with 8 players vs 6 will see the smaller team struggling to survive. I guess I got spoiled by the auto team-balancing mechanic of ET:QW and TF; I just always assumed a game in this genre would have it. On some servers bots can be substituted for people to balance teams, but bots are a bit of a wild card. They can be awesome marksmen as infantry, but they're hopeless when driving any kind of vehicle.There is no single player component. The soundtrack is appropriate and non-intrusive. I got this game practically for free in a sale; buy it if it's $5 or less.If you're a World War 2 history buff or you liked Enemy Territory: Quake Wars then you'll like Red Orchestra. "

												Online WW2 shooter with vehicles to drive and much emphasis on teamwork. In other words... a niche game for groups of people to play together and kick the crap out of the noobs and the disorganized. But people do still play this, believe it or not. It is a pretty decent game. Just be prepared to die horribly alot if you decide to join in this late after its release. :o			"

												The best multiplayer WWII ground warfare simulation made so far on this planet. (50 player max)Yes, it's that good. No, it's not perfect either but its' superb qualities more than make up for the small irritations likethe occasional unrealistic ballistics or the slight lag when wanting to fire and there is a lot going on around you.It has the perfect balance between realism and fun. You'll be shouting all kinds of insults and other stuff at the screen in no time.  Red Orchestra 2 is a depressing mess compared to this stunning game. Tripwire tripped over and fell flat on their faces when they chose to upgrade the graphics instead of improving the interactions with the environment and correcting the few bugs that still exist. Nevermind, we can still enjoy this somewhat dated but brilliant east front sim on mostly russian servers in the evenings. Maybe RO3 will see better sense from Tripwire and less greedy pandering to the COD crowd.			"

												I waited a week or so to get this, as my graphics card is a little too old to run the second. And let me tell you what, that week or so was well worth it. For a eight year old game, this is one of the best shooters i've ever played. Aiming down the sights is a must, rifles have to be re-bolted after every shot, a few bullets can kill etc. Tanks feel very natural as well, you're either a driver, gunner, or a machine gunner, there's no be all end all position in said tanks. The driver and gunner have to work in perfect unison to survive against another tank and reloading times can be a killer. The maps are big, without feeling too oversized. I've yet to play the Darkest Hour modification but am downloading it at this moment. If you can't run the second, or missed out on the free day I highly reccomend spending the 10 bucks on this. Even if the servers aren't as populated, graphics a tad out dated and some other very minor things, you won't be dissapointed.			"

												I had so much fun on this game. Despite the muddy graphics and awkward cover taking it's a really good game. Playing Red Orchestra 2 just isn't the same. The original was simple to pick up and a lot of the tactical stuff came from the players. In Red Orchestra 2 a lot of that felt like it was put in for the sake of it.I have fond memories of this game even when I picked it up years after everyone else. Throwing a grenade into a half track and seeing the notice board display your five kills in a row was amazing. It's a pity Tripwire didn't just tweak this game for its sequel. Instead they added a cover system that no one asked for and a new tank model every few months.If you think you can live with a community of about 148 players at any given time buy this game			"

												This game is definitely fun and at times even moreso than the new one. It certainly has shown its age, but if you can look past that, it has infinitely more content than Heroes of Stalingrad. The problem is simply finding servers with people to play with. Gameplay is definitely less streamlined, but there are much more actions, guns, tanks, and maps. It's also much more unforgiving than the sequel. If you're looking for a tactical shooter with a ton of features and are willing to take the time to find a full server then you should buy this.

												You sick of those fancy Modern/Advanced warfare ♥♥♥♥?Buy a Red Orchestra!!! Realistic combat mechanics :Your speed depends on Type of weapon you are using AND on number of magazines you are carring. Yup you heard right in this game ammo is counted is Mags that puts you into dilema :You just killed a guy and you mag is halfway empty. Reload and have no more spare Mags but be on safe-side in terms of running outta ammo in middle of firefight, or pray for the best and dont mind reloading. That will be your main though ingame. Hud is minimalistic, you see only Mags left, no ammo counter. Community in this game is really good but prepare to get rekt over 9000 Times before you master movement, and tactics in this game. Overall game is for People who like slow but tactics paced combat and Realistic game mechanics. Oh and game is likely to dont open again after closing it, but that just requires deleting one file in game folder, even game launcher in case of that error will tell you to do so, as far as i know that problem is Windows 8/8.1/10 only.Overall: 9/10 "

												Red Orchestra is notable for its emphasis on realism in comparison to other World War II-based FPS games. The game takes place on the Eastern Front of World War II and covers the period from 1941 to 1945. The player is given the opportunity to participate in the reconstruction of events in the Red Army and also for the Wehrmacht. The game is targeted primarily at the network mode, but there is a single-player game against bots. Each location (map) is a really existing historic district. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 features an advanced ballistics system for both small arms and tank rounds - incorporating bullet drop, flight time, and tanks with more realistic armor properties than most games (featuring: penetration and deflection, in relation to range and projectile trajectory angle).

You won't get a whole lot of physics so often tanks can get stuck on tree stumps, models look a tad blocky (not much though) and the multiplayer servers only have dedicated groups, bots, and modders.Still, if you yearn for a WWII experience that feels legit, Red Orchestra delivers...with 2 free mods that give you a total of 3 theatres of war nonetheless.

Never before in an  FPS has surpressing fire worked so well. The sound in this game is unreal! When you are being shot at it really sounds like bullets are flying right past your head. Which leads me onto the next point. Imersion. I before said the graphics were dated but the little effects are SOOOO good. When shot at the tracer efects and dust kicked up is soo cool.

												Starting as a mod Red Orchestra won the contest at Moddb.com and won a license for their engine, which is what you see in the retail version. It has been significantly improved over the years, the bugs were ironed out and new maps came, and occasionally are still delivered by the community. There aren't many players yet the battles can reach an epic scale of a maximum of 50 soldiers per map. It's a game thar needs more time investment then Call of Duty or Battlefield in order to learn all of it's mechanics. The maps are huge in comparisson to Battlefield(not as huge as ArmA's or Operation Flashpoint - that's a nigtmare). Oftenly you'll be running to the control point for 10 minutes just to be pinned down by some sniper hiding in the woods or a building, whatever you prefer. There are also vehicles in the game which are most effective when teamwork and trust between the crewmembers is applied(yes you need more people to drive and shoot at the same time). PC gaming is changing with RO.			"

												Red Orchestra: Ostfront is one of the hidden gems of the FPS world. I'm not sure why Steam says I only played 65 hours. It was much more than that.Combining realistic tank and infantry combat into a seamless experience (though some maps are tank- or infantry-only), this game delivers a realistic WW2 immersion that the CoD and BF series only dream of. Major pros:-Realistic weaponry, human and tank damage models-Team-based tactics; no lone-wolf BS-Historical maps-You can hip-shoot a freaking MG-42 (but unless you're Audie Murphy, I wouldn't advise it)-Tank projectile physics are fairly realistic (e.g., shells deflect at high incidence angles)-Lots of types of tanks to drive-You can call artillery support (and not just for getting a certain amount of kills), though the mark has to be in a good spot to be effective!Cons:-Probably the only major con is the lack of a single player campaign. The AI is so terrible, that laying the maps in single-player is really boring and pointless. However, this game from the start was always meant to be multiplayer. And in that regard, it delivers in spades. -Certainly not a deal-breaker, but compared to CoD2, which came out around a similar time, the character and vehicle animations are rather robotic and artificial-No Tiger IIB-Really nothing else "

He got trapped on a bridge which I foolishly joined him on. Panzer IV rolled up and we start yelling and praying for my AT gun to kill the tank. Tank explodes and we win the match. We both had to leave for a second after that.41/45Would ♥♥♥♥ myself again.			"

												A really good WW2 sim, with realistic bullet physics like drop and breathing, with you being able to mount or brace a weapon against walls , or mount machineguns or anti-Tank rifles. There is a large selection of maps by default, with great mod support with new theatres other than the Eastern Front, like Crete and North Africa in Mare Nostrum or Normandy, the Ardennes and France in Darkest Hour. The graphics are dated and the standard Multiplayer is dead as disco. However the game has bots and LAN games, just dont expect 64 people per server. There is a large selection of weapons depending on the date of the map you are playing on, ranging from bolt action rifles like the Kar-98 and Mosin Nagant, to rare protype weapons such as the G41 semi-automatic rifle (Replaced by the G43 in later maps.) The tanks have multiple round types, and sloped front or turret armor can cause tank rounds to ricochet, so plenty of practice is needed to command a tank and its crew. Many tank/transport models appear in the game like the German Panzer IV, Tiger, SDKFZ 250/1 Half track, as well as Soviet tanks like the KV1 and T34/75.			"

												Brilliant. Obviously not as sophisticated as its astounding younger brother, Red Orchestra 2, however, Ostfront is still an exceptionally exciting multiplayer shooter. Incredibly captures the atmosphere of Eastern Front of World War II combat especially in its visual portrayal of half-destroyed urban environments such as Stalingrad. The emphasis of the fighting gameplay is rooted in gritty, challenging, tense realism rather than the flashy superficial blandness of so many recent and better-known military shooters. Although there aren't many servers on Steam with a high number of only human players as opposed to bots, the ones that exist will provide you a gripping multiplayer battle experience. One of the best, most innovative games ever made.			"

												The other reviews are right, the multiplayer is dead, I thought maybe there'd be a group of faithful players I could get in with but, alas there is none.  I've only found bots on servers so far , no real people. I didnt play this game in its hayday so I really cant give you a accurate decription but I still see traces of its fading glory. I will say its incredibly lonely/ depressing to join a server with only a few bots on it. The game was ment to have 64 players on each made and now theres only 20 bots bumbling around and driving their tanks into random spots. I cant find it in my heart to give this old war dog a bad review.  ""WW2 games dont die, they just fade away""- General MacArthur.The graphics arent amazing, there just okay but your proably not playing a red orchestra for that reason.I havent delved too deep into the game as of yet but the mods look promisingI'd recomend this if your a WW2 History buff or want to see what the seris was originaly like.Its not a bad game.Edit: As for the Mods....Mare Nostrum is very cool has alot of good maps but is completely dead, only 1 server up and there hasnt been anyone on it when ever I check.Darkest Hour--- Has alot of promise still in it. The 29th infantry's server is almost always active, so you can join a good game there. It has more features than the regular game or Mare Nostrum as well. Its alot of fun and very immersive IF you can find a good game. Would recommend.Overall I'm not sure if I'd recomend getting this game, its mostly dead. Darkest Hour is alot of fun and theres still a group of faithfuls playing it. Its up to you, if you like WW2 and tough war games get it on sale but know there isnt enough servers for you to join at anytime into a good game, its in a constant state of flux.			"

												If you like World War 2 first person shooter PVP simulations, this is a good game to get.  This game is more on the realistic side of WW2 combat games, but using location capture and ticket loss.   Although the graphics are outdated, still a good game.  The problem is the player community is low, and not many servers active now.  It is popular in Europe still.You will be using authenically modeled weapons with iron sights. There are no crosshairs, hard to tell friend from foe and has friendly fire.  Has a compass, ammo and body status on UI,  has fatigue that limits movement , and has no healing.  Some infantry classes are Limited in number, while plenty of soldiers with bolt action rifles available.  Has artillery strikes called in by a radio located at major bases. You can drive a tank solo by jumping between crew stations.  But if driving a tank with AI bots onboard, the bots get in the way, when in tanks.  Tanks are modeled as close to real thing as you can get in a video game. There are more tank models available to drive on some maps or mods. If you are playing with bots on server, they are stupid.  Cannot order the bots around either.Also download the Darkest Hour, Mare Nostrum, Real Panzer mods to this game for more Red Orchestra goodness.  The modding community has made more maps for this game.Does have Steam Achievements but you can only do them on a Stats Enabled server with more than 15 player.  Has badge trading cards.Needs more people playing and more servers hosted.for more info:

What makes this game for me ..........when you hear the crack and thump of a rifle bullet whizzing past as you run across open ground.Diving into tall grass as a rifleman and crawling towards a enemy machine gun with the constant fear of him locating you.The unmistakable whine of a enemy tanks turret traversing as you rush up behind it.The team work as you and another player fire and move towards a enemy trench.The feeling you get when you hit an enemy with iron sights from a great distance with a bolt action rifle.Overall an amazing Game definatley recommend it!!!!!

												   Ooooohhh, I like this game.  This is the first ""on line"" game I ever played, and I LOVE it.  It was straight forward and intuitive as far as getting online and It's easy to learn the mechanics of play once you are in the game.  Great Mods and really great maps and weapons.  Don't bother me with tons of customizing because in this game it isn't needed, The uniforms and guns are perfect as they are.  I especially appreciate the realism  - you can die from one bullet,  cover can be everylthing, tactics matter and working as a team helps.  The graphics are very good - I run on ultra settings and it looks great and I have experienced no glitches.  I really have NO CONS - not that it is perfect, but I can't find any major problems.  I have always been able to get online and in to a game - If you like first person shooters or war games  - BUY THIS _ I paid full price and am absolutely satisfied with this game.			"

												This is the first in the Red orchestra series, it’s a realistic classed based military shooter. This is set on the eastern front where the Germans are fighting the Russians. There is only one game mode, where you have to capture all of the points of the map or drain the other team's respawn tickets, most of the maps are massive in size, and you also get quite a few vehicles. In red orchestra: You can only take about 1-4 hits before dying, You have no crosshair with a free aim system, The weapons have quite a bit of recoil which can be counter acted by firing with control or crouching and lying on the floor, Machineguns pretty much have to be fired from using the bipod, you can replace the barrels when they get too hot, you can fire from the hip but you move really slowly and the recoil is ridiculous,You can run while crouching, And you have very little HUD and hints telling you what to do.This is a really good hard-core multiplayer fps which you should get if you like this kind of gameplay.

												This as a great game, old, but still a great game. The graphics are not exactly ""new and improved"", but the action is still good, realistic and intense. The tank combat is fairly realistic (with the exception that some times you can have one man operating the whole tank) but aside from that, it requires cooperation and skill. The infantry combat is realistic, requiring one to move up with artillery and smoke support. Guns are realistic (except they dont jam) and the fact you can swap for your dead enemies weapon is really cool. It fairly depects the weapons and quantity of them during this time and error (meaning everyone cant play as a squad leader with a MG-42 and semiautomatic pistol) This game is not for everyone though. If you cant wrap your head around the idea that this is not a shoot'em up game and there is no cross-hairs, then this is not for you. For the rest of us though, if you enjoy WWII shooters this is definately one game you will want to add to your collection (and maybe for you Brits, its expansion Darkest Hour)....2 thumbs up!			"

												NOTE:*****At the time of this review, this game is dead or dying in terms of its playerbase, buy at your own risk.*****June 22, 1941. Breaking his nonaggression pact with Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union and begins one of the longest and most brutal campaigns in modern military history. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 masterfully captures this front of the second world war like no other game to date. Red Orchestra is a realistic, team based, multiplayer first person shooter. It is not a simulator like the ARMA series, but is still a game that must played with the upmost seriousness. The game places you into the boots of a soldier in the Soviet Red Army or in the German Ostheer and allows you to assume the different roles of infantry or armored vehicle crewmen. Players can assume a variety of roles from riflemen, assault troopers, and tank crewman to snipers, sappers, tank hunters and tank commanders. Some roles are leadership roles, with the purpose of guiding and ordering your teammates to victory like squad leaders and tank commanders, with the ability to call in support, like devastating artillery strikes. Combat is realistic, tough, and gruesome. Every mistake is punished by death. Infantry must work together, take cover, and use real world tactics, with different roles coordinating with each other to achieve victory. Vehicle crews must also communicate and coordinate if they are to survive, let alone win, whether it's in an APC transporting troops to the frontlines or engaging enemy tanks as a gunner in your own tank. Fight several battles in historical locations all over the eastern front from the earlier days of the onslaught with the victories of the Germans to the final days of the Third Reich, with the Soviets in the heart of Berlin, with several weapons fully realized and vehicles with realistic handling and mechanics. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is one of the most terrifying, realistic, authentic, and greatest multiplayer shooters of all time. A complete masterpiece.			"

												Great and realistic fps set in ww2 times featuring the russians and germans, weapons do high amounts of damage, have high recoil when firing standing up against no cover, and teamwork is absolutely essential, many different classes such as artillery operator,rifleman,tank commander. Great buy if you're a ww2 junkie.			"

												Honestly tripwire should have made Red Orchestra 2 just a better graphics version of this, but no they had to focus on specific battles and make new games instead of modifying RO2 when it came out, lazy. It would be great to once again have an Eastern front shooter with all the mods, variety and vehicles this game had. They had T-34s captured by Axis, they had foreign SS division mods, Axis weapon mods, Allies truck transport mods, bike mods, wide range of vehicles and had great mods for Western and African fronts. If I remember correctly the Western Front version and some moded Eastern front ones had Tiger II even. The new version has literally only 6 Eastern front vehicles like WTF			"

												While it may not be the easiest game to pick up, Red Orchestra is one of the most visceral, challenging, and fully skill-driven, yet at the same time still fun FPS's on the market. The emphasis on being as realistic as possible (eg. free-aim while not using the sights, no regenerating health and high damage weaponry, and minimalistic HUD) while still retaining the action of some of the biggest AAA titles makes this one easily worth grabbing for any FPS fan.

												If you want a realism game set in World War Two then look no further than Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45. This is not your average Call of Duty or Day of Defeat. It retains the realism while still having fast paced combat and maps. Another interesting aspect is the setting. The game takes place on the Eastern Front with the Soviets fighting off the Germans while featuring authentic German and Russian weaponry from their aesthetic looks, ballistics, modeling, and realistic 3 dimensional sights ranging from your basic iron sights to telescopic sights on sniper rifles and tanks. Even the uniforms of both belligerents are modeled realistically.			"

												The best and most realistic WW2 multiplayer shooter ever.The Tank battles are awesome though there are not many playing this game today.Not recommended for all those who are seeking for a fast paced cod like experience.But if you spend some time to get into it rewards you with a realistic battlefield experience.The only downside is like i mentioned before the lack of server and players though there are still some people playing this these days.two thumbs up !

												A True war action, set in theme of WW2. Not CoD, or BF style. Just you, your rifle and your life in your hands. One shot and you are possibly dead. You've spotted tank? You are possibly dead. You rush enemy's trenches? You are possibly dead. You found good place to hold defence? A random grenade can ruin everything. A game where it is EXTREMELY hard to survive, but in fact it shows you the realities of war. Feel what your relatives, participated in WW2, felt. Also with RO1 it comes mod about US vs Germany and I also found moddb page about African warfront. So by purchasing this game you actually purchase full war story of the WW2. Thanks for attention.

												This is perhaps the grittiest and hardest World War 2 game you can find. Period. The system and mechanics is slower paced, but brings back the authenticity of what war really is. There aren't magnificent explosions and scenery, but a dark world torn by war.Mechanics like covering and deploying weapons, bullets ricocheting (and potentially killling you!), limited ammo, and target-sensitive hitboxes makes this a shooter that provides the most authentic game of World War 2, or at least for its time.

												This game is HARD.If you want realistic eastern-front WW II action, this is your game. No artificial zoom in on iron sights, no med packs, no mercy. EVERYTHING will kill you. Get shot in the arm? Hope you weren't planning to shoot a rifle. Shot in the legs? No more walking. Caught crossing in front of a tank with your tank's side exposed? BBQ tonight! The only place where ths game isn't realistic is that you can't snipe a guy on a motorcycle. You can, however, blow him to bits.   This isn't to say that the game is impossible. You are rewarded for employing battlefield survival techniques by being alive for a few minutes longer. The tank battles are glorious, but some of the larger maps tend to involve you driving for ten minutes to your death. A sequel is bound to come out soon, but several servers are still up and running.

												This game is HARD.If you want realistic eastern-front WW II action, this is your game. No artificial zoom in on iron sights, no med packs, no mercy. EVERYTHING will kill you. Get shot in the arm? Hope you weren't planning to shoot a rifle. Shot in the legs? No more walking. Caught crossing in front of a tank with your tank's side exposed? BBQ tonight! The only place where ths game isn't realistic is that you can't snipe a guy on a motorcycle. You can, however, blow him to bits.   This isn't to say that the game is impossible. You are rewarded for employing battlefield survival techniques by being alive for a few minutes longer. The tank battles are glorious, but some of the larger maps tend to involve you driving for ten minutes to your death. A sequel is bound to come out soon, but several servers are still up and running.

												Dear Mother,I once considered war an act of man, a sought of pride in life to fight for the land beloved. I have seen now that war is not such. As I fight father and son, brother and cousin, uncle and nephew. We have pushed into the NAZI controlled France, casualties are mounting as though to become the mountains we must now cross. Some have merely become a vapor if nothing else. When you read this mother, fear not for me as I am well. I cannot speak for my brothers, when we stormed the beach. They gave their lives to save others and were butchered by the NAZIs for their heroics, they saved so many Mother, even I. Please forgive me for not being able to protect them, I led the charge with regret. The sounds of zippers still ring in my ears, trembles down my spine. Yet, we've moved inwards since that day and we've progressed to Germany. I'll have Hitler personally apologize for his herecy to God, this I promise Mother.With love and life,Your SonI have PTSD and bombed my own home because I heard tanks rolling by.9001/10			"

												Bought in 2007-2008. This closer to realism you cannot get with gameplay mechanics (in good way). Soviets and germans speak their own language. You need 2-3 drivers for tanks. Playerbase is somewhat strong. There is pretty much always at least 1 full server of 50 players at nights.They say, that Verdun is realistic game historical FPS. This is more realistic. Go figure.Only downside is that aiming is somewhat slow, when clicking with mouse. And jumping is awkward and stamina eater. And there are maps, where you have run alot to get shot from far away, if not careful.9/10			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a game developed and published by Tripwire Interactive. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is a slow-paced realistic tactical shooter with heavily depressive atmosphere and predominantly bolt-action which makes it unique experienceShooting is the hardest in the genre because there is no magic eye with built-in zoom and sway making aiming without stabilizing gun very tricky which is not very realistic but serves the gameplay rightRed Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is actual a better game then its sequel Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad and I'd recommend this over its sequel which was sub-par RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I'm not a huge fan of music games that don't let you import your own music (Guitar Hero, Rock Band, Guitar Hero World Tour, The Beatles Rock Band, Guitar Hero II, Rock Band II, etc.) but Red Orchestra is a winner in my book because you just conduct an orchestra playing classical music, which I really enjoy. It has all the classics (that was a pun!) like Tchaikovsky, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven, and (unfortunately) Wagner, and it also has some more snappy modern stuff like Shostakovitch, Mahler, and stuff Mozart wrote when he wasn't 12. I feel like this would have been better as a Wii game or a Kinect game or something, because using the mouse to conduct feels weird, but it does support joysticks and frankly it's so well done that I don't see why anyone would complain. A must for fans of music games who, like me, want something other than Coldplay or Freezepop to listen to.			"

												Think Call of Duty 2, except way better. This game explores the nuances of realism often left out of war FPSes, adding details like stamina and environmental injuries to provide a more in-depth experience. Battles often emply a good deal of tactics, and each player can serve a different role in the overall strategy. As a whole, the pace is slower than many other frantic shooters, but this allows for more strategy and skill rather than simply running in and shooting blindly. My personal favorite FPS. (And yes, I do like it better than Red Orchestra 2. It just has a more solid feel all-around.)			"

												BUMMER I thought I had read solo play too.  I don't like multi-player and my inet isn't fast enough to really play multi-player games.  Luckily was cheap at 2.49.  Maybe sometime they'll bring cable in the boonies here.Played practice.  View when driving a tank is really limited.  (as it probably really is). but kinda takes the fun out of it. Still I managed to beat a practice mission fine. Graphics are ok for a older game.  I'll have to give it another look someday, but I have so many better games on my iMac to play at this point. I suppose I could recommend it as a multi-player for 2.49 I'd not recommend you pay more.			"

You find some, but only 5 are active or so.-Join the one with the most players ""International Server""-Play the game-Be a gunner-Kill some bots / guys-Someone calls ""someone"" with a machine gun a noob (ofc in russian)-Write in chat; ""Who are you talking to""-Another guy responds ""To both of you""-Be sad-Never ever play the game againALTHOUGH THE GAME IS 11/10			"

												Solid gameplay I haven't seen in a long time. The only downside is its terribly dated graphics - I'd hold out for RO: Heroes of Stalingrad running on the UT3 engine.Unlike other WWII FPS games that rely heavily on automatic weapons, RO goes back to basics with bolt-action rifles for about half of each team and they have a distinct advantage over SMGs at about more than 10 feet. It sounds dull but makes it really intense. Tanks, artillery, and machine guns weren't left behind either.			"

												Isn't so good like Red Orchestra 2, but is good to have it like a training for Red Orchestra 2, because is hardly to play on servers RO2 if you are untrained on it's old version.

												If you are looking for a very easy game that your PC can handle and you are searching for WW II fps shooter that both got Infantry combat + tank combat on same maps, then RO:O 41-45 is highly recommended for you. The community is still some what active and there are some servers still that are full of players to play against in intense multiplayer battles. How ever, a large majority have moved on to their new game: Red Orchestra 2.			"

												I really wanted to play this game as I loved the realistic concept that it brought to the shooter scene. The problem is that this game is only multiplayer, the community is dead, the maps are only filled with bots, the achievements are broken as they require a certain number of human players and work only on official maps. I gave it several chances over the months but in the end it saddens me to tell that it fails to deliver that awesome concept of realism. I can only recommend it if you have a high number of friends to bring and play together with them. Only then the game would be more enjoyable and I have my doubts about that too. You can play with the bots your own hosts of game ,but their AI is just plain horrible and it throws away any sense of coordinated teamplay realism that you might have,even with the team commands.I have my hopes up for Red Orchestra 2 which aparently killed the entire community in RO1 now			"

												Great game. A must get for only 5 bucks until June 30! The realism in this game is crazy, watch an ally in front of you get his head shot, and your guy will start breathing heavy, there is real time bullet physics, so it takes a few seconds for the bullet to hit its target if it's far away, and the bullets do drop over distances. Another thing, you don't have to have a great computer to run this, mine is not the best, and I get 30-50 fps on this. The graphics don't bother me either, and make sure you get Darkest Hour with this, most people play that one now.			"

												Heard so much about RO so decided to try it. Hmm. It certainly shows it s age. While it is fun for a while it hasn't grabbed me in the same way as the ARMA series which are more tactical and graphically far superior. With the WW2 mods available for ARMA knock spots off RO. RO is a multiplayer only game so there is no single player campaign. There is a practice mode that allows you to play all the maps but apart fom a few bots there is very little to hold your attention. Would I recommend RO? In all honesty no, go for ARMA and you can play from a WW1 mod (which I have yet to try) up to modern land sea and air combat			"

												This is the most realistic World War II shooter you'll find outside of Red Orchestra 2. Unfortunately, the sheer realism of it can make for a frustrating experience. Don't expect a run-and-gun experience. Be prepared to fight in a realistic manner with the rather rudimentary weapons---by modern standards---that are available; if you decide to play this game in the manner of the Battlefield or Call of Duty series, you're certain to die repeatedly. Chances are that you'll only enjoy this game if you're a realism FPS junkie. Even so, it's just not all that well done.			"

												All I have to say about this one is, meh..Maybe its just the fact that very few military games nowadays intrique me. Yet we have another bland generic military FPS here. Perhaps this was good when it came out, but now its very dull to me and mediocre. I got it in the pack that came with Killing Floor. I'm not saying this is a bad game by any means, its just not my personal cup of choice tea. Red Orchestra is a semi-decent timekiller but only worth about 5 bucks in my opinion. I'm going to try out the second installment soon, but I'm not holding my breath.			"

												It's difficult to imagine this game ever being good, even for its time.  It's an awkward, buggy mess with  invisible collisions in strange places, making navigation and gameplay difficult.  When this game was released, there were shooters notable for their ingenious mechanics and smooth design, so it's difficult for me to excuse this game - its coarseness and lack of polish are inexcusable, even for 2006.  A game with a challenge is an entirely different thing than a game that is difficult to play, and sadly, this is the latter.  I can't recommend this one.			"

												Quite an interesting game. One of the more realistic shooters, RO offers the player a great play with feeling and tone of the Second World War. If you are tired of playing COD or CSS continually I would recommend this game defiently. The realism in the game is great but also annoying at times for some, but the satisfaction of taking that enemy out or pounding the ground with artillery quickly replaces it. This game is one of the best I would say and a must have for WW2 fans. Pros: Good amount of authentic weapons and maps (however the limit counter is annoying sometimes), realism, team sizes are good, authentic feel and good environments.Negatives: Class limits, some maps don't offer some weaponary, lack of field weapons such as anti-tank guns and flak guns, and sometimes, not very often, bullets don't seem to register with target or the gun doesn't regiester when you fire it; however this occurs rarely. Overall a great game I say. "

												Only this first-person shooter, can give you a clear idea about the Soviet infantry and the Eastern Front. There are too many FPS on the western front, but the truth is that every 8 out of 10 divisions of nazis destroyed the Soviet people. Not only soldiers, but also children and women who worked in military equipment factories have made this victory. Despite these historical truths, most games where Soviet Union taking part seemed to be mocking Red Army. This one is fully authentic and multipayer in same time. Also there's the unique game machanics - arms locking system on any items (for accuracy), realisation of  the sniper rifles, animation and quality of models at the highest level. Despite the fact that the game came out several years ago and initially was only just a mod based on UT2004a - she is worthy of attention even now and in the new year, right up to the second part.

												This game is an amazing sirst serson shooter unlike any else. It is an extremely realistic war simulation, possibly one of the most realistic there is. You must think like you are in a war, and think in very confusing environments. You have to use TOTALLY different tactis than in a normal game, and you either hate it, or love it. I LOVE IT!!!! 4.7 STARS!!!!			"

												Old game, but still, the best realistic FPS out there. Has tanks n ♥♥♥♥. So far there has been 2 FPS games I've really liked (multiplayer that is). TrueCombat:Elite, RedOrchestra: Ostfront. Now RO2 (Red Orchestra: Heroes of Stalingrad) is coming out this year, gonna be a hoot. I hope, if someone actually reads this, that you give it a go. I have high hopes they have fixed some of the issues that RO:O has - and even with its flaws, it is still the best.And I have typoed my avatar. Nice.			"

												Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is one of the finest WWII games of its era.The graphics are reasonable for the time it was made in, the sound effects are good and the performance is best.The weaponry is rather limited, but there is a community server with mods, great fun.Despite that it still holds up to this day, the achievements are near impossible to acquire, considering not that many people still play the game, and on the same non-modded server with official maps. Other than that, great game, worth your money.			"

												This game is surprising for a FPS in that it is mostly accurate. There's no crosshairs to make life easy for you - you're aiming as the soldiers did down iron sights. This adds an air of realism, and you will likely find yourself going to favourite weapons. No single-player campaign, which many may consider a downside, but the immersive multiplayer levels (and there are so many more you can download) make up for it. There's also a practice mode, but the AI is the usual brand of stupid, especially at operating tanks. (Though their aim when they do manage to shoot at you is uncanny)The tank warfare may be slightly different from reality to even things out, but the change enhances the game. Highly recommend.			"

												""This game is a dying breed of ""realistic"" games that really aren't fun and consist of people using bolt actions to pixel hunt from a distance (just like you experienced). That's why hardly anyone plays this anymore and instead go back to more enjoyable games such as Battlefield: Bad Company 2.The sad thing is that Heroes of Stalingrad is going to be just like this: people will play it for a month, then dump it after realizing how much of bore the game is.

Red Orchestra 2 is an alright game, certainly better than any other WW2 shooter out there, but Red Orchestra 1  ( Eastern Front ) is still the best, ESPECIALLY, with The Darkest Hour mod ( western front ).

												Red Orchestra is a really Good tactical WW2 FPS featuring good class based gameplay, nice open ended maps, and above all..... THE BEST gunplay I have ever seen in an FPS. Shooting a gun in this game feels almost real. Iron sights look realistic and automatic weapon recoil is just monstrous. My favorite feature is the ability to rest your weapon on any object in the game world for more accuracy and stability. I find it a lot better than some ridiculous sticky cover. Everything You do influences Your weapons accuracy: Your stance, Your character`s fatigue, Your health, etc. If you try to shoot when your hands are wounded, you`re tired from sprinting and you`re in an upright stance, then you`ll probably miss because of huge weapon sway. Red Orchestra is generally pretty awesome but the WW2 theme starts to get tiresome after some time. I wish there was a modern day combat mod for this :( Important note: This game is not very popular, and sometimes it`s hard to find servers with people on them. The game also enforces some serious restrictions when choosing a class ( for example: There can be only 1 or 2 snipers in each team ) so be prepared to fight as a bolt action rifleman when joining a server with many people on it.

												Red Orchestra deals with the Ostfront (East Front) of World War II. Play as the Russians or the Germans in a realistic matchup with up to 50 players.One shot will kill you. Bolts needs to be manually reloaded. There's no run and gun found here. Moving from cover to cover, and suppression fire from teammates are the only way for success.Machine gun fire will cause players to search for cover or immediately fall to a prone position. In Red Orchestra, players will team up to work together to flush a sniper from his position.If you're looking for a realistic, team-based first person shooter, than Red Orchestra has it.			"

												The game that set standards for realistic fps. This war picks many intense and horrifiying battles between RU and Axis, From stalingrad to berlin you will be set in for an addictive WW2 title that will keep you playing weeks. Over time this games graphics have gotten outdated but the realism is still there. There are servers that are still populated but very few. The aquiring of achivements is nearly impossible but can be done. i recomend this for anyone looking for a good WW2 fps. If you do aquire this game make sure to download the mods Darkest Hour, and Mare Nostrom for more content.			"

												This game is what all FPS games should strive to be - realistic, but fun, with an emphasis on cooperative team play. The graphics may not be the best at this point, but this hardly detracts from the vivid environments, achieved through cunning use of textures (Dirt, dirt everywhere - war really is crap) and constant background noise of whistling bullets and artillery. Vehicular combat is expertly portrayed, with a proper crew being a must for effective employment and a balanced, but powerful presence. Infantry combat truly shines however, the details everywhere - overheating MG barrels, an ammunition feeder and a squad leader with communication equipment, interesting cover and ironsights mechanics as well as stamina and modular health system all contribute to a sense of accomplishment with every fragged opponent. For people who appreciate a team based conflict simulation, there are no Rambo's here; this is a game where ""credit to team"" really shines.			"

												Possibly the greatest game I have EVER played. The maps are huge and realistic; there is an arsenal of historically accurate weapons that are simply not portrayed in WWII games, such as the MP41, different variants of the Mosin-Nagant, the PPD-40, and the Panzerfaust is finally made equippable in multiplayer (no more lugging around heavy launchers!); and don't get me started on the vehicles! Realistic interiors, incremental throttle, tanks requiring more than one player to operate! Bullets ricochet and weapons can even be shot out of your hands! There is no magical ammo pool, magazines must be manually checked and reloading before one is spent can waste precious ammo. You also have to actually pick up weapons and ammo  instead of just walking over them and inexplicably having them in your inventory. This may not be for everyone, and if you think you are good at Call of Duty, (no hard feelings, I love that franchise) don't be shocked if you suck at this. I am honestly not that great but the game is extremely fun and addictive, and I would STRONGLY recommend it to anyone.			"

												A game thats arcadey but serious, requires aim and isnt some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ console port, a true PC title, MODs are just as good as the actual game, just a shame its old, RO2 will be great if it sticks to its roots, the Nam MOD for RO2 looks like it will be 100 times better then BC2:NAM, cant believe they release the MOD tools in advance of the game and the quality of MODs themselves are insane, something DICE for example isnt doing anymore. +Respect for being a actually PC gaming company.

												Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 features a realistic infantry + tank and armoured vehicles experience, amazing graphics (for the time and Unreal Engine 2's standards), a bit ""hard"" controls and solid gameplay. NO regenerating health, NO medikit/bandage healing, NO MERCY.This game has a GREAT immersion, and although not as big as Red Orchestra 2's immersion, it feels really good and demands teamwork for the game to work.Sadly, the game itself is pretty much dead, together with the Mare Nostrum mod. But, Darkest Hour (the western european front mod) is always full of players. So, why don't you give it a shot? Because i gave it one... and i don't regret it.			"

												Great game. Although its texture quality is low reolution, the game is great. It reminds me of how the first call of duty was. The only part of the game I found broken was the bot mechanics. Unless there is a direct route for the bots to follow, they will just sit at the spawn. You can command the bots, but this is also a bit broken. However, Red Orchestra is not made for bot play, but to test your combat intelligence against other players on the battlefield. If your the type of person who enjoys run-and-gun, shoot'em up kind of games, then Red Orchestra is definetly NOT your game, fo this game is fairly realistic, and player strategyon the battlefield is a must, or you will find that you will be shot in the face, repeatedly. I must also add that the aiming mechanics are a bit clunky, so dont expect to be gunning down guys a hundred yards away.			"

												Auch nach nun schon 10 Jahren ist Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 nicht Tod. Man findet genügend Server mit Leuten drauf um lustige Runden zu spielen, sowohl reines Infanterie als auch Panzer Maps. Die Community in diesem Spiel zählt zu den besten die ich kenne und jeder der etwas für Panzer und taktisches Spielen übrig hat, sollte sich dieses SPiel kaufen, oder zumindestens genau anschauen. Aber es ist nicht alles rosig, für neue Spieler die nochnie etwas von Red Orchestra gehört haben wird der einstiegs Schwierigskeitgrad zu hoch sein. Darum 9/10 "

En effet Red Orchestra est un jeu exigent, mais il est d'autant plus gratifiant.

												Black Ops es un FPS, Red Orchestra es un simulador de guerra. El realismo es su base, el juego en sí es viejo, pero eso no lo hace malo. Los servers siguen bastante llenos, y la jugabilidad es asombrosa. Basado en la guerra entre Rusia y Alemania, en intensos campos de batalla muy variados, algunos que muestran calles polvorientas rodeadas de edificos destruidos, y otras con densas llanuras perfectas para moverte en tanque con tus amigos. Los vehículos son excelentes, con capacidades entre 1 y 8 personas, dependiendo el modelo, y con distintas funcionalidades, algunas para transportar soldados y otras para atacar. El modo de juego es clásico Team Deathmatch, y las partidas tardan lo justo y necesario.El juego me encantó, le doy un 9/10 por algunas fallas en el sonido y otros detalles, pero es mas de lo que uno esperaría de un juego con tan poca fama, y tantos años ya en la tienda...

												This game is what all FPS games should strive to be - realistic, but fun, with an emphasis on cooperative team play. The graphics may not be the best at this point, but this hardly detracts from the vivid environments, achieved through cunning use of textures (Dirt, dirt everywhere - war really is crap) and constant background noise of whistling bullets and artillery. Vehicular combat is expertly portrayed, with a proper crew being a must for effective employment and a balanced, but powerful presence. Infantry combat truly shines however, the details everywhere - overheating MG barrels, an ammunition feeder and a squad leader with communication equipment, interesting cover and ironsights mechanics as well as stamina and modular health system all contribute to a sense of accomplishment with every fragged opponent. For people who appreciate a team based conflict simulation, there are no Rambo's here; this is a game where ""credit to team"" really shines.			"

												Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is one of the finest WWII games of its era.The graphics are reasonable for the time it was made in, the sound effects are good and the performance is best.The weaponry is rather limited, but there is a community server with mods, great fun.Despite that it still holds up to this day, the achievements are near impossible to acquire, considering not that many people still play the game, and on the same non-modded server with official maps.

												The original Red Orchestra that some may not have heard of. Personally, I think this game is almost perfect in its execution and complexity for a game released in 2006. There is so much content in this game: tons of maps and tons of weapons and vehicles; more than Red Orchestra 2. This is comparatively not a bad thing - as Red Orchestra 2's focus is on infantry rather than on combined arms combat as the first game is.The graphics may not be excellent, but it portrays the game's hopeless feel. You are a single soldier fighting amongst up to 63 other players in World War II. Death is inevitable, and the game's gloomy, dark feeling adds to the atmosphere. That is not to say that a single soldier cannot do anything by himself, however. If he is good, then he will be able to provide a large influence in the battle.It is a shame that this game does not have many players. Personally, I have found great difficulty getting into the game as the only populated servers are inhabited by Russians who seem to only play this game. Thousands of hours they have poured into the game; they know everything about it, and they will annihilate poor little me (with 60 hours at time of writing) without a second thought.This game is unforgiving, and that is the reason why it is so fulfilling. There are no visual aids; no silly unlocks like in Red Orchestra 2 (grr, I hate that unlock system) and you will die in one hit. The wound system mostly works and portrays the weakness of a soldier to a bullet well, but I have had times where I have been shot by a full calibre rifle and not died.The tanks... they are interesting. The game attempts to hide the HP system of the vehicles, but it does not work. Typically, your tank will only take one shot before being destroyed. Some tanks are objectively better than others (why would you take a StuG III if you can use a Panzer IV H?). Apart from that, I think the game is balanced. The submachine guns are impossible to use at long range (this is probably on purpose - but it has been changed in Red Orchestra 2), which personally annoys me. Therefore, the most viable weapon is the bolt-action rifle. You can never go wrong with one.I have not mentioned the excellent mods. Darkest Hour: Europe 44-45 is the most prominent one... in fact, the only mod that is played. It is based on the Western Front after Operation Overlord, so it provides a refreshing experience and change from the Eastern Front for Ostfront 41-45. Also, I think the tank gameplay is better.There is also Mare Nostrum, but nobody plays that one. Therefore, I have not had a chance to play it, but its premise seems interesting. North Africa - the British against the Germans and the Italians. A game based on a setting that I have not seen before.In conclusion, I think that Red Orchestra Ostfron 41-45 is well worth your time. It is the best WWII shooter I have played (apart from Red Orchestra 2; I'm not sure which one is better) and perhaps the best shooter I have played ever. Please buy it, because I don't want to see it die before Rising Storm 2 releases.			"

												You will not survive.A welcome change from CoD type games where you can rush a machine gun and come back from the brink by just hiding for a few seconds. Here, if you get hit, you're either dead outright or so badly injured you may as well be dead. Rushing MG positions? Forget it. Tanks rampaging everywhere with impunity? One AT round and goodbye.To do well, you need to use every bit of cunning and skill you have. Be cautious, always alert and accurate at all times. If you do this, you will increase your chances of surviving.For the next few seconds.Darkest Hour addon is fun (D-Day map for any Saving Pte Ryan fans) but the original is the best game.

												One of the few good World War 2 games. This game is also of exceptional mention because it exclusively focuses on the Eastern Front of World War 2 which In my opinion has been heavily neglected in the video game industry. Those games that have included an Ostfront usually lack detail (such as limited weaponry) but this game really has historical value.			"

												You will not survive.A welcome change from CoD type games where you can rush a machine gun and come back from the brink by just hiding for a few seconds. Here, if you get hit, you're either dead outright or so badly injured you may as well be dead. Rushing MG positions? Forget it. Tanks rampaging everywhere with impunity? One AT round and goodbye.To do well, you need to use every bit of cunning and skill you have. Be cautious, always alert and accurate at all times. If you do this, you will increase your chances of surviving.For the next few seconds.Darkest Hour addon is fun (D-Day map for any Saving Pte Ryan fans) but the original is the best game. The realism really makes the gameplay memorable and shows the importance of both luck and skill.			"
