								I purchased this game back in 2011 (before this Early Access program started), in hopes that the developers would get around to finishing it based on their promises. Instead, they went back and re-released a ""new"", updated version of ""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"" and have barely touched this game ever since, only adding a new level after an ARG event for Portal 2.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AS IT IS FAR FROM FINISHED!!

								The fact that you are still seeing this game on steam is a result of three groups of people negating their responsibility.1. The developers of course, for abandoning the game and quite literally walking off with gamers money.2. Valve, for not removing abaondoned early access games from Steam and offering refunds to those burnt gamers.3. Us - the gamers - for allowing Dejobaan Games LLC to continue as a company despite the first two points.Oh and Dejobaan? Finish a game before starting on another one. Also give me (and the rest of the gamers that put faith in you in this title) my money back.			"

Early Access Review
								What can I say about this game. It is the first early access game on steam. A game that has been in a state of early access for 4 years and 8 months(April 1st, 2011) and no sign of ever going gold. In fact, it has been so long since it's last update that it has almost been as long since it was updated as the offical launch of early access games on steam. If Valve had taken a look at how early access worked for this game I doubt they would have ever allowed any early access games on steam. Why any game that has not been updated in over two years without being formally released is allowed to stay avalible to customers to purchase is beyond me. Truthfully, it's not a horrible game but it is far from great. Most of my hours came from stress testing a video card. This game would cause crashes more often then any other I owned at the time. The rest came from the 2011 potato thingy for portal 2 launch. If your a fan of games that use your own music to generate levels I would recommend a bunch of others others over this one. Even Dejobann's other game AAAAaaaAAaaAAaaaaAAAA!!!!! does the concept much better and is more polished than this rendition. I just can't recommend this game to other people.			"

								Almost five years of broken promises and we're left with a tech demo that doesn't even resemble the original concept that was sold. I've repeatedly contacted Dejobaan but have received nothing but lies (they claimed it was a priority but have released four other titles in the interim) and mocking shrugs (along the lines of ""gee, we can't please all of the people all of the time""). Valve refuse to refund despite their complicitness in promoting it during a 2011 sale.This is a total scam and should be avoided at all costs. Dejobaan should be ashamed of themselves, if they're actually capable of feeling such.			"

Early Access Review
								Intro:1...2...3... Kick It is a music game modelled after Dejobaan's earlier game, ""Aaaaaa,"" in which the player ""base jumps"" and avoids a series of obstacles on their way to the ground.  This iteration is only a spiritual successor, as Dejobaan has removed many of the more action-oriented elements from their formula and has instead tried to craft a new genre of relaxing music game with only two or three core gameplay mechanics instead of the many kisses, combos, landings, and tricks we saw in ""Aaaaa."" The concept is much simpler now: fly close to objects to earn something called ""TB,"" and you also get something nice if that object is oriented towards the bottom of your screen. There are no landings, tricks, combos, or crowds to show off to. Because the game is STILL IN PROGRESS, I am trying to be as fair as possible. Please understand that any of the bullet points below may be changed or improved by the time you are reading this.The Good: * The graphics are visually interesting, but there is still room for improvement. I imagine a music game should have something more than plain black backgrounds.* The Game is constantly updated.* Interesting and well-developed soundtrack. I am not super into music but I thought the lyrics and beats were fun to listen to.* The developers are some of the nicest people in the world. Drop by the Steam community forums and see for yourself: they respond to every bug, glitch, and criticism with poise and patience.The Bad:* Not all updates are good. For example, it used to have a nice voiceover AI in the menus, which for some reason was replaced by silence in the latest update. Silent menu screens? In a previous build, I was unable to load any actual levels due to the way the game saves music.* The full-screen is not working at the time of this writing. It opens a window large enough to fill my screen, but there is still the familiar Windows 7 title bar at the top.The Ugly:* There is nothing that I can see to qualify this as a music game. Some obstacles will ""pulse"" with the beat of the music, but everything else in the level seems to be pre-scripted. I can listen to Dolly Parton or speed metal while playing and get the same experience. My recommendation for the Developers would be to replace the black background with something colorful that responds to the music.* The free-falling mechanic is just not that interesting or immersive like it was in Dejobaan's first game (which was not very immersive to begin with). This feels more like a rail-shooter than a falling simulator. There is no rush of wind passing my ears, no way to slow or speed my descent, and absolutely nothing to remind me that I am falling down instead of running sideways or flying upwards.Conclusion:Because the game is still in development at the time of this writing, I think this review (and any others) should be read in that context. Unfortunately, at this stage of development, I never-the-less foresee ""1...2...3... Kick It"" as being noteworthy just for coming alphabetically in your list of games, and not for the enjoyable time you spend playing it.			"

Early Access Review
								1... 2... 3... KICK IT! is a rhythm/skydiving game. It's AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! but the level design is set to music. It's permanently stuck in early access, but oddly has been developed a bit over the years. It's gone through 2 or 3 major engine rewrites, but seems to be stuck in very early development anyway. Don't buy it if you expect a 'finished' game experience.There are a few songs made for the game, which are decent.You can hand it your music library and it'll try to generate levels based on that, but the music analyzer is buggy. That's about all I can say about it because there's not that much to do in the game. While A Reckless Disregard for Gravity had point-collecting and levels to unlock, this game can't really do that because of how random the level design is. There's no progression and no sense of achievement because the game experience varies wildly depending on the randomness of the level generator. The difficulty is pretty pointless because there's no death or failure state, just less points than you would have had for doing well. Also, there's no rating system or metric for how well you did, just an arbitrary number (and the devs have rewritten the scoring system a few times as well). If I get a 'high' score, I don't know if I actually did well or the song was just easier than most. Often, longer songs will net you more points by default because you get a few points per second, and longer song = more time to get points.  I just can't recommend the game because even though it seems like a decent concept, it doesn't have that much potential and it seems to be totally dead. To be a game I'd recommend, it would need:-an entirely different music analysis/level generator that actually makes sense for the song-a scoring system that can tell you how well you did vs. the difficulty and length of the song-some way to actually progress or increase difficulty over time, some way to actually fail a song-something that actually makes you move with the rhythm, like osu! or audiosurf. Playing with full audio is no different from having the music muted because the music only affects the quantity of obstacles, not their placement or their difficulty. And if the dev team hasn't done this in the last 4-ish years it's probably not going to happen anytime soon. The problem is that even if this game escapes 'early access' status and fixes these issues, it doesn't seem like it could ever be as fun as AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! which still makes this a game I can't recommend. It has some potential, but when compared with other rhythm games or other arcade games, it just won't compete even as a 'finished' product. AaaaaAA only works because of the fluidity and uniqueness of the level design, and if you take that away or leave it up to a music analyzer, you remove the challenge of AaaaaAA and make it repetitive because all levels have to be (about) the same. Ultimately, you should only buy it if you are a die-hard Dejobaan fan for completion's sake.			"

								About 5 years ago I got this game in the Potato Sack Pack. Since then it's always sat at the top of my library, seeing as it's sorted alphabetically. I decided to check it out just now and noticed there was only one achievement: 'I Beat City 15'So I made it my goal today to get the achievement.I sat here, played through the intro level and decided to skip straight to City 15 just to save time. After a bit of searching around, I couldn't find the level. A quick google search led me to the conclusion that the developers removed the level, but kept the achievement up. 3 years ago, the devs said they would fix it. 2016 still no fix. 10/10 devs, you got us good			"

								1...2...3... KICK IT! (Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby) is a first-person perspective base-jumping-esque game where you fall through procedurally generated levels to the sound of your own music. Mechanically, it's similar to AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity and AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! for the Awesome (which may be the two best video game names ever), but it doesn't manage to reach the level of the other ones - the procedural generation makes something unique, but it doesn't seem to ""mesh"" with the music the way the best procedural music games tend to, and, well...there's really just not a whole lot to this game.Pick up one of the other two instead - feel free to pass on this one.

								I want to like this game. I loved the other games Dejobaan have made in the past, and I was curious to see what they would do with Ugly Baby, so I was eager to pick it up. I didn't mind it being in early access since I had faith in their abilities to create a game (especially after Aaaaaaah), and it was one of the reasons that the Potato Sack from 2011 worked so well. There was a lot of good potential there.It's been a few years now, and there's still nothing here but an incomplete game. In fact, it's worse; last year, I was at least able to load the game and run the few test levels (and, admittedly, had fun with them). Now the game has trouble booting up, and when I do manage to get it working, absolutely nothing works. I'm very disappointed by this, and despite my enjoyment of their other titles, their quality is definitely taking a hit in my eyes. The lack of public accountability (or even timely updates) is especially frustrating.In other words, unless you see an update with something along the lines of ""the game is finished!"", I would sadly say to stay away from this title.

								Do you like AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity? Do you wish it was easier? Do you wish there was less to do? Do you wish the cool level names were replaced with ""City #""? Do you wish it integrated a music player so you didn't have to alt-tab to whatever horrible music player you use that isn't foobar2000, the superior + best music player that I use to play my music on my computer? Then hoOooOooOOOooO BOY you're in for a real treat here.This game has been ""in progress"" or whatever for two years and here's the entire gameplay experience:1) Pick level. If you pick the first two levels, skip to #5. If you pick the third level, skip to #4.2) Wait for the file browser to load. For whatever damn idiot reason, the game decides to scan the ID3v2 tags, which means that just displaying a single album's worth of songs can take about thirty seconds, and if you have one folder full of music then you're in for a real doozy of a wait.3) Pick a song you want to listen to.4) Wait about a minute for the game to load the level.5) Use the mouse to move around the level. Use the mouse buttons to rotate your field of view. 5a) If a tall building is on the bottom of your field of view, your multiplier goes up and you get about 5 points per tick.5b) If you pass within range of a small building asteroid field, you get (100 x M) points per small building, where M = your current multiplier.5c) Occasionally the colors pulse, and for about 10% of songs you may notice the buildings being ""built"" around you at roughly the same pace as the beat.6) Collect your score and your ""followers"" (score / 1,000). Followers can be used for lots of things, such as ""absolutely nothing"".7) After you unlock the first four levels, the game really opens up, as now you can play the fifth city in any order you wish.8) There are only five ""levels"" in the game and three of them are various forms of simplified tutorials.Two years of ""early access"" for this. Oh and they just opened up the scripting editor, so you can muck about there and maybe the game will build a spiral ramp in response to a certain portion of a song instead of a building asteroid field. Or maybe not.Not sure if there were more levels at an earlier stage of the game, but considering the leaderboards are entirely empty I'm willing to believe the people with the ""beat level 15"" achievement just used an Achievement Manager.On the plus side, ""Future Shock"" is a really good song and whoever does the voiceover may well be the only chick in the history of indie games to actually know how to read lines without sounding like a terrified dyslexic shut-in with a gun to her head. So credit where credit is due.			"

								If you've been around long enough to remember Valve's potato themed sale ""The Potato Sack"" used to promote the release of Portal 2 back in April 2011, you may remember this game. This game has gone through multiple ""Revisions"" (some of them totally needless because even though the game worked, why not scrap the game and rebuild it to have better graphics guys?)The game is stuck permanently in developer hell with a heavy dose of Duke Nukem Forever syndrome. It's been over a year since any update and the developer has gone on already to make other games (Monster Loves You!, Drunken Robot Pornogaphy, and Elegy for a Dead World) and seems to have just left this as a side pet project to fiddle with whenever he wants to (Which seems to be never.) This game was probably one of the first ""Early Access Games"" before Early Access and Greenlight was even a thing on steam. And sadly, It's STILL in early access. For 4 years the game has gone almost nowhere. Save your money on this one.			"

It boils down to the fact that while this game exists, it's here, and it doesn't SUCK, it's not worth grabbing because there's no further promise to the game and it's really not all that finished.

At one point I thought it was going to be an original and new game, but then I started it up for the first time and saw that it was basically their AaaaaAAaaa!! game all over again. I then proceeded to ignore the game for a long while, but keeping an eye out for any updates to make me think the devs were going to work on this game.  I saw some progress and so I jumped in to see what it was like now and... It's not much different at all.  There's not much 'game' in this game.  Levels generated by the music you load don't really feel like it fits the music.  The objectives are kinda dull and boring, where Aaaaa!! at least had targets to hit and stuff.  ""Drop that baby"" is basically just ""avoid the easily avoidable obstacles""Basically, I would only advise buying this if you're interested in seeing game design failures because I'm pretty sure this has some good examples of what NOT to do when making a game.  The first Aaaaa!! game was fun for about an hour and the 2nd one was fun for about 20 minutes more... I'm still waiting for this one to be fun.			"

								When I played the original 'AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA', I was thinking how great would it be to combine this formula with level generation based on music tracks? When I found out, 'Ugly Baby' was exactly that, I immediately bought it, although it stated on the store page (Early Access wasn't even a concept back then) that this game was still in beta, but the full release was an automatic update, as soon as it got out. I then realized that what I had bought was a very, very early just playable version with few different levels.By now, time has passed and Dejobaan have release several other games, but this one is still stuck in development hell. I'd love to see a full version once and I appreciate the engine migration and all the stuff that happened since the potato sack like a few additional stages, but a full version is due since a very long time ago.When the full version is out, I'll properly review the game again.

								This is basically a game with such a gimmicky, boring concept, that even its developers abandoned it. The game feels much closer to some amateur's experimental project in programming than to a real, sellable product.The gameplay itself revolves around falling through a level that's based on some techno song that plays in the background, while trying to avoid obstacles and hit little targets. Like I said, the concept gets old quickly, and you'll find little to no variety when falling through the same geometrical obstacles and trying to align yourself with the targets.Imho, there are much better rhythm games, and even better, games that let you use your own song library, so if you're looking for something like that, I recommend you look around instead of getting this one.Since I got this in the Potato Sack, quite a while ago, I don't feel that much ripped off but, seriously, I feel bad for whoever bought this from the store.

								This game can have some good song in it, but the entire game is like dropped. I bought it a year ago and now it seems to be updated only one time, in something that is worse than before. If you have the money to buy this i recommend to you to buy something else even if this is on sale.			"

Early Access Review
								This is one of those many games that I have seen unplayed in too many people's games list. I decided to give it ago to farm some trading cards after this has been in my library for a year or longer. It is in Early Acc..wait what? A game released years ago is in Early Access? Yeah, it is. I didn't quite believe it until I saw the stamp on the store page and the multiple reviews and discussion threads referencing. Many players feel the developers are abusing the Early Access status as an excuse for the game ""being worked on"" and not up to people's quality standards. Yet, Steam users report that the game hasn't been updated in over a year, so the developer is definitely doing some thing shady. While I don't care enough about this game to feel like I was scammed, I would probably advise most people to not buy this game despite the game in my experience feeling solid and semi-enjoyable enough to be played and possibly beaten. I don't honestly think the game is bad, but the player/customer experience is heavily damaged by the developer's strange behavior.Another strange factor is that apparently this game has been redone multiple times. The game I remember seeing from videos years ago (even from a 4 year old video on the Developer's own Youtube channel!) is vastly different from what the game is now. I have no idea if it is better or worse, but it's strange to see a game have a completely different art style and game mechanics from it's release.For the most part, gameplay is like an endless runner or a rhythm game played in first person as if you are sky diving around large shapes. Levels have different requirments such as getting enough points by getting close to objects, collecting items, hacking flashing objects by pressing a button while near the object or flying through a open object as if threading a needle. It's a rather simplistic game, but I think it generally works well for what it does, just it doesn't do too much. Some levels are based on specific tracks and other allow you to choose from a list a songs - you should be able to load your own music as well, but I've read at one person mentioning issues with loading custom music.I think this game is rather alright, though probably a bad purchase due to developer scumbaggery. Fans of the other Dejoban games often recommend the other AAAaaaAA! falling score attacks games versus this one, so I would look into those first if this game piques your interest.			"

								if your favorite thing to do is to set money on fire and watch it smolder for years, this game is a perfect opportunity for you to have the kind of fun that you enjoy.or if your idea of having a good time is to just have another game in your library that will amount to nothing more than another pretty icon to stare at, this may be your style of game.or if you are the kind of sado-masochist who enjoys buying games that they know are worthless, for the soul purpose of giving them the ""thumbs down"" or a so-called ""funny"" review; again, this game could be right up your alley.or if you are one of these benevolent souls who just enjoys helping poor little ""independent"" game publisher scum become wealthy people for doing nothing more than stealing and stabbing their customers in the back, again, this is a perfect opportunity to fulfill your desire.but if you were looking for an enjoyable way to pass the time for a few hours; well, in that case, you would be barking up the wrong tree here.steam was actually selling this game for over a year before they plastered the early access bs warning label on it.a half a decade has now elapsed and this game is still vaporware or at best; an unplayable mess that is not worth the time to load the program, (as you can see by my hours of game-play). if that's what you are hoping to find in a game, enjoy.otherwise, you may wish to save your money for something less harmful. or not, i don't care.

Early Access Review
								This game (much like it's name) has an interesting, if but checkered, history. It arrived in my library Steam way back in 2011 not long after it was ""released"". It came out as a in-progress title long before Early Access was a thing but the game looked striking, wasn't pricey and had a number of updates quickly following.Then the updates slowed. Then it became an Early Access title retroactively. Then nothing. Last update was 2013. The current rating of Mostly Negative reflects how people feel about this.But how do I feel about this game?It's changed a lot over the years - I've checked in on it now and then when I see an update to see the what's new and different but it's been more or less the same game.The basics of DTBLAUB (yup that's how I am going to refer to it as) are simple - you fly through a music generated ""level"" in first person using your mouse to control direction and rotation (staying still but the level rotates around you, clockwise or counter-clockwise). The goal is to score points by flying through collectibles (coins, blue ""suns"", etc.), flying close to objects (without hitting them - which if done enough times fails the level) and hacking special glowing objects (fly close and hit the space bar). The difficulty and speed are controlled more by the music than anything else.DBTLAUB is nice to look at, the visuals are striking and intense, which is actually what drew me to the game in the first place, but like a lot of the game they quickly become repetitive variations without being creative outside of a couple of special levels.The music that comes with the game is fairly good electronic style beats that while initially enjoyable begin to annoy after hearing the same song 4-5 times in a row when failing a level (the number of times I failed a level at the 94% mark was infuriating). After a couple of attempts at a level I found myself muting the game until the next level. It still feels so very much proof of concept than even a semi-fleshed out beta. I found DTBLAUB to be repetitive, content thin and at best an example of a concept that one day could be a full game. At worst somewhere between boring and frustrating. For games that use music to create their play space you can do much much better.			"

								when i boght this game it was not labled as early acess there was no warning it was unfinished and it was marketed as a full game.when it first came out it had less content then free cellphone games at the time and that was over 5 years ago.at one point an update hapend that added a bit of a story. the story amounted to the amount of content in an intro.so even at that point id give it near a zero rating but with potentoul.then an update happened that removed the story and added nothing.the game has not changed sence.i would not recomend this game to anyone in its current state that its been in for over a year. its like AAAAHHH if you revoved 99% of the gameand i would not recomend geting it even if you expect it to get updated becuse we have been waiting 5 years but have not gotten anything from it.

								Originally put on Steam in 2011, this game was largely purchased by gamers only because it was part of the Portal 2 ARG.While the game was alright it ultimately fell into the darkest pits of development hell. With other games being created and finished by the company in the mean time. Now it stands as one of the longest early access games out there with little to no word from the developer in years.Supposedly 2016 will have a release of this once abandoned game, but at this point we are more than half way through the year. Add on top of that fact that literally no one cares or remembers this game and you have one of the most lousiest and unprofessional means of handling a product that I've seen on Steam.I can not and will not support this game and I'm surprised no one is making them take accountability for it outside of the dead fanbase.Please wait until this game comes out. If and when that happens, please don't forget all of this and keep it in mind before buying.			"

								The first time I played this game it was kind of fun, but very difficult, and got old quickly, so I uninstalled. That was the last time I ever got it to work. Now after reinstalling, it's just a mess.First off, the menu controls make no sense. When you first load it up, you get a full screen with some robot voice saying the news, with no text. I tried hitting all kinds of buttons and keys and nothing happened, then I clicked my mouse and it went to a menu. From the menu, the options are gibberish and some of them don't even do anything. Loging in as Akumi or whatever seems to start the game. From there it appears you select a level. Start the level and you hear nothing bit wind noise, but no display other than what appears to be a frame around the edges and a cursor in the middle.I've tried playing this game multiple times over the past year or so, got 18 minutes into it trying to figure out how to even get it to do anything at all, but it's totally broken. The developer seems to have abandoned it. It's a neat concept, it might be cool if it actually worked.			"

								Glorified Portapotty 2 ARG made by swindlers; An immortal testament to how much of a POS early access is, when you give it to developers who haven't proven they can finish something. There are dozens more instances of this horsehockey, but I have carefully avoided buying them. This game, however, has another glaring flaw: I think this product actually gave me irreversible brain damage.Yeah, really, I can prove it. Ever since I first played this unfinished hodgepodge of gangrenous gonads, I sometimes type indecipherable, Slavic messages about ""orange soda without the ice,"" without meaning to do so. There's clearly subliminal messages in this game, why is Dejobaan Games, LLC allowed to continue these Slavic shenanigans for 4 years, without legal recourse?			"

								I paid into the alpha of this in 2010? I think two games have come out since? Don't get me wrong. What it's slowly becoming over the years is neat and all. But it hardly gets updated. Steam Early access didn't exsist, and the game had all this promise. Meanwhile Dejobaan has been working on other games instead. It seems to me that the money from this was used to help fund games like the just released Drunken Robot Pornography. At one point 123 kick it was totally scrapped and just turned into another game. Same idea as before, but totally different mechanics. The forum seems active, and Dejobaan pretends to listen. Heck, it even says so in the Early Access Description. But the truth is, it's been at LEAST ~3 to 4 years since I paid for this, and it hasn't been updated since what, July of 2013? I dunno.. It seems to have a ton of promise if Dejobaan would actually work on it, instead of putting out games like DRP. If you buy this now, you get a very basic Alpha with a very small handful of levels. While I enjoy what's there, I just can't recommend this to anybody. I'm sorry.			"

								Broken for years, Dejobaan retroactively slapped on the early access tag, while shunning this game in favor of other projects... A shame, since this game was broken only shortly after I first found it. Maybe throw down some money for their AaaaaAAaaaa games, but avoid Dejobaan otherwise.Update 3/15/2017Oh Snap! The discussion forum was deleted! Kudos to silencing those that bought the game! My bet would either be on the only active thread being a complain-fest about the game being broken that got derailed, or else Dejobaan might actually be working on this steaming pile of... ugly baby... probably not the latter, I'd assume.

								UPDATE 27th July 2016: Still not done, but the page for the game on Dejobaan's website shows a video showing off current in-dev gameplay. It's not looking so hot. 'Tis a shame that development hell kills off so many cool ideas, especially ones from one of my favourite indie dev teams.-As much as I love the things Dejobaan put out, this is just disappointing. Not much changes regardless of the song you load in, not forgetting the most important fact that they've outright completely forgotten about the game overall.The last update was in *July 2013*. If they're working on a big update then OK cool that would be nice but I would at least like some kind of post saying ""Hey, we're still making this game by the way"". Don't get this unless it's super cheap or you're a die-hard Dejobaan fan.			"

								This game has been in Early Access for over three years, and has seen minimal updating. Ultimately customers are not getting what they paid for, as the game's ""Early Access"" status seems permenant with no word from the developers. All the while, the dev team has been working on a sequal without ever finishing the original or providing the content that was promised.Lofty promises, no delivery. Not worth the cost.			"

Early Access Review
								This was originally released years ago, and had the ability to take your own music and have the game create levels. You basically got to play ""AaAaAA"" with your own music that proceedurally generated the level. Which was awesome! It was a small difference, but one that made the two games totally different.They eventually killed that option in the original game (through updates/patches, nerfing features, until the ONLY important gameplay difference between AaAaAA and 123KI  was simply the control scheme), in order to re-sell this ""new concept,"" which is basically a graphics update of something they released years ago.I'm OK with them re-selling an update/re-boot to the original, which was honestly very inexpensive (and often freeware) when released. Kickass, I'd totally be on board with paying $20 for an improved sequel of a great game that I originally got for free/$1/$9.99. But patching my *owned* game to remove functionality, options, and basic gameplay (the ability to integrate my own music with a level, THE REASON WHY I GOT THE GAME TO BEGIN WITH, AND THE REASON WHY MANY PEOPLE GOT IT, THEIR INTEREST BEING A REASON WHY THE DEV IS STILL BE AROUND TODAY...)...that's just a fkng ♥♥♥♥ move.I obviously have many mixed emotions about this. I like their games, and have been vocally supportive in the past, but hamstringing games for your earliest supporters is just a mean and ♥♥♥♥♥♥-nozzle move.			"

								It's an interesting game but nowhere near as good as their other game (AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity) and it seems to be perpetually stuck in an early access beta form (since before Early Access was a thing if I remember correctly).  The concept is good and the mechanics are decent, but it lacks the intensity (and difficulty) that I'd expect (and want) from this kind of game.  If they finally update this to something a bit better I'll be glad to come back and give it a shot, but as it stands now, I couldn't recommend this for purchase.			"

								So this game has had a whopping overhaul since I last played it.  Dejobaan have clearly lavished a lot of time on the interface.  The game is also totally different from the pre-alpha... Gone seem to be the crazy music-video like spirally tentacles and psychadelic backgrounds.. They've been replaced with lots of flashing and pulsing cubes.The other major plusses for this new version are the radio voiceovers which are amusing, the music which is not too bad, and the controls which feel very fluid.  the ""city map"" screen is enigmatic in its inscrutibility... I can seem to play any of the ""levels"".. so why are they linked, as if it's some kind of progression?  What do any of the descriptions mean?  What's the benefit of playing any one level?The answer, it seems, is ""none of it makes a blind bit of difference"".   All the levels look, feel, sound and play the same, except for a few which seem to be cut-scenes.Sadly, the game is missing any form of coherence whatsoever.  I so dearly want to love this game. I really enjoy Audiosurf, but that has no pretence of being a ""game"".. just a ""ride your music"" simulator.What does 1..2..3 need?  Well, it needs a single-player game for starters:  Let the player play the game using pre-determined music to begin with.  Make it nice and easy.. fun.. like it used to be.. before they added the ""three strikes and your out"" annoyance.  Once you're through, and have cracked the game using the pre-determined scores and music, open it up.. Let people play whatever.. like Audiosurf..   Add a *POINT* to the game.. you're a spy, trying to scan for agents.. or you're trying to find someone.. any point to ""scanning"" would be good, rather than just point scoring...To be honest, I couldn't be bothered with this new version.  It's a real shame because Dejobaan have clearly tried to salvage it from it's pre-alpha state.  Sadly, it's missed the mark a little.   I haven't got time to put all my music through this to see what makes a ""fun"" level, because I doubt that any of the levels are truly ""fun"", now that you've got the rule that ""hit three things and you're dead"". I have an urge to create a boring 1hr long MIDI track with a single note, and AFK-ride that note from the comfort of in front of the telly, returning to see I'd scored the highest score ever..  But it's just not worth it.  I still can't give this a thumbs-up, despite the fact it's oh-so-close to being awesome.  Sorry, Dejobaan.			"

								The only early access game I've played that's actively regressing.The last patch to this game added a feature where you can lose tracks, a bunch of gunk to the UI, and new ""levels"" that just scream loud noises into your ear for a minute or two. Oh, and added sounds that you can't turn off. Because the ""Options"" button doesn't work.Don't worry, though; since they haven't patched it for about 2 years, odds are good that it will never get worse.			"

								I loved the game to death at least in the older times. The game back then felt like it generated so much more and the background was like staring at fireworks that constantly went off but now, now it's it's the same exact background each time and the generation of buildings is not nearly as good as it used to be because of the fact it is all dependant on the level you choose making it feel more of a pattern than a generation caused by a song when the city itself feels repetative. Perhaps I need to test it on more genres of music than Cyber Goth Patient Zero but I am limited to that until the next time I can afford music like rock, rap, metal, and pop on iTunes but until then I am judging on what I see currently. I haven't much time on the game but I have seen it in the past since I watched tons after tons of videos of people playing it in past versions. The game is even less enjoyable and now you will forever play through some god damn levels that are almost exactly the same meanwhile the background no longer explodes to the beat of your ♥♥♥♥ing music. Groove is not at all like what it use to be since if I remember correctly you got grooving by flying close to object. I do that now do I fill the groove objective? No it just sits there. Grooving was pretty fun in my eyes with all this little green particles but now the ♥♥♥♥ed that. I am actually editing thise about every 5 minutes because I keep playing and it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off more and more. On the bright side the background which use to cause vision problems which I loved now does at least a few lighting effect. Mainly white, purple, green, and blue from what I have seen. I am all over the place with this review since I keep on editing and adding more. Oh also a few fancy lighting effects on the blocks. Turns out grooving is still there but it is not groove and it does nothing for your points besides an extra 4 or 6. If there is a type of generation for the song the game isn't really doing much generating is it? Give the game control over every single block and turn that into a level and call it classic. Either that or let us choose which update of the game we are on. Well I have Rock music and other now and it is the same EXACT ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.			"

Early Access Review
								Originally ""released"" in 2011, this is a prime example of everything wrong with indie games today. Dejobaan released an unfinished, buggy, short rhythm game based on their 2009 release, ""A Reckless Disregard for Gravity"". With very few maps, indistinguishable beat-matching, and recycled gameplay elements, the devs dropped this game to work on other projects only to ""release"" it again in 2013 thanks to the Early Access system.Although this game has improved (thanks to more income by being put to the top of the Early Access section of the store), it's still an incomplete, shallow, rhythmless mess that still isn't worth playing 2 years later.

								1.. 2.. 3 Kick it has came along way from being a game that was 1 of the worst games on steam not name The War Z.  The graphics are basic poligonal 3-D the audio went from this play any song you like to including some built in track that I really don't care for.  The gameplay atleast works.  Tracks no longer crap out mid song and actually finish.  The problem is that it's boring.  It feels like a horizontal AAAAAAAA Blatently Disregard for Gravity with no sense of panic or intensity.  Sure there is decent speed but at the end of the day it feels like a playable screensaver.  When we have games like Symphony and Beat Hazard, I'd say avoid even if you have those.  It's not worth your time.			"

								AKA 1..2..3.. KICK IT… this game deserves just that.  I kick in the pants.  It's no more fun that AAAaaaAAaaAaAaaaAAaa!!!  And that wasn't fun to play, say or type.  It's a soaring game where you are falling forever and flying as close as possible to objects to score points.Bland, uninspired, boring.  Why would anyone spend money on this.  I cannot recommend this at any price.  If it's $0, take it, but only for the steam trading cards it can get you and then just sell them and feel better about your lack of purchase.Visuals 3Gameplay 1Slant 1Overall : 16 "

								This game is reminicent of AaAaAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity. The mechanics are almost identical except there's no landing needing to be done at the end of a level. The levels can be generated based on any MP3 you have in your collection, so you can basically fly through your music. The first few levels were pretty slow going and merely ok. For a fluke I tried out one of the last levels (since they're all unlocked at the beginning) and it was much faster and more interesting. I actually had to deal with some quick thinking that gets you into a sort of zone.Overall I would say it's an ok casual game, but more of something mindless to do than a game to really engage in. I'll put it into my casual bin, but I probably won't play it very often.			"

								When I first got this game, it was still in a state of moderate development. I enjoyed the orignial concept enough to sink a few hours into the game. I was curious when the most recent update came out, but was utterly disappointed. What was once a semi-enjoyable interactive music visualizer became a broken plot-based saga. The developers completely derailed the original concept of the game into an unenjoyable, uninspiring style of ""story mode"" that leaves you wondering what the ♥♥♥♥ they were thinking. The game is now an unattractive mixture of bad level design, bad plot, and absolutely horrendous music choice. After all that was promised when this title was orignially released, it is disheartening to see it go so quickly south.			"

								Did you like AAAAARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHhhhhhhhh..... ... ?If so you will love 1... 2... 3... .Its much the same gameplay, though with tighter controls and can be played one-handed. Which is fantastic for one-handed gamers (A rather overlooked market frankly.)The big difference between this and the previous base jumping entries from Dejobaaaaaaaaaaaan however is that you can (now, not in the future, you can do it now.) use your own Mp3 tracks to generate levels.This is still early access however, so don't expect things to be perfect and realise there is no guarantee of a final polished product. But 1... 2... 3.. for the game it is NOW not the game you may get later.			"

								This game was originaly sold for full price but wasn't even completed. After being put on hold for a few years (still being sold) the developers figure they would now start working on it again. So now the game goes from a full retail game and gets put into ""Early Access"". I'm still not really sure how it's even legal to sell an incomplete game and have it slip past and get thrown on the Steam store to make money.The game has gotten a complete makeover and went from a game about playing music and falling through a stage collecting a score and shooting...well...nothing, you see they gave you a gun to shoot stuff but because it was never finished there was nothing to shoot. The gun has since been removed and now the game is nothing more than a screen saver that plays your music. Now the whole point of the game is to fly through a stage and get as close to an object to gain a score but you need to avoid making any kind of contact with it or you get hit, but don't worry because you can't die... I'm not really sure the developers even know what they want the game to be or what they're trying to go for. Any other music driven game knows what it wants to do and it does it well, this game on the other hand doesn't and in fact if you really wanted you could load up a song and just let go of the mouse and the level will complete itself with no assistance needed.If you want a game with absolutely no objective and no real reason to exist then this is the game for you, but if you actually want a game for your money then avoid this game at all costs.

								This is a great game if you're looking for something that you can with out having to set aside large chunks of time to play it. I feel like I've had this game for almost as long as its been of on steam and I still love starting it up and playing when ever I need to kill time between classes and can't play something more involved. That being said I have also found myself glue to this game for hours at a time. Don't let my playtime fool you much of my expeirence with this game is offline play, which steam fails to track. This game also seems to be in endless early access and constatly evolving, which helps to keep it feeling new and fresh.			"

								Although development on this game is going almost painfully slow, it is still fun to play and kill some time. You can turn your own songs into levels much like audio surf, this is where youll get most of your value from the game in its current state. If the concept intrigues you, I would recommend AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! -- A Reckless Disregard for Gravity instead for a more finished product. If youve already played it and liked what it had to offer than pick this up as well!3D vision works great and really adds to the experience.			"

								There's something about this series that I find strangely relaxing; soaring through the sky, twirling around buildings ... similar to Mirror's Edge in feel, in that there is a genuine feeling of height and falling that is just oddly cathartic to me. I'd love to see this incorporated in another game; perhaps a way to make fast travel feel less like point and click and more like travelling fantastical distances (I've always felt like my character in Bethesda Games is doing a Megaman-esque beam up whenever I fast travel). This installment brings with it full mouse control, which I find to be very tight and easy to master, the ability to use your own tracks on some levels (Yes, I used Megalovania and Arachnophilia), and an interesting character in Asumi.That said, this game has been in Early Access for quite a while, and I think I know why. As much as I like this, it does feel very much the same, and I think the developers know that and are trying to find new ways to mix up the formula. Now, I for one don't mind more of the same; I've already run through all the levels on the other games and like the idea of using my own music to mix things up again (Hopes and Dreams, people). If I had to throw in a criticism, though, the levels where I could use my own music didn't have as much level variety as I would've liked. I also echo the same sentiment as many; a free-fall option where you aren't stopped after three hits would be nice. So do I recommend this?  I'm gonna go with a very tenative yes, with a suggestion that you pick up one of the others first if you're a prospective new player and wait and see if the project has truly been abandoned before putting more than a dollar of your money up for this title in particular. I sincerely hope this isn't the case; with VR already descending on the video game industry, this (along with the previous games) is one of the titles that makes me want to plunk down the cash to see where Asumi's story takes her.

								Recommended: Yes, but ONLY if you can get it at a discount. Although the game is fun in small doses, in it's current form it offers very little longevity. Once you've played all the levels, there is little reason to go back to this game.The graphics are nice and clean, if a little basic. The mouse controls are great, really responsive, but the keyboard controls feel wonky at times: Especially scanning was erratic. I often found myself mashing 'space' just to scan something.All in all, at the moment it's a fun basic timewaster with no staying power.			"

								All the original songs in this are fantasitc.It weaves an interesting narrtive through base jumping and data gathering for creating digital human simulations, or something. Either way the great sciency lyrics and colorful, mesmerising gameplay make this my current favorite dynamic music game. Also, it's interesting to see how the music level generation changes each time the developer updates or adds on more levels. There are some really neat ""easter egg"" style levels. ""Count the False Statements"" is pretty great and the binaural one is very interesting.Overall I'd heartily reccomend this game to anyone who likes more abstract games or the current vein of games with levels generated from user music, or anyone in general really. It's certianly worth some time in my opinion.			"

								This game has made great progress since it first popped up on Steam, as an early beta. Now, almost 2 years later, it's changed a lot, but for the better. Music integration is almost on point, the environments always look stylish and playable. There isn't much in the way of gameplay variation yet, but hey, it's a relatively small game, for a good price, and who knows what the developers might add in the future, since they've added so much already. I'm excited for where it's gonna go, but I've been pleased with it so far, too.			"

								I haven't accumulated much time on this game solely based on the fact that it's not as fun as I initially thought. A first person ""Fly-Where-You-Want"" kind of game and avoiding obstacles seems like a blast at first but soon becomes monotonous because it lacks variety. Visuals are vibrant and appealing to the eye but it doesn't separate it from many other games with similar graphics. Aside from avoiding obstacles ""supposedly"" to your music, there's nothing else really going for the game. Unlike many other rhythm games such as Dance Dance Revolution, Osu!, Stepmania, Cytus, etc. The game doesn't feel like it goes with the beat since there are no ""hits"" or any real indicator that you're on beat with the music. Closest there is is when you pass by an oncoming pole or block every time an upcoming note is about to come.  The feature to add your own music to the game is interesting in itself but at the same time doesn't seem to change much of the gameplay in terms of BPM, notes, or style. There is a difference but it's so minimal that you're better off just disregarding it as it isn't noticeable.  Speaking of disregarding, the developers have also seemed to do much of the same. I'm not exactly sure how the ""completed"" product was set out to look like but many people have already shown their much hated opinion on the game. The conveniently named ""Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby"" protrays the true perception from the developers to the game and could not be more appropriate. With the promises to keep the game up to date yet releasing a new and surprisingly (not really) similar game to it's older counterpart is a clear indicator that the developers have given up. Either dropping the first game entirely or releasing a cash grab as an ""improved version"" of the first is criminal. The game is technically in Early Access, Late... Early Access. About 3-4 years in Late. Ignore what the developers have to say as for they have left this application in the dust of abandoned and unfinished games. The fact that over half of the game reviews are in the ""no-go"" zone and nothing has been done about it, it's clear that the developers are self-aware, they don't want to work. It's safe to say that the title ""1... 2... 3... KICK IT! (Drop That Beat Like an Ugly Baby)"" is unfortunately forever left in the depths of Early Access.TL;DR: Drop this game like the developers did.			"

								I DO NOT recommend this game. And I'm saying this with a heavy heart. This game, as incomplete as it is now, was something I absolutely adored. It generated levels for you on the fly, different level for every different song. The fun you could have with this game just by changing the tracks is hard to imagine, simply because how many presets there were. You could glide above piano keys, you could delve into the heart of some kind of a database system and how it looked from inside, you could fly around and dodge countless stars that could kill you. The list goes on and on.I don't know what happened to the developers or to the game itself. One day it just... updated. And everything became so much worse. It seems they tried to make up for the lack of updates with some kind of a story? But in the process they absolutely eliminated all the fun with pre-made levels and songs. Did they hire new developers and remade the game? Hell if I know. I just wish I could play the same game I played back in 2013. And it seems they abandoned the game again, and are *not* going to update it ever again. It's a lost cause, guys. Move on, there is nothing to see here.			"

								At $10 for a game that has gone through a full engine conversion (to Unity), it's pretty, but generally insubstantial.I bought the game a long time ago, not as part of whatever this potato thing everyone else keeps mentioning, simply because I like Dejobaan.My problem is that since my purchase, Dejobaan has worked with Owlchemy Labs on Aaaaa! For the Awesome, and has FINISHED Drunken Robot Pornography AND Elegy For A Dead World, while my ability to drop beats like hideous squalling infants has not been enhanced.I stopped buying Dejobaan's games after this, because I don't reward developers who sell a product with a promise to finish it, but then fail to do so.Show me a neatly wrapped, finalized product that works decently, and I'll gladly play it to review then.

								Because this game begins with the number 1. It has being on top of my steam library for a long while. Until i decided it was time to pick the bad games from the list, and put these in a list of bad games. Which i could then minimise forever. Upon playing this game I came to realise that I do not have epilepsy. Otherwise I whould now be drooling on the floor and having spastic body movements because of the severe epiliptic imagery.3/10			"

Couple this with the visceral tie of the gameplay to the music being played at the same time and it's just amazing.At the moment though, it doesn't accept the full range of formats (and maybe doesn't at all) that Audiosurf and the like will accept, but the 15 or so tunes packed with the game are pretty awesome anyway. Also each soundtrack has multiple levels of replayability as the construction of the level depends on the ""city"" you've selected. So one city will have you falling through grid sections of long blocks, whilst another will be sending you weaving through cylinders punctuated by spinning fans and spokes. Not sure how many cities there are yet, as more get unlocked as you play, but of the 5 I've unlocked, each one breathes new life into the old tracks.This game has progressed a LONG way from where it was during the Potato pack, and really all it needs now is player selected music sources to be excellent.

								Apparently this game is still In ""Development"", though I have no idea how much farther they are planning to take it. I figure the release implies they are close to done, and unless they have a lot more tweaks to put in I am dissapointed. The game needs loads of polish to begin with, and the only thing that each song does to the level is speed it up or down. I'll admit that it does time the score circles pretty well with the beat in most cases, but it's pretty much the same pattern of obstacles and point positions.Who knows? Maybe in time it will be fixed and a really cool game. I for one expected more and with games like Audiosurf and Beat Hazard, I figured this would bring something more to the table. Oh and apprently there will be enemies to shoot, that might help some but if the pattern of blocks never changes I can see this getting old real fast.All in all, I only payed 5 bucks so I'm not outrageously dissapointed and mad over this game but this seems like a really ugly baby.

								If you are looking for a simple triptastic game this one is not bad. The level generation is well done, and the player can also opt out of too much of the challenge in later levels by hiding around the edges of the levels.

								I got bored one night and saw that this game had the option to earn some Steam Trading Cards- so rather than waste money on the market buying them, I decided to play it in order to get half the cards thinking it surely cannot be that bad- as I remembered playing this game two years ago and saying it was terrible. To my surprise, it was honestly quite fun- random, but fun. From what I could understand, the aim of the game is to get yourself as close to objects as possible, but not clip into then, the closer you are- the more points you earn. The objects in the level are based off what music is playing during the level, as the level is generated from what music is selected and you can import your own music in to basically generate your own levels.I don't have many music files on my PC, so I just had to use what I had, but I still found it quite fun however it soon gets boring and repetitive.I'd play this game if you ever just want to chill, listen to music and relax a little. It's most certainly NOT worth its full price, but if it's in a cheap bundle, I wouldn't hesitate to get it.			"

								You fall through the air to the sound of your music. While falling you hit plates to the beat of your music. You will shoot things to make it through certain parts of different songs to gain even more songs. The graphics are simple and are perfect for this game. If you are photosensitive then this isn't the best game for you. The overall game incorporates things from the game ""AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAa A Reckless Disregard For Gravity!!"" but you don't have to learn how to land at the end of the level, all you do is finish the song. Its fun casual game for anyone wanting to just get a quick game in. Ive really enjoyed playing this game and I know you will too if your into music based games.			"

								Ignoring the painful fact that this game has been in Early Access for more than 4 years - before Early Access was even a thing - and seldom updated since while the developers have gone on to release a couple more games since, this game tries to be somewhat like the developer's previous 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAA' games, which were genuinely quite fun... but it never succeeds in being like that. The developers claim as much - they never really found that special formula for it.You're falling down a structure, and your goal is to weave back and forth to pass by as many parts as possible without hitting anything. The interaction with music never really seemed to be meaningful - usually what you end up going down is on the sparse side, and not too challenging either.			"

								This game is a good reason why early access should be regulated somehow. I was so excited when i heard about ""Kick it"" being like Audiosurf but with base jumping.It turned out to be one of the biggest piles of steaming wank i own. This game had a mountain of potential, i mean, you get to base jump to music in a level  that was generated to fit the music, how much better could it get? Well, for a start, it doesn't even look like a city, making the whole illusion of you base jumping become shattered from the very start which leads to it feeling rather awful. The Humour is also a painfully annoying thing about this game. Yes, humour is a more personal thing, but when the title involves a joke, it becomes very boring, very quickly. It feels like a child who saw his parents laugh at his joke, so he won't shut up about it. They attempt to give the main character a story, but in all honesty, she feels too boring and underdeveloped to make you give a single care for her.I could make an entire list about why this game should be avoided, but i shall just cut to the most important reason:THE DEVELOPERS ABANDONED IT.

								[EDIT] dead game, don't buy[ORIGINAL REVIEW: Recommended]Maybe I should actually talk about this game seriously since the old beta was trashed and a completely new version was created recently.Despite the fact that I compared the old beta to Audiosurf in my original ""review"" (not that I make proper reviews or anything), it was actually really bad. You had to control your fall AND shoot enemies with cursor-based camera controls instead of your typical mouse camera controls (try to think of using Wii FPS or RTS camera controls in a normal FPS). The levels were also empty and boring.In this new version, the controls and stages have been greatly improved. It contains proper mouse camera controls and the levels have much more objects in them, making the levels much more interesting (though don't expect these levels to always be filled with objects). The shooting mechanic has been removed, letting you focus more on your maneuvers as you fall. This is a huge improvement in my opinion because I always hated the shooting mechanic in the old beta; it always caused me to fly off-track or crash into a wall.Even though you see me praising the new version, don't expect to have a full game that'll take away hundreds of hours of your life. As of now, the game is only about falling; no special rings, plates, obstacles, or other mechanics that fit the ""falling to your music"" theme (but I guess the simplicity adds to the appeal a bit). However, the game is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, so I expect Dejobaan to add more stuff to the game as time goes on. Besides, it uses your own music, so it can have a lot of replayability if you enjoy it.			"

Music integration is almost on point, the environments always look stylish and playable. There isn't much in the way of gameplay variation yet, but hey, it's a relatively small game, for a good price, and who knows what the developers might add in the future, since they've added so much already. I'm excited for where it's gonna go, but I've been pleased with it so far, too.			"

								All the original songs in this are fantasitc.It weaves an interesting narrtive through base jumping and data gathering for creating digital human simulations, or something. Either way the great sciency lyrics and colorful, mesmerising gameplay make this my current favorite dynamic music game. Also, it's interesting to see how the music level generation changes each time the developer updates or adds on more levels. There are some really neat ""easter egg"" style levels. ""Count the False Statements"" is pretty great and the binaural one is very interesting.Overall I'd heartily reccomend this game to anyone who likes more abstract games or the current vein of games with levels generated from user music, or anyone in general really. It's certianly worth some time in my opinion.			"

								I bought this nearly 5 years ago with the promise that it would be completed. Well this game is vapourware, it will NEVER be finished. It hasn't even been *updated* since 2013. It's a great concept but not worth any amount of money.			"

								Achievement is not possible to get. For some of us, we want to make sure we've accomplished the challenges the game makers set for us. Not be jerked around by them.Anyway, this game continually changes in major ways. I used to know how to play it. The whole thing is completely different, level 2 won't load, it's basically been in Alpha for years.			"

								Fairly promising game but the developers have completely abandoned it and given a bad name to every early access game that has ever been created and ever will be created. It wasn't that fun in the first place but they're still trying to charge $10 for it? Steam needs to delete it and remove the admin's account while they're at it. 1/10			"

								Achievement Progress at time of writing: 0/1 (0%, this was a Steam Summer achievement only, and is unobtainable now)This game is basically a mix of Audiosurf and AAAAAAaaaaAAAA......you freefall from the sky to a landing pad, getting close to objects to score points, and the level is generated based on your music.I personally did not have a lot of fun with it, and I would suggest money be spent elsewhere.

Early Access Review
								This game is a good reason why early access should be regulated somehow. I was so excited when i heard about ""Kick it"" being like Audiosurf but with base jumping.It turned out to be one of the biggest piles of steaming wank i own. This game had a mountain of potential, i mean, you get to base jump to music in a level  that was generated to fit the music, how much better could it get? Well, for a start, it doesn't even look like a city, making the whole illusion of you base jumping become shattered from the very start which leads to it feeling rather awful. The Humour is also a painfully annoying thing about this game. Yes, humour is a more personal thing, but when the title involves a joke, it becomes very boring, very quickly. It feels like a child who saw his parents laugh at his joke, so he won't shut up about it. They attempt to give the main character a story, but in all honesty, she feels too boring and underdeveloped to make you give a single care for her.I could make an entire list about why this game should be avoided, but i shall just cut to the most important reason:THE DEVELOPERS ABANDONED IT.

Early Access Review
								Ignoring the painful fact that this game has been in Early Access for more than 4 years - before Early Access was even a thing - and seldom updated since while the developers have gone on to release a couple more games since, this game tries to be somewhat like the developer's previous 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAA' games, which were genuinely quite fun... but it never succeeds in being like that. The developers claim as much - they never really found that special formula for it.You're falling down a structure, and your goal is to weave back and forth to pass by as many parts as possible without hitting anything. The interaction with music never really seemed to be meaningful - usually what you end up going down is on the sparse side, and not too challenging either.			"

								Since they're updated the game...finally, guess I'll update the review. Basically this is a simulation of base jumping and gliding around objects that pulse to music. Oh..wait...you're still reading about paying $10 for this....why?Got this game I think nearly 2 years ago in a bundle. It was early access then...and it still is. George RR Martin must be helping create the game. With that said, you'll die alot too because you can only hit objects 3 times. More than IRL, but you're more than free to try and play it that way.Used to be you could hit until your meter thing ran out...so if you kept it up you could get the feel of the level while smaking crap. Not anymore! Now, 3 smacks is it and by the time you figure out what happened and where you're going, it's time to try over...well if you want to anyway; after a few tries I decided I wasn't really all that interested anyway.That may seem fun to some, but not to me! I do like a couple of the songs, but they aren't good enough to put up with the game.			"

								As-is, it's a dumbed-down version of AudioSurf without the player-base, mod support, or dev support.Any hope of it improving is misplaced, as it's been radio silence from the devs for around 4 years.It might be worth it if you can get it for $0.99, but it sure as hell isn't worth $10.  And honestly I wouldn't suggest giving these folks money for something that is not - and will never be - finished.			"

								The game is just as amusing as the title.Fun as hell game to play, basically it's one of those rhythm games, where you avoid obstacles and get points. It's kind of like audiosurf, except you base jump. You can even import your own music, and the game creates the level for you! It's well worth 10 dollars though, imho.			"
