Posted: July 2, 2014
												I grew up playing the Nintendo version of Bionic Commando (there was an arcade version too) and loved the game enough to still play it to completion every year. It was the first game that had a swear and a gruesome scene of someone's head blowing up. For those that haven't played or heard of Bionic Commando, its a 2D gunning platformer with a world map and different, unique and vibrant levels with a wide variety of enemies. If you think you've done every 2D platformer before, have you tried a platformer with no jump button? This game really hangs its hat on the fact that you use a bionic arm for platform traversal. The arm is pretty versatile, the normal arm button launches it diagonally, when you use a direction and the arm it will blast out forward, and ducking while using the arm will send it forward, but lower. You can use the arm upward too. With the arm you can swing and climb. You can release the arm's grasp to drop and release the swing. In this version of the game you can grapple barrels, pick them up and throw them. Its a nice touch. You can also use your arm to counter bullets. Its a nice feature.With the overhead map you and your helicopter pilot will fly around to different areas / levels. There are two types of areas. Combat zones and neutral zones where you'll talk with people, obtain items that will help you and club a prisoner with your bionic arm. The combat zones have been modernized while still giving them a vibrant, colorful feel that makes it feel like a game in a good way. The excellent old chip tunes have been modernized and they all sound good, but personally, I prefer the older tunes.The combat areas have a two or three sections, usually broken up with a communication room that will further the story for you and open doors to the next segment of the area. So an outside area will go indoors, a towering spire will reveal the upper half of the spire when you use the communication room. You can also wire tap in the communication room and new to this version of Bionic Commando is a simple mini game that has you hurling a yellow ball in a three dimensional box. If the ball exits the box, then you fail, but there's no consequence for failing like the Nintendo classic where enemies would flood the room. The goal is to rotate the box and hurtle the ball to yellow blocks that will prevent the ball from going out of bounds. Its pretty easy and it breaks up the game. Its just extra icing on the cake. The game also has communication chips like the old game, so in certain areas you'll need to have the blue chip to communicate. The Nintendo version of the game had you pick a weapon, a communication chip and an item when entering each level. Thankfully this version lets you use all of your chips, which will spare you some time.As for the weapons, to be honest, its a little underwhelming. You have your standard 2 bullets on screen revolver, a weak laser, a short range shotgun, a rocket launcher and a bouncing laser that shoots at an angle. The angled laser can shoot enemies hiding behind cover or above you, but since the game gives you so many other ways to kill covered enemies it seems useless.. The original Nintendo game had a 3 way gun that felt useful and the original rocket launcher would plow through enemies. Now there seems to be an emphasis on realism where the explosion of the rocket launcher will damage if not kill you. The rockets also wave, giving it a chance to miss. The shotgun does the same damage as two bullets from your revolver. The weapons just feel useless when compared to the simple starting revolver. You'll be able to change your weapons on the fly with the shoulder buttons, which again is a welcome tweak to gameplay from the Nintendo version forcing you to be stuck with one weapon the entire level. The most useful weapon not in the Nintendo version is a simple grenade. So you use 3 buttons, arm, gun and grenade throw. Its a good way to kill enemies behind cover.On the map, your helicopter moves along lines level to level, giving you choice of where to go. The only catch is that convoys patrol these lines and if you run into one, you'll fight in a top down stage. Its nice combat diversity that doesn't last long. You can use your arm to whip away bullets, but each of these areas is over quickly. You can find easy lives this way.One of the biggest changes from the Nintendo to the Rearmed version is 2 player co-op through the levels and also multi-player death match mode. They feel like good add ons, but for those that like the single player, the biggest change are the bosses. The original Nintendo bosses were more like enemy rooms with a core at the center. Now the bosses are giant machines for the most part. These machines take a good chunk of time to destroy, have different patterns and phases of the boss fight. Its a really nice change to the original. Plus, the bosses have some character and brief dialog before each fight. It adds a lot of charm to the game.As for challenge, the game is easier than the Nintendo version. You can take more damage, you have more attacks and can use multiple items at once. There is no real consequence to the game like there was on Nintendo. There are unlimited continues, using all of your lives merely sends you to the map. The game feels easier and you can take more bullets before you die.In later areas when using the arm on horizontally moving platforms, the arm is suddenly very flawed. It will let go quickly if the platform you are on is moving. Sometimes, climbing onto a moving platform will nudge you off the back of it. You can even run against the movement where suddenly you're running in place when the platform is moving to the left and you are running to the right. Or trying to drop off platforms will sometimes bump you back onto them. Toward the end of the game it turns into a fight against the game's mechanic on top of what can already be a forgiving arm hit detection that doesn't always grab onto things. A lot of the time the arm will grab onto something as its retracting. The Nintendo version had that flaw too, but it wasn't nearly as abundant as in Rearmed.For children of the 80s this was a difficult game on Nintendo, but now it might run you 4 hours to complete. There are a few difficulties to chose from too. I can say that $2.50 is a good price for the game, but I have difficulty justifying $10 for a game this old that is really just a fresh coat of paint with some memorable bosses. The levels are quick and don't offer much challenge to veterans who have already completed the game 20+ years ago. There are a few new levels including the final level that feels excessively long. There are plenty of challenge rooms inside non combat zones where you're forced to get from point A to point B, but that's hardly an attraction. The game has in game medals, but no Steam achievements. After everything being said, I prefer the original and I think that the sequel to this remake is a better game, mostly because I felt like I hadn't already played it.			"

Excellent remasterBionic Commando: Rearmed is a remaster, developed by Capcom, of the orginal 'Bionic Commando' released on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES).The Good- Audio = Remix of old soundtrack from orignal game. Sounds great whilst maintaining its roots.- Graphics  - Story- Atmosphere - Unique gameplay = Unlike other platformer, you can't jump and have to rely on your 'Claw' get past obstacles or climb platforms. The claw also deflects bullets and has other uses as well.- 12 level campaign - 56 challenge maps = Mainly testing your skills with the 'Bionic Arm'. People looking for a REAL challenge will enjoy these.- Co-op = Done locally, where you tackle the campaign with a friend.- Multiplayer = Done locally where up to four players face off in a stage.- Diverse difficulty levels = There are 3, with the fourth unlocked after completing campaign. Levels determine the number of enemies and traps encountered.- Variety of weapons = Besides your standard rifle you can get: Machine gun, rocket launcher, shotgun, link gun and grenades.- Plenty of secrets = Secret areas are located in each level which contain a unique weapon upgrade.- Helpful Tutorial = Must play for beginners as it teaches you the essentials to completing the game.The Bad- Controls = They are not too bad (I played with M+keyboard), but this game was definitely made to be played with controller.- No online co-op or multiplayer  - May need walkthrough = Some stages and boss fights might get a bit tricky.Final VerdictVeteran of the orignal, will love this remaster as well as those looking for a unique and challenging action-platformer.

												As a remake of the classic NES title ""Bionic Commando"", this game got the full HD treatment - widescreen support, a kick@ss soundtrack by Payday composer Simon Viklund, a complete graphical overhaul with 3D characters, co-op mode, and more.The negative reviews for this seem to be about the control scheme - which stays true to its classic NES roots. There is NO jumping in this game - every vertical move you make is using your bionic arm. Hence the title, BIONIC COMMANDO. Figuring out what paths to take to get where you want to go is part of the fun. If you can't (or refuse to) figure it out for yourself, you shouldn't be playing this game.			"

												EDIT: I really wanted to update the review since lots of people have problems with drivers and can't google it for some strange reasons. You can find the legacy driver on the official NVIDIA website: http://www.nvidia.co.uk/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver-uk.htmlIt will work simultaneously with the new drivers, but will fix all the older games that used PhysX like Gears of War, Medal of Honor Airborne, Dragon Age Origins, etc.Now to the review.""LOL NO FOKEN JUMPS 0/10"",-typical negative review for the game. Pros:+Nice remaster+Old-school gameplay+Good graphics for a 2008 platformer+Couch coop+Awesome soundtrack+Controller supportCons:-A bit wacky controls for both keyboard and controller (note: I have beaten the game years ago fully on keyboard, so controls are definitely not unplayable)-Becomes a bit boring after some time playing-Graphics are a bit acid for me, even though very close to the original.Verdict: 8/10. If you liked the first game, you'll definitely enjoy this remaster. Xbox 360 controller strongly recommended.			"

												Great remastering of an old classic. Very fun and unique to have a platformer where you can not jump at all.Many people complain about the difficulty or ""clunky"" controls. The game is supposed to have very restrictive movement. It isn't a simulation of what it would be like to be a bionic commando -- it is a game first and foremost. Overcoming the strict control and movement mechanisms is the challenge, but can be very rewarding. Watch a YouTube speed run player and you'll see how fluid it can become once you master it.Be warned though: you NEED to have a controller. The game is *literally* unbeatable on Hard+. It is impossible to beat the end boss without a controller due to being unable to remap the keyboard to split rocket launcher control from character movement. Outside of the end boss the game is extremely fun.			"

												Bionic Commando is an amazing recreation of the classic NES game from Capcom. The original game is near and dear to my heart, so I had pretty lofty expectations for the remastered and modernized version. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Bionic Commando does just about everything you could hope for in terms of taking the things that made a golden age classic into the new generation. The controls are fluid and tight, the graphics are amazing, and the soundtrack...oh wow. This isn't a game you will breeze through. Bionic Commando forces the player to practice, honing their skills with each new play session. The game is challenging, but not overly difficult in a frustrating way. Whether you have played the NES classic, or are looking to experience the game for the first time, I can't recommend Bionic Commando enough.			"

												A remake of an old Capcom Classic that was in arcades and on the NES.  Like any old, popular game, good music usually an attributing factor. The tunes here are remixed by Simon Viklund to be contemporary, hard hitting, and faithful.  There is beautiful, reimagined character art by reknown Capcom artist, Shinkiro.  They even added some comedy, even though retroactively inserting your own humor into an old favorite is risky.  It works though. The entire package feels incredibly professional, and there are even co-op and challenge modes.One of the better 2D action games I've played, and a much better effort than the recently reimagined Strider. It is a bit difficult and intentionally obtuse, so beware aspiring gamer bro: there is no jump button, and you are to get around by swinging and grappling.			"

												Simply put, Bionic Commando: Rearmed is the greatest remake in the history of gaming. Not only does the game have incredibly pleasing visuals and music, but the tight gameplay from the original NES game is still fully intact, with some innovations as well.If you haven't played this game or the original, basically you're a guy with a grapple arm and you can't jump. You get around by swinging from stuff, and which way your grapple goes all depends on which direction you hold down. The controls are so damn precise that after a while you'll instinctively be pulling off all kinds of sweet grapples and be swinging around like spiderman. The level design takes heavy inspiration from the original but some of the levels have been modified, as well as many of the boss fights which can prove to be challenging if you lose your cool. On top of that, there's TONS of challenge levels that will keep you playing long after you've beaten the game, allowing you to hone your grapple skills even further.Rearmed is worth your money. Hands down. Buy it.And yes, you still get to blow up Hitler's face with a rocket, and see it in all of it's goryness.			"

Have NFC that Bionic Commando is more a a ""puzzle platformer"" and♥♥♥♥♥♥and whine about their being no jump button. (25% of neg reviews).Everyone else who likes classic puzzle platforming games in general, or the original Bionic Commando in particular (and aren't too much of a nitwit to install the necessary legacy Physx driver) will likely enjoy this game.tl;dr? -> It's probably not for milennials and/or PC noobs.

												Can't recommend a game that requires me to go out of my way and try to find 3-year-old PhysX legacy drivers (instead of doing it upon actual game installation) just because it's been outdated, poorly developed and it's not like Capcom can't get a fix on this. I'll review my review once the game is playable (because I do know Bionic Commando was a great game back in the day).Either an update or a disclaimer on the store page is not too much to ask. GOG offers it to all the games they sell.-------------------------------------------Crash in application version: 1.1.0.12714This game requires an up to date version of Ageia PhysX and associated DLLs.

												I came here with the purpose of finding a game I didn't like and seeing if it was worth a negative review.Glad I came back to this one.  As it turns out, its a rough diamond.Its a jarring game to play initially.  We are so used to knowing what a shooter is and what a platformer is.  When a game like Bionic Commando denies us a jump button then it becomes very stressful.  My advice is do the tutorials and attempt the challenge rooms within the friendly zones first.They will teach you the mechanics and you will quickly be able to move fluidly the way you want to and be a true bionic commando, instead of a slow clunky frustrated commando wondering what you are doing.The swing mechanics of the bionic arm are very fun once you take a few minutes to get used to them, and you will be taking on platforms and bad guys with ease quickly.  You won't even mind not having a jump button after you've figured it all out.Level progression is a bit different too.  Area 0 is a friendly zone that must be entered to find the tutorial, and Area 1 must be entered to find the challenge rooms that put into practice more of the advanced skills.You won't initially know where to go, but by exploring the areas you can access you will eventually build up a handy arsenal of equipment and knowledge of the game.   I highly recommend exploring all the friendly zone to start with and entering the rooms to collect useful equipment as well as getting used to moving around outside of combat.  After you've comfortably explored the friendly areas and rooms, tackle the nearby accessable low numbered areas and dominate those enemies in combat.As an example of a time where you will be initially confused, you need to explore a friendly zone to get the flares you need to more easily explore Area 4.  The level can still possibly be completed, but you will get frustrated wondering why an early level has you zipping about blind trying to find a random platform or bit of wall you need to succeed.  Turns out exploration of a friendly zone was the answer and only one I discovered by accident after getting frustrated and quitting out to try another stage.Bosses are in every enemy stage, and there is a great mechanic where you can hack enemy consoles for a chance of learning the boss weakness.  I found the early bosses to be easy enough that I didn't get frustrated and wanted to keep playing.  Beating bosses earns you more gear as well as more levels to play with so its a rewarding experience.There are also enemy trucks zipping about the world map also give you a chance to play a different kind of shooting game and experiment with weapons.  Its a bit repetitive, but a fun distraction between the main game.In conclusion, Bionic Commando Rearmed is definitely a game that tries something different and succeeds.  If you can cope with it being different, put in that half an hour to learn how to play the game.  There is a real treat lying ahead for you.EDIT: I'll admit later levels and challenges do become frustrating so just enjoy the fun bits.			"

Posted: September 4, 2015
												Absolutely spectacular remake of one of the most iconic games from my childhood. Bionic Commando was one of the very best games for NES, and remains a very fun game to this day. This remake is a faithful rendition of the old classic with updated graphics.I was wary when I first got this game, afraid they may have added new controls to make full use of an XBox controller. But that apprehension went out the window as soon as I started playing. The graphics look beautiful, I was stunned to see how good this old game looks with new visuals, and I was amazed to find they kept the old control scheme: D-pad (or left joystick) and just two buttons (A and B). To any of you who might be thinking ""wow, just two buttons, OMG WTF???"" you're missing the point of this game. It's old-school platforming fun, with a really good plot and great challenges that really make you think. This is the kind of game I want my kids to play (whenever I have them in a few years). The mechanics are a bit frustrating at times, since there is no ""jump"" button, no ""run"" button, or any of the other frills you would find in most third-person shooters. Instead, you have just two buttons: one to shoot your gun, and another to shoot your bionic arm, which functions basically like a grappling hook. You can shoot the grappling hook in exactly 5 directions: straight left, straight right, 45 degrees up-left, 45 degrees up-right, and straight up. Though this might seem like a limitation, it's actually an integral part of what gives this game its challenge and creativity. Back in the day when this was programmed for NES, it was the pinnacle of gaming, and today, it's a wonderful challenge that gets better and better as you play longer and get used to the controls. The reason I want my future kids to play this kind of game is that it really forces you to think outside the box. For example, there are some areas that seem impassable, but with a bit of thought, you can jump off the platform, turn back and catch onto it, then swing past and catch another platform with a little bit of timing. Things like that are what makes Bionic Commando something unique in the world of gaming, teaching kids (or nostalgic adults) how to think outside the box and work with what you have to overcome challenges. As I mentioned before, the graphics look great. It's not absolutely stunning, definitely not on par with Skyrim or The Witcher 3, but still very good. If you played the NES classic like me, then you will be absolutely blown away, but for people who are new to Bionic Commando, it probably won't stun you. There's nothing wrong with the graphics, it's just obvious that it's a minimalistic platformer. The tutorial reminds me of Frozen Synapse, while the main game looks similar to Valdis Story: An Abyssal City, but less cartoony. Speaking of the tutorial, you really should play it when you get to it. If you haven't played Bionic Commando before, you'll need the time to get used to the controls, and if you have, you could probably use a refresher course, especially since you'll be using an XBox controller instead of the NES controller. Please, for the love of God, don't try to play this game with your keyboard. For one thing, I don't think you can get a true feel for the game without using a real D-pad and real A & B buttons, and for another, some of the reviews have stated that in later levels the key binding is messed up which is very problematic when you're facing a Boss Battle where one false move could spell your doom. I'm actually seriously considering getting a USB NES controller specifically for this game, but it works great with an XBox controller so there's no need for that unless you're just nostalgic.Sound quality is excellent, I think it does a great job of staying true to the classic sounds while updating them to the modern era. The music sounds like a revamped version of the original soundtrack, and the sound effects are a perfect blend of just enough chiptunes to make it feel older, while still maintaining a level of modern quality. Overall, this is a spectacular game that I would recommend to anyone who is a fan of platformers or looking to try one. With various difficulty levels to choose from, it has great replay value, and it's simple to learn but difficult to master. $10 isn't that much for a game these days, and Bionic Commando goes on sale pretty regularly so I'd say it's definitely worth every penny. Oh, who am I kidding? I can't try to write an unbiased review of Bionic Commando: Rearmed, this is a faithful remake of one of the first video games I ever played. It's awesome because I said so, now buy it and love it. --------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												I played this game a ton as a kid, so to soak it all and remember it, I went back and played through the original Bionic Comando First. Which was a GREAT game but it had a few issues itself.The intro starts off remade well and pretty true to the original, Wow this is a decent remake I must say, Brand new graphics, same ol story,the touch ups look nice, the levels and characters are drawn nicely, he looks like he moves smoother, but Now onto what really matters, the gameplay, the controls feel pretty tight (not a good thing), the original was a little hard, but it moved a little smoother especially with crouching and shooting, its like he takes a little too long in the remake its not near as fluid it seemed to me, the sound fx upgrades were nice, the way the claw grabs items works great. I do like the upgrade that you just press up to go into the door thats perfectly sized now, vs the original hold it for 3 seconds to go in a door that looked smaller than your guy was lol.And pause for a minute is it just me or does this dude kinda resemble Duke Nukem? Anyways back to the review.It is very aesthetically pleasing to fans of the original such as myself.I love the mini game to try to hack the sytem as well, nice addition. I also like that the extra life looked 8 bit nice touch there as well.The boss battles were also well done, overall I thoroughly enjoyed this remake minus the few flaws it did have, it did improve on many things from the original game and was a nice flashback playing and fun with the additions.Pros:+ Way Better Graphics+ Dedicated Remake+ Nice Additions+ Co Op+ Vintage Flashbacks for us older gamersCons:- No Trading Cards- No Achievements- Controls Don't seem as fluid, but not they are not horrible.I'd still recomend it to any one who loved the original or who wanted to experience what gaming use to be like with better graphics tho lolThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.

												This here is how you remake a game, gentlepersons. Maintains all the charm of the original and expands on it with much improved playability and expanded gameplay. Not to mention the awesome soundtrack. A sure bet if you're in the mood for a challenging platformer and well worth the asking price.Not to be confused with the decidedly average 3D Bionic Commando.			"

Great soundtrack, additional challenge rooms outside of the adventure,  many unique boss fights. Its an awesome game!  Controller supported. Its all here!! I really dont know why this has 'mixed' reviews. Its a 9/10 for me. I would recommend this game to people who like platformers, classic NES throwback, challenging but not too punishing!			"

												A fantastic remake of a classic nes game. Everything in the nes version is included, and improved. Music is better, new weapons and items are included and a bunch of the useless aspects of the original game are scrapped.The only negative thing about this game is the lack of online multiplayer. Local multiplayer does exist, but like come on, who in todays world actually has real life friends?Play it.			"

												If you grew up during the same time as I did then you played the original Bionic Commando on nintendo and loved it. This is a blast from the past! I say you should buy this game if you even remotely liked the original. This reboot is so much like it. I have recommended it to all of my friends.			"

												Fantastic Remake of a classic game.When I tell most people of my favorite NES game back in the day, most have never heard of Bionic Commando. This remake captured the spirit of the original and added some great weapons and features. It was challenging and totally worth it. Even if you beat the game, there are about 50 challenge rooms, some of which will have you scratching your head. Definately buy this!			"

												I thought the idea of the bionic arm reach replacing ""jump"" was neat and I really enjoyed the first few levels... Felt like being spiderman slining webing!  The first few levels drew me in and i didn't think the controls were all that difficult to grasp.   Fast forward a few levels and my play expereince was ruined by clunky controls which i couldn't get over.  The annoying thing for me is that failing jumps and swings later on often results in a death requiring me to repeat contnet to get to where i'm having trouble... And sometimes that journey is difficult at least for me and i don't always make it to the ""hard"" part and then when i finally do I have a good chance of choking and repetead death. I don't mind getting owned in a game, but in this game, more often than not my failiures feel like fustrations because the controls are too clunky or ridgid for me to get my hero to what i want him to do.   I would have apprecaited an easy mode with better check points for people like me who would like to get through the game and have a casual good time.			"

												One thing I suspect divides reviewers of this game is whether they remember the original Bionic Commando - if you do, that will set your expectations accordingly and you will go in expecting a platform game with solid weapons where the main fun is in the experience of using/swinging around on the arm, and yes, slightly repetitive gameplay at times. If that is what you are going in for, this game hits the spot perfectly If that is *not* what you're expecting, though, it could feel like something of a let-down, because while it starts out looking like a fairly story-driven FPS, runs through the standard Super Soldier stuff like Metal Gear Solid/Rambo/Deus Ex/Commando etc. (you are the ultimate warrior of bygone days, called upong to reluctantly return to service and save the day), it really is just a platformer. I think this could cause some to take a dim view of the game, which is understandable. Anyway, the whole thing is better than I was led to believe, and is a solidly implemented nod to something *like* the original in 3D. Swing, kill, get out of the line of fire, kill, swing, get a better gun, swing, kill - like spiderman with guns, as a platform game. Swinging on the arm is done brilliantly, guns work well and you get upgrades regularly (one at a time like the original game, some would have liked to see a pack full of weapons to switch between but in fairness that might not make sense given the character). Boss battles are well done, satisfying and interesting without any of the tedium and brokenness that seems to plague many games' boss battles. There is one possible exception on the boss battles thing, but a) it is spoilerish and b) doesn't ruin the game. Overall, this platformer scores well. Before you play, watch some videos of the original 2D game and see what you are signing up for - and if you decide to go in knowing that Splinter Cell it ain't, this game is good, solid, old-fashioned fun. Overall, graphics aren't particularly fabulous, it's a (fairly) repetitive platformer, and nostalgia would not have carried it alone, but it scores an 8/10 from me for one reason, something that is missing so often from games: Playability			"

Summary/Overview Bionic Commando is a rated Mature run-and-gun side-scrolling platformer very similar to Contra. The primary characteristic alike in both of these games is the ability only to swing from area to area instead of including a button to jump. I know that many children and teenagers growing up won’t be able to appreciate this remake of the classic Nintendo Entertainment System game because it already seems to hard without a jump button. I do realize wholeheartedly the stigma that would♥♥♥♥♥♥modern-day gamers off. I understand you, but I assure you if you have some time, patience and practice, then you will get good at this game and succeed. One of the main hallmarks in the Contra and the Bionic Commando series is action-packed run-and-gun gameplay that shows no mercy toward enemies.Original release: Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, Game Boy in 1992Newly updated release Bionic Commando Rearmed: August 14, 2008, PC release, also released on PlayStation Network and Xbox LivePublisher, Developer: CapcomGenre: action, side-scrolling, platformer Presentation     The graphics have been updated from the original Nintendo Entertainment System counter-part. They are now more crisp, show improved lighting and have a better enemy, environment animations. The story is presented through communication hubs that tell you more about the story as you progress through the levels. The story is the classic hallmark of many real-life warzone tales and stories of today.Gameplay     The primary characteristic that sets Bionic Commando and Contra apart from many platformers now is that they can be played in a variety of ways. If you are really good already at the game, you can choose to speedrun while skipping the story and many enemies. You don’t always have to take on every single enemy; this is all up to you based on how much health you currently have and how well you trust in your skills. Unlike some platformers that require only button pressing to be successful, Bionic Commando requires you to know enemy patterns precisely; Capcom did this within the original Mega Man games as well. If your movement is even the slightest bit unprecise, you are going to have to replay levels again and again until you clear them.      In fact, I remember watching some gamers on the REACT YouTube channel play the original Contra on the original Nintendo and they struggled. The difference there was that Contra allowed for extra continues. However, Bionic Commando Rearmed does not have that feature. Either you occasionally gain extra lives from level to level and refill more health by defeating random enemies, or you have one life to make the most of it.Does Bionic Commando Rearmed Appeal to the Modern-Age Gamers in the Digital Generation?     Yes, and no. If you are a modern-day gamer that wants a trip back through nostalgia and have never played the old-school side-scrolling hard platformers that were around back then, this will give you a first-person test-drive through all those years, in the late 1980’s through early 1990’s. However, if you are like me and don’t have as much time as you used to right now to play games and not enough patience or time before moving on to other games in your backlog, then I would not recommend it. However, if you don’t have a fairly large backlog and want something to play for a long while, constantly improving and transitioning between all the difficulties from easy to hard.Controls     You use basic mechanics on the keyboard while using the arrow keys also to control your release of your bionic arm. You need precise aim to be able to swing and pull yourself up to other platforms. This is the hallmark of these original side-scrolling games like this. The controls work ok for keyboard and mouse, but I know I am not alone when I say that the original experience is much better through using a controller. It would be awesome if there could be PC compatibility for a Nintendo Entertainment System controller.Positive, Negative AspectsPros•Awesome 8-bit soundtrack that is high action•Awesome main character model that has been updated from the original. The main character looks cooler than he did before•Enemy models are represented based on their colors by faction•It is fun to run-and-gun and shoot enemies that we need to kill for a purpose•Excellent objectives, goals and milestones to work towardsCons•Might not appeal to the current generation of gamers we currently have•Takes much time and patience since there is also one initial life without any continues in single-player•More variety of controller options would be a nice addition for Capcom to add eventually•Capcom, give us a remastered version of the 2008 more current generation version to go along with this oneOverall- 7/10     A good remake of a classic side-scrolling platformer that takes strategy, time and patience to master.Key1-3 = poor4-5 = ok6-7 = good8-10 = amazingDisclaimer     This game was provided by Accidently Reviewed.

A remake of the classic NES title that seems to stay very true to its core gameplay mechanics whilst also adding other content.Plays fine on a keyboard but a controller would probably be more recommended whatwith it being a platformer. The controller input isn't rebindable and there are preset control types the game allows you to use but the controls themselves should be relatively simple enough to play through with.Difficulties range from Easy, Medium, and Hard. From what I see Hard mode on this game overall makes it a bit harder than the NES Bionic Commando with its high number, damage resisting, beefed up enemy count and Spencer being able to sustain fewer damage.As it goes like with the NES one there are two kinds of gameplay, its core platforming sections which is basically 90% of the game and the occassional top-down shooter sections. The top-down shooter sections are as occassional as before. When trying to select an stage you do so from a somewhat visually appalling-in-comparison mapscreen where you're a helicopter hovering over a numbered Area to descend to. The top-down shooter sections will only come up likely by chance because you happen to be trying to select an area to descend to from the overhead map and and an enemy truck on the map happens to come your way. It's still as basic as ever; top-down perspective, shoot anything that shoots back with its extremely simplistic controls (with the new addition of the movement via the analog stick) and style like with any other game of its kind. The usual end-goal exit has been replaced with a non-retaliating obstruction that you have to destroy. You can breeze right through these sections with little to no trouble especially if you've acquired a strong enough weapon or two. Used to be that the only good reason to do these top-down shooter parts is to collect obtainable Continues from specific enemies. This time around they're unlimited so there's no real good reason to actually make a forward attempt to go do these anymore although lives are still a thing but I'm not entirely sure if you can farm those properly. You get 2 (or 3, I forget) lives by default. As tradition would go doing a proper job at staying alive and completing a level won't result in much inconveniences with starting a level over at a point especially if all lives have been wasted.Most of the mechanics & features in the NES version have made it here and work pretty much the same way, like the bionic arm still being able to block bullets if the action's performed right and only being able to respawn from the beginning of the stage & most doorways, specifically & especially the ones that enable access to boss doors.Its core mechanic is the replacement of a jump button/option to a bionic arm that allows you to grapple in 5 directions (←, ↖, ↑, ↗ →) onto platforms for either climbing or swinging likely consistently in succession. Learning bionic arm platforming may take a bit of time to learn fully and get used to but I thought it was pretty worth it when put to proper use. There are even some tutorial and challenge levels to help get a better handle with it.At least on Medium difficulty and later, there are no longer any enemies that die in one hit with weaker weapons. You also have a health bar now as opposed to the squares that indicate how many hits you can take from anything. This also means that there are no longer any collectible ""bullets"" to pick up from killed enemies as the bullets have been replaced by obtainable Score Tokens and random health refills.A few items and weapons from the NES one have been replaced by many newer ones (weapons mostly) that are actually all very useful in the right situation as I never actually found myself picking favorites. Every item & weapon you acquire are now all automatically equipped with the ability to switch weapons in-game. You can find upgrades for each weapon however you'd have to put in effort into locating them as they're pretty much all hidden in secret areas. Practically all of the notable parts of every stage in this game are kept the way they are with some changes made for better or worse like complete scenery/atmosphere overhauls and other additions to prolong the stages a bit maybe. A few bosses have been replaced with more new ones to add variety in these fights one way or another they've been redesigned. In the later half of the game you'll have to fight most of them again in their upgraded forms. Plus, you actually have to fight them now because the choice to skip a fight altogether has been removed. The final boss fight too has been completely redone and now has his own incredibly long specific stage with the final escape still mostly being the way it is as it was.It's just a personal issue but I didn't find the visuals & graphics & whatever the like to be all too appropriate with the gameplay but all-in-all I enjoyed it and thought that it pretty much played almost exactly and then some like the NES title.

												These reviews are appalling.Firstly, ignore my playtime. I have poured hours upon hours into the Xbox Live release. That being said, this is a fantastic game. If you have ever played Bionic Commando, you owe it to yourself to play its remake.This game is very difficult, unforgiving, and requires a lot of trial and error. It is not a game of this generation, or last generation. Bionic Commando: Rearmed is a refined coat of paint on top of a classic Nintendo game. If that's your thing, you probably already own this game. If it's not, you should run away as fast as you can.Aside from difficulty, it seems a lot of the reviews are complaining about technical issues. I myself had absolutely no problems with anything (I am on Windows 10). I've booted this game up once and have had no issues.Do not listen to the hate this game gets. Give it a shot.			"

												A remake of the original NES game Bionic Commando. It is a action-platform game with puzzle elements. You control Ladd Spencer, a commando with a bionic arm with a grappling hook. Ladd Spencer cannot jump so you have to make full use of the grappling hook to get to higher places or even pass through obstacles.Pros: - Good graphics - Good music - ChallengingCons: - Music good but a bit annoying - Controls are stiff and difficult to grasp but that's to be expectedThe game is pretty decent for those looking for a challenge. It is pretty forgiving in sense that it allows you to repeat levels as many times as you want to. Even so the game is NES hard so if you're not up for a challenge stay away from this game.			"

												A FANTASTIC game..........if you can run it. This game badly needs a patch cause getting it to run consists of downloading old NVIDIA drivers. It doesn't overwrite your current drivers, though. It just uses them for this game rather than newer ones, which is weird. I don't know whether I should recommend it or not when it's such a good game but such a bad port. Port aspect aside, and considering that there was a solution for it (unlike the Sam and Max games), let's move onto the game itself:[✔] Challenging AND fair[✔] Creative use of unique game mechanics[✔] Doesn't try to be an ''interactive experience''[✔] Good music and PresentationAfter playing The Tomb Raider reboot and Bioshock Infinite this game was a Godsend. Like The Swapper, there's a unique game mechanic (the hook) and the game makes creative use of it throughout. Most boss fights are you entering a room and having to figure out how to use your hook to defeat them. The game doesn't throw hints if you don't get it in 10 seconds and it's always a rational process of deduction. Not having a jump button might seem really odd at first, but after a few hours you wouldn't have it any other way. The shooting is of the Megaman variety, albeit less varied. This is more of a platformer and the enemies' bullets serve more as obstacles to platforming rather than the main challenge itself. Wish the second one was on Steam, although I hear that game sucked♥♥♥♥♥and they added a jump mechanic. It's worth noting that the guy behind the Payday Soundtracks did the OST for this game, and it shows ✔			"

As a game that came out in 2008 to fit the market of that time and still suit the origins of the franchise, it's a pretty solid product that still holds up 8 years later. It's still a satisfying 2D platformer that provides a good challenge for those seeking one. You just have to deal with some minor frustrations that start to overstay their welcome once the game's length starts to settle in.			"

												Bionic Commando for the NES, to this day, is still my all time favourite NES game. When I learned they were going to do a remake a couple of years ago I got really excited and in the end, all of my expectations were met. They did everything right!This game keeps the original game intact while building off it, minor adjustments to some of the level design and adding a couple of gameplay mechanics like barrel grabbing and Interactive Wiretap Hacking. It is a true remake done well in a day and age where remakes and remasters tend to be used as quick cash grabs, leeching of the previous gaming gen for cheap and easy work. The graphics look really nice and polished and many new visual details have been added to the game including great lighing effects that really add a great level of atmosphere and even the music has been kept intact but giving it this nice current day techno style remix vibe update. My favourite part was always the fact that you couldn't jump and had to rely on your swinging skills from your bionical arm, it's a game that truly relies on your skill to master the swinging as it can be pretty technical, letting go in time, short swings, reeling in and letting go on time while continuesly swinging about. The overhead stages have been remade as well and were kept in the game and I love it how you have more control now making them a lot more fun to go through compared to its NES counter part were they become more of a hindrance, a chore.All in all, even if you never experienced the original NES game, this remake can truly hold its own, great gameplay, nice looking graphics, an impressive soundtrack, a cool story and most of all, just pure fun.For a couple of comparisons with the old game check out this video here where I talk about Remakes done right, Bionic Commando and Binic Commando Rearmed being my prime examples:

 Challenging experience Playing the story co-op, the normal diffculty is very challenging since You usually have 3 lives until restarting the level and there are many hard platforms or even hard enemies to pass. But once beating those levels and the whole game, it feels immensely rewarding.I recommend playing this game on easy difficulty first.			"

												I played the hell of out the original NES version as a kid. It was a difficult and frustrating game but I HAD to beat it and finally did. Of course I wouldn't have stuck around to keep playing without the addictive music. Even in 8bit, its still great.Now we have Rearmed! Its easier to me (of course I'm a lot older too) but it is a very fun game and the music keeps the energy going. To upgrade things a bit, now you can grab enemies, cans, misc items with your trusty arm. I'll have to replay the game just to go back and do all the new stuff I couldn't do in the NES version. Plus, the weapons are much better. Especially the machine gun!!!This game also had me laughing. The dialog between the enemy (when you hack into their lines) is hilarious. It seemed to me they were poking fun at the original game and...well...just having fun in this remake which is perfect.Only bad thing is the game was too short but its a good one to replay. I'd complain about the price but when I was a kid, the NES cartridge was way more expensive than it is now!!! Its worth the price.Oh--and when you land, at the start of each level, watch for the nod.			"

												The difficulty and learning curve is steep at the beginning mostly due to adjusting to the controls. In order to perform a diagonal grapple you have to stand still. You can also do it by a diagonal push in that direction but because of it's small margin of detection on the stick half of the time it will either cause you to grapple up or horizontal. To chain grapple under a ceiling you have to push left or right. That's where I spent quite some time fighting my natural instinct to push diagonal.Once you get used to the controls the difficulty plateaus a bit until you reach the final level, which turns out to be three times as big as any other area you've completed so far. Be sure to go back and collect lives because it can be really unforgiving.With it's tendency to force players through trial and error gameplay such as ""leap of faith"" situations (there is no air control in this game) I can only recommend this to NES purist who were nostalgic of those long bygone days.

												fans of the 8 bit bionic commando will like this game. Its a bit easier than the original and a lot more forgiving but has some added depth with more weapons and a greater range of movement. Those of you looking for a cookie cutter platformer aren't off the mark by much but you will not be able to jump. A large part of the challenge/fun is in getting the grapple and release timing down to fling yourself across the stage.			"

												Worthy, if you played the NES version and liked it you'll want this.Just about the best port you're going to find, true to the orignal values, and a polish more rare then diamondsHow can you say more good things?   I re-eddited this review just to make sure an overwhelming positive tone can be seen.Anyone else looking to develop an old classic should use this as their blueprint.			"

												I'll start this review by simply saying that Bionic Commando Rearmed is the best platformer game on Steam, hands down.BCR was developed by a swedish studio called GRIN, they had previously made the Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter games which were ""okay"".But in 2008 they really hit the motherload with this one, the game is an HD remake of the original NES game ""Bionic Commando"" and not does it only add more content to the mix, but even refines the original experience making it a superior version to the classic.In BCR you play as Nathan Spencer, a ""Bionic Commando"" with a giant robotic arm that operates as a telescopic grappling hook you can launch in five different directions, making it perfect for flinging around like Spider-Man. (Or Tarzan, but let's face it, nobody thinks Tarzan is cool anymore.)But there is a twist! You cant jump, the reason for this was originally the fact that the NES controller only had the A + B buttons which most games used for different actions. Shooting took the other button and grappling hook the other, meaning there werent enough buttons for jumping.For this reason, the developers had to get the level design absolutely perfect for the game to work, and oh boy did they succeed. The level design in Bionic Commando is still one of the best in any platformer game still to this day.What about the music? Well simply put it's AMAZING, after finishing the game twice i dont think there is a single bad track in the entire OST of the game. Even the originals from the NES game sound amazing, but they really did the remastering well in this one.If i'd have to give the game some criticism, (which is really hard btw) it would probably be the PC porting. While it certainly is superior to the other versions in terms of graphical fidelity, rebindable keys and proper sound settings, it's lacking an option for enabling vsync.This doesn't sound so bad at first, but when you realize that your rig is capable of running the game in ludicrous speed (I had about 400-470 FPS during the entire game) it can cause serious issues with overheating in your GPU.All in all, BCR is one helluva masterpiece of platformers and one of the brightest moments in Crapcom's history, if they only had hired these guys to remake the old Mega Man games...The game sells for 8,99€ on Steam and for that price i can certainly recommend you buying it. The game offers about eight hours of gameplay, but that number might vary depending on how much you have played platformers before or if you wish to complete the challenge missions. It should also be noted that the game is a remake of something that was on NES, so the replay value is pretty much endless.Lastly, GRIN was shut down in 2009 after their commercial failure with the new Bionic Commando game, (I'll talk about that a bit later) and because they had multiple projects going on at the same time, even though publishers were delaying their payments.Most of the GRIN development team went ahead to start a new development studio called ""Overkill Software"", sounds familiar? Yeah, these are the same guys who made the Payday games.One last thing, the last boss of this game is Adolf Hitler, yeah.			"

												Critically acclaimed, but largely overlooked by today's average gamer. Rearmed is an addictive, charming, fluid, polished, challenging and above else, fun bit of side-scrolling action. From the brilliant animation to the excellent soundtrack and all the subtle touches of creativity, it's hard to say where BC:R shines the brightest. I've not had the good fortune of playing a reimagined  game that has stayed so close to it's roots, yet felt so fresh and engaging as this absolute gem. Have a look at the trailer, it oozes the same kind of feeling you get playing this game, something that plays and feels like a labour of love.			"

The levels weren't overly long and when you know where you're going it can be finished in minutes.Unfortunately it has a very long ending mission that's multiple times as long as a normal level. I failed at the final boss and had to start alll over again because I ran out of lives (which I won't do). I really hate it when games do that. I'll just watch the ending on youtube.			"

 You will be Bionic Spiderman and Love it - 8/10It' nice to see a remake that manages to follow the mould of the original and still make it fresh and new. Now I loved me the heck out of this game on the NES and if you did you will find a lot to like in this game. MAny of the things you liked about the original are still here, while at the same time new elements have been added that keep this game interesting. If you never played or heard of the original. You'll find this to be very fun action platformer.THere have been changes, old annoyances removes, new annoyances added but everything from the graphics, the mechanics and the music show honest respect for the the source and genuine creativity in bringing a more modern feel to this classic.The bad. Well it's difficult. and can be rather unforgiving. Timing is everythingand the right weapons make the difference. Even vertans of the original will have a hard time with this one. Only real  niggling annoyance is that unlike the original  you will have a tendency to climb up rather than hang and believe me when I say there will be times when you wish that weren't so. Otherwise, the controls are spot and responsive and once you get use to the no juping thing you'll be a regular Bionic Spiderman with a Machine Gun			"

Summary/Overview Bionic Commando is a rated Mature run-and-gun side-scrolling platformer very similar to Contra. The primary characteristic alike in both of these games is the ability only to swing from area to area instead of including a button to jump. I know that many children and teenagers growing up won’t be able to appreciate this remake of the classic Nintendo Entertainment System game because it already seems to hard without a jump button. I do realize wholeheartedly the stigma that would♥♥♥♥♥♥modern-day gamers off. I understand you, but I assure you if you have some time, patience and practice, then you will get good at this game and succeed. One of the main hallmarks in the Contra and the Bionic Commando series is action-packed run-and-gun gameplay that shows no mercy toward enemies.Original release: Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988, Game Boy in 1992Newly updated release Bionic Commando Rearmed: August 14, 2008, PC release, also released on PlayStation Network and Xbox LivePublisher, Developer: CapcomGenre: action, side-scrolling, platformer Presentation     The graphics have been updated from the original Nintendo Entertainment System counter-part. They are now more crisp, show improved lighting and have a better enemy, environment animations. The story is presented through communication hubs that tell you more about the story as you progress through the levels. The story is the classic hallmark of many real-life warzone tales and stories of today.Gameplay     The primary characteristic that sets Bionic Commando and Contra apart from many platformers now is that they can be played in a variety of ways. If you are really good already at the game, you can choose to speedrun while skipping the story and many enemies. You don’t always have to take on every single enemy; this is all up to you based on how much health you currently have and how well you trust in your skills. Unlike some platformers that require only button pressing to be successful, Bionic Commando requires you to know enemy patterns precisely; Capcom did this within the original Mega Man games as well. If your movement is even the slightest bit unprecise, you are going to have to replay levels again and again until you clear them.      In fact, I remember watching some gamers on the REACT YouTube channel play the original Contra on the original Nintendo and they struggled. The difference there was that Contra allowed for extra continues. However, Bionic Commando Rearmed does not have that feature. Either you occasionally gain extra lives from level to level and refill more health by defeating random enemies, or you have one life to make the most of it.Does Bionic Commando Rearmed Appeal to the Modern-Age Gamers in the Digital Generation?     Yes, and no. If you are a modern-day gamer that wants a trip back through nostalgia and have never played the old-school side-scrolling hard platformers that were around back then, this will give you a first-person test-drive through all those years, in the late 1980’s through early 1990’s. However, if you are like me and don’t have as much time as you used to right now to play games and not enough patience or time before moving on to other games in your backlog, then I would not recommend it. However, if you don’t have a fairly large backlog and want something to play for a long while, constantly improving and transitioning between all the difficulties from easy to hard.Controls     You use basic mechanics on the keyboard while using the arrow keys also to control your release of your bionic arm. You need precise aim to be able to swing and pull yourself up to other platforms. This is the hallmark of these original side-scrolling games like this. The controls work ok for keyboard and mouse, but I know I am not alone when I say that the original experience is much better through using a controller. It would be awesome if there could be PC compatibility for a Nintendo Entertainment System controller.Positive, Negative AspectsPros•Awesome 8-bit soundtrack that is high action•Awesome main character model that has been updated from the original.

			Fala moçada... Bionic Commando Rearmed é um relançamento da CAPCOM. O jogo original foi lançado em 1987 e, francamente, era muito mais legal que essa versão nova.		

O jogo é do gênero aventura/ação em duas dimensões,  onde você assume o comando de um soldado cuja missão é resgatar um outro soldado que aparentemente está sendo mantido refém de um grupo terrorista, além de ter que descobrir tudo o que puder sobre o tal grupo.A jogabilidade é bem ruim, os comandos são pouco funcionais e o pior de tudo é que o personagem é grudado no chão. Ele não consegue ultrapassar nem uma caixa de sapatos sem utilizar seu gancho, o que é, no mínimo, incoerente. Os gráficos são bons, mas não chegam a salvar o jogo e a história é ""clichezaça"" ao máximo.Nota geral: 4,5. Poderia até ter sido menor, se não fossem os gráficos que realmente são bonitos. Abraços.			"

												A good game with some jarringly stressful levels at the end, namely the upper swinging section in 11 where you have to be very precise and a slight mispress of the claw arm button, which your press only has to be off by a milisecond, means having to re-navigate the bottom section to get back up for another most likely unsuccessful try. Then you have the final albatros level. It just ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. The first part, your claw arm doesn't work half the time on some of the platforms in one section, an obvious game glitch, and the rest is just a pure stress test. If your doctor ever wants you to take a stress test, tell him no thanks, you have already played Bionic Commando Rearmed. The last albatros level is the worst level I have ever seen in a video game. It was so incredibly stressful and so bull-shi--y that I just got tired of it and gave up and uninstalled the game because I just stopped caring, never to be ♥♥♥♥ed with again. You get through three door tests that are stupid enough in their own right, then the next section has changing platforms and collapsing hook grapple points. I was laughing at how stupidly stressful it was and just quit and am done with this game. Such a shame, all that work for such a truly God awful last level.Everything is good, but it will take some getting used to for most people because it is a platformer without a jump button. The idea is that your bionic arm is so heavy that you can't jump but you can sure as hell use it to swing around the levels awkwardly and that is the whole thing that made Bionic Commando unique in the first place, since the original. Everything works fine and it is a challenging game so some things are going to be immensely stressful in the levels but it is do-able with practice. The challenge levels in particular are probably the hardest, most stressful things I have ever done in my life, Unfortunately a lot of the picky awful programming that forces you to have perfect timing in the challenge levels trickles over into the story missions. On the 10th challenge I had no idea how to swing up to do it until I checked a youtube video. Even after watching how it was done I still had no idea how to do it until I read some detailed comments under the video and even then I still pretty much did it by luck. I gave up after the second set of them. The third set of challenges just got too stressful. I have never in my life seen anything require you to be so incredibly precise. If you don't swing right even for a milisecond you fail. If you dont hit the button within the right milisecond you fail. There is quite literally zero margin of error in the challenges, but thankfully they are not required so I am just enjoying the story levels. The graphics are awesome, the music is superb and is the best part of the game, the weapons and enemies solid, the animations realistic, and the gameplay is smooth. The only real way the game could be improved is if the dumb overly picky swing section in 11 was fixed and the last level wasn't so nightmarishly bad.The combat is ♥♥♥♥ing stressful as well because there is no recovery time so one hit and you are sometimes bouncing around like a pinball into other hits and you can either be killed in no time or be easily bounced off a platform and fall a long, long way down and have to reclimb the level which absolutely sucks. If only your guy wasn't such a stiff heavy snail with incredibly picky claw arm swing controls then it would be less frustrating.6/10, nothing but pure stress at the end. Get the 2009 Bionic Commando instead. The swinging in it is not done very well (gee what a surprise!) but it is not too bad and the game is still enjoyable but very short. The claw arm idea instead of a jump button is a very neat idea but it really should stay in these games and not be adopted by any others. Catch it (the 2009 3D version) only on sale though for $5 or less because it is a very short game.			"

I found the controls frustrating and annoying, and had a hard time figuring where to go in some levels becuase there isn't any kind of help.  Yeah I know, ""get better at games noob"" but whatever, games for me are meant to be fun, and I didn't have fun playing this.  No thanks.			"

												A very accurate remake of the original Bionic Commando. From what I saw, it was a bit-for-bit remake of the original with updated graphics and some save features. This game has the same flaws as the original. The control scheme is infuriating until mastered, but satisfying once done so.It is a classic from the dawn of gaming, but unfortunately, time has not been kind.			"

												If a game is awkward and unintuitive by design, can I really fault it? And am I prepared to be lynched for it?Yes, also yes.I actually played this years ago on the Xbox 360, and remembered having a lot of trouble acclimating to the controls. I thought for sure that I was just a dumb kid back then, and that I'd get it the second time as a big strong adult. I sucked at platforms back then, and retro inspired ones especially. Now I'm a Castlevania fan. Times have changed! And this is a universally praised platformer, held higher than it's 2008 fully 3D remake, and I loved that game to death. I have to give it another try. It couldn't be as awkward as I remember. It was just as awkward, and I'll attempt to somehow explain.Imagine you were playing Metroid. You move, you shoot, you hop on platforms, pits are instant death, and touching enemies boops ya away. Now remove jumping. Now have all movement controls mapped to combinations of directions on the left control stick and the B button.Not so hard, right? Now make sure almost none of that directional input is the direction you want to go. Going upwards is about the only thing you're getting into your muscle memory without a fight. Simple actions requires unintuitive commands, such as pressing down and B to pull yourself under a gap to the left or right, or pressing B with no directional input to swing to the left or the right. This might not sound like too much, but when levels are multiple tiers of platforms full of enemies and death pits, it can be really frustrating to try and pull off multiple different kinds of obtuse commands and keep it all straight in your head. No one move you pull off is particularly complicated or outlandish, it just defies muscle memory with it's obtuse commands.So when everything is built around this bizarre 45 degree angle flat plain traversal, what am I to do when the first boss required me to interacting with something that was an inch off the ground? Yep. That's what did me in. That was what made me quit. A slightly raised barrel convinced me to refund Woolies Sacred Cow and then come to ♥♥♥♥♥ about how it's totes overrated yo.Seriously though, if you can somehow acclimate to these controls, I can actually see this being quite fun, so if they don't turn out to be a barrier for you, please disregard this entire review and enjoy your game, you lucky Mutant.

												If you've never played this game before in its previous forms, like myself, I can't recommend this game.If you are familiar with the original, don't listen to me, there are plenty of reviews from former Commandos that will probably be of more use to you._______________________________________________-: What drew me to this game were the labels action and local co-op, not because of any prior knowledge of this game. However, I found the controls unbearable. Movement is slow, and actions are clunky. When I learned that this is a side-scroller, and you can't jump... that seemed kind of counter-intuitive to me. Your only method of vertical transportation is a grapple, that is hard to manage and is very limited in precision. Trying to manage all of these quirks was a full-time job, so there was no room left to manage a high difficulty level.+: From what I see in the community, the original game is beloved, and this remake was met with praise from the fans, leading me to believe there is a high nostalgia factor. I however cannot help you with this.In short; YAY NOSTALGIANAY NO JUMPING			"

												Awesome. I never played a bionic commander prior to this. Saying that I was like hey I can't jump what is going on here ! So I did some research and discovered yea, he don't jump. So i scratched the lice off my head and pressed forward. Took so long to get it out of my head that I could not jump, even towards the end I would instinctively attempt to jump up to the ledge above. Once you get used to it however it adds an interesting difficulty aspect which obviously is what makes this game interesting in terms of game mechanics. If you do a google search for this game and the original you will see the original levels side by side. It seems to me that this game stayed pretty freaking true to the original. A top notch remake. I found the game to be very awesome once you accept that yes, you can't jump, deal with it ! Also no you can't duck, deal with it.           The level layout as I said based on the original, and it feels it. The level layouts feel great, not over thought not under thought out. The graphics are beautiful, the music is awesome.          I would highly suggest purchasing this game if you are a fan of side scrollers. Even more so if you are a fan of classic side scrollers.			"

												Bionic Commando: Rearmed is terrific in almost every way, revitalizing a classic but long-dormant game in an exciting way that stands on its own. The soundtrack to Bionic Commando: Rearmed is a fantastic piece of work, a deft contemporary reworking of classic 8-bit NES tunes. From top to bottom, Bionic Commando Rearmed is an incredible game that's well worth owning. You might need to install physX legacy drivers to get the game to work in windows 10. I recomment a controller or gamepad for this game.			"

I know what you may be thinking ""ah.. why I even need to do this crap?"" is only 5min of your time to do this so do it if you wanna play the game.If you have any other problem regarding other game because u changed the version of physx just go back to nvidia site and download last'st version and problem solve.The game itself works perfect (after doing the above) 1080p wide screen no problems a very good port and even if you never played bionic commando do not let pass this classic! it's a very solid ""2d"" plataformer action/advanture game.Have Fun!

You never get a prompt with what controls control what in given situation (interaction with equipment, chaking, help database, etc. etc. etc.).Then ingame, playing co-op, the ui doesn;t even show which heath bar belongs to which player ! :DLet alone that some levels are unplayable and difficulty settig doesn't change it at all.This title just reeks of anateurish AND hasty development.Another hyped crap, this one.

												This is part of my backlog but from what I played it delivers a much enhanced experience that I remember as a kid in 3rd grade when the game was brand new on the NES.  There is a bit more hand-holding, and the powerups are fun which will always be contested by purists, but you'd be missing out greatly if you passed this up.  This was as labor of love, something I wish could be said about other remakes like Duck Tales and Strider.  If you're a fan of platformers, even if you come from the Manhattan Duke era or later, it would be a shame if you passed this up.  Production values through the roof and the controls are awesomely tight and rewarding.  9.5/10 in my book.			"

The port has been done excellently. Graphics are quite decent and the soundtrack KICKS♥♥♥♥♥ Easily one of my favorite game OSTs ever. Gameplay is as awesome as it has always been. Grab this game!

												NO!!!!! Do NOT purchase this piece of crap, mangled pile of garbage with abysmal controls. Get to the last level which is exponentially longer than the others leading to it - no proportionate level scaling. The game was simple up until this point - then, it puts you through these 3 long, meticulous, trivial switch pulling portions before the main platforming, swing crap fest. Die here - go back to the beginning to do those 3 ridiculous initial sections. Horrible game design. I'm all for challenge; but not at the risk of monotony and boredom.Oh yeah, I should have known how bad this experience was going to be when the game failed to open after purchase - required this ancient legacy PhysX driver download that I needed to Google Reddit for. Lazy dev port.Oh yeah, part deux...What is with all the leaps of faith? How can you consider that skill when the screen doesn't reveal the platforms or obstacles. Capcom, what were you thinking? Baaaad level design!			"

												I want to like this game, I really do. I'm just not feelin it.I remember the original bionic commando in all it's glory back in the NES days.This certainly tries to recapture that glory and maybe for some people it will be enough.For me it's just not there.For starters the controls are horrible. Unresponsive and crude are the best adjectives I can give for it. For one thing they can't even be bothered to use a readable font when instructing you. Press the ""i"" button... I pressed the i button, I pressed every button on the dam keyboard until I realized what they wanted was the j button. Do you know how much ""j"" looks like ""i"" ? well it shouldn't unless you use a terrible font.But suffer through the tutorial and you can get to a point where the controls are playable. Not fun per say, but sort of usable and I was able to beat all the tutorial ""challenges"".On to the game itself. I realize you don't typically play a platformer for a storyline. But wow, this is bad. It's so bad I would prefer they not have put one in at all. One page splash screens to launch each mission would have been preferable. Instead you get treated to page after page of back and forth dialogue that amounts to a meaningless pile of drivel peppered with cliche threats and taunts.If you can't be bothered to make a story decent then at least keep it short and relevent towards moving you from one mission to another. Don't give me long winded conversations about nothing interesting. Even the almost valid enemy coversations (that you hack into for hints about how to beat bosses) is dripping with cheese in the worst ways.I digress... gameplay. It feels like it's trying to be bionic commando but the entire game just feels... slow. Bullets fly by like butterflies that you could just reach out and swat if you wanted to. Movement is clunky and the entire game is like swimming in butter.I pushed on, treating it more like a puzzle game than a shooter. Though the minimalist puzzle mechanics seem to only be there to funnel you into more shootouts.There's a myriad of enemy troops but they all come accross as lazy and are beaten with essentially the same tactics. Level designs are short and feel meaningles. Boss fights were simplistic exagerations of the basic mechanics that only really become difficult when the controls don't respond in the way you want them to (which is frequent...).  Conceptually they were too easy to beat, but then the controls cheat you out of what you are trying to do and you get to start over. In the end boss fights felt unsatisfying.Beyond the main gameplay there's two other modes you get shoved into:1. hacking. at first these are frustrating, you weren't told what the controls are and trial and error will make you fail them (setting off alarms). once you do figure out the controls they are so simple to get through you wonder why they bothered, its just a waste of time. Spin cube, throw ball, spin cube, throw ball. I'm bored...2. top down shoot outs (between missions). On the world map when your helicopter flys over a convoy, she parks and lets you out to go walking around shooting things... Why? There's no logic to these stops, we could have flown past them or around them or.... Sadly these sections (as much as they don't make sense to the overal plot) are actually slightly more fun gameplay wise than the actual platforming game. The controls function without too much slippage and you actually get to use your bionic arm against enemies (even if its only to knock them back ~ where as in the main game your arm does nothing to them). Not that I'd want to play an entire game of this, they are once again too easy and not all that interesting.And that's where I am. I beat the tutorials, I played a few missions, I did some hacking and fought some convoys when my pilot decided to land between missions. But... meh. Overall I was bored. I took a break to get a drink and realized I had zero motivation to bother getting back into the game.I wanted to like this and for those who really need to scratch the nostalgia itch maybe it's on OK game. But it's just not cutting it for me. I'm bored and the controls suck really bad. "

												This might be for the retro crowd for the people that have played the original and are craving a just remake of the punishing, but surely rewarding story of Nathan Spencer. If you're buying it from the nostalgia angle, it's already in your library.But this isn't for you. Nostalgia's a hollow high that never feels quite right through rose-coloured glasses. In a present day playthrough attempt, I just couldn't wrap my ahead around the frustrating player maneuverability and static enemies. The gameplay simply doesn't age well, and you'd be content just watching someone playthrough it.			"

												This game is a faithful remake of one of my favourite games of my childhood. While it's great that it's a such a close remake, that can also be a bit of a bad thing as certain features that have undoubtably improved modern games are abscent. This is however, a graphically/sonically improved game from the original with all the same flavour. I love it but I am biased as I grew up with this game.			"

												Beautiful graphics don't save this game from somehow having worse controls and precision than the NES game that inspires it. You have to figure out the game's crappy physics and poor collision detection on the hook before you can have any success. I can't imagine levels went through much, if any, quality assurance and the whole thing is a slow, frustrating slog and ultimately unrewarding. Play the original and don't bother with this.			"

												first of all, CAPCOM should bother to make it work on its own... out of the ""box"" the game crashes at the splash screen, everytime i started it and after that just a log file appearing and then again from the top... thankfully from some steam forums i found a solution to this issue by istalling the psysx legacy drivers (which coexist with the updated ones if you have them). after playing this though i cannot say i that i can recommend it (even on sale) . right from the getgo you can tell they wanted to capture the original but the thing is that they have failed miserably with this one. there is no jump button , you can only swing with your bionic arm , which is very picky with which legdes you can do that . also even though i tried i couldnt find a way to just drop from a ledge other than just you know... falling off. the graphics are atrocious, the movement is jerky, the music is boring at best and the ""hacking"" ""mini-game"" is just meh... if you can tolerate these facts and your nostalgia takes the better of you... then congratulations this game will make you very to somewhat happy. if you aren't wearing nostalgia goggles though you can see the game for what it is an easy cash in using the name's branding... and just that. it is not even worth 2 euros on sale... PS: this is from the log file... if you see this during the splash screen and you get the constant crashing search the steam forums for a link to the nvidia legacy drivers and the game will (probably) start , although that is on CAPCOM and shouldnt be a burden to the user....""Crash in application version: 1.1.0.12714This game requires an up to date version of Ageia PhysX and associated DLLs.

												So many painful, horrible, awful decisions were made with this game.  Was there a real reason to use the PhsyX engine?  No.  Was there a reason for the terrible default keybindings?  Nope.  Was there a reason I am not allowed to shoot in any other direction than forward?  No!  Even with its issues, Bionic Commando (the 3D PC game) was actually a better game than this.  If you like games in the ""forward shooting only"" genre, then Broforce is a WAY better game, infinitely more satisfying, hilarious at times, and quite fun.  This game, however, needed a LOT more playtesting and polish before distributing it to the world.  Developers can learn this lesson:  I get they were trying to be relatively faithful to the original, but keep in mind those games were limited in what they could do because the hardware was limited.  Repeating janky controls from the original doesn't help matters in any way.  Buyer beware!  This game probably won't work on your hardware without modifications.  Namely you will have to hunt down the legacy PhysX engine, switch the game's executable to Windows 7 compatibility mode, and probably restart Steam like I did to get it to start without crashing.  This game wasn't received well by critics and now I know why.  It's an ill-conceived PC game - at best - and it hasn't aged well in the few years it has been out.			"

It's hard, very hard, but very possible to beat.So if you like NES games like Bionic Commando or Castlevania, this is a great reimagination of a classic and you should definately pick it up.			"

If this game were so old that it pre-dated Steam, I could understand a lack of support and foresight on the developer's part. However, this game came out when proper support should have been the norm, and it's a freaking Capcom game! They have enough money to make their games work in a couple of years. Indie devs can do it. So can friggin' Capcom. This is positively unacceptable and should be shameful to a company like Capcom, regardless of wealth.			"

												If you remember Bionic Commando from the NES, this is simply the same thing reskinned.  This game is really just a nostalgia bomb.  If you never played the original, you may find the grapple-swing platforming mechanics odd and not super fun.Boss battles seem to be slightly different and there's a hacking mini game at the communication stations that's new, but apart from that it tries to be a faithful reproduction of the original.  Best part?  The remixed music from the old game.  SOLID soundtrack here.  They really did make this an honest redo of the NES version, even modeling the drawings of the characters between missions and in communication sessions after the originals.  They even clip the text the same.  Nostalgia is heavy for me here, but without that historical perspective, it's a hard game to recommend.  I'll give two prices on this.  $2 if you never played Bionic Commando and $5 if you did.  It is fun, but it's not going to be the best game you play this year… probably not even this month.Visuals 6Gameplay 4Slant 3Overall : 43			"

												Loved the original 8-bit Bionic Commando on the NES, and Rearmed is a faithful and masterfully crafted sequel / port, superior in every way. The soundtrack is composed (pun intended) of remixes of the original tracks, and they are retro and rad. The gameplay of grappling, swinging, and shooting is intact. There are plenty of secrets, clever boss fights, and hilarious quips from our titular protagonist and his enemies and allies. My gripes are two: one is small and the other is not. First, small gripe, I'm sad to see that there are no steam achievements like there were for the PSN version. Two, big gripe, Bionic Commando: Rearmed for PC is consistently OVERHEATING MY MACHINE, complete with graphical artifacts, system shutdowns, and stern BIOS warnings that the processor is in danger of being damaged. This appears to be a game engine issue, and I'm not the only one with this problem. No bueno.			"

												I wanted to like this game but it is killed by the same crappy control scheme that the original NES version was infamous for. Back in those NES glory days, we kids never questioned why a bionic commando would be unable to jump or climb over an obstacle. Now, though, it’s stupid and frustrating.Many positive reviews celebrate this as being a “hard” game, but all of its difficulty stems from the crappy controls. It shouldn’t be rewarded for bad design. I could get over not being able to jump or climb if the grappling mechanics were smooth and responsive, but they aren’t. They’re clunky & counter intuitive. And this in a game full of instant death areas that oh by the way gives you a certain number of lives to get through each level.I stopped this after about an hour, once I reached a level with a secret area I could not get into after dying & starting all the way over five times. I knew exactly what I had to do and it wasn’t very complicated, but the controls are so unresponsive it became impossibly hard. Then I thought about how, if I did manage to make it into the secret area, I would have to navigate back out the way I came and survive through the rest of the level and the boss fight. If I ran out of lives before that, I’d have to do the entire level all over again. Who thinks that’s fun?This game could have been great if they had retooled the grappling system and the level designs. Instead they essentially lifted everything straight from the NES original aside from the graphics. If they weren’t going to update the controls, they should have at least given infinite lives & checkpoints inside levels since the gameplay boils down to tons of trial, error & luck. I bought this during a Steam sale and I regret the purchase. My advice is to get an emulated version of the original NES version. It will give you almost the same experience.			"

For example, the aiming is of the grappling hook is BS, it barely ever aims in the right direction due to it using the thumbstick when clearly designed for the D-Pad, this is just one of the problems I have with the controls.Please do not waste your money on this game!

												I am always confused when really old style game mecanics get such amazing reviews by so many review sites. I am clearly in the camp that nostalgia isn't good enough for a game to be fun.The gameplay for me is frustrating and awkward. The difference between 'fire the rope and swing', 'fire rope swing and let go', 'fire rope swing, hit wall and bounce a mile into some deadly spikes' is too small.The fact that this amazing Commando can only aim horizontaly (at 90 degrees) and can not jump seems perplexing. The story is non existent. The graphics look ok, at best (not that i care too much about graphics when good gameplay is present.)All in all, certain games should remain in the past. This is for people looking for a challenge and who are willing to learn a frustrating, antiquated, control system. Almost any new game is better than this. Gave up after 3.4 hours of playing. 3/10P.S. Doesn't even work out out of the box. Needs the manual searching and installation of old PHYSx drivers to even get into this. Poor.			"

Product received for free
Bionic Commando: Rearmed is basically terrible.Grappling hooks are insanely awesome in gaming culture.  They're a major staple of the Zelda franchise, for example.  The Bionic Commando: Rearmed game showed some promise being one of the few 2D games I'd be excited to play that had a grappling hook mechanic.  Unfortunately, that mechanic was not implemented in an intuitive way.Tell them about getting the game to even work.Yes, yes, I was getting to that.  The game doesn't work out-of-box.  It is missing the PhysX driver it requires.  It comes bundled with PhysX as part of the install, but it doesn't install the correct version.  You require this legacy driver: http://www.nvidia.com/object/physx-9.13.0604-legacy-driver.html  (Thanks, support forums!)  That thankfully won't replace your latest PhysX driver, but it's a hoop you have to jump through just to get the game to load its initial agreement screen.  Then, you have to scroll through a lengthy contract with your arrow keys and finally agree to it before you can see the main menu.  At this point, I was already kind of upset with the game, but it had more issues going forward.Like the inability to target where you want the grappling hook to go?  Or the lack of a jump button?Yes, those two things exactly!  The controls were lacking a jump option, and the grappling mechanic was not as fun as it should have been.  I've seen free Flash-powered browser games from 2004 with more charm and elegance in their grappling mechanics than this game had.  I've seen better shooting mechanics in old arcade games from the late 80s and early 90s.  Compared to Contra or Metal Slug, I don't understand how anyone could recommend this game.The UI was nice, though.If this game has any nice points, it's the UI design.  Mind you, parts of the UI were non-functional, but most of it worked and looked very stylish.  It's a unique UI and worth the experience, I suppose, since the game was free.			"

												Ok me and my friend might of been a bit impatient with the game, but bare with me here. Our experience with the game was this :1- We had no prior experience with the franchise, so nostalgia was not a factor2- Our first reaction was ""WHATS TO JUMP???"", followed by intense frustration3- We tried out the grappling hook to get around. ""Its so clunky"", my friend said. I also had trouble adjusting. Even after I got the hang of it (BADUMPISH), I did not find it fun in the slightest.4- Levels were bland and unappealing. ""Wow this is ugly"", my friend said.5- Enemies were dumb and easy. We only had to crouch under their bullets and shoot back. Not exciting in the slightlest.6- After what seemed like a progression blocker at the second level, we quit.After about 10 minutes of gameplay, my friend was like ""Can we play something else? This is dumb""Glad I got it on sale.			"

												Was so excited for this game, and then severely let down when playing it. The game is ruined by stupid design choices that inflate difficulty and take away enjoyment. You are playing a platformer that came back out in 2008, and you cant JUMP.....the most common and essential thing. You need to swing to get past a barrel or block. It is supremely stupid and makes dodging shots impossible. The game doesn't tell you but you can use your claws to blow some bullets, that would have been helpful to know. The other big problem is you cant AIM!! What the hell is the games problem. For some reason your guy can only shoot straight forward, and the idea of having his gun point up or down is soo crazy and would make things much easier, but that would just make too much sense. So then there's the arm. For having your game based on this, the swinging and arm mechanics controls are TERRIBLE. You have to press down while falling to shoot sideways. Half the time you will press up and it will shoot sideways. For having to direct it the controls are just super janky. Also, when you fall, for some reason you break the rules of physics and momentum doesn't carry you forward, you drop straight down, unlike any platformer ever. Also the swing mechanics are super terrible, sometimes you just pull up the line, others you swing and let go, and others you hold on. It is unpredictable and not easy to do at all, leading to countless deaths. Most of the time you die you realize its not your fault, its the poor game mechanics or arm controls or stupid restrictions placed on you. Then there are bosses, who they repeat after you beat them.....classic lazy design move. Its tough to figure out the one single way to hurt them, and you dont have the luxury of figuring out because of the other antequated mechanic, of that you get 3 lives and have to start the stage over again. Since you die regularly because you have to use the swinging and grappling mechanic and if you mess up in most parts you instant die, this leads to frustration. The final level was the deal sealer for me. You have to go through tons of rooms and then fight the boss all without losing all your lives or all progress is lost. The only way to get more than like 3-5 is to keep going back to PSA levels and getting single lives, which takes forever. There are also the annoying parts with cars thats slow things down. Sorry but there are some upgrades and secrets and co-op, and a good sense of humor, but those are the only positive features. Avoid this game, it is a disgrace to platformers everywhere. I will now be glad I can jump and aim a gun in games from now on. 4.5/10.			"

												Once again I've been thwarted by Steam reviews, exciting looking screen shots and a cheap price.  This game is a real dud.  Imagine a side-scroller with no jump button, just an unintuitive cable system that more often than not flings you somewhere you did not intend (like a spike pit).  And lucky you, when you miss that one jump out of 50, you have to start all over and do it again.Who rates this stuff anyway?  Complete garbage.			"

												Developers Grin have tried very hard to give the gameplay a retro feel but miss the mark completely. Issues incude:1. The controls are trying too hard to emulate the NES original without remedying the issues a modern controller could easily overcome. You can't, for instance, aim in most levels. The right stick isn't used at all. You can fire left and right and that's it. Even in the top down scenes where you CAN aim you shoot in the direction you're walking and so can't stand still and aim.2. The grapple is essential to gameplay but a pain to use. Like the gun, it can't be aimed and the controls are set up to ensure at some point you'll accidentally fly off a grapple at top speed when you wanted to hang. Add to this insta-death spikes for extra frustration as you kerpow into them and die.3. Lives. This game has lives. In 2014. To go along with it's insta-death hazards. It is not generous with them.Generally, the game confuses ""irritate the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people"" with ""challenge"" and is far more of a chore than it should be.If you're hoping for a fun update to the original NES game, this isn't it. Try Shovel Knight instead or something.			"

												They can't jump.....I was looking for a local coop game and stumbled upon this! Bought it and played it alone and with a buddy for a few hours.My conclusion: WTF is this?!?! It makes me angry and confused! No thanks!What bothered me most is the gameplay. Your bionic super soldier cant jump! Why the hell cant he jump! Ok ... i have not played this game back then, im not a fan or familiar with the franchise but if they are an bionic army experiment one could assume they have the ""POWER"" TO JUMP ... yeah its about grapping ... but did their bionic reconfiguration made them disabled to jump. Maybe they are too cool to jump, you might assume (just shoot and grapple ... hell yeah! real men dont need to jump around foolishly!)? ... Yeah ... I dare you play that game for half an hour and see how cool you feel than!Just grappling is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and makes the game feel somewhat clumsy and wooden ... The mulitpayer is kinda funny and since your opponent is as nonjumpy and inept as you .... it has kinda something to it becaue you can mock him/ her propperly upon a kill while trying to swinging clumsily to the next plateau!So I guess I would recommend that game for fans of the series (if there are any... *cough* ... good game friends ;) ) and maybe people who hate jumping! Go for it!Everbody else who is especially looking for a local coop or multiplayer experience i would heartly recommend FIST PUNCHER!! (yes, there is jumping!)			"

A re-make of the original Bionic Commado (Hitler's Revival: Top Secret) NES game, excluding Hitler and the Nazis as the enemies but more player friendly?Anyways, there's no jump key, and in a side scroll shooter with multiple gaps to constantly pass through you'd except to be able to jump. But the ENTIRE game has a grapple fetish and focuses you main movement to be grappling.I got stuck on the first level, until I realized some barriers can be shot down and some can't. But they don't tell you this in the tutorial, all they teach you is GRAPPLING 4 DUMMI3S, no information is given on the game but how to grapple derp.I honestly tried to play it, but it sucks.1/10 "

												What the actual ♥♥♥♥. I understand how the old school joint was a happy memory for old people, similar to the way kick the can was fun back in the early 40s......... but this is 20XX now (XX = whatever year you read this in). This game is what garbage eats. If this game had actual ♥♥♥♥♥♥s in it, I wouldnt give it a better score.Graphics: 4/10 no ♥♥♥♥♥♥s (if it had them, it would be 4/10), looks OG xboxish (big giant green controllers that dont do anything, see the controls score)Controls: -100/10 because i could never figure out how to actually jump. oh there is no jump and thats what makes the game cool. ♥♥♥♥ you. ♥♥♥♥ you with an enormous amount of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in positions that make people uncomfortable.Replayability: ♥♥♥♥/10 , 25 minutes and im out. This game is lucky im lazy and its small. this is like 300mb that im ashamed to have on my PC, but will probably never uninstall because its 300mb.Bottom line is this game is dog crap from the butt of a canine.This feels bad because i actually do like most capcom games. Street Fighter 2 through 7 were great, and Mega Man 1-53 were some of the best platforming ive ever experienced as an animal with thumbs.This game however, doesnt deserve to be capitalized in the name.bionic commando:rearmed is one of the worst games ive played as long as ive been a human.nbd tho dat humble bundle deal was sweet.

												I do NOT recommend this game. Terrible control system! For a 2D sectional game you CANNOT jump! You will be easily blocked by a single barrel, which you should be able to easily jump over, in terms of a special soldier! Stupid setting! It is 21st century! How could you design a game without generally acknowledged configurations! Besides, stuff consumable like barrels cannot be refreshed if you happen to break them, then you will be probably stuck in this level. Even you cannot carry a barrel and get off from the elevator! It will be broken! Stupid again.Japanese games are no longer as good as they were. Fewer designers would devote much to a game and make it close to perfection.Never buy this game unless someone gives it to you as a gift or you get it from a game bundle.			"

												Pros this game is very fun i mean very fun the game is hard in it does get later on so you do have to put more effited in to this game art style makes me want to fap  It looks so good i mean so good  good muisc contol's are fine they coulud have done better. boss fights are so gudCons the gameplay of this game is slow THERE is no jump butten you may say there is no jump beautn so the game can be harded yes but a lot if the deaths that happen to me could have been avoied if it had one you  can't look up in shoot this makes it fituags to deal with emays that fly in the air the A I is bad in this game in that would not be a big deal if the game did not spam a lot of emmis on scne at once in when you get stuck in a conor that meaans you just died.now the conlrs to this game are kind of wried so wehn you see a bot to kill you have to come to a stop complte in shoot them that makes fighting in this game a pain. There is one  huge problem  i have with this game tho is after a couple hours of playing this game it will stop working it took me a couple of mouths to get it to work because i was playing ohter games this is a decetn port but the game not working after a few hours♥♥♥♥♥♥me of a litte it can easyly be fix it's some thing with the phics eng. Overhal this is a good game i got this doring the staem summur sale 2 years ago for 2 $ in a was happy it fun i would say pay for this game if you like hard games you should pay 10 - 15 $ on this game if it's like 20 then no don't buy i am not sure how much it is now but i go fap now			"

												I love the original NES game, even with the clunky NES graphics. While this game has better graphics, it has clearly lost its way due to the port. I wanted to love this game. I wanted to be able to recommend this game. I simply cannot.What went wrong?- The control scheme is actually worse than the NES classic (even emulated versions).- The level design, while mostly true to the original, is off in a number of places. This makes some of the trick swings impossible to do. This shows a clear lack of QA testing.- Limited extra lives. The classic game had areas where you could repeatedly go back and pick up more extra lives. In this version, if you pick up an extra life, it is gone.- The hacking mini-game. Just sucks.- Removal of the nazis. Just more PC correctness.- The new graphics actually hide things that it shouldn't.- The U. N. areas were completely reworked.What went right?- Colorful updated graphics.- They mostly kept the soundtrack.			"

												I never played the original NES game before, but this is a great remake! The graphics look good while still retaining that old-school 2D-action feel; the character portraits look great as well.The controls may seem a bit daunting at first, but once you get used to the fact that you can't jump and have to use your bionic arm, you become pretty good at it and you'll swing around everywhere.The story is simple and doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's entertaining.This game is way better than the re-imagined 3D Bionic Commando. Highly recommended for any old school 2D action-plattformer fans.German buyers beware: the ending in the German version is censored. (Everything else is the same.)			"

If you were raised in the SNES or earlier era of video games, you may want to think twice.  It will get old quick if there's no nostalgia to back it up.  Watch my full video review here:

												Pretty well done remake of the NES classic. The boss fights (if you can even call them that) from the old version have been almost totally redone, and are much more satisfying. They are actually unique boss fights, rather than just swarms of enemies coming at you while you try to destroy a reactor.The remixed and new music, as well as the sound effects, sound good while keeping a hint of their retro roots. Similar to the music, the levels maintain a nice balance of retro throwbacks and new creations deisgned to really test your ability with the bionic arm. The difficulty of the platforming ramps up nicely, and gets kind of rough at some end parts. There are unlockable challenge rooms as well, that will teach you more advanced mechanics, and improve your skills.The weapons from the original have all been reworked and are more varied, with certain weapons performing better against certain foes, or in certain situations. The top down levels when you encounter an enemy on the map have been improved as well, but they are so easy and short that they almost feel more like an inconvenience than an addition to the gameplay.The ""puzzles"" you must solve when you hack into enemy communications are also pretty pointless. 95% of the time, there is only one move you can make per turn that won't result in instant failure. This makes them almost solve themselves, and ensures you are not required to actually think for yourself at all.That being said, in regards to the communication rooms, you are no longer required to have the correct color radio selected to be able to communicate without just getting static. This is a really nice change.Overall, it's a very well done remake, that manages to stay true to the original while expanding on the experience. The complaints are minor, and if you enjoyed the original this is kind of a no brainer.			"

Unfortunately, this includes an overhaul to the story, particularly the ending, which felt underwhelming compared to the original. The best part of the update is that some of the achievements unlock rewards in the new Bionic Commando.			"

												This was my first CAPCOM game that I had ever played. I know that CAPCOM has <i>thousands</i> of other games, but after my experience, BCR was probably one of the best to start with. I hate platformers, so when I found out this was a platformer I was a little turned off. However, I had just bought the 2-pack with BCR and the sequel, Bionic Commando, for sale, and I hate jumping into a story without any prior knowledge, so I decided to play through the first one for some background info. After I got used to the controls, I found this game extremely fun. I made it through the first couple of levels pretty quickly, and proceeded to continue with the game. In BCR, there are enemy encounters, and I felt cocky, so I decided to initiate one. That's when I got a big surprise; some parts of the game are played in top-down/isometric shooter mode! Now, most people would just be like,""Oh, well... That's pretty neat!"" but I have been on a Diablo-esque hook, meaning I have been hooked on the top-down/isometric playstyle of Diablo and other games, so I was really intrigued by this. Sadly, enemy encounters are very short, but they aren't really a main part of the game, so that's to be expected. All in all, I'm hooked on this old relic of a platformer and can't wait until I play the sequel!			"

												BCR is incredibly difficult, with really hard level design, challenging bosses, and nonsensical physics. In other words, its a perfect ""remake"" of old NES platform games. Not actually a level for level remake of the oringinal bionic commando as far as I remember, it has tons of content, but if you're easily frustrated I'd avoid this. It would have been so much better without a lives mechanic, especially since it doesn't actually show you how many lives you have anywhere on the hud.			"

After I got used to the controls, I found this game extremely fun. I made it through the first couple of levels pretty quickly, and proceeded to continue with the game. In BCR, there are enemy encounters, and I felt cocky, so I decided to initiate one. That's when I got a big surprise; some parts of the game are played in top-down/isometric shooter mode! Now, most people would just be like,""Oh, well... That's pretty neat!"" but I have been on a Diablo-esque hook, meaning I have been hooked on the top-down/isometric playstyle of Diablo and other games, so I was really intrigued by this. Sadly, enemy encounters are very short, but they aren't really a main part of the game, so that's to be expected. All in all, I'm hooked on this old relic of a platformer and can't wait until I play the sequel!			"

												This game was so incredibly boring I was amazed it even got released. I worry about the man who made the promo video. Does he sit awake at night, feeling guilt over the long hours he toiled away making that video... pretending the game wasn't a complete waste of time? Will he ever forgive himself?			"

												Buy this on PS3, not on PC. I hate to reccomend a console version, but the controls are far less responsive here. Trying to do much of anything is just going to end with dying. Just on the first boss the claw likes to completely miss the platform you're trying to grab, or will leave you hanging in the line of fire when you try to climb. If you can get a hand on the controls, or play on PS3, though, it's a GREAT game. I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed the second Rearmed game isn't on PC.			"

												A fantastic remake of the original NES game.  If you played through at least half of the old version, this game is a must-have.  If you were raised in the SNES or earlier era of video games, you may want to think twice.  It will get old quick if there's no nostalgia to back it up.  Watch my full video review here:

												A nearly shot for shot remake of Bionic Commando for NES. The graphics look great, the gameplay is as solid as ever, and there are extra challange rooms, some of which are impossibly hard. The main game is also just as hard as the original NES game was. Tough but fair, some cool weapons, and an additional level at the end of the game. A ridiculous value.			"

												I had this game for PS3 and enjoyed it. Never beat that last level though. So when I seen it on Steam it was a no brainer. Every level is available to replay even after the game is finished. Lots of challenge maps too. If you're into oldschool 2D type games, this is a cool game. Pro: Higher frame rate than it's Ps3 version.Con: I really wish it had Steam achievements. Ps3 had trophies. Boo hoo on that.			"

												Great local coop or single player game. You use this neat bionic arm to grapple to ledges, grab objects to toss at enemies, and grab enemies in later gameplay.  The game can be challenging at times but if it gets too hard there is an easy mode that basically removes some of the pitfalls you would normally fall through. If you like side-scrolling games with some 3D polish and don’t have this on an NES pick it up.			"

												Apparently a boken installer on the Steam version is missing dependencies (PhysX DLLs). You have to find and download a specific older version of PhysX from nvidia to make this work. I wish I could write a review of STEAM utterly failing to ensure that games they sell actually work. I can't do that, so at least this warning may help someone considering this game.			"

However this game really lacks some essential quality control. I managed to dodge the frequently mentioned PhysX crash, but when I started playing I got black screen here and there. Some weird screen flickering in others. Come on, this game has really basic and simple graphics to cause that many issues. Really disappointing.			"

												Not a bad game, though it is quite challenging! The bionic arm is fiddly and at times doesn't quite shoot in the direction intended regardless of the arrow-keys it's a nightmare to use correctly, the trailer made it look so elegant and easy but I can assure you it's not. Atleast I can't work the thing anyway. Despite that, I'd recommend the game, fun, interesting, puzzling and a good overall time-killer. The music is pretty decent too!  "

												A lot of pride and care has gone in to this remake of the classic Bionic Commando and it really shows. It's very well done but unfortunately the controls can be somewhat frustrating, and with Rearmed being a unforgiving platformer while platformers are not my strong point to begin with it resulted in with me giving up after a while and moving on to something i felt more in control of.A shame, but i would still recommend it to players who do like their 2D platformers and especially to anyone who has played and loved the original.

												This game is a throwback to the days of old, where arcade machines ruled the roost way back in the 80's to 90's. Bionic Commando Rearmed is a remake to the original 1987 NES game. This game is seriously challenging and reminds us of how difficult games were back in the day. Controls are responsive and tight, level design is awesome and the graphics are nice and shiny. The gameplay can feel a little stiff, especially since you can't jump in this game (you use your bionic arm as a hook instead) and the last level is particularly punishing (took me 30 minutes just to get to the boss). In summary, Bionic Commando Rearmed is a great game for people who enjoy action arcade games like Metal Slug and Contra.			"

												I brought this in the sale thinking it would be a decent game but it sucks big time, the graphics are poorly grainy, it's very slow but the one thing that kills the game is the controls, trying to use the grappling hook doesn't work properly, especially if using the xbox 360 controller, but even with that it's sluggish to play, I played about 20 minutes of it and it's a waste of money no matter how much you pay for it. I don't recommend it at all.			"

												An excellent remake of the original. As 2D platformers go, this was one of the best from the 8bit NES days. It has been updated some, and not just the graphics. Unfortunately, this includes an overhaul to the story, particularly the ending, which felt underwhelming compared to the original. The best part of the update is that some of the achievements unlock rewards in the new Bionic Commando.			"

												This game is fantastic. Great Nintendo-hard gaming. From an era when games were difficult so they'd last longer and satisfaction was derived from learning patterns and exploiting them. I played Bionic Commando on NES as a kid, Rearmed on PS3 when it was released in 2008, and now again on Steam since I picked it up for $2. Worth it even at $10.The music is excellent. Gameplay and controls are tight. Graphics and animations are beautiful. Overall difficulty is right where it should be. Tough, but not nearly too hard. Success always seems right around the corner.This game has been criminally maligned on Steam. I'll address a couple complaints I've seen in some less enlightened reviews:1. Crashing/Failing to Start (Win10). I encountered crashing at first. Driver issue. Fixed it in 30 seconds here: http://www.nvidia.com/content/DriverDownload-March2009/confirmation.php?url=/Windows/9.12.1031/PhysX-9.12.1031-SystemSoftware-Legacy.msi&lang=us&type=Other2. No Jump Button/Unintuitive Controls. You are correct. There is no jump button. The controls are not what you're used to if you only know Mario. Don't give up so easily. The controls are unorthodox, not unintuitive. You've just never seen a game that controls like this one. Spend a little time learning how to swing around and soon enough you'll feel like a total badass. Make no mistake: it DOES require learning. But learn. It's worth it.I love this game. I beat it once and intend to beat it several more times. There are secrets to find and scores to improve on. If you can't be bothered to download an outdated driver and spend a few minutes learning a control scheme no other game has, then yes, skip Bionic Commando Rearmed. Otherwise, pick it up, give it a try, have fun! "

												Having never played the original, I really wanted to try out the remake, especially after playing the demo on the PS3 and falling in love with the title song. The game is not complicated, weapons are varied and have different uses, and the graphics are colorful and varient. Only gripes I may have are there's no online coop or multiplayer, sometimes the background scenery can distract you and make you think it's part of the level, and some pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemy placements. Overall, I'll recommend the game, especially on a sale (Capcom sale currently going on with $1.99. It's a steal). The people who complain about ""Theres no jjump!!1"" have trouble getting the idea of different control schemes in their head.

												Really, really hoped this would be a good game. Loved the original back in the day.Unfortunately, this game doesn't work on modern computers (weird since this is an updated game and not simply a ""fix"" to an old game).If you want to try to get it to work, you first have to install some legacy drivers for your graphics card. For some, that seems to work. Worked for me for one play attempt. Then the game started freezing up on certain screens. I adjusted everything I could think of to make it work again but never got the freezes up to stop.Until the developers decide to fix this game to work on updated systems, don't waste your money			"

												Pretty much the greatest NES remake ever made. GRiN was a great team. If you voted this down it IS because you do not understand the arm mechanics. The directions are slightly different while on the ground and in the air. There are also tricks and cancels you need to learn to ""git gud"" with the bionic  arm. You will know you are getting good at this once the super hard difficulty does not phase you anymore. BEST soundtrack. Steam hours do not reflect my playtime for this game. Well over 500 hours on Xbox 360 and PS3. Check the leaderboards. 9.5/10			"

												*First of all read this if you want it to work* (come with me if you want to live): uninstall any PhysX version you may have currently yes you need PhysX even if you have an ATI card. (windows settings > apps and programs scroll to the N's for Nvidia PhysX) next go to the discussion forums on steam and follow the first link in the sticky post at the top of the forum to get the right version of the Legacy PhysX drivers. INSTALL THAT, then and only then follow the NEXT link to get the most up to date version of PhysX drivers and INSTALL THAT. they coexist together (and wont bork Fallout 4 that way) if you install them in the right order. Do it in the opposite order and the old legacy drivers wont install and the game wont run. Only install the legacy drivers and Fallout4 might not run. Now that you've got the game running. Leave a real review because you're not a helpless millenial gamer who gives up the moment something doesn't work or worse uses Microsoft backup (shudder) to ""roll back"" your system.Now for the review this game is awesome, full of nostalgic feels and music that pays homage to the original, if you played the original and loved it you might even choke up a few times, yes its that good. The revamp is carried off wonderfully though it's actually harder on the boss battles (this is a good thing) than the original and that's mostly because the better physics model makes it harder to ""cheeze"" the bosses. This is a great game, it captures the magic of the original the manic desperation of flinging your bionic arm out to save yourself or get across a hard area.All you Quake CTF era players and basically anyone who ever played a game with a Grappling hook (Earthworm Jim, Trine untold other games I'm looking at you) can show your gamer respect to Bionic Commando for introducing one of the most fun free form emergent skill based gameplay mechanics ever thought up.And yes its that good.I give it 11 out of 11 Keks			"

												This game is absolutely brilliant. If you never played Bionic Commando on the NES, you don't need to do so to enjoy this game as it is better in pretty much every way possible. There are however plenty of eastereggs and funny references that fans of the original game will appreciate. The difficulty level has been stepped up with multiple difficulty settings avalible, and the AI is very impressive for a 2D platformer. All the boss battles have also been completely changed for the better, and if you choose to play in coop their behavior adjust so that team work is required to destroy them. In the original game weapons had very little importance, but this time around every weapon is uniqe and has its own useful applications, which is nice given that the enemy variety has been improved as well. If you were unaware, the gimmick in this game is that you cannot jump and have to rely on using a grapple hook arm to get around. The arm functions pretty much the same way it did in the original game, but with some added features such as the ability to pick up and throw barrels as well as some enemies. The ONE issue I have with this game is that if you play on a keyboard you won't be able to control your RC rockets separately from your walking, which makes the final encounter notoriously more difficult.

												It's hard to recommend a game that crashes upon startup right out of the box (you fix this by downloading a legacy Nvidia PhysX driver).However, once you get that fixed, the game is a pretty good experience. Bionic commando is a 2D platformer where there is NO jump button! Your mobility comes in the form of a bionic arm that is akin to being a very unmaneuverable Spider-man. You get to fire a limited burst of rounds, no matter how fast you press the fire button. You have a limited number of lives (3) to finish a level. It's a very old-school game (it is a remake of one, after all), so if this is the kind of experience you want: Bionic Commando has it. At least they save the game in between levels.6/10 ""Okay""			"
