												Having sunk over 200 hours into this game alone, over 500 hours in total for this whole trilogy how can I not say this is one of the greatest adventures I've had ever in my life. This is not just a game that you play like call of duty just to pass the time, this series has become a religious experience, a lifestyle.When I first loaded up this game I had no idea what I was in for, but it gave off a seriously special energy and I got sucked into a living, breathing universe...full of wonder, full of excitement and it shook me like Star Wars KOTOR never could (and is the reason why and how I even bought this game). Don't even think is this game going to be good enough for my $20 (Australia), if you can afford it just buy it and open your heart, mind and soul to this amazing experience. Don't listen to the haters crying about there ME3 endings that they never got etc, its the journey, the friendships you create, the relationships you forge, the hearts you can break, the tears that can be shed. Don't miss out.Love you Bioware, you have turned my world and my views, my inner essence, my personality upside down, inside out and blown it to hell and back (in a good way). You've made me mad, you've made me sad, made me happy, made me cry, made me scream the roof down. How many games can you get emotionally, psychologically and spiritually attached to.Games are artwork like paintings and music for this technological generation, this game is a work of art. AAA+			"

												I'll be honest and admit that I very rarely finish the games that I purchase. I usually play them until I get bored or see something else that grabs my attention.Not Mass Effect. I've finished all of these games several times, ME2 probably being the best of the bunch. They are all good and well worth playing. I'm a 35 yr old physician and I was waiting in line with teenagers at midnight for the release of ME2 and ME3 at Gamestop. I had a great time. 10/10 Would debate Miranda's cup-size with emo hoodlums again			"

												Favorite game of all time.Awful inventory system, didn't really care about the combat system, couldn't care less about upgrades, weapons, etc, graphics are fine for its time, BUT...But if you are a fan of epic science fiction stories (Dune, Hyperion, etc) as I am, with the vast, diverse and interesting worlds and species and their relationships to each other along with an ominus evil lurring to destroy the galaxy, then BY GOD this is the game for you.Great characters, a plethora of game-changing choices, awesome antagonist, amazing story, incredible dialogue... Simply excellent. I cannot recommend this enough.			"

												""A tear comes to my eye as I think about how best to express the pure joy this game brings. That sense of joy can come from climbing to the top of a mountain on a world at furthest reaches of the galaxy and witnessing an alien sunrise, the stunning and original story line, and even looking down at your feet as you board a cargo ship and see the entire universe below you. All these things can only begin to explain the wonders of this game."" Beautiful space opera, with huge beautiful world to explore, and with great and deep characters to discover. it's a whole new world and you going to fall in love with it.			"

												Mass Effect is a sci-fi shooter with a great storyline and characters that I grew fond of, as if they were really my squad members. I fell in love with this game with time as the story and characters developed, I've never played any game like it, and I highly doubt any other sci-fi game series could be as awesome as Mass Effect. It is truly unique and very enjoyable to play. Give it a try!			"

												Punched a reporter.10/10 would punch again.In all seriousness, Mass Effect is a well-rounded game from BioWare, the people that defined my childhood with such classics as Neverwinter Nights, and my all-time favorite, Knights of the Old Republic.This first step into the trilogy, puts you into the boots of Commander Shepard. He (or she) is given the task of stopping a rogue Spectre from... you guess it, taking over the galaxy (OF COURSE!) Along the way, you pick up a colorful cast of characters that help Shepard every step of the way.One of the things I really like about Mass Effect is its approach to morality. It is not the standard good vs evil choice. To put this in Star Trek terms, Paragon Shepard is more like Jean-Luc Picard or Kathryn Janeway, always willing to go for diplomacy first. Conversely, Renegade Shepard is more analogous to Benjamin Sisko; doing whatever it takes to get the job done, and sometimes crossing the line. But even though ReneShep may cross that line, he or she, is willing to live with the decision regardless of the consequences.Gameplay may seem a little archaic especially when compared to the later games in the trilogy, but there is something about it that I find charming in its design. Sure, inventory management can be a bit of a hassle, but let's face it, no game has ever really had a perfect inventory system. The shooting is solid enough, even though the guns sound like pea shooters (This only applies to the pistols. The shotguns, and sniper rifles have weight to their sound assets), and the variety of ammunition types, equipment and powers allow for a lot of replayability. Plus, you can take your completed Shepard, and import him or her into the next two games, taking your decisions with you.So, what about Shepard? Take a seat, relax, and begin your journey to find out.			"

The story is deep, serious ♥♥♥♥. You like galactic, cyberpunk stuff that reminds you of swtor? Play this, it's so precise, voice acting for every moving thing, storyline has so much attention to detail, especially the characters, they DIFFER so much from each other, and it continues to develop and evolve as the series continues. Music is so nostalgic, everything is ace, the film-grain effect for that retro look... People don't pay respects to these little details that the bioware team throws in. They are aware of every aspect of good storytelling, and they exploit it well in this series.Summarising stories is the worst way to fish someone into what you're selling, won't want to make them play it for ♥♥♥♥. If I summarized the storyline it would be; 'you are commander shepard, goal is to save the galaxy with a team' But the storyline isn't what it is about, otherwise there would be so much of the same ♥♥♥♥ in both the gaming and film industry, what really matters is how you execute it. Play this game, it will hook you in the first 3-4 hours, if it doesn't, then it isn't your thing. It's a game that isn't open-world yet offers so much freedom.PROS:+ Definitely one of the most interesting, yet complex plots out there+ Gameplay is dynamically shaped by your actions and dialogue selections+ Can go around as a total ♥♥♥♥, or an ethical and universal role model+ Epic protagonist+ Great model designs

												(Just for clarification I've played this game like 6 times outside of steam)There are games you like. There are games you love, and replay many times.And then there are the games which almost bring a tear to your eye every time you start them. The games which you've played enough times, you can quote the dialogue, speedrun the game perfectly, and remember every encounter from. Because those games are masterpieces.This is one of those games.			"

												It probably hasn't aged as well as some other games out there, but it's the first game in one of the greatest trilogies of all time set in a unquestionably plausible, if fictional, universe. The later games may have better graphics and slightly improved mechanics, but without completing ME1 you won't have the proper foundation to fully appreciate them.			"

												Mass Effect is the template for modern games in general. It has a great story, lots of characters, good voice acting and cool gameplay. Even now, several years after its release and two sequels, it still holds up better than most games.The orginal Mass Effect has something that its succesors do not have: style ánd substance. The original has hundreds of customisation options. Skill trees are huge and you can easily invest in skills that are not entirely related to your class. It is a bit like Dark Souls in that you can still adopt to suit the situation. You are not irrevocably commited to a single style. This allows you to change things up and to keep the long quest fresh. This word: commitment. In Mass Effect 2 you would commit to romancing a partner, playing a class and upgrading some weapons. In the original, you spend way more time exploring, fighting and doing cool stuff in general, while still keeping the interactions with your team interesting enough for you to invest in them. Mass Effect is balanced in its commitments, not overly invested in one or the other. It does a lot of things right, but it certainly isn't the best in any area. However, when taken together, you get a very complete and incredible game. I admit, it may have some problems, like the Mako's gravity defying motions or the tedious shootouts in bunkers that lead to nothing but more worthless junk. However, if you cannot overlook these issues then I suggest you take step back and consider the point of exploring. Bioware has built entire planets for you to explore, and you complain about the space suit you found that happens to be too pink? You are missing the point. If gratification is what you want, then go play something else. Mass Effect is a genuine experience; something that needs to be played to be enjoyed. It isn't the result that matters, but the process.			"

												Mass Effect is an action role playing third person shooter game, developed by BioWare. Releasing on Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. The game was released in November 2007 as a timed Xbox exclusive, but eventually got ported to PC in May 2008. The game starts out with you being able to fully customize the appearance of the main character, male or female, abilities, and background story.  The game play is based a lot around a squad of three characters including you. There are six difference “classes” that come in the form of important characters that you encounter throughout the game. Each of these classes will level up, and have their own special abilities and talent tree to select from.  The talent tree is very detailed, allowing you to spec each class into specialized roles which you will take on different missions depending on what enemies you will be facing. The game’ combat system is primarily in real time, but you can pause at any time to give orders to your squad. I however found this to be a very negligible feature as I had no use for it all, I don’t think I used even once. The combat is very easy to get to grasps with. A really good cover based system is included, with some really tight controls to boot. Whilst you do have unlimited ammo for your weapons, you do run the risk of overheating your guns if you just continuously fire, meaning you have to take breaks in your onslaught for a few seconds at a time or you can simply switch to one of your many other weapons. I liked the idea behind not having to scavenge around for ammunition, its 2183…it’s all lasers for gods sakes! :)  Another key game play element comes in the form of the dialogue and morality system. A really good portion of the game takes place in dialogue scenes with NPCs, your answers really do matter and can sometimes change the course of events which carry out for the rest of the game. I am not normally a fan of games which have too much dialogue, but I was completely intrigued to explore each dialogue option to delve deeper and immerse myself completely in the story. Different actions and different results will affect your morality, completing the main missions don’t really add much to the system, but a lot of the game’s side missions make you choose a “good” or “bad” resolution to them, which really makes you think sometimes. Mass Effect is almost ten years old now, and whilst it is showing its age, it is certainly still an OK looking game by today’s standards.  All of the animations are really crisp. The textures aren’t all high resolution, but you have to remember the age of the game when playing. The facial modelling of all of the characters is done very well too, and even betters some of the recent titles! I played Mass Effect on the medium difficulty level, and I found the game to be challenging enough so that I wasn’t breezing through the game, but not so hard that I felt I wasn’t able to progress without having the need to grind a few levels before taking on a certain boss or mission. The only times I did find myself getting stuck, is purely a UI issue, rather than the gameplay. The game doesn’t do a fantastic job at telling you where to go next; you have a lot of maps to be able to look through, but no help at all comes for many of the side missions for where you need to go, meaning I had to look up a few of the missions online to be able to work out where to go. The majority of the game’s levels are really well designed. There is really only one main hub of activity in the game which has an open world feel to it, and that is the Citadel. You will find a good portion of the game’s side quests in this location with plenty of NPCs to interact with as well. Each of the game’s main missions takes place on a different planet, and that planet will also have a handful of side missions for you to complete along with the main story. I would urge people to check them out as they are well worth your time, and I didn’t at any point feel like I was completing the same type of mission over and over again. All of the side missions add a great deal of story which also keeps the lore crew happy as well. I have recently just finished my second play through of Mass Effect, the first being a few years ago now. The most recent play through of the game took just under 20 hours to complete, this is with me being in OCD mode and completing all of the side missions, exploring all of the levels and interacting with any of the NPCs I came across. There is a deal of replay ability with Mass Effect, you can of course ramp up the difficulty, but you can also play the game in different styles using the morality system, and changing the gender of your character to also effect relationships with your crew members.  I would even say I could squeeze another two play throughs out of Mass Effect before I would find it hard to find something new to come across. Technically, right now I have to say Mass Effect does have a couple of issues running on newer operating systems. Whilst I didn’t have any crashes or major bugs, I did have a few performance problems with the odd stutter every now and again. I am pretty sure it is not hardware related as my PC is more than capable of running current titles on 4k with high settings. Another pet peeve is that I wasn’t even able to run the game on 1080p; you have to put up with the lower Xbox360 resolutions. I didn’t play with a controller, as I am more interested in being more precise with my aim than anything else to be honest. My conclusion on Mass Effect is, that whilst many of you will have probably already played and finished the game, I would still class this as a must play title for our recent memory. It is the start of a truly fantastic series, and one of the standout titles of the last generation of games. It is showing its age slightly, but Sci-fi fans will want to start here before stepping foot into the Mass Effect world.  If you can look past the aging graphics you have an absolutely stellar story and hella fun gameplay with some heavy RPG elements.

												Mass Effect starts the beginning of a saga that kept fans at the edge of their seats until 2013.  While many will argue that Mass Effect 1 is least important of the series, there is absolutely no reason not to play it.  It feels like a different game than its sequels, and only if you have played Mass Effect will you understand some of the events and consequences that take place through Mass Effects 2 and 3.  Verdict: If you are interested in this trilogy at all, do it right and start from the beginning - Mass Effect.			"

												Ah, Mass Effect... how do I make this review and not sound the slightest biased at all?1- INTRODUCTION Mass Effect is one of those cult classic games that gained recognition due to its advertisement of being a spiritual successor to Knights of the Old Republic. To some degree, yes it is. As soon as you start the game it just screams Star Trek or at the very least any old corny 80s sci-fi TV soap opera or like some people like to call it ""a space opera"". This is definitely one of the charms of this game. It's more about talking and finding resolutions to problems rather than pulling out your plasma rifle and shooting every space-fiend you come across.2- NARRATIVE AND STORYTELLINGJust to get this out of the way, overall the voice acting in this game is great. There wasn't a moment where I went ""jeez that was... yeah"".  Although high quality voice acting is kind of already expected from a studio like Bioware. Anyways;This being the first game of the trilogy the story aspects are still based on foreshadowing while following a basic narrative focus on an objective. In this game the main objective is trying to catch a rouge Spectre (Mass Effect equivalent of a Grey Warden or Jedi) named Saren and bring him to justice for the crimes he commits during the game. Without going into spoiler territory, the game does a great job of keeping narrative cohesiveness no matter which mission order you decide to play the game in which is something dearly missed in the next two sequels that feel disjointed at times. As far as the companions go they're some of the best Bioware companions only slightly falling short of the Dragon Age cast but surpassing a lot of the KotOR cast. All in all, the storytelling in this game is great and always seems to be interesting, whether it be random chatter in the background or the actual dialogue and pacing.  3- MECHANICS Now let's get to the actual mechanics. The overall shooting in the game is above average at best. The guns feel very ""pew pew"" and have very little impact or satisfaction using. The main saving grace for the combat are the powers. Like any Bioware game, it wouldn't be complete without a pause button for tactical awareness, borrowing from the fact that Bioware usually specialize in turn-based real time games. In conjunction with all these powers and the overall shooting there is much to enjoy from the combat as it gives you a sense of command while not relying heavily on RNG and dice roll mechanics since it's a third-person shooter. What about the role-playing? Unlike previous Bioware games where you had a long list of stuff to pick they added in a dialogue wheel which would later be a staple for all Bioware games to come after DA:O. The idea is ingenious as it allows for a much more convenient experience compared to something like KotOR. As good as the dialogue wheel is the actual role-playing suffers from something I like to call ""meta thinking"", I'll elaborate on this later. Like KotOR you're presented with two sides of a black and white world, Paragon (basically Light side) and Renegade (basically Dark side). Like any RPG there's a persuasion mechanic but unlike most RPGs this persuasion mechanic isn't improved by leveling up your persuasion skill/talent etc. You have two persuasion skill trees called Charm (unlocks the blue ultra Paragon options) and Intimidate (unlocks the red ultra Renegade options.). This mechanic would be fine and all if the amount of talent points you can put into them wasn't capped by how much Paragon and Renegade points you accumulated throughout the game. This whole management of morality points just to get the best possible outcome is where this game really falls short. This talent point cap encourages you to only play as a Paragon or only play as a Renegade instead of mixing choices up for a more honest playthrough of what YOU would actually do. If you're planning on playing a mostly good guy you won't be facing most of these problems since getting Paragon points is relatively easy to the point where doing normal sidequests will randomly give you Paragon points out of thin air simply because you played the game. But if you're planning on doing a hardass/jerk/badass while still having good intentions (mostly choosing sarcastic lines while still playing for Paragon outcomes) kind of playthrough you're really going to struggle without ""meta thinking"" and planning out which options you have to be a Renegade about or a Paragon about. There were some choices I regretted doing simply because I need more imaginary morality points to advance my persuasion talent instead of actually playing the game how I wanted to play. Still, it's a little bit of a nitpick that I can't immerse myself in my character and rather go all meta and minmax what mission order I have to do.Another concern this game has is the whole Mako sequences that take place when you land on a random planet and you take control of an exploration vehicle called ""the Mako"". The physics feel odd to say the least and the planets that aren't story mission related are bland and not interesting even if the sidequests on the planet are. When you first play the game it probably won't be a problem at first but if you have played this game to death and beyond like I have these sidequest missions can be a little bit of grind since controlling the Mako up long steep hills isn't the most fun thing to do.4- RESOLUTIONDespite all the ♥♥♥♥ I've thrown at this game, it's still one of my favorites to replay every year or so just to re-experience the joy of how it influenced the type of entertainment I consume today. This will always remain a timeless classic in my eyes.			"

												Let me preface this by saying that I played Mass Effect 2 first on the XBox Before I played Mass Effect 1 on the PC. (Exit OG ME fans and PC loyalists)Let me also say that I believe ME1 to be the better game (Exit ME2 fans).Where to begin? To start, this game is much harder than ME2. Not only is it more difficult (this coming from someone who has beaten both on Veteran difficulty as an Adept), but ME1 is harder in a better way than ME2 is hard. Let me explain: In ME1, there are situations where you can get overwhelmed by enemy numbers, but the difficulty of the encounters usually arise from having to balance tech, biotics, and guns in the right way to beat your enemies. As an adept, I found that abilities like Barrier were indispensible for any engagement because it gives me increased survivability that I can't get from armor (Adepts are restricted to Light Armor). There was a distinct feeling of tactical combat where you had to plan around your enemy's abilities (which they use more liberaly in ME1) and where your abilities seemed useful. In ME2, the difficulty arises almost exclusively from large numbers, constant gunfire, and a Shepard whose shields seem to evaporate almost instantly. Fighting any one enemy in ME2 is the same as fighting any other enemy: remove shields, barriers, and/or armor, hit them with one of the biotic abilities that ragdolls them, spray, and repeat.Another thing that jumps out from my memory is cover in both games. ME2 is a cover-based third-person shooter; to have any hope of surviving an engagement for longer than ten seconds, you MUST find cover. If you aren't close enough to target them with abilities, tough luck. ME1 has cover and incorporates it, but several times I remember the game punishing me for staying in cover for too long. I have lost track of how many times I was sniped or blown up with a rocket for taking cover at inopportune times while dangerous enemies were about. To top it off, if I faced a situation in ME2 analagous to an ME1 situation where I was punished for going into cover, ME2 would reward me by making me impervious to all damage while I wait for my health and shields to regenerate. Cover is not the catch-all solution in ME1 that it is in ME2.ME1 isn't without faults, dear reader. Preach this to the choir: ME1 is slightly uglier, the Mako sections go from ""adorable"" to ""abysmal"" real quick (and they are a sizable part of the game), large exporatory bits like the Citadel are frustrating to navigate, the inventory interface is not the best, the ""quest"" interface is equally frustrating, the gameplay is somewhat unforgiving during the late-game, and the voice acting and writing in ME2 has an edge over ME1 because ME2 has the confidence of a second iteration and it doesn't ham in nearly as much exposition about the universe. I'm sure I'm missing some things, but for all its faults, the things ripped out of the game in ME2 make my playthroughs of ME2 melancholic and boring. No **truly** heat-based weapons, no inventory on the scale of ME1, no modifying weapons on the fly, a MUCH less complex leveling system than in ME1, and the implimentation of regenerating health à la ""most mainstream shooters.""At the last, I will leave you, reader, with this anecdote: When I loaded my ME1 save in ME2 to see what Bioware had in store for people who bought the first game, it was cool to see the choices in the last game reflected in some little blurbs in the early game, but I could not get past the ""thermal clip"" that they pushed on you right out of the gate. In ME1, the fully-voiced Codex explained why reloading was unecesary due to the advent of Mass Effect technology. It was an interesting mechanic that that allowed for some interesting plays to occur, removing some technical difficulty (""I ran out of ammo and now I have to face this boss. How have I failed to arrive at this situation?"") and adding some new opportunities for meaningful difficulty (""That Asari overheated my weapon, which gave her enough time to put me in stasis, expose me, and kill me dead. How can I overcome?""). In ME2, they scrap that unique mechanic with the generic, tried and true ""bullets-in-a-magazine"" mechanic for ammo that you see in almost every other shooter. Not only is this disappointing considering what ME1 was like, but ME2 even teases you with those little blurbs that appear while loading a section of the game. One of them says something along the lines of ""Guns use thermal clips. When it overheats, eject the thermal clip and load in a new one!"" So harshly do I scream at my monitor saying ""THE GUN ISN'T OVERHEATING, THIS IS EA DEMANDING THAT BIOWARE MAKE THE GAME ""MORE ACCESSIBLE"" TO THE GENERAL MARKET!""For those of you into people, ME1 is like a kind of ugly stutterer who has these deep and interesting elements to them that make them a joy to be around. ME2 is like a charismatic, physically attractive person who has a bit of an empty head. They're cool to look at, but beyond first impressions, interactions with them get old REALLY fast, especially in light of your interactions with the ugly stutterer.Playing this game after playing Mass Effect 2 makes the sequel look like it was made for children.tl;dr: After beating both ME1 and ME2, I must say that ME1 is the better game, so buy it.

												It's hard for me to quantify in words what I liked about Mass Effect. Both back when it first released and upon retrospect.Mass Effect was a huge turning point with video games and its influence is still readily seen to this day. It marked the shift toward cinematic based games becoming the norm and allowing you to interact with the events. It influenced dialogue driven protagonists with their own dialogue trees and progression systems. And it modernized concepts Bioware previously did in Baldur's Gate like party romances. Much of this was done before in games like Kotor or Metal Gear Solid, but Mass Effect tied everything up into a neat well polished package. This was a game that blew me away when I first played it. It was truly the first 7th gen game that indicated to me where video games would eventually go. It looked amazing and I fell in love with the gameplay and all of the characters. It really was a game Bioware made in their prime.Naturally playing it today will make you notice the game hasn't aged all that well. Bioware was still transitioning from mostly making turn based games like Kotor so they didn't quite perfect the gameplay til the sequel. I still highly recommend playing Mass Effect 1. It is easily one of the last great games Bioware made.

												After doing 5 walkthroughs and reaching over 150 hours with Mass Effect I have to say this is one of the best games I have ever played. Game mechanics are mediocre at best - the cover system is not the best and managing your inventory could have been much better. But this was released for consoles back in 2007. We have come a long way in this genre since that year so let's just accept these issues as well as the somewhat dated graphics and focus on the story instead.Well, the story is all about a commander called Shepard who is tasked with capturing Saren who goes rogue and by doing so endangers the lives of many. He is from a race called Turian and is an agent of the notorious group called Spectre. Along the way Shepard discovers Saren is just a pawn in this game. He continues to uncover who exactly is in the background and the findings are interesting enough to have two more sequels for this game.The sequel focuses more on the action and the third and final episode tries to combine both. At this point you have probably heard of the controversy in connection with the ending of the trilogy. It is always nice to start with the first where there were no expectations and this is where you meet the Commander and the various races living in the galaxy. There are tons of side missions and you have your own ship to control to be able to reach the planet you desire. You meet new characters who'll join you as during each mission you control a squad consisting of 3 people. What makes Mass Effect really great is its depth! How the story unfolds and not just the main story but the story of each and every character important to Shepard's quest. From time to time you get to make decisions and these decisions can seriously affect the storyline. The personality trait you have is also very important: going with the good choices makes you a paragon in the eyes of your comrades while sticking to the darker side (you see what I did there?) renders you a renegade. A 2nd walkthrough is the minimum just for the sake of seeing what could have happened if you'd gone the other way.Mass Effect is a great game: Its storyline, music, voice acting (the female Shepard's voice is equally good), characters, art design are all top notch. You didn't like the casualness of the second part and the ending of the trilogy was a letdown for you? Grab the 1st where it all started. But this time, pick a different line in a conversation or a different class for Shepard at the beginning. Or a different background for him. Or simply complete some side missions in a totally different order. One thing is for certain: you'll find something new in your next walkthrough.			"

How would you like to command a space ship and take part in building the image of humanity for all the other aliens in the galaxy?  Basically, that's  the question, Commander Shepard, your character is asked early on in the game, asked as in obliged. This is a game developed at the time where BioWare was respecting its fanbase same as CD Projekt of today. That said, you get to play through a well written storyline, faulty combat that has its charm, original soundtrack that whenever you're going to listen to again, you're going to relive the feelings and last but not least, graphics that are today outdated, yet possible to mod with some sweet 4k textures and having a strong art style, it still got the touch.     The whole Mass Effect trilogy is remembered for it's characters, but the first one doesn't only have the memorable squad mates and NPCs, but also an original story, with the least tropes and cliches of the bunch and non-arugable, the most solid regarding plot and pace. In a galaxy where humanity is new and relatively unproven, you, Commander Shepard, get to be the first human Spectre, an agent authorized by the Council to do anything, have to catch a veteran rogue spectre, finding out his motives and putting an end to whatever he is scheming. It's the tale of your rise. A tale where you write history by fighting alongside humans and aliens, getting involved in both trivial and important matters, a tale that grows more grave as it progresses. And like any good BioWare games, you'll have to make hard choices that DO have consequences. There are conversations you can carry on with different characters(especially your crew) that can determine your relationship with them and leave a mark on them throughout the trilogy.       Regarding customization, you can change gender, facial traits(including scars), name, classes and background profile. The first and last two can change certain options in the story line. As you progress in the game, you'll gain either paragon, renegade or both kind of points, having more into one will make certain dialogue lines available to you and some gameplay bonuses. Also, the extreme of your morality will change the environment, soundtrack and a background picture at the end of the game.       Soundtrack is how it should be, giving the right vibes of what should any intro into a Sci-Fi should: the feeling you're stepping into mysterious grounds while wondering if the advancements you have will be enough. Certain key moments are enhanced by the soundtrack, decisions sound more dire, discoveries more interesting and the ending a hell lot more epic.       The gameplay is original as well; your weapons don't use ammo, but they can overheat. However, with the right weapons and the right weapon modding, shooting infinitely is almost reachable, but unnecessary, since most enemies die from the high level weapons. You can loot guns and equipment from corpses or crates, loot that can be used by you or your squadmaters, if the specifics are met.    There are unknown planets with different Eco systems and points of attractions for you to explore, with everyone's favorite vehicle, the Mako, which rides mountains just like horses in Skyrim(but with better logic) and bounces good enough to dance on ""Moves like Jagger"".        One more big fuss about this game is the romance options. You can end up into a relationship with a crew-mate. There are two options for each gender, the human of the opposite gender that is in the squad from the prologue or the hot blue alien which is a she no matter what.       For most good old games I feel the need to ask potential players to give it 3-6 hours or more for the game to get to them, but Mass Effect is engrossing since the beginning and it's new game plus material, not just for gameplay and achievements but for making different choices in the storyline you're going to remember for a long time.        Mass Effect is the starting point for a beloved trilogy, but also the kind of game that stands well on its own. It's not just nostalgia that makes some fans call it the best of the series. Even by today's standards, it's still unique and an example of how new Sci-Fi's should be made. The campaign can take between 15 to 60 hours, depending on how you play it, but even 15 is enough to satisfy(although you might find yourself spending more time than you'd decide). It runs with no problems with newer systems and the price is low regarding what is has to offer. In other words, it is a MUST BUY!      I'm a Mass Effect fan and this is my favorite game in the Galaxy! "

A great stroy, wonderful characters that develop throughout the games, romances everywhere and a galactical threat that makes you the paragon/renegade hero of the entire galaxy. I know all the criticism, I agree to most of it, but that doesn't make me stop playing this game over and over again and I have played it five times already, literally.Be the man/woman you always wanted to be, emerge into this fantastic universe and see what you can do to make it a better place for all species.

And by perfect I mean the style fits everything else the game is trying to do exactly how it should+ Controls are exactly how you'd want them (Except for the Mako)+ Story has lots of depth and is plenty interesting+ Leveling up is amazingly satisfying+ Plenty of armor, weapon, and upgrade options+ Mako roaming splits up the on foot action very, very well+ Keith David+ Plenty of side quests+ Combat has tons of depth+ Recharging weapons make for unique combat+ You can be a total ♥♥♥♥ to everyone you don't like+ Keith David is amazing+ Music is amazing+ Did I mention Keith David!?Not so good:- It's quite linear (Which isn't a big issue at all, for me at least)- Some bugs here and there (You may end up having to reload a time or two)- You're glued to the ground (Probably more a personal issue)- The Mako could control more smoothlyMy complaints are minor while my compliments are off the charts.

												After replaying the entire trilogy a few times I am more convinced than ever that Mass Effect 1 is the best game of the series.Is it the most polished game of the series? No, that's ME2.Does it have the smoothest combat of the series? No, that's ME3.Does it have the best-written character/character arc of the series? No, that's Mordin Solus.But what it does have is the most cohesive design and story, an interesting universe, a great soundtrack and by far the least amount of fan pandering.It also runs quite well on PC. It does not have a wide array of in-game options or settings but if you are willing to edit some of the .ini files you will be able to really make the game shine.

												Mass Effect, released in 2007. Really? How could I live all those years without experiencing it? This game belongs to MUST PLAY section. The whole Mass Effect series!This game has it all. All the other games are about saving a girlfriend or a family, saving a city, a state, our planet, but the whole galaxy?? Mass Effect has definitely very interesting and exciting narrative, great character development and voice acting. It's a game where player choice affects the story of the entire Mass Effect Trilogy!If you want to see what I enjoyed the most here is  My Twitch Clips Compilation  full of love, drama, jealousy, violence on reporters, deadly yet hilarious fails, game glitches, nice music and happy endings!Please, if you want to get the full experience, start with this first Mass Effect! Highly recommended game and not only because it contains the best sex scenes I've ever seen in a video game..! ;)If you have any questions or comments feel free to post them!Mass Effect Andromeda is coming soooon yay!

A letter for the future generation of gamers and the newcomerIf you're reading this to check if the game is worthy, no matter how many years have passed since then, I wish you to know that I'm representing many Mass Effect fans out there and that my words are the actual representation of what we all feel, for I believe this game will stand the test of time.You're about to experience the ultimate word on story-telling sophistication of our time. The game itself had a lot of technical problems which includes too much ''loading screens'' of about everything you do or walk, wrong faced player camera after a cutscene and even some other design problems, but you may consideer all this unavoidable during the year 2008, Mass Effect was ahead of his times and all ambitious projects are prone to technical problems. What we advise you to do however, is to tolerate all the flaws at first because you will understand soon or later, if given the chance, why this game has spawned the best and biggest fans in gaming's history.Sometimes we just don't want to mumble about technical problems because we strongly believe it isn't just about that and it isn't really important. I refuse to highlight all of the cons and compromise what you're about to experience so I decided to keep things short and objective with the honesty about what matters, this is what we all experienced, some at first hand or a few later: Characters feels real, because they got too many lines and intricate personality. Soon you forget they're fictious and as they're part of your team your first instinct is - to care. This applies even for lesser NPCs you don't regularly interact with.The original soundtrack is the work of a master, every single piece of song fits perfectly on any ocassion in-game. All brought to you by Sam Hullick and Jack Wall which they got some inspiration from the 80s sci-fi movies, the best classical source for sci-fi. Such as Blade Runner.The plot was written firstly by Drew Karpyshyn, the real mastermind behind it and it was based on what really works; unexpected turn arounds. No one believes in you but your real friends and that creates a sense of heroism with commitment never done by any game before it. After he left the series, not much hope was left.As with the beginning of the series, ME1 as we call it is literally more RPG than Action. But the action is there and the tactics you can implement are a hybrid mouisture of dexterity with turn-battles when you pause time.When the music M4 Part II from the band Faunts plays with the staff roll, you know what you just experienced was a miracle. The proof human creativity, team work and artistic design has literally no limits and the result of that work remains on you.Every game needs personality and a soul. The sophistication I speak about was achieved through the narrative almost in the totallity of it and the majority of your experience will be triggered by human emotions - from the music, plot and the characters and the events e situation - for and to you directly. It's a Bioware signature since ever but better on Mass Effect.There are many positive things left we can't just express if we want to keep this letter on medium and wouldn't ever fit in here.In this letter I wish to write here for the record, so far great promises are coming from Mass Effect Andromeda which is almost releasing. If some of us aren't too happy, you can blame Electronic Arts. During Mass Effect 3 closure to our beloved series, they commited a series of mistakes such as rushing the game and its ending for the sake of their gains and also for pure incompetence. So far if it keeps rocking, we keep digging it... because we respect Bioware. Whatever had happened before and whatever awaits for us up ahead, It is here were it all began and will forever lives in our hearths. This is what it means to be a real N7, to flow with love and be aware of hate and all consequences that follows with both.Brazil born, Survivor, N7 Infiltrator. Balanced alligment, Tali's lover. Synthesis was the solution.Originally posted by Shepard to Andromeda Initiative:We have not other choice but to thrive.Sincerely, Mauro A. Souza - Signing off. "

Mass Effect begins the story of Commander Shepard. Please note that both Pinnacle Station and Bring Down the Sky DLC are free, but are not included with the Steam Version of Mass Effect.You can grab them from here: https://help.ea.com/en-us/help/dragon-age/dragon-age-origins/bioware-classics-dlcPROS- Textures are low quality, but there's a mod that fixes that called M.E.U.I.T.M- Cheats are incredibly easy to enable/use (to get the Super Armor and Super Gun)- Face off against a Krogan, the Geth, and even a Thresher Maw!- Choose the Paragon [Hero] or the Renegade [Badass] Path, you're choices ultimately shape the game (including what might and might not happen in ME2 or ME3)!CONS- Tali is not a romanceable character until ME2. You're stuck with either Ashley or Liara.- You'll be stuck in the Maco for 30+ minutes driving around large empty planets looking for mineral deposits, crash sites, anomolies and enemy bases.- Items in this game do not upgrade in the traditional sense. Let's say you have a level 1 rifle, if you pick up a level 2 rifle you'll be stuck with both unless you sell or convert it to omnigel.- Some of the planets/bases you go to will look identical but with different textures.My Rating: 10/10 (Highly Recommended) "

												The first game of a truly amazing saga!For those who don't know ME yet: It's a Third-Person-Action-RPG.You're playing Commander Shepard, a man who will become the first human Spectre, an elite force of the galactical council, chasing the rogue spectre named Saren, uncovering the truth behind the disappearence of the protean race and facing an enemy which threatens all living beings in the galaxy.For me, this is one of the most brilliant and memorable game-series i played.The first game is a great start into all the emotions, decisions, the epic story, memorable characters and everything else the series has to offer.But let's not forget about the flaws (oh yeah, there are some)..- some beautiful, but empty and generic worlds to explore- the mako (the vehicle you'll drive on the planets)- there are literally only 3 or 4 interior templates used for sidequests, which make them all look alike (a shame, because the quests itself aren't bad or uninteresting)- the mako- the inventory (you'll end up clicking hundreds of times just to sell your stuff or make it into omnigel...no comfort function)- the freaking mako !seriously, whoever made the mako behave like he does, needs some serious punishment. :)I really like to explore the worlds, but the driving, jumping and general behaviour of the mako just drives me mad.Anyway...apart from these (imho minor) flaws, Mass Effect is a great start of the series and sets the foundation for an epic journey through the galaxy.Highly recommended!

General info~Genre: Action game with roleplaying elements~Number of players: 1~Downloadable content: available (not on Steam)~First part of a trilogy~Completion time: 20-45 hours~High replay valueStrong points+Rich story: Explore the Milky Way occupied by many alien species, each with its own detailed history and culture. Narration is fluid and players won't have any issues following the story as it expands and reach its climax.+Cast: A customizable protagonist (face, gender), ruthless villains and unforgettable companions (with different armour exclusive to their race). Expect to gain more enemies and allies as you clear the galaxy of terrorists and drug warlords.+High replay value: 6 classes that offer different play styles (sentinel, soldier, engineer, etc.), variable companion combinations, New game plus, etc. If you also add the two existing moral paths, the two protagonist genders and end game decisions you might easily spend more than 500 hours on this game.+Challenging: 5 difficulty levels to choose from; including easy, veteran and hardcore. Each difficulty level affects enemies' weapon damage as well as their skill selection and combat behaviour.+Hybrid theory: Mass Effect isn't just a space shooter. You will be constantly switching between action sequences and role playing diplomacy. Many of your previously completed quests will affect NPC's and companions' behaviour. Expect different comments depending on your previous decisions.+Battle tactics: With just a hit of a button you can pause the action and command your team to change positions or targets. You may also, depending on your class, choose different skills which may distract your adversaries (sabotage, lift, synthetic overload, etc.) or obliterate them. As you level up, more skill options become available and it will then rest on your tactical prowess to transform a hellish confrontation into a summer breeze.+From zero to hero: 60 levels to master (50 are accessible in your first playthrough), 6 companions to recruit (humans, asari, krogan, etc.), numerous skills to learn (you cannot maximize all of your skils in one playthrough, try various combinations and pick the ones you enjoy the most).+Devil or angel: Two moral paths to choose from; your overall attitude affects the NPCs' behaviour towards you as well as your appearance. Paragon attitude depicts a forgiving, humane Shepard while the Renegade path is suited for all of you psychos and vigilantes! I've tried them both and they are both rewarding and fun to play as.+Pass the legacy: After finishing the game you can a)export your saved game to Mass effect 2 and keep your key-choices and/or b)start a New game plus with your skills/characteristics intact)+Soundtrack: for a great tale to be told, a music score of equivalent value is needed. Check the whole OST uploaded by TantrisOST in youtube:

			Main Theme to the excellent videogame Mass Effect. Composed by Sam Hulick and Jack Wall.		

+View: with your own spaceship land on imaginary planets, each with its own atmosphere, flora and fauna. You can also visit our Sol system for some funny comments from the crew and codex entry system. Also, on Luna...+Price: significantly low during sales.Weaknesses-Full pockets: In many instances, your inventory will overflow with useless weapons, redundant armour portions and obsolete ammo mods. Do not forget to visit periodically your inventory in order to clean it up or you might end up wasting half an hour during the last chapter making room for some new weapons and armour.-Choices ungiven: despite being abundant, only a few choices actually matter for the game's finale. A few other choices might end up affecting characters shown on the two sequels, but their significance is negligible for everyone who plans to play the first Mass Effect only.-The missing chapter: Unless played as part of a trilogy, Mass effect 1 seems like an unresolved tale. Also, I must add that the third game is not available on Steam and everyone interested must create an account at EA's Origin in order to buy and play the game there.-Not so challenging after all: Mass effect targets a wide audience.  Experienced players may find its simplicity frustrating and its regeneration system debatable. As an old school gamer myself, I never paid too much attention to those mechanics since Mass Effect  finds a few plot tricks to justify them. Play for yourselves and form an opinion based on your own experience.Neutral ground±KotOR clone: Players will identify strong resemblances to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, mainly found at the morale system and plot structure. Bioware never hide the fact that they wanted to create their own space game and their involvement with KotOR affected Mass Effect  alot.My rating4/5
Mass Effect has its flaws, mainly found in the battle system and narration pattern. Nevertheless, if you are tired of medieval cliché with dwarves and elves, try conquering the galaxy nebula by nebula while communicating with alien races or facing your galactic adversaries armed with futuristic weaponry.

												While I've only played through this entry once, I feel I can say this is definitive sci-fi entertainment. Gameplay:The gameplay is a bit clunky and awkward, but I also went back to play this after playing Mass Effect 2 (I wanted to play it again with a save import from the first). It may not seem as bad from the perspective of a new player, but various aspects just feel rough around the edges. From the UI right down to the controls, it feels very, very unrefined. The UI, especially the inventory screen, was a bit confusing the first few hours, and it never really became second nature throughout the rest of the game, as tends to happen with other RPGs. There are also some performances issues and quite a few bugs (it wasn't until after my playthrough that I realized the game didn't look awful at max settings, it was just bugged and forced everything to the lowest settings).While the gunplay and UI are a bit difficult to get a feel for at first, what this game manages to nail down perfectly is interaction with characters. You choose conversation choices from a dialog-wheel. While simple in it's execution, this small, six-segment wheel is your gateway to learning about the universe and the characters of the game, as well as the system that allows you to leave your mark on the galaxy.StorySomething about the setting and character's of this game really pulled me in. Perhaps it's just how fleshed out it all is. Every planet, even insignificant ones, has at least a brief write-up. Conversing with crew members reveals detailed pasts and unique personalities that leave you wishing there were more options on the dialog wheel. The varied alien races have entire histories, both as solitary civilizations, and as members of the galctic community. The universe feels vast, one of few games that manages to make you feel like there is more to the world outside of what you've seen.If you are someone who loves to get drawn into detailed univserses, or are a fan of detailed characters that you actually start to genuinely like - or hate - Mass Effect is the game, and series, for you.

Reviews for the Deaf and Hard of HearingOverall Rating: 9/10Gameplay Rating: 9/10Accessibility Rating: 7/10NotesOverall rating is a combination of the gameplay (mechanics and story) and accessibility (how the game includes deaf/hoh gamers).  If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!General GameplayThe first in a series from BioWare, Mass Effect was designed to be an open, choose-your-own-adventure type game within a relatively loose storyline.You play as a Human Alliance Navy Commander named Shepard.  You're quickly embroiled in a fight to save not only yourself and crew, but humanity and all races in the universe from extinction at the hands of the Reapers.The story for Mass Effect and the effects between games that your decisions have makes playing the whole series on occasion quite enjoyable.  The games can be long, so they can be daunting to try and replay.  Make sure you have time!General AccessibilityAccessibility OptionsMass Effect opens to the main menu, so you can set subtitles before the game begins.  Sound controls let you adjust music, sound effects, and dialogue volumes independently.  For gamers with mobility issues, you can rebind all keys to suit your needs.In gameplay, there are few indicators that you are being shot at or that you were hit.  The bullet animations are fast, and you may miss them until your shield is gone already.  I often did not know I was being shot until my health was critically low, which is the first major visual indicator of damage.  This can make the game frustrating at times.Subtitles & CaptionsPros:- Subtitles are large and easy to read with light blue text and black border.- In conversations, you see who is talking and subtitles at the same time.Cons:- Most subtitles are shown because you trigger them, but some come from nearby people and they are not named, so you may not know who is talking.Chatting/CommunicatingMass Effect is single player; no chatting available or required.---Visit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf "

Teal DeerDevelopers: BioWarePublishers: Electronic ArtsInitial release: May 2008Genre: Action, RPG, Story Heavy#Worth/NotWorth: #SoWorthExposition, Concurrence and SummationMass Effect is the first in an epic trilogy. This is about 9 years too late but maybe there are still people that don't know what this is.An original world from our beloved BioWare that evokes a very real lived in feeling of a modern sci fi space opera. Mass Effect is more RPG than shooter despite it usage of firearms. Class specialization is quite important going anywhere from a soldier, vanguard/adept at biotics (a sort of sci fi magic, manipulation of dark matter) and tech specialist. Weapons training is also very important as the guns are not exactly accurate and if your character is not trained with that weapon it will be almost entirely useless as they are not accurate at all.  You play as either John or Jane Shepard, Commander in the N7 Alliance Navy. Despite what most people think of this character I believe this character to be a nobody. As in, a representative to put yourself inside of.. someone who represents anyone who actually gives a damn. As I believe that the character of Shepard is relatively inconsequential, an almost idealistic version of a real person. To make a timely reference.. a MockingJay. This is a highly narratively driven game, at every conversation you are given the ability to choose your dialogue choices. Unfortunately, broken down it generally resorts into three types of responses. Paragon- the sort of goody two shoes, Renegade- The sort of I don't have time for this person and the exploratory reaches of exposition. My only complaint here is that certain actions grant you either paragon or  renegade points which will unlock further dialogue options in other situations but in order to use them you need to have the pre-requisite amount making playing a sort of gray character almost impossible. The gameplay loop goes something like this. You receive a mission statement from someone main quest or not and you fly there on the galaxy map, explore a bit, land in the mako (a sort of all terrain vehicle with highly questionable physics, though I've never been to another planet so who am I to say) find a base, shoot all the things, have some dialogue, make your paragon or renegade choice, go back to the ship, get mission, fly there on the galaxy map.. you get the picture. I don't mean to sound dismissive but if you try for a lot of the side missions it can indeed get rather tedious. Though some of them are quite expositional. In between missions you are encouraged to speak with your crew; ask them how they are doing and what they thought of the last mission, they might even divulge what they think about the bigger picture. There is room for.. romance. Should the desire strike your fancy though options are limited especially compared to the games there after this one. I should mention at this point that at the time of writing this, this is my third time completing Mass Effect 1. Additionally I have completed Mass Effect 2 five times and Mass Effect 3 three times. I did not intend on having my opinion of those games influence this review however I feel as a human that is likely going to be impossible or if at all even just unintentional. THE GIST Mass Effect is a world that for me personally rivals and triumphs over other Sci Fi worlds such as Star Wars and Star Trek, perhaps that is because of when I was introduced to it or perhaps because it truly is just more interesting. This is the beginning of an epic saga that is easily in the top 3 series of games I have ever played. I'm sure most people either know what this game is already or has played it as many times as I but I wanted to actually write something and sort of.. have my official stamp on it so to speak. The cycle cannot be stopped.Follow my curation for more "

												----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------This is my 3rd favourite game in the trilogy. I've played it only 5 times, but would love, and will replay it again. The best part of this game is, that your choices inpact the 2nd one, some in a small way, some in a big way, all of the matter!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The graphics are from 2007, and are outdated as in 2016-2017, but are more than playable.The gameplay is a bit clunky, but is still alright, you can chose from 6 different classes, which aren't indept as in the other games, but are unique form eachother.The sound is good. Differently not as good as in the 2nd and 3rd game, but is still good.The length of the game is about 25-30 hours on easier, and about 35-40 hours on higher difficulty, it get's even longer, if you do the side-quests, in which they are alot of them!Your choices are matter, they aren't indept as the other games, but are really good here aswell.The AI is alright, a little outdated, but is still good.The voice acting is on par with the other 2, and is amazing!Here you firstly are introduced to the iconic characters, who will stay with you untill the end of 3! They are great!The story is amazingly done, it might get a little boring in the end beggining, and the start of the middle, but after that it's great! The character customization is not that good, but the default characters are the best.Overall, I give this game a 8.8/10 [This is my opinion, and I hope you'll respect it.]If you've read all of the way to here, I thank you for reading it all, it means alot! :DI am not an English speaker, and sorry if I misspelled something, or a sentence didn't make sence.Thanks again for reading it all, and I hope you'll have a great day.But for now...

												Mass Effect 1: The game that started it all.If you read or watch Youtube videos regularly about ""Top 10 Best Gaming Moments in Recent Memory"" or ""Top 10 Best Video Games of Last Generation"" or something along those lines, you've probably seen Mass Effect get pointed out in one of those top 10s very often. After having enough of seeing Mass Effect mentioned on one of the lists, I decided to get Mass Effect and see it for myself. After completing a playthrough as a full out paragon war hero soldier and even imported my character to Mass Effect 2 (Where you can find my review here) and I think Mass Effect was simply outstanding. It had the best overall plot of the three games and had several unforgettable moments, there are quite a few flaws.GraphicsFor the visuals, they took some time to get used to because in some ways it looks like you're watching a TV show in the 80's-90's. However, in time, I was able to get used to the visuals and was highly impressed. For a game from 2007, the visuals are very good. Obviously, they don't compare to Mass Effect 2 and 3's visuals, but I'd prefer not to compare this to the other games. GameplayThe gameplay is probably the weak point of the game. I understand that this game is partially a tactical shooter, but let's be real here: You don't need to use the abilities for each character, the enemies are either easy to kill or too difficult to kill, and the AI is awful. I didn't like the firing at first how it decreases your accuracy, but I got used to it after the first few missions. The gameplay definitely did not age well in the past few years, that's for sure.StoryThe story is the strongest point in the game. Saren plays the role as the main villain very well. I wouldn't say he's top ten worthy, but he's still an amazing character. Too bad it started to get cheesy towards the end. As some people have said, Mass Effect does not actually take off until Virmire, where several of the biggest moments in the trilogy are encountered. The other characters are pretty cool, like the Krogan bounty hunter Wrex (Who is 100x cooler than Grunt in Mass Effect 2) and Liara, an Asari biotic who studies the Protheans, an ancient race who was destroyed by a certain group of people.[masseffect.wikia.com] Overall plot was the best in the series and was just awesome. I don't want to spoil it, so just buy the game!AudioThe voice actors did VERY well when playing their roles. I think the best of the voice actors were either Ali Hillis (Liara) or Brandon Keener (Garrus) but Wrex, Shepard, and Saren's roles stood out, too. The music is awesome and I enjoy hearing it, the only problem I have with the audio is that half of the time all you hear is ""pew pew pew"" coming from the guns or ""Shields down!"" The music should've played some more so I can here my gun going ""pew pew pew"" while I hear epic music playing in the background. When the music didn't play, the mission felt very bland. ReplayabilityThe replayability in this game is just about as strong as the other Mass Effects, but from what I've seen from others, this Mass Effects seems like it is the one that is replayed the most. The story wraps you in to the point you've realized you played the game seven times. VerdictIn the end, Mass Effect is a strong start to an amazing sci fi RPG trilogy. I highly recommend it. I assure you, you will not regret it.Graphics- 8/10Gameplay- 4.5/10Story- 10/10Audio- 9.5/10Replayability-  9/10.:8.2/10:.+Best overall plot+Great villain+Amazing visuals+High replayability+Solid RPG elements-Awful AI-Tedious combat-Music barely plays-Gets really cheesy toward the end			"

												TL;DR: Great game - engrossing storyline, decent combat system, fun exploration, slightly branching storyline. Classic. Buy it.How did it take me so long to find you, Mass Effect? Where have you been my whole life?As you can tell from the above text (and the blue thumbs-up symbol) I rather enjoyed Mass Effect. From the get-go till the end, the in-game fiction is well woven, making this one of the best developed sci-fi universes I've had the pleasure of being involved with. The intricacy of the universe certainly puts series like Star Wars (the movies, at least) to shame. There are lots of distinct alien races with believable cultures and histories (though for the most part they are all humanoid and speak English...). The future technology is well explained with the usual pseudo-science.The story was pretty good. As Shepherd, a man/woman in the Alliance (human) military, you start off investigating a distress call from a remote colony. Things go bad pretty quick, and you discover secrets which threaten the security of the galaxy. The next bit of the game concerns you gaining the trust of the Council (galactic government) in order to become a super-special-ops sort of dude. Then it's time to recruit a team of the best aliens and humans out there and set about saving the galaxy from it's ultimate doom!Gameplay is as a 3rd person, squad-based shooter. The controls are easy to pick up, and allow you to bring up a squad menu which pauses the game and allows you to tell you squad members to use their biotic powers (think the Force from Star Wars but better) or tech abilities, or switch weapons and so on.As a sort of space-RPG, you choose your class in the beginning, which defines what weapons and abilities you can use. You also level up during the progress of the game, allowing you to hone those skills. You can also set it so you can control the levelling-up of your squad members' skills as well. You do tend to pick up a lot of loot, allowing you to get new weapons and armour, upgrade existing ones and so on, depending on your class. Unfortunately, you have only a limited amount of inventory space, and it fills up pretty quick. I kept finding myself having to empty my inventory in the middle of levels.A great feature of this game is exploration, as you get put in command of the experimental Alliance frigate, the Normandy. You can fly her wherever you wish, and land on many planets with the Mako jeep/tank thing. Lots of people hate the Mako for its wayward handling, but I loved it! The only downside is a lot of the optional planets are pretty repetetive/boring.One thing which I liked in this game (compared to the second) is that it is not divided into ""hub areas"" and ""combat areas"". You could be attacked anywhere, even on the Citadel (the galactic capital). You never know whether a mission will be a simple mission where you just have to talk someone down, or whether you will have to fight your way through rooms full of enemies.This brings us to another thing. Choice. People often get sniffy when video games claim to offer choice to the users, saying they follow the same storyline anyway, whatever choice you make. Well, this is mostly true. However, there are several choices you can make in the game which are imported to the second, which can make the game much harder, or very much alter the tone. I enjoyed having the choices personally, as it made me able to at least feel like I was doing things 'my way'.I should go.			"

9.5/10+  This is one of the best single player experiences I have ever had; it is a must play for any RPG or sci-fi fan. It is probably one of the most expansive and interesting sci-fi universes created in the last decade. The story and characters had me fully engaged from beginning to end, and that isn't an easy feat to accomplish for the vast majority of video games. While the second and third games were continual refinements of gameplay, their stories were not nearly as original and refreshing as the first entry.-  The gunplay could be sloppy, the graphics look a little muddy these days, the cookie cutter planets could be repetitive, the elevators were too slow; this game wasn't without flaws. However, this will be one of the only (if not THE only) times where I can say I overlooked every gameplay flaw because the story hooked me so hard.			"

												What happens when you take a RPG, give it a sci-fi setting, make it choice-based, throw in some political themes, add in extremely likable characters, make it a third-person shooter, give it fun gameplay, and then craft an epic narrative out of it? You get Mass Effect. Mass Effect is the Star Wars inspired masterpiece created by Canadian developer Bioware. It was the result of the dev's desire to have full creative liberties over a sci-fi game. They essentially took the engine, mechanics, and structure of KOTOR and made an original game. If you are a fan of sci-fi, you will love this game. If you're a fan of videogames, you will love this game.Pros:Everything said in the introCons:Rendering error in Noveria and IlosResults:  9/10Sci-fi masterpiece			"

												So good that I sat through the black screen credits!!!Everything in this game is put together and presented so well. The tactical 3rd-person combat with a slew of skills to cast made for some damn good fun. Compelling voice-work combined with a great soundtrack and storyline make the non-combat parts of this game very entertaining to sit through. BioWare's signature dialog options are available too, but don't always turn out to be what you expect. I don't know why they don't make the dialog options more clear. Many times Shepard (the protagonist) says something completely extreme to what the dialog option appears to be. Anyway...thats just a minor gripe. Its still fun to be caught off guard by the results of some of the dialog options.Character skill trees allow you to build your team to fit your playstyle. You can choose to invest in mage-like biotic skills, or beef out your weapon proficiency, or dabble in bits of both.I did find myself spending a lot of time in exploration and side-missions. The worlds are littered with bits of information that help in telling the full backstory. Side missions tend to have decent independent stories as well. My only gripe with them is that the maps for the side missions got somewhat repetitive after while. It wasn't too big of a concern since the worlds usually look pretty different form each other.  It took me a while to finally get around to playing this game. As a bonus, it looks pretty great when played with the M.E.U.I.T.M HD mod. I spent about 37 hours in Mass Effect. I definitely recomment playing it.			"

												I played as a Paragon female Shepard for my first playthrough, and that is what I'm using as a basis for this review. My computer is in no way high-end; I played on medium graphics settings and had to mess with the console sometimes to force the characters to render, so I will not be commenting on graphics.THE GOOD--Oh man, the worldbuilding. Multiple worlds built, I should say. I've been yearning for a space opera to poke around in for ages, and am so glad I found this game. Could it have been better? Sure. More populated, more cities with actual cultures to discover, a bit more variety, all would've been welcome. But is it still good/fun/exciting to explore the way it is? Yes, yes it is.The battle system is fun. Granted I played on casual setting because I enjoy being feelthy, but it was seriously a great time to run in and smack the bad guys around with the stock of my shotgun after shooting their HP down to the nubs from behind a turned over rubbish bin.The actual plot is not at all new or unusual for a hard sci-fi, ""alienz and advanced technologiez are great!!!1!"" type of story. It's still engrossing despite the lack of originality and the Big Reveal of the ~overarching theme~ is awesome.THE BAD--This game has really awesome male characters and annoying AF females. Tali is pretty cool, but Ashley cites siccing a dog on a bear ""no matter how much you love the dog"" along with her xenophobia and Liara is a caricature of just. Of just everything. Kaidan is fairly milquetoast as well because when playing as Fem!Shep everything is centred around him trying to get in your pants.You're better off just taking take Garrus and Wrex everywhere, swap out one to Tali as needed. Yes, really. The aliens are great, take them all the time.THE UGLY--THIS IS NOT HOW PEOPLE SPEAK, WHY WOULD YOU STRUCTURE SENTENCES LIKE THAT, WRITERS?? I feel like BioWare needs to have a writer either already trained or sent out specifically to learn some screenplay/theater writing skills because I spent so much time wincing when people began to converse. I actually facepalmed during the romance dialogue with Kaidan. I had to turn off the game for a bit during a Major Confrontation with a Very Important Character because the conclusion was in no way built upon the previous lines of dialogue and that was just so rage inducing.The overarching plot is great, epic even. But it seriously falls down on the job when people open their mouths.TL;DR--Excellent game despite how cringe-worthy the writing is. Play if you want to steep in a Space Opera for a while, but if Compelling Storytelling Via The Interplay Between Characters is your jam, be prepared to groan a lot.			"

												No game is perfect, but Mass Effect is extremely close. The universe, the story, the characters, the voice actors (especially Jennifer Hale as the female Shepard), the gameplay, that combines third-person shooter elements with RPG stuff, and the amount of things you can do in this game is simply mindblowing. The only thing it lacks in my opinion is the freedom of Deus Ex. But even so, you still have a lot of freedom to shape the experience to your own preferences. No doubt one of the best games ever made. And the graphics are actually quite impressive considering the release year.			"

In the year 2148, explorers on Mars discovered the remains of an ancient spacefaring civilization. In the decades that followed, these mysterious artifacts revealed startling new technologies, enabling travel to the furthest stars. The basis for this incredible technology was a force that controlled the very fabric of space and time. They called it the greatest discovery in human history. The civilizations of the galaxy call it... Mass Effect.Codex entries, Mars Rovering and squad-based shootouts: the Mass Effect experience.Relatively massive aRPGs are always a highly subjective experience. There's so many ways to play them that it can be argued that no two people are playing the exact same game. So it's only fair that I just detail how I played Mass Effect, so you can choose, no circle menu needed, how relevant this review is to you.Vanguard class, on Veteran difficulty, completed all the missions (even the garbage collection ones) and explored every planet before taking on the story missions, read all the codex entries, concentrated on using all powers and abilities, and constantly switched out companions.This means that absolutely everything in the following review is so highly subjective that you can append everything with ""playing the way I played it."" So that's exactly what we're going to do, every time something subjective comes up I'm going to mark it with an asterisk (*).""Help me out here, Shepard. The lines between friend and foe are getting a little blurry from where I stand.""- Urdnott Wrex Playing the way I played is dangerous. A Renegade choice, even, chewing through all the optional stuff first. It was obviously not intended to be played in that way and I don't recommend it *.If anything, you really want to pace yourself. As it is, playing my way, you get a flat 60% of the game's worst content upfront, the 60% of garbage filler planet exploration * and exposition, followed by 25% of decent filler content (Hackett's errands, Citadel quests, and a half dozen missions that end in hilariously anticlimactic text prompts), and finally the 15% of excellent story content. So do one story mission, then a third of the planet exploration, and so on. All this takes you through two main forms of gameplay and some fairly hefty conversations.The core firefight gameplay is pretty consistenly good *. You have a lot of tools at your disposal and get incredibly overpowered by the end with double-stacked mods and the best gear that credits can buy *. With Barrier-spamming and a shotgun in hand you're encouraged to run into firefights instead of just toeing it behind cover, which leads to satisfyingly aggressive fights, and your other abilities range from debuffs, to disablers, to squad-wide revival *.All this is supported by some great sound design - meaty gun blasts and hard-hitting shield displacement - and gives you some unique eye-candy to look at while doing it, outside of a few notably awkward armour designs and some very drab interiors in the planet exploration stages *.""We are trained for espionage. We would be legends, but the records are sealed. Glory in battle is not our way. Think of our heroes: the Silent Step, who defeated a nation with a single shot, or the Ever Alert, who kept armies at bay with hidden facts.""- Captain KirraheWhen the music is great, it's great. When it's not, you're listening to the same three lazy space ambient tracks while mountain-climbing your way through the game's endless supply of Steam Greenlight-tier empty barren maps with the Mako *, the game's Mars-Rover-Tank thing.Now the Mako itself controls fine. Even great, I'd say. Pulling off some manoeuvres like jumping over a trio of rockets and returning with one back that just reduces a squad to shreds, before landing with a satisfying clunk, never got old *.But the maps are absolutely awful, outside of the story maps. The Mako works best when you're forced to continually get in and out of it, not just driving to the same two dungeons filled with different assets, struggling with the physics engine to get over mountains and getting bored to sleep treading through endless plains.So that's the bulk of the gameplay *.There's some ""under the hood"" RPG systems ala Deus Ex, which mostly amount to ""equip the thing that makes your points go higher"", but switching armour and weapons does lend some visual variety to the game and there are some endgame ammo types and power-speccing that allow for different playstyles - even within classes *.Now this is a game that is designed for gamepads first and foremost. Use a gamepad if you can. The menus are designed for crab people. The auto-aim and stat-based aiming is so ridiculous it's not like that's a concern. It's completely playable with a keyboard and mouse if you can think like a crab-person for said menus, it's just awkward and the RPG aiming means you can be staring right at an enemy and still miss.A word of warning: Steam's version of Mass Effect is fairly buggy. If anything you're probably better off buying the Origin version, since you get the DLC and a fair few bug fixes, but if you have an inherent aversion to Origin you can still enjoy audio/BGM constantly cutting out and characters having a tenuous connection to the material plane.No asterisk there, note that.""We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it, and you will end because we demand it.""- SovereignThe widely lauded story is fairly good, if very Bioware tropey, but the majority of the dialogue and flavour text is based around exposition around various worldbuilding elements. Even at the most dramatic moments, Mass Effect has no problem dropping its in-universe jargon to enforce how consistent it's world is. This isn't a bad thing, but people who like reading codex entries and discovering how a new world works are probably going to get more out of the story out of people looking for a standard RPG or action plot *.Characters have their own driving motivations and backstories, and even the most alien races are driven by fear, anger or plain boredom, and unless you're completely averse to conversations, at no point does it feel like a slog getting through them.Shame that they're underwritten *. As a rule of thumb, you'll get about three conversations out of a squad member, and one conversation out of a regular NPC. Most of them trigger just after a few travel screens, but a few trigger after story missions - this means that for half the game, half your squad will just repeat itself, and vice-versa for the other half*.For some inane reason, most of the inter-squad conversations are reserved for the elevator transitions, elevators that you will absolutely want to skip at every possible moment *. Ignore that asterisk, everyone should skip the elevators. They're awful. Use the rapid transit system when you can.""Goodbye, Shepard. Thank you.""- SarenMass Effect is a good game that's held back by filler content that doesn't use the core gameplay as much as it should. That and really bad, bland maps for most of that filler *.Is it worth playing? Absolutely. Mass Effect is a one-of-a-kind space opera RPG. Nothing else quite like it out there.And you don't need an asterisk on that.			"

												Straight to the point:1) You spend 1/3 of the game riding the elevators. Square-shaped, round-shaped, vertical, with some angle, fast, slow, EVERY KIND OF! I wanna thank the developers for so impressive variety! It didn't even annoy me when I'd finished reading the 2nd Shakespeare's book during elevators rides. Really impressive and not boring part of the game!2) Even your vehicle can jump, but not the main hero. Sometimes you can accidently mistake by leaving your vehicle on a rocky surface and not being able to return to it because you can't jump. But it's not the time to get upset! Bioware envisaged the situations when you can't get back to your vehicle which is 5 meters from you. All you have to do is return to your spaceship on the orbit and then go back. Hard to think of a greater idea. Bioware definitely nailed it!3) The exploring of the planets makes you to feel physical pain. Don't be surprised with finding your fist at the other side of your monitor when you'll explore the exact same building or underground complex like you did 20 times before. Actually they vary, you just have to notice it. Look at the crates inside the rooms. They have the different order! That's enough, right, Bioware? Oh and the People's Choice Award goes straight to that sattelite model. It's used for everything! You can find it on every planet. Sattelites, beacons, nukes and ♥♥♥♥ing tons of other purposes! I won't be surprise if this sattelite is able to cure the cancer or it killed John Kennedy.But seriously though, this game worth playing. kthxbye "

												If you ever wanted to explore the galaxy, or if you like sci-fi, or you are a sucker for space operas, you can pick this game up right away. You are Commander Shepard, and your Shepard can be a grizzled veteran marine, a tech savvy scoundrel, or a biotic powerhouse. He/she can also be something in between any of these classes. This game is all about the choices you make, and those choices will affect your environment, other characters relationships with you, how cheap or expensive new weapons will be at stores etc.The exploration mechanic of the game is based on star clusters and star systems. As you travel the galaxy and solve missions, new clusters of stars will appear on the map, giving you more chances to explore. Indeed, the crux of the game is exploration and the game does this part very well. As you explore, you will also gain bits and pieces of information which form the lore of the Mass Effect universe.And now about this game's shortcomings. Fortunately, there aren't many, and they are nothing immediately off-puting. The combat and gunplay feel a bit sluggish at times, and the exploration can get tedious at times. Planetary maps are not that large, but they feel empty expect for a camp here and there, or an anomaly.All things considered, I highly recommend this game to anyone.			"

												Mass Effect changed how I look on games as media, before I liked games but I was almost never really invested in the stories they told, that all changed when I played this game. Mass Effect is a classic game that everyone should at least play once in their lifetime, the story is so well told and written it will keep you invested the whole way, the characters you meet and get to know are some of the best characters I have ever seen in a game. But this game is not only awesome because of the good story and well written characters but also because the world they made for this game is simply one of the best universes in not only games but in all of fiction. Both the aliens and the humans in this game feel real and convincing.I’m a big sci fi nerd and I have always been fascinated by how they portray the human race, in most sci fi that is a huge hit or miss, example of this is how humans are in star trek (love star trek) they are simply too nice they don’t feel like the more grey humanity we know. In mass effect they made a human race that seems like a logical step from how we think and act today, no perfect goodwillers ( like star trek), not some evil war empire( like in 40k) but somewhere in between(maybe a bit more to the 40k on the scale then star trek, kind of on the same place as babylon 5 grey humans not black or white). The universe they made feels alive and almost real something most fiction fail at.The gameplay is maybe weak in some areas like the mako but it doesn't really matter because what you get out of this game is simply more than just gameplay (gameplay is good in most parts) you get a good story. Should you buy this game? I think so because I think if you don’t you will miss out on one of the best modern games ever made, you will also miss the start of a saga that only got better in mass effect 2. This Game changed my whole view on games and it has stuck with me after all this years and I think that is a testament to how much of an impact this game had on me.Story 10/10Music 9/10Atmosphere 10/10Gameplay 8/10Replayability 9/10Final Score a solid 9/10 because no game or media is perfect.PS: sorry for any bad English I have always been bad at typing and spelling even in my own language, also if you wonder why my playtime is so low its because i played the games on the xbox back in the day, think I finished mass effect 1 7 or 8 times. Was planning to play through all the games on pc but i haven’t gotten around to doing it yet. "

												Personal Rating: Very satisfied, some minor gameplay annoyancesClassic Rating: ★★★★☆ME is a pretty solid game with an excellent plot and characters, good soundtrack, entertaining gameplay.Some things could be done better, though:✘ Camera can be annoying while fighting and running, it behaves erratically.✘ Getting to cover is somehow ""bugged"": sometimes you want to cover and Shepard doesn't care, sometimes you're just passing near a wall and Shepard gets to cover on his own. Moreover, you can't lean while in cover behind some walls and therefore you can't fire.✘ Mako: weird controls - slightly press a direction arrow, Mako turns by 30 degrees; problem is, there's plenty of quests using it.I encountered 1 bug on the Citadel and on Zhu's Hope Colony: after completing a couple of quest, I could not move anymore, I did lose both mouse and keyboard inputs ingame - had to close game's window and reload. It fixed itself by saving before reading the quest log in my Diary.""Impressed"": I played ME and ME2 so far, hope to get my hands on ME3 soon.			"

												this game...it blows my mind. i nearly 100%'d the trilogy within a two week time period, spending an average of 40-50 hours per game. i skipped some side missions because i was OBSESSED with the story, so one could easily get more game time than that out of them. i did go back and 100% this one and clocked in around 60-ish. this one is my favorite :) (but ME3 is a better game). ME is a lot like other bioware RPGs, notably KOTOR and dragon age. anyway, it gives this surreal illusion of the vastness of space but you never even leave the galaxy, you ride in YOUR SPACESHIP to other star clusters via mass relays, which basically zoop you off at FTL speeds. cool thing: your character/decisions you make in this game carry over to the second one (and then both to the third). so there's some replay value in story changes due to who you keep in your squad, who you kill/let live, results/decisions from missions, etc. 10/10, will play again (and again).

Short preview: (+) Enough good story. ✅  (+) Long game-time length. ✅ It was 61 hours for me, with side-quests, “assignments”,.  (+) Customizable dialogue. ✅ Click here to see it!   (-) It doesn’t run on Windows 7 – 64 bit, even with changed compatible mods. ✗ It’s fixable with an official patch, click here![masseffect.bioware.com] (-) Sometimes the body and face animations lags at the end of sentence. ✗  (-) There’s not enough action, shooting. ✗  Crashes / Bugs / Glitches:After I had updated it to v.1.2, and was able to run, I had a weird glitch, which was that the keyboard rarely refused to work in the game. I had to use ALT+TAB+Delete and restart the game. Without keyboard, I couldn’t save it before the had the process stopped. :(  My personal opinion:Unfortunately, this game has many minor flaws. Rarely / sometimes the voice acting didn’t match to the correct character behaviour. For example; I was in a calm conversation and the other character was in trouble, and I would have liked to offer my help ‘Can I help you?’, but Shepard said, ’What do you want?’, in a rather rude way. :(  The 40% of the game-play was a talking simulator (with all side quests) for me. I found myself in a good action at the beginning, and when we docked in the Citadel, I had talked and walked place to place for 9 hours, in that same giant spaceship the Citadel! Fortunately, they were not too long, but a lot of! When I began to bore it, fortunately, I managed to start the second main mission and left the Citadel.  The side quests rather repetitive, go to planet to planet, kill them, bring that, talk with them.  BUT! ALL AFTER THESE! The story blew up and gave me a desperate interesting! The last 30% of the game was absolutely cool and interesting for me! And I knew then, that the sort of boring 70% of game-play was needed. To get to know the other civilisations, species, their life and habits. They all needed for the complete feeling! At the end of the game, I was rally happy that I’ve bough this game and finished it. ✅  Recommendation:Despite the many minor flaws, I was happy to get to know this story/game. I can recommend it to them who;  Like Sci-fi stories.  Like to talk with non human species.  Like to behave as you are. (Or at least similar what you are.)  Like to discover other planets. (Sort of open world)  Future atmosphere.  Like or bear to do repetitive side-quests.  Achievement hunting:There’s no Steam achievements, but there’s in-game achievements. So, your Average-Steam-Achievement-Rate won’t increase or decrease with this game. It was a good news for me. ✅			"

												Mass Effect games are always fun to talk about, never sure if I love or hate them more.The 1st game in the series undoubtedly plays most like an RPG of the 3 games, though even then, it would stand as a rather odd RPG when compared to others. For those that have played BioWare's best work: Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic, you'll notice some similar sub-stories, characters, and styles. I mention this only because the influence is strongest in the 1st game, when the series hasn't really defined itself completely.Anyways, it stands as the black sheep of the trilogy for its odd mix of RPG and 3rd person shooter mechanics. It does, however, possess strengths the others lack. The Lovecraftian horror influence is pretty clear in some of the side quests that take you to remote planets -- the fear of the unknown, the ominous music all play into this. The vehicular sections on the remote planets are a bit clunky, but they do a good job of establishing mystery -- you don't know quite what you're going to find. This works well in both reinforcing the trilogy's whole narrative and the general style the narrative embodies: the unknown, powerful threat, the dirty/dark sci-fi.Of course, one has to forgive the incessantly repeated interiors and textures for the side quests, this game lacks polish. If one can get past it, one will find a series of stories that help add to and fill in Mass Effect's universe, even setting things up for the sequels well.If one does everything, the game will take roughly 45-50 hours. If one moves through the narrative alone, you can complete it in 10-15 hours. The main story narrative has the strongest KOTOR infuence. KOTOR was a campaign across a series of planets, not an entire galaxy. Mass Effect too, is composed of fairly long missions on a small handful of planets -- each a sort of individual story that connects to the larger narrative. Or there's the fact that in both KOTOR and ME1, the player follows the antagonist, or rather retraces their steps, to discover their motivations and goals, across different planets. This is contrasted, then, with Mass Effect 2 and 3, where the meat of the games is composed of much more compact and exposition heavy missions with a lot of tight, polished shooting across many locations.The shooting mechanics seem to, in principle, be based on what many call a Gears of War or GTAIV cover based system. Player pops in and out of cover. However, it's pretty clunky, the player doesn't stick too well to cover and cannot navigate it very well. Add in the fact that weapons, armor, and upgrades are doled out in a traditional RPG manner, with damage stats being compared, unique drops, the skill point based system of character leveling. and a huge inventory to sort through, and one will begin to notice that things seem out of place.  It is not so much that these elements are bad in and of themselves, but more that they don't belong together. As if the developers were unsure of what kind of game they wanted Mass Effect to be.After several replays, I've come to realize that they don't do a very good job of leading up to what is supposed to be the central twist of the narrative, the big reveal about the focus of the whole trilogy, the thing to make the games all connect. Avoiding spoilers, I mean the event with the 'virtual intelligence' on Virmire late in the game. Anyone replaying will notice that the game will go so far as to basically tell, through other characters, the player directly what the narrative reveals later in a manner obviously meant to be climactic. It is again, odd, unpolished, and atypical of BioWare, much like the entirety of the game.**SPOILERS AHEAD**Besides feeling out of place and sometimes unpolished, the game has a lot of content, has mechanics that work even if feeling awkward, and manages to present an engaging narrative -- I still get rather excited when Joker commands the fleet upon Sovereign in one of the final scenes. Mass Effect's cinematic presentation is fantastic and never fails to make me feel invested in the story. (If, again, one can forgive some of the cliches like checking the body of the villain to make sure he's dead only to discover him alive or thinking the hero is dead only to have him reemerge triumphantly. I think it is possible to view these little storytelling sins sympathetically, cute little mistakes of young Mass Effect)I spent around 150 hours (100 on my Steam copy) on this game over several playthroughs. As I said at the beginning, I have a lot of issues with the series and it definitely isn't perfect. I can't deny though, that they do some things so well, and are so unique that they are games we can conclude are worth playing, worth discussing, worth evaluating.Despite the game's flaws, odd qualities, and weird inability to define itself, I have to recommend it for all it does well, for starting a great trilogy and for leading into the best game of the series: Mass Effect 2.

												Mass Effect, or as I like to call it, Extreme Drag Racing, is a game that you must play at some point in your video game career. Not because it's famous, or because it defines the sci-fi RPG genre. No; you must play this game because it has heart. It's captivating beyond anything you can fathom. I applaud all the developers who created this game, because they knew what they were doing. Does the game have flaws? Of course! What game doesn't? Have you played Fallout 4? So any excuse of, ""Oh, this game is too old"" or ""Oh, this game has bad graphics"" or even ""Oh, there are already 3 sequels to this game (almost)"" is...well inexcusable. So please, if you consider yourself a gamer of any level, or any genre, this game is one that you must add to your library of experiences. Trust me, it'll be worth it. Shepard out.			"

												Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.First of all, this is an RPG with shooter elements. Some people are playing it backward trying to make it a shooter with RPG elements. If you run and gun through this ala Gears of War, you're going to die a lot and the game will be a disappointment to you because you have the wrong preconception of what this game is about.The gameplay is fantastic, duck n cover, strategy orientated. While it does use real-time targeting, which is where your FPS skills will come into play but takes a level of strategy by pausing the action, sending out commands to teammates, and figuring out the next best tactical step.Overall: I cannot recommend this game enough to RPG fans. If you're a shooter fan and don't have an RPG background, you will be disappointed unless you stick with it and learn how the system works.			"

The most intriguing, thought-provoking, unique universe that exists in a video game. The most interesting and real characters you'll ever come across in a video game. You'll feel as if you know these characters personally. You'll be attached to them and by the third game, it'll hit you where it matters most.It's amazing what Bioware created and it's the only video game where your decisions will carry over for an entire trilogy.  It's quite possible that nothing like this will ever be recreated and that's perfectly okay. This particular game and the two sequels are going to be thought as of something incredibly special and it's a real shame some people won't  ever experience it.Unfortunately, the first game isn't very welcoming with it's endearing looks and gameplay. Despite this, I urge you to just push through because the story itself will get you hooked. The second and third game becomes much more accessible and in my opinion, much more fun.  Each game is extremely memorable and has so many incredible moments backed by an amazing soundtrack. From synthesizers to heart drenching piano music, the score will never leave you with a dull moment and it accompanies the characters emotions to near perfection.I highly recommend this game and the entire trilogy to anyone that wants to experience something truly special.

												Mass Effect is a Sci-Fi Third-Person Shooter/RPG. The game is set a few hundred years into the future, where humanity has discovered FTL travel and other intelligent life. You play as Commander Shepard. AI called the Geth have been attacking human colonies across the galaxy, and it's up to you to stop them. Along the way you will travel to numerous planets, meeting and helping many different species. As you go along, you unravel the mystery of why the Geth have been attacking humans. The story is absolutely amazing. One of the last few good games developed by BioWare. You make a ton of choices throughout the game, which impact both the ending, and the sequels to the game. The combat is great too. A challenging tactical third-person shooter. Each battle requires you to plan ahead, otherwise you will be overpowered very quickly. If you are playing on harder difficulties, one wrong move could mean the end of the battle. This makes for some really tense situations. There is an inventory system which allows you to customise you and your squad's armour and weapons. Plus add modifications to them. The interface for this can be annoying, especially when you have a ton of gear. But it's not too bad, and having the ability to upgrade weapons and armour is a great addition to the game. Overall, Mass Effect is an amazing Western RPG/TPS. One of my favourite games of all time. I would recommend this to anyone.			"

												A game I had over looked until I first saw the ME2 trailer. Thought I should look into the first game. Picked it up during  Steam sale and haven't looked back. ME series has become my favorite game series to date.Now ME does show it's age. Still decent looking but I do recommend the MEUITM mod for HD textures for all the characters. It does make a world of difference in how it looks.  Excellent story. A very large selection of weapons, armor and mods for both to tweak.Combat, it's not horrible but it's not great either. It will get you thru the game. It is much better come ME2 and ME3.Only two DLC for this and Bring Down the Sky is worth installing. Pinnicle Station is umm ok. It is not needed except by those who want to play it as it adds nothing to the series. BDtS does add something to ME3 depending on choices you pick.Again great game that sets up the rest of the series nicely.			"

Great squad combat.The graphics may be slightly dated but it still looks fine running through my 1080p TV.The only criticism I have is that the 'loot box' unlock mini game is frustrating. Not hard, just frustrating. It is also pointless as after three or four quick reloads you can get through. Might as well not be there.But that in no way detracts from the total awesomeness of the game. I have had no problems running it on Win 7.  If you are into sci-fi or action RPG's you owe it to yourself to pick it up next time it pops up in a Sale.			"

												My first 'real' RPG and my introduction to the trilogy as a whole. Mass Effect 1 is an excellent game that's aged pretty well, though there are still some hiccups here and there.Pros:-An immersive story where most choices have long-standing consequences. These range from fairly obvious galactic-scale choices to something as seemingly inconsequential as chatting with a particular NPC. While not all of these are terribly important, it really gives a sense of connectivity between games. People don't just forget how you treated them in the past.-The planetary exploration system. While it's unfortunately coupled with the horrible Mako controls (talked about in more detail below), this is one often-derided part of the game that I actually enjoyed. By having a planet in nearly every system that you can get down and explore (rather than just scanning from your ship, as in later games) makes the galaxy seem that much more massive.-The universe itself. Like most Bioware RPGs, the universe of the game is incredibly fleshed out. You'll discover hundreds of 'codex entries', which are little articles which describe how things work in-universe. Everything from spaceship design, to FTL travel, to how certain aliens function is covered at some point or another. This is all optional, of course- you don't *have* to know any of it to play the game, but it really enhances the experience when you can see how much thought went into creating this world.Cons:-The inventory system is... not great. I've seen worse, even in AAA titles, but this one is pretty bad. Your inventory will quickly become cluttered with mostly useless junk, with only a few things worth keeping. This does a good job of fleshing out the world somewhat (most things have a small description or at least a logo, making the galaxy feel bigger), but at the cost of convenience. You practically have to micromanage your squadmate's armor and guns for the first half of the game or so. Once you get access to the really good stuff, everything else becomes pretty much obsolete. Credits become kind of superfulous at the end of the game as well- I maxed out my bank on my first run without even really trying.-The dreaded Mako. It's essentially an armored vehicle for planetary exploration. Sounds great, right? The problem is that the handling is utterly atrocious. The thing lumbers around like a drunken rhinocerous, until it gets stuck on a rock outcropping and flies halfway across the map. It's all right to drive on a flat surface, but most planets are at least somewhat mountainous. There are even a few that are almost nothing but hills. Once again, this adds character to the planets at the expense of gameplay. Everything else:-The combat's nothing special. Not bad, mind you, but it doesn't do a whole lot that's really unique. Third-person shooting from behind chest-high walls with some different powers to liven things up. These range from hacking robotic enemies or weapons to 'biotic' powers which are essentially Force moves. The AI for enemies can get a bit stupid at times with characters running straight into your ambushes. -The graphics are good. A lot of the planetary environments are still beautiful, but some of the characters can get off-model mid-cutscene which makes things pretty jarring. Overall, I'd rate this a solid 9/10. Good combat, if nothing new, coupled with a wonderfully rich environment, engaging characters, and long-lasting consequences that will follow you through the trilogy.			"

												One of my new personal favorite series.I played the Mass Effect triology not expecting too much. This game takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions. You fall in love with the characters around you and really feel like you are fighting for a true cause. I loved this game so much, it's now higher than the Bioshock series (which was my all time favorite). I've never cried so much when a character left or I made the wrong choice. Mass Effect 3's ending absolutely destroyed me. I completed it only a day ago and I still feel really depressed over it. In general though, this game is an extraordinary masterpiece. The character development, the choices, the gameplay and the story are just so amazing. I loved every minute of this game franchise and I recommend this to everyone. I really felt like I was Commander Shepard. I felt like I was making a difference. I felt like I was saving the world. I really felt like everything I did, everywhere I went, that people, no the WORLD was depending on me and the choices I made. I've never felt so much for a video game in a long time. 10/10 Broke my heart, made me fall in love and made me happy when I made the right choices.Thank you Bioware. Another absolutely amazing series from you.""I'll always love you Garrus""			"

												I first started playing Mass Effect 3, then Mass Effect 2 and now finally, the first Mass Effect. Then I turned it around and played ME1,2,3 in the correct order.Seven years after it's release, it's still one of the better games. The graphics are a little outdated, but nothing disturbing. The combat mechanics and the use of biotics have been better implemented in this game than in ME2 and ME3. Too bad they didn't stick with this combat UI. Also the way that weapon upgrades work is much more extensive then with it successor games.Mass Effect one has the strongest storyline of the three games, but as a result, lacks a bit of character development. You don't get to know the characters as well as in ME2 with the loyalty missions. The dialogue is strongest in ME3.This game is easy to get by for a few bucks during sales and is definitely worth it.			"

												Well, what can I say? Mass Effect is one of the best RPG's ever made. Many missions to do, meet a lot of aliens, kick a lot of ♥♥♥, use awesome weapons and have a romance on the side. Brilliant.One down side about this one (and the rest of the series), is no controller support. You can get a mod for it though, but, thats not the point. EA should have done better on that. Also, the mechanics of the game aren't the smoothest. Combat can be rather difficult to get used to. But, this was improved later on in the series. Overall, a great game that will always be remembered.			"

												Mass Effect is my favorite series I have ever played. You can really understand and learn about the characters in the game as you play it. It is an older game now sure, but even in 2016 it doesn't look bad at all. There are also mods to help revamp the graphics and lighting that are easy to get set up right for you. This game has pretty okay replayablity as well. Different classes with very different abilites, different choices to make throught the game. Play through at least two times to get Paragon (good cop) and Renegade (bad cop) options, and you can hit most of the dialouges this way as well. It has amazing soundtracks, voice acting, unique character races, lots of lore and story, all around a really great experiance. You can play this game and not the second or third, and still be able to have fun with the story. Though when I played this game years ago, I just had to play the second and third. To this day, to be able to sit down, play Mass Effect, import my character and thier decisions to Mass Effect 2, and import again to Mass Effect 3, and have nearly 150-200 hours put into this one character, is special. It isn't a new character the next game, it is my character. It is everything I want them to be, and the same goes to all the other characters that went with me along the way. It is making your own story with you and your team. Making relationships, friendships, working through hardships, all done together. I absolutely recommend this game, and the entire series. Roleplay, storytelling, engaging characters and enviornment, everything makes it special. 10/10 experiance with my time with it all			"

												Maybe the best sci-fi RPG (up there with KoTOR) and one of the best story-based computer games. The main story, written by Karpyshyn et al, shines accompanied by a wealth of developed support characters with their own backgrounds and stories. Pros:+ amazing main story+ choices DO MATTER at personal and global level+ a very large number of support characters each with corresponding stories+ variety in weapons, characteristics, skills etc+ optimal duration, not too short but also it does not drag forever+ music and sound effects+ some really awesome moments especially near the endCons:- graphics show their age - environments of side missions are repeated (especially the bases), making some quests rather boring- some occasional crashes All-in-all: A must-have game!

												The game that turned me into a fandom nerd.  Although this, the first installment of the excellent Mass Effect trilogy, can be a little slow to get going, it's not so much about the action but the universe and its occupants; really well realised characters in a fleshed out world.  It really is the characters and 'lore' that makes this game.  Just as well, as much time is spent conversing with these characters, discovering ancient secrets of the galaxy, in a well told story of galactic anihilation.  And luuuurve...			"

												Mass Effect is brilliant. It has that incredible ""feel"" that I constantly look for in games.The combat is often turned down by many players as they find it difficult to deal with and boring, but I think that it's a nice addition to this game's originality! It's a lot different than combat in most games, but that doesn't make it bad -  at all -  for me.The music. Oh man, the music. Whenever I hear for example ""Vigil"", ""Vampire Ride"", ""Liara's World"", past the halfway of ""Uplink"" or any Citadel song, I feel great. The amazing music is a major part of ME's memorable atmosphere, though not the only one.The galaxy is huge! There are several systems and beneath those star clusters to explore. On the planets' surface, you drive the 100% badass Mako. The vehicle has got positive and negative feeback - I don't quite understand how anyone could diss that beast!Lots of characters from several different interesting species. I love every single one! In fact, at first I was totally annoyed and frustrated by the small ball-y Volus, but now I always grin at them! They're so silly!I grew to really care about and like the squad mates. The alien ones, at least - they're the most interesting! There is a tough guy from the Krogan species - they always remind me of toads for some reason.  In the summer, there are some toads and frogs in my pond out in the yard - I should name one of them Wrex! Gotta love him!Definitely one of the very best games I've ever played. The spacey sci-fi world is marvelous. The only space game that I would consider even better is Star Control II, a classic from -92. But ME is a certain number two!And there are two MORE of these games! How much better can this enjoyment get?			"

It's not so much a game as it is a wonderfully told story.The story is great, the gameplay is intuitive and creative, and very infrequently dissociates the player from the game.

												Unlike most people, i think Mass Effect is the best series among Mass Effect Trilogy. From rich story, have solid RPG system, great world creation just like from 70's to 80's sci-fi and i enjoy every second of playing Mass Effect.I can't deny the fact that the gameplay is confusing for new player, lazy PC port and few minors problem. But, those problem can be resolved easily.I proudly can say that Mass Effect is one of the game of all time made by Bioware (other than SW:KOTOR and DA:O) that i beat this game 5 times (Don't mind my gameplay hours recorded on steam)If you're big fans of this trilogy series, you should buy/see :- ""The Art of Mass Effect Universe""- ""Mass Effect Library Edition Volume 1"" and ""Mass Effect Library Edition Volume 2""- ""Mass Effect: Revelation"", ""Mass Effect: Ascension"" and ""Mass Effect: Retribution""100/100, would play it again and again.

												Mass Effect is quite possibly the most amazing game ever written for a video game, recalling many of the best elements from some of the greatest works of the sci-fi genre and putting you in an almost ""Oblivion""-like level of control over the world. You could spend dozens of hours simply exploring unknown worlds and building your fortune that way while shirking the main story altogether if you choose. But if you don't have all the time in the universe to enjoy this one, the main story is not too long. In fact, I honestly wish it were much longer, but that was the sacrifice made for the open-ended freedom of exploration the player is given. One will most likely spend upwards of 50 hours just exploring the galaxies and discovering all of the tiny stories within the story that really flesh this universe out. Plus, there are many different ways to play the game which will command you to replay it over again just to see all of the what-if's and enjoy mastering all of the various class sort.			"

												That's the one game which presents the new era of the games where story has became importest part of games, since Half-Life 2's success. In some cases it's evolution (story, enviroment, graphics, level-design, characters, quests) of SW: KoTOR with it own plot and universe, but in level-up system and battles it's devolution. Back in mid 2000's it was popular to add vehicles to the games, but if you're going to play Mass Effect I'd recommend to you finish the side quests and main story first and then try land missions and DLCs when you'll play with another backstory/class/gender etc. Otherwise, land missions can just make you rage on that game with the same type of buildings what you visit, same missions, high mountaint and Mako's driving controls. If you play on Normal and you think that the game is ez pz, the end battle will change your mind and test what you learnt with that fight system.P.S. Also, about DLCs. First DLC you can obtain for free from Origin site, but the other one is illegal to be installed with Steam-version. Anyway, you know what to do... :)			"

												The first Mass Effect is one of the games that make me want a third, neutral recommendation option here on Steam. On one hand, I love this game, I've finished it 3-4 times - recently here on Steam (in preparation for Andromeda) and a few times using the boxed version and while I enjoy the game a lot now, I remember my first time playing it and I also remember dropping the game after an hour or two, simply because it didn't appeal to me at the time. I came back after I finished playing ME 2 (which I loved the moment I started playing), because I wanted to fill in some leftover plot holes, made by skipping the first game. I'm glad I did it that way, if I forced myself to play ME1 first, I might've really hated the game and it would make me skip out the whole series as I would assume the games are all ""bad"" or they don't appeal to me, because let's face it - ME 1 has many flaws.Let's list some cons:The first thing you'll notice - only low resolution options and no borderless support (and I didn't find a way to enable it even with usage of external programs), also the graphics are rather mediocre for 2007 (use 1st Bioshock for comparison).Most interiors are copy&pasted, recycled content - get ready to go through the same exact building 20 timesExteriors are not exactly original either, seems like they used some sort of random gen script for most planets, then altered the textures, placed that one building I mentioned above, put one of 3 types of enemies inside, scattered like 2-3 other ""events"" across the map (usually mining or a container with items) and now and then they added a ""quest"" which involves Admiral Heckett contacting you after you fly to a new location, saying something generic like ""hurr durr there's a bunch of scientists needing your help, we rely on you, Shepard""Combat is very clunky - I hope they fired whoever came up with the idea of snipers that instakill you and hit you every time. Krogans and some Geth that run at you no matter what are not very fun either.Combat on higher difficulties is difficult not because the enemies would get smarter, it's because of the mechanics above. You still get one-shot, just more often.Enemy variety - 80% of the time you fight the Geth, 10% Humans, the rest is split among the other races (mostly Rachni, Batarians, Krogans...)Class and quest/kill reward balancing is awfulApparently the same balancing team did class balancing, as some classes are obviously a lot stronger than others.Bugs (and I don't mean the big bugs - Rachni, I mean actual bugs), getting stuck is not that uncommon. Sometimes you're not even sure what's a bug and what's a feature. For example - there's a quest on citadel that makes you go find 21 NPCs that are scattered around the city. Not only the place is huge, it's also really confusing as the map is pretty much useless. 'Till this day I still don't know where the 21st NPC is (or if the quest bugged for me). I'll never know what the quest reward is (probably something worthless, like 500 credits)The voice acting is 50/50 either great or terrible. The female Shepard voice actress is awesome, while the male actor sounds very stiff and boring.Why even play the game with all those flaws you ask?Well, the story is amazing. Not the exploration side quests - let's not talk about those. But the actual main story is great, all the backstory on every race and every individual makes you really interested in what happened and what happens next. While I think that Bioware is a rather ""lazy"" studio when it comes to game development (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age 2), I'd say that their storywriters are among the best in the industry. Also most importantly - this game is the prequel to the actual Mass Effect game - Mass Effect 2. Mostly everything that was wrong with ME1 is fixed in ME2 and while they are both very good games, ME2 is way more ""new-gen-player"" friendly, easier, more modern and fun to play. So that is my recommendation - play through ME2 first and if you enjoy the game, you'll be eager to play ME1 as well and if you don't enjoy its gameplay, you'll at least enjoy the story, that's for sure. I think the flaws of ME1 that some of us overlooked back in 2007 didn't age well, nowadays we seek more refined games - like ME2. However, the story is just as good as it used to be, so it's definitely worth a playthrough. "

												This game really did it for me. While not flawless the gameplay experience it gave me was among the best I have yet to encounter in my gaming 'career'. Apart from my first playthrough of Final Fantasy 7 and, of course, Mass Effect 2 nothing comes to my mind that holds up in comparison.The premise does not seem that extraordinary at first glance. You play as Commander Shepard (either male or female, your choice) and basically you are going to prevent the annihilation of every major civilisation in the galaxy. Pretty standard so far. But the world building in this game is so complex, so detailled it blew me away.Every now and then you get entries in your Codex where you can read about the many spacefaring races, some important historic events or the different technologies you are utilizing in the game. I loved how they put that much effort into something many gamers won't even bother to read because it is not important at all if you just want to progress the story.What really makes the game come to life is its host of memorable characters. There are innumerable people you encounter, many of which can be spoken with, often offering multiple dialogue-tree options. Some of those will join your team and become your companions. Since I engaged all of my companions in conversations regularly between missions I started to really care about them. They are fully fleshed out personalities, each with his own motivations and wishes.The main villains, the Reapers, are mostly only hinted at. But you never forget them and their looming presence in the background gives the story a dire urgency. The Reapers' henchmen you are battling are nothing grand but they serve their purpose well.The gameplay combines elements of roleplaying, shooter and exploration games and the result gave me great joy. There were some rather unpleasant moments while traversing the surface of the more mountainous planets but thankfully there weren't that many of them. The majority of the game is spent either engaging NPCs in conversations or shooting at  enemies. Both aspects are done very well, although the shooter portion got a tiny bit repetitive at the end. But since I did every available sidequest and played almost nonstop for several days until I was done that might be my own fault.The skillsystem is solid and you get tons of loot to equip your characters with.There are several occasions when you have to make a decision that will have repercussions in the later games. Some are more personal and affect if a specific character will survive to come back in the sequels. Some have a galactic impact. In one case you decide between exterminating an entire race or giving them another chance. All of these moments came back to me vividly while playing Mass Effect 2 and being confronted with the consequences of my own actions.			"

												Mass Effect shows it's age in many respects, but holds up surprisingly well - after all, it is almost time for it's ten year anniersary! Despite a somewhat annoying combat system, excruciatingly slow run speed, my mistake in picking Infiltrator when the almost all confrontations were face-to-face, et al et al... There's something special here. Potential. Despite not being the apple of my eye ME1 serves as a great introduction to a series I'm beyond happy to start playing my way through.and I'm really only writing this because im waiting for that me2 download			"

												First of all, this game is nearly 8 years old (as of now). In newer machines it’ll require some tweaking to acquire the best results. Some things are unavoidable though, for instance, the max resolution is 720p, but other issues can be improved. In my experience the “motion blur” setting didn’t work out well: Shepard was always “shaking”. Other issue was the V-sync setting: no matter what I did, it simply wouldn’t work, the game was always at 62~63 fps and I would see screen-tearing literally all the time. Luckily there’s an easy solution for this: I simply activated triple-buffering in the GPU settings, overriding the game settings (then I activated V-sync in the game settings and restarted it: problem solved). Another issue was the Steam Overlay: in order for it to work with the game, I needed to open Steam as an administrator (Win 8.1).Now that the technical issues are taken care of, let’s see the pros and cons:Pros:•	Massive game: at least 30 hours of gameplay are guaranteed.•	Over the top replayability value: you can play as Renegade, Paragon or any mixture of both. Your choices will affect not only the story of ME 1, but also the subsequent titles of the franchise.•	The game is funny. Although Shepard appears to be serious, there’s a subtle humor to many of his lines/actions.•	Outstanding voice-work: Seth Green (Joker), Keith David (Captain Anderson), and Mark Meer (Shepard) are incredible. Overall, the whole cast is consistent.•	You can punch a NPC for no apparent reason.•	Engaging story and interesting characters/classes/settings: Reapers, Protheans, Quarians, Krogans, Keepers, Turians, Volus, The Citadel, The Council, Mass Relays, etc… there’s a whole new sci-fi mythology to be found.•	Great graphics for 2008: even though the graphics might seem outdated nowadays, they were really impressive back in 2008.•	You’ll get to drive the best off-road vehicle ever: the Mako.Cons:•	You can’t romance everyone.•	You’ll get lost in Ilos, no matter what you do.•	In the beginning you’ll have a hard time finding your significant ones inside the Normandy.•	You’ll be annoyed by Shepard’s lack of endurance training (he can’t sprint for 200 meters without getting exhausted).

												I played 1, 2, and 3. The ending of 3 was a massive disappointment, but for me it was mainly because over time I grew extremely emotionally attached to most of my crew. I seriously don't want to let go, and I'm hoping Mass Effect Andromeda will fix the mess along with my feels (I doubt that). But overall this series is really good. I have never been so emotionally attached to video game characters in my life. And Tali'Zorah.... I need more Tali in my life.Bioware and EA: ""Here guys, have a Citadel DLC for Mass Effect 3, bond with all your characters and throw a party!! :D Yeah that's right, get dem feels in!! :D Hope you love your crew, Tali, Garrus, Wrex, EDI, Joker, Liara, Javik, Grunt, James, Cortez, Thane, Miranda, Mordin, Ashley, Kaiden..... because we're about to ♥♥♥♥ that ALL up for you, FOREVER! :D And then give you Mass Effect Andromeda and hope that you will forget about it all! ^_^- with loveOkay I'm done venting :)			"

												What if I told you there was a science-fiction roleplaying game where you lead a vastly diverse crew to stop the Council's golden agent after he goes rogue?Now, what if I told you that in said game, you make choices that can drastically effect multiple boss fights and just how diverse your crew is?Now stay with me, what if I told you in said game, your dialogue tree has VOICED dialogue provided by Mark Meer (if you are playing male) or the lovely Jennifer Hale (if you are playing female, obviously.)Okay, okay, sound interesting? Now how about this... What if I told you that this is Part 1 to a fully thought out and innovative trilogy where you can import not only your saves, but your very character (from your choices to your appearance) from the first game?What if I told you this game also has low enough specs to be played on most laptops? Seriously, if you're a RPG fan and you haven't played this yet because the controversy of the third game's ending has discouraged you: play this trilogy anyways. This is a lore-filled game with a fully narrated codex. A fully narrated codex!!! You can spend hours just listening to the codex alone!Seriously, the entire trilogy will provide you hundreds of hours of immersion in a well crafted universe.Just buy this if you like roleplaying games of any sort.

Mass Effect 3 is only available there, as well as the DLCs for ME 2.If you buy this game here, you can't simply use the cd-key to activate it there. You need to get in contact with Origin support so they do it for you. But it works.It's one of the best RPGs ever and you should totally play it, but understand that this game is a series in which every game matters for the next ones, so you might want to play it over Origin from the start.

Overall score is an average Mass Effect is one of the best RPG games that I have ever played. With its incredible story and terrific universe, it provides hours of action packed fun that will leave you eager for more when the game ends. It does carry some issues, but they are so minute that if you discover them, you will instantly forgot about them.

												I tried Mass Effect once. Couldnt see what all the fuss was about. Went back to it. Gave it another chance. Got totally sucked in. Finished all 3 games now. Mass Effect, whilst being the roughest around the edges, is still an excellent game. Shooting mechanics overlayed with the ability to momentarily pause and direct your customised comrades make for exceedingly deep choices. Thats before you even get to the game world, which is so fantastic the races and places will stay with you long after you finish it. A sci fi masterpiece of a novel where you can write your own story. Be aware, Mass Effect 3 is not available on Steam. You will require Origin to play, but it's still worth it (trust me, I hate Origin).			"

												Mass Effect is a good game, but not as good as you would expect from review rating. In the start, it's even boring. I nearly wanted to quit it – with all those lengthy dialogues, walking around doing nothing, shooting nobody...With lousy controls, inconvenient maps, generic exploration missions and awful combat system, you almost want to hate it, but THEN, in the second third of the game, the story gets better, creating emotional attachment to the characters, revealing sinister plot of epic proportion and pushing you to make game-changing moral choices, you're getting more and more excited and want to find out what's going to happen next. After the final battle you're like ""WOW! That was something!"" But is a great story enough to define this game as great? I don't think so. Every other aspect in this game is bad or mediocre.  So I give ME solid 7.5/10.PROS:- Great story (but only after the Citadel intro), although it's too anthropocentric and Commander Sheppard is unrealistically important and popular for a single soldier- Flexible and vast character appearance customisation options- Mods that make the game substantially better (e.g., MEUITM mod)NEUTRAL:- Alternative scenarios, choices matterCONS:- Homogenous textures with poor attention to detail (it might not be possible at the time, but still it doesn't add up to a good experience)- There are times in main missions when autosave feature is not working the entire mission; if you forget to save (which might be a disabled feature, too), you risk starting all over again, which means 10-15 minutes of repeated gameplay- Awful Mako (vehicle) controls, often it goes the opposite direction from what you're stearing it to. Combine it with disabled autosave and falling off the cliff and there you go – repeat the whole mission again- Awful combat system: there are covers, which both you and the AI should be using, but, since everyone (including your squad members) are just chaotically running all over the place, it's just easier to rush forward and shoot everybody without thinking about any tactics- Initial weapons are awfully inaccurate- Inconvenient inventory system (typical RPG thing)- Unbalanced credits system: short of money in the beginning, millionnaire towards the end (another typical RPG thing); but, IMO, it's not worth to purchase anything anyway, you get all you need from looting- Generic exploration missions on another planets with mountainous terrain – it's up and down over the mountains all the time- Mini-map kind of sucks, because it functions only as a radar and it doesn't depict distance properly- Right turn doesn't work sometimes, you have to turn the camera left to enable right turn again- There are no markers for side missions on galaxy map; you have to read the mission description to know where you should go and it's not very convenient- You need to create an EA account to get the free DLCAnyway, with so many faults, I still think this game is worth your time and money, because with such flexible and vast story it was something unique at the time, earning ME a place in the history of video games.P.S.

												Mass Effect is one of the best single player games in any genre that you can play for the best part of a decade. It helped to redefine the genre, and is a must play for fans of rpgs, sci-fi and shooters alike. The graphics are slightly outdated but can be improved with mods. Voice acting is top notch, sound effects are great and the sound track is fantastic. The gameplay is truly outstanding and helped to redefine the genre. The choices you make in the game have legitimate consequences, altering the story as you progress. And what a story it is, full of depth and intrique as you embark on a mission that will decide the fate of the galaxy.			"

   My Playthrough   Youtube Playlist    The Review Mass Effect is a grand Sci-fi RPG.  In fact this is by far the best Sci-fi RPG I ever played. The replay value of this game is very high. The game is both challenging and rewarding. The role playing elements of this game is deep enough to keep you invested and with such great characters and companions this game feels more real. The graphics still looks great. If you love fun and well written Sci-fi RPGs then you will enjoy Mass Effect. I can't recommend this game enough.   "

												Mass Effect is a fantastic Role Play Third Person Shooter.  The real mass effect  to mass effect is the cause and effect your choices influence the game and the other characters you play with.  If you are looking for a good game third person shooter this is it.  Be the hero everyone wants to be or be the hero  because you get the job done without worrying about your actions.  I have did two different play styles one good on evil and both are great.  Game play is about 30-40 hours you could probably get through game with out doing all the side missions in 20-25 hours but remember the cause the and effect.   I also recommend the bundle of the two games.  Because your play in the first carries over to the second and then the third.  But because EA is dumb you have pick up the third outside steam.			"

												Ah, Mass Effect. The franchise that has entranced me the most out of everything I've ever played in my life.I remember picking this series up around the time ME2 was already out and people were raving about ""Lair of the Shadow Broker"". Its final DLC ""Arrival"" had been announced and was days away from release. The first 2 games were both on sale and I can honestly say they were the best $40 I've ever spent.Right off the bat, what captured me about Mass Effect is the soundtrack. Haunting and alien with a strong 80s Sci-fi vibe. combined with the incredibly immersive visuals of the battle-ravaged landscape of Eden Prime, the first planet we visit during the story.The visuals themselves have a slightly rough edge to them, could be described as ""slick retro"", but in my view this is what increases ME1's charm and for some reason heightens immersion. Jack Wall & Sam Hulick are a magical team who have pulled out all the stops to truly bring the gameworld to life with the gift of their music.The lore is rich, fascinating and immersive beyond compare. There is enough material to fully supply 100 Mass Effect sequels, because the universe is vast and knows no boundaries. No matter how far-fetching some ideas or concepts might appear, there is no such thing as ""unbelievable"" when it comes to something so unknowable and alien like Space. Noone knows what's out there.The Mass Effect series is set 170 years into the future, where within the past 30 years humanity has discovered we are not alone in the universe after all. We are but one of numerous sapient species in the Milky Way, and they all have strong opinions too. Yet the galaxy is filled with secrets and one particularly horrifying secret is due to be irreversibly uncovered and put every race in peril. For there are monsters hidden in the dark corners of the Milky Way, and those monsters intend to wipe out all organic life as we know it.Gameplay-wise, ME1 isn't as fluid as other modern shooters. It certainly has its clunky issues and is a little cumbersome at times. Most optional side-quests conclude in identical-looking indoor structures regardless of what planet they're on, making them awfully tedious. The handling of the planetary exploration vehicle, the MAKO, leaves something to be desired, having been described by an in-game character as boasting ""handling like a tipsy rhino"". I'd say that's being generous.The weapon overheating feature, while designed to add a sense of shooter realism, is more irritating than immersive and will infuriate some people. The inventory system is a primitive, overly cluttered mess and will most certainly irritate some players to no end, but once you get the hang of it you can mostly ignore it.But the punchline is: as clumsy as some game systems are, you can't help but overlook them because the back story will have hooked its claws into you too deep, that you will not be able to stop playing. On a grander scale, overall level design is absolutely breath-taking. Landing on a red moon and looking up to see its main planet covering most of the sky like an angry giant will indeed take your breath away.You're suddenly no longer in your own house, but on an alien world light years away. Driving along the Prothean Skyway on Feros and stopping to soak in the visuals will transport you to 2183 AD. Seeing the Prothean spires stretching beyond atmospheric visibility will project images in your mind, not of a haunted, abandoned world but of a majestic technologically superior empire spanning across the galaxy in all its glory.I ended up completing Mass Effect 1 within 3 days (I took my time) and when I was done, I imported my savegame into Mass Effect 2 and was blown to the stratosphere. Oh yes, hang onto your saves, because you will need them to continue your story in Mass Effect 2. Actions have consequences, and they will shape world details around you.I can go on like this all night, but my point will remain the same. Mass Effect is worth every cent and every second you put in it. I was not a sci-fi fan before Mass Effect; I am now. Even if you're not a fan of elaborate fiction, you can't help but let your mind roam wild when your eyes feast on the stunning futuristic visuals of the Citadel - the cultural galactic center, or the haunting lost alien world of Ilos.""Andromeda"", the 4th installment of the Mass Effect series is less than a year away from release, and I don't doubt for a second it will not disappoint. If you're not a Mass Effect fan, now it's time to become one.			"

 An exciting Space Adventure  9.3/10Now I know this game is quite old, but I have finally been able to sit and dive into the deep space of Mass effect. From the vast amount of planets to explore, to the commanding of my squad to take on the ventures unknown, I had one heck of a time.In the beginning I jumped in being prepared to get through the game as quickly as possible. Now it is not the best way to play this game, even though I had that mindset, I found myself veering off course to the different side quests the universe had to offer. Right from the start, you are given a variety of choices in dialogue in which molded your character with the personality you wanted to give. Now being the person I am I will always be the that knight in shining armour, but the choices were still very hard to choose from, sacrificing others for the good of mankind, or maybe saving a whole species but risking another catastrophe of war, it was a very hard decision.Putting aside the dialogue for a moment, there was still a lot of decision making when it came to the combat. Different weapons, with different upgrades and stats, then choosing if to keep the best weapon for yourself (of course you do) or giving it to your squad members. I have to admit I did spend a lot of time deciding which upgrades were best on which guns to make certain situations easier for me, some bullets did better against synthetics while others organics, and at the time of the fight you could just decide by thinking  Which enemy have I came across the most? Im not saying this a life or death decision but it really. REALLY. helped in some such situations but yeah I like combat to go smoothly when Im involved.Overall this game is a must play. I would advise getting it for the cheap price it is now than the full retail price it once was.			"

												Overall, good game, but since it's a bit older, don't expect inovation. A must play if you want to play the whole trilogy. Graphics are a bit older, but the story is better than most of the games out there. Since it is an rpg, some of the missions will be frustrating beacause of difficulty (not the story related - they are scaled well, maybe a bit too easy. If you get into the game and story, the trilogy will reward you handsomly for your choices. There's a great feeling when you run into an old friend from previous game (s) - for example: meeting Wrex again in ME2.If you want to make progress in paragon/renegade system, immediatelly invest in charm/intimidate as the game will open these dialog options ONLY if you invest in them, not like in ME 2 & 3.One more VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION: If your gameplay lags a lot and you get very low fps altho you have a machine that's way beyond minimum specs, try disabling your firewall. It helped me to play this game as it was supposed to be played 60+fpsEnjoy :)			"

												The Mass Effect series is by far one of my favorite RPG games to date. Since I've started the series by playing the third game first and then the other two games, getting used to the lower graphics and the different controls was a bit of a challenge, but once I've gotten used to it I really enjoyed the game.You get to know a lot of different characters, you are faced with a lot of difficult choices that actually have an impact on the game's progress. It has everything a good RPG needs to have to be enjoyable.I've first played these games on my PlayStation console, but I definitely will be playing the first two on steam again, since they have a high replay value.I can only recommend this series to everyone who enjoys playing RPGs.

												This game is the start of an epic trilogy that is rich with story and interactivity. Developed by the same company that made the popular Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, this game improves upon the role-playing system presented in that game. This third-person shooter is worthy of being one of BioWare's crowning achievements. People that desire hours of entertainment should definitely check this one out.			"

												Join Commander Shepard and his/her crew of humans and aliens to save the galaxy from a galactic threat. It's a Third-Person RPG Shooter that vaguely feels like Deus Ex at first, because weapons are fairly inaccurate to start with, and Shepard doesn't want to take a diazepam because your arms sway all over the damn place while trying to aim with a sniper. But soon you specialize in what weapon you think you're best with after killing enemies, completing quests, etc. with skill points you earn as you level up, as well as other misc passive & active abilities. Shepard's crew on the other hand, often come with biotic and tech abilities to help you in battle, and even in things like hacking devices.The weapons also work on an overheating system, as in they have unlimited ammo, but if you don't control your bursts well enough, they will overheat and you will be unable to use them for several seconds. There are weapon mods to reduce heat weapons produce, as well as other useful things, and ammo mods to inflict more damage, bypass shields, poison, etc.Along your quest, you can choose to either be a saintly paragon, or a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, or somewhere in between with the whole moral choice system, and the more you use the charm or intimidate options in dialog, the more levels you unlock in the charm/intimidate skill tree in which to spend your skill points in and unlock more dialog options.Then there's the epic world map of the galaxy, in which you can continue your main quest, or pull an Elder Scrolls and do ungodly amounts of sidequesting and explore everywhere. Usually when you land a on planet, you do so with a space buggy called the Mako, which is equipped with thrusters, a machine gun, and a cannon. You explore a fairly large surface area of the planets you land on, optionally collecting things such as veins and salvage to earn exp and money. Then there's the main point of the planet, which usually involves entering a facility, or cave, or just wipeing out a camp of hostiles.You collect lots of weapons, armors, weapon mods & ammo mods, along your way, which are magically transferred to your inventory after killing enemies, then theres a bunch of shops to buy and sell from. By the end of the game, I had several million credits, and 2 weapon mods to prevent overheating to the point where my weapons never overheated, I love when older RPGs do broken stuff like that.The main things I hate about the game are the sound glitches, and my CPU fan going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at all times due to the game being punishing on your CPU. But thats just some technical problems, it's a great game and it runs fine besides that, I only ever crashed once.You can also import your save into the sequel, Mass Effect 2, and have a bunch of story elements impacted, as well as start with some bonus stuff. More games like this need to do that.			"

												There's not much more to be said about Mass Effect than it's the beginning of a beautiful relationship that you won't easily shake.  While the games that follow it might be more streamlined they will never hold the same appeal or feel of accomplishment you get from finishing ME1. Overall, it's my favorite of the series and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great story and a very memorable character.			"

												One of the best games ever. Period.The story, the world, the history - everything is so well written and executed. There is a lot of backstory in this game and if you take time to read/listen to everything - you are going to enjoy every single second of Mass Effect and you will remember this game for many many years.I just finished my second playthrough (the first one was 4 years ago). Mass Effect doesn't age. it's still beautiful even after 9 years of its release.There are a few things that can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ (like driving a Mako through a rocky terrain or repetitive level design of facilities on different planets), but apart from that - it's a gem in every aspect. The developers have done a great job at making every planet look different. The skies are just beautiful (with so many stars and planets). Eh. Love it.Mass Effect is one of those games where you feel sad after finishing it.			"

Keep your saves.Go get mass effect 2 and play it using your saves.You will literaly be missing out if you dont give this a go.PS: giving it a go means finishing at least the first mission which is a bit boring.

												Not much playtime yet on steam but I've played quite a lot on PS3 (90 hours or so) and the steam version is like that but with better graphics, fps, and loading times.It's a great sci-fi game and it's filled with a lot of exploration, backstory, and lore.The rpg elements are ok-ish and the combat's not polished compared to newer games, but the shooting is serviceable, not absolutely horrible. Just not up to today's standards I'd say.It's more star trek than any star trek game, because you get to be captain of a ship, make decisions that impact storylines and your relationship with your crew, pursue romantic interests, and explore plenty of planets (though admittedly they are sometimes kinda empty and the buildings are reused very often). And if you really like lore and backstories in your games, this game has plenty and a lot of them are fully voiced. What mass effect really does well is immersing you into its world.Would definitely recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in sci fi.			"

												After playing Dragon Age for a bit some years ago (I don't know why I quit? I had better things to do I guess) I decided to try out another infamous title from Bioware: Mass Effect. I had no idea what to expect and just went in blank. I entered a world full of Turians, Salarians, and a lot of other races I was quite sure I would never remember. But as the game progressed, I became quite fond of Turians. I met my first Volus along the way. I learned what a Specter was and what was expected of me when I became one. And the conversations. I love the conversations. Instead of watching a scene and waiting until you can play again, you decide how this conversation will end! Will your persuade your teammate to cooperate or will they leave you when you decide to yell at them? It's your decision.This is a game I'll never forget, and I'll make sure to give Dragon Age another go!			"

												After seeing snippets of Mass Effect 2, I knew I had to play from the beginning. This game is a great start to this three part space opera. The story is deceptively simple. You are Commander Shephard and you must save the galaxy. As you complete the simple story you will have to make decisions that will flesh out the story and in some ways decide on who lives and who dies. Apart from the main story, there are numerous side missions that help develop relationships with fellow characters or influence what happens in the sequels. There is tons of replay value due to the fact that there are different ways to handle various situations in the game. The graphics have aged well, I think. The characters are all memorable. You won't like these characters, you will LOVE them. The relationships you build (or tear down) will follow you in the games to come. Now for the negatives, and I had to squint to see them. I personally found the exploration tedious. The planets you go to are all very detailed, with descriptions about their resources and history, but driving the vehicle to go through some of the rough terrain got to be annoying at times. Thats really the only negative I could think of. A great game that should be tried by everybody.			"

You won't like these characters, you will LOVE them. The relationships you build (or tear down) will follow you in the games to come. Now for the negatives, and I had to squint to see them. I personally found the exploration tedious. The planets you go to are all very detailed, with descriptions about their resources and history, but driving the vehicle to go through some of the rough terrain got to be annoying at times. Thats really the only negative I could think of. A great game that should be tried by everybody.			"

												Mass Effect might be an old game but that shouldnt stop you from playing it, if you like story-rich action RPGs then you will definitely enjoy this game.I played the game on Windows 10 and it ran without any issues on ultra high settings.Pros-1.Good story and interesting characters with great voice acting2.Decent graphics3.RPG elemnts like skill trees,decision making and character customization4.Has many entertaining side quests and activites to keep you occupied for hoursCons-1.Dialouge animations are sometimes glitchy which breaks immersion2.UI can be a bit confusing in the beginning			"

												This is where it all started.I have hundreds of hours logged in this trilogy, both on Steam and on Origin  where I inevitably ported my Mass Effect 2 save files to, but I'll explain in my review of that  and I'm still not done with this series, and with its characters. Mass Effect means a lot to me, both as a game and as a story.The controls can be janky - especially if you're playing as an Infiltrator - and you'll quickly find yourself watching the same npc animations over and over as you progress through the game that's something that Bioware is quite infamous for, you'll find it in pretty much all of their games but as you immerse yourself in the story it all becomes superficial.There's so much you can do in this game, including optional quests that have impact on the story in the sequels (nothing too substantial unfortunately, they're more like easter eggs/cameos, but still nice to get nonetheless). I did a completionist run a few months back with my first male Shepard Uriel, and it was well worth the time and energy I put into it - though I wouldn't reccomend it for a first time player. Mass Effect has its flaws, both in its story and in its gameplay. But there's no denying that it's a classic, and that its beloved by a lot of people, including myself. It's worth it, trust me.			"

												The first Mass Effect game is a game that changed my life. It got me into astronomy and not many games will get me interested into a specific subject and will make me enjoy it. Mass Effect is basically a choose your own adventure book in video game form. The story and characters are very well written and you feel like you're actually this commander that is gathering a small team to take down the Galaxy's biggest threat ever. The music is seriously one of the best ever in video games, it has an 80s synthetic feel to it and you can really feel the emotions in every song. There's just too much replay value in this and I honestly can't recommend this enough. You will not regret playing this series.			"

												Mass Effect has one of the best sci-fi stories out there and the universe is fascinating. The soundtrack is  absolutly beautiful. I love how the game gives you multiple options when dealing with other characters. Some guy is bothering you? You can politely ask him to go away, or deck him in the face- the choice is up to you. You can easily play this game 2-4 times and have very different experiences. Some cons:-Managing your inventory is way too tedious.-Elevator rides take forever to go anywhere and are completely pointless. Far too often I've gotten into an elevator, waited for the loading screen to being the elevator sequence, gone down the elevator, then waited again once the doors opened to load the map. Why??? It seems like a small thing, but man is it ever annoying (although elevator conversations amongst your sqadamates can be pretty entertaining). "

												The only reason to play this is for the story.Many of the reviews on this game lead you to believe is a nearly perfect game. That is probably out of love for most of the franchise and/or nostalgia. graphics are not ""slightly dated"" but extremely dated. combat is extremely clunky until you get to higher levels, and some fights on higher difficulties are damn near impossible. ie, battlemaster krogan. if you cant stun him, after he 1 shots your companions, he will charge you, and no matter how far you run he will wind up right behind you, then punch you and you're dead. There is also the fact that if you die on a boss, you are almost guaranteed to have to go through that entire cutscene again. same with any fight that has a cutscene.The gui is clunky, with stats not being clear, everything being fairly basic design.Planets are barren, with a few spots to visit. The mako is extremely weird to controll. often times you turn much more than you wanted too, it's fairly inaccurate when shooting unless you zoom in, which leaves you with no idea where you're pointing.if you want to play the mass effect series, go ahead and get this game, but don't expect a game with amazing mechanics.  If I knew what this game was like before, I probably would have just watched the story on youtube and saved myself a lot of time then moved on to play the last 2.			"

												11/10This is my favorite series of all time as far as RPG's go and almost one of my favorite period. However, it is a little dated looking now, so.. here is something to help with that.(For actual review skip to HERE! typed below)http://www.moddb.com/mods/mass-effect-1-new-texture-updatesimprovements-modCheck out that site, it will have you up and running with far improved shaders and graphics. Also, DLC!http://help.ea.com/en/article/mass-effect-bring-down-the-sky-dlc-redemption/In order to get the end DLC PS you will need to register your key with Origin. I hear rumor that it's automatically included with the game now and no longer a need to get the trillogy. I can't confirm this though. as I always move my back up file that contains the DLC I got wayyy back before EA nuked every available link for it... So I import my back up copy. You wont miss anything without the PS DLC as it's a very short run, and doesn't transfer anything to the next game. Bringing Down The Sky however is fantastic and I highly recomend it. Make sure to launch the game once before trying to install it. I have far more hours in this game than STEAM reports, as I had been playing it long before they started keeping track, and now play it through Origin since steam doesn't get updates for the series to keep them working with PhysX. (Political battle with EA I'm sure...) I'm sure there are ways to make it work with steam but I guess the launcher for the game isn't that big of a deal. I just launch Origin as a non steam game to keep the overlay.Read this, it might save you a lot of problem solving and head scratchinghttp://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/2uxq1r/problem_installing_meuitm_for_me1/Still need more? Here you gohttp://forum.bioware.com/topic/215916-making-the-most-of-your-me1-pc-experience-maximizing-graphics-and-sound/HERE!Mass Effect is a sci fi RPG set in the future. You travel between galexies trying to save the univers from a massive threat.The choices you make matter. People will live or die because of them, some choices you wont even see the results from until you are playing the second or third game. You truely shape your own story and it's fantastic in every way. The game play mechanics are a bit dated, as are the graphics but the mod listed above should help with the later. While the game play mechanics are dated, they aren't lacking in fun. They aren't tedius, they just aren't stream lined. ME2 has a change in this, and 3 alters game play even further. In this installment you have a inventory and can buy different weapons, armor, ammo types, and get some resonable depth with the leveling system. The next installments simplify this and you lose a lot of that old style mechanic. (I like the armor system and weapon system a lot in the first game but the ways to improve in the second game are good  as well, just different.) You work as a squad, and command each member. That beind said they do have AI and work on their own as well. You can choose to let them use their powers by themselves or, to have complete control of what they use and when they use it by issuing commands. You get to explore planets, there might be random people trying to fight out for their lives, giant creatures waiting to kill you, or little monkeys stealing tech you really want to get your hands on. There is so much I would like to say, but won't at risk of spoiling the adventure for you. Get out there, suit up, and have some fun.If you are going to play any of these games, I highly suggest starting with this one and playing all the way through. If you don't, there are things you will miss. Big things, and little things that make the series shine so bright. I'm commander Lex Lagger, and this is my favorite game on steam.

												Just a quick review.People will tell you that Mass Effect 2 is where the serries really got good. People will tell you to skip 1 and go straight to 2. People will say ""I could never really get over the graphics"" or ""I just don't like the controls.""Those people are wrong.There has never been a game quite like this one and there may never be again. The storytelling, the characters, the humor, the love, and passion, and fear you will feel are like nothing you've experienced before. It's a roller-coaster of emotions and, like the best roller-coasters, it will leave you awed, overjoyed, and a little out of breath.In conclusion: yes, the graphics are weak by today's standards. Yes, the controls are clunky. Yes, the Mako handles like a jetski in a desert. Yes, you shoulc 100%, absolutly get this game.			"

While keeping an awesome, full of events story, the game also offers many different side missions which are not far behind the main campaign.In addition, the dialogue in this game is very friendly and allows you to easily distinguish between good and bad, which makes role playing much more convenient.

												No one likes to display their closet nerd stuff out in public.There are only about 4 types of game related shirts I come across that people seem okay with wearing out into public without getting massive wedgies from everyone. Halo or Call of Duty something (shooter nerds trying to act like they're not nerds chugging all that Mountain Dew) A Horde or Alliance symbol (Warcraft nerds) Anything Nintendo related (Nintendo's cool but Super Smash Brothers on Steam is the future come on Reggie Fils make it happen...) The mysterious N7 symbol (You'll see well groomed, attractive, a-list type folks whom you're sure couldn't possibly be into games strutting around in these)Yes, the N7 symbol that comes from Mass Effect.  People walk around wearing this in real life with beaming pride.  The amount of respect for the symbolic designation of Commander Sheppard's training in interplanetary warfare (The N7 ranking) is huge amongst fans.  The distribution of Commander Sheppard's Jersey (N7) may very well rival the amount of wear and public exposure as some semi-popular professional athelete jerseys.Mass Effect is here to stay...indefinitely.  With this first game a giant amount of gamers became life long fans.  It's amazing to see the sheer diversity of people who have become so attached to the universe and the characters.  People cosplay the characters and go to conventions even though the trilogy for Mass Effect has reached its conclusion long ago.  (No worries, there are definitely more Mass Effect games to come).Along with Dragon Age, Baldur's Gate and Knights of the Old Republic, this would be another example of Bioware's dedication to crafting intense stories and deep characters that people can really dive deep into.The GameMass Effect is a Space RPG focused on story and character development.  The conversation wheel is used frequently to allow the character to engage in discussions with other NPCs and teammates they encounter during gameplay.In this game you play as the commander of an elite team consisting of the galaxy's most skilled interstellar fighters in a mission to save the galaxy.  It's essentially a third person, cover shooter where you can issue commands to your teammates to strategically position them and to use special abilities on enemies.You can fight with what is essentially Star Wars-esque Force PowersAlong with all manner of space guns: Rifles, Sniper Rifles, Pistols, Shotguns, automatics and so on.Pros Great Gameplay mechanics Excellent Story Excellent Character Design (People are obsessed with their favorite characters) Excellent Visuals Very elaborate RPG elements Choices made can impact the of outcome events both immediately and in later games (This is the first part of a trilogy)Cons Inventory can get a little cluttered There's a rare chance that you can encounter a catastrophic bug in a few places that will prevent you from progressing (must reload your last save) Save Often The entire trilogy isn't available on Steam....blame Electronic Arts.If you enjoy Sci Fi and RPGs, this game is a no brainer.  You've probably played it already.  If you haven't...now's the time...			"

												I cannot say enough good things abut the triology. The game was so charcter driven that I came to care about my FemShep and the crew. By the 3rd game there were times I was a wreck because I was so invested. Even the first game was brilliant and Bioware just got better and better with the trilogy. Yeah, ME was made in 2008 and it shows its age but the character development and foundation of the series was there.Even with combat, this game can be slow for those looking for action. A lot of the game is about discovery and making choices, which many of them carry over from game to game. However, I have not found a better RPG/Action game yet.			"

												Oh Mass Effect, such nostalgia, much wow. It's been nearly 8 years since the initial launch of Bioware's Space Epic and to this day the industry is still learning from it. Mass Effect 2 brought serious improvements to the ME universe however the original Mass Effect is a classic. The Morality system where a player could either become a Paragon (Good) or a Renegade (Bad) was similar to the likes of the Good and Evil system of games like Fable however it actually awarded the player with satisfaction. Every decision point actually effected how you played the game.The planet exploration system in Mass Effect has and always will be amazing, roaming planets with the Mako Rover was fun but awkward at times due to the mechanics however this was improved vastly in Mass Effect 2. When using the Mass Relay system to teleport from one relay to another you would get a decent animation that was followed by a stunning central planet followed by it's surrounding plants. The galaxy's that filled the space in between were stunning as well, with a high fidelity of stars and more it was a sight for the eyes that I have not forgotten to this day.Actual combat was fairly decent however again it was vastly improved in Mass Effect 2. If you ever need a great game or series to play, something you plan to put at least a hundred plus hours into, the Mass Effect trilogy is a great choice however I suggest you prepare yourself for the ending of Mass Effect 3, don't say I didn't warn you about that one. If this game's on sale for $4.99 or even $19.99 BUY IT and the other two Mass Effect games as well (Mass Effect 3 is only available on Origin sadly, thanks EA).			"

												Mass Effect is a must have.Simply because it kicked off the most sophisticated Sci-Fi IP of the past 30 years. The richness and depth of the Mass Effect Series' universe is easily on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. If you are a Sci-Fi Fan you can not help but get sucked in and swallowed whole by this beast.As a game the strength of Mass Effect besides it's lore is a superb story within that lore, believable Charaters to interact with, choices over choices that impact not only the current game but reach forward into part 3 and some of the best written and performed dialog of all time.Within the series this is the game featuring the most Exploration opportunities and the strongest classical RPG elements (VERY stat and skill dependant down to a limit in inventory space, lots of loot).The weak points:Bugs. It's a problem with the whole series. There is nothing gamebreaking, but some Bugs are just plain out annoying and stupid but never got fixed. My guess is that this is in no small part due to the fact that the Mass Effect games are made for consoles first and foremost and are from a console era when patching wasn't really an option.While the Exploration possibilities are quite big it sadly isn't done very well. Most of it consists of driving a vehicle with crazy physics through randomly generated height maps that had a few prefabs placed in them. That is litterally something that a hobbyist just learning how to make maps can put together in an hours work or less.The list of weak points could be made longer.But in reality they do not matter. Because the story and how it is presented not only makes up for the weak points. It lets you forget them. I am just in the middle of another series playthrough just because I have finally gotten all DLCs for part 3. And this probably is the strongest pro going for the series: Even though you could play just part 3. When you pick it up again you wanna start at the beginning again. With Part 1. Because seeing a new Shepard evolve and change over the course of three games is just awesome. It is just like those Lord of the Ring or Star Wars weekends when you watch all the movies in succession. Only better because it lasts for weeks. Hell a 100% completion playthrough of all three games is worth easily 150 hours of playtime.Last but not Least: Another important reason to get the Mass Effect Series is that part 4 is rumored to hit us next year at the latest and you absolutely will want to know what all the fuss is about when that happens.

												This game is very near to perfect. If you like RPG, this will quite literally give you a galaxy's worth of role playing. I'll start with the things that don't matter hugely to an RPG, but add to it and bring it to perfection. Firstly, the graphics are beautiful. Individually, tree leaves may look a little pixelated, and close-up shots of weaponry and armour suffer the same effect. However, when the graphics are bought together as a whole the effect is simply profound. Vast cityscapes sprawl beneath the viewing deck on the Citadel's wards, amazing scenery from the Presidium. All the skyboxes are filled with amazing imagery; binary star systems, meteorite showers, even simply beautiful blue skies and white clouds. Tying it all together are the little graphic effects, such as the lifelike water, or whisps of smoke and steam. Detailing on the characters, aliens, and animals are all done excelently, making the alien species not only believable, but also emotionally telling even when blue or scaley. Add to this very effective use of lighting and colours, and the option to have a 'film grain' graphics setting, and you are left with a game that is just beautiful.Next, the music and sounds on this game are very well suited to the gameplay. As with most RPGs, the music seems to crescendo with each new adventure or battle, however at points in this game it also brings in much more somber and melancholly sounding music to reflect the emotions of the charecters and crew aboard the Normandy. In either case, the music always seems to reflect the fact that this is a game anbout space, and definitely adds to the other-worldly feel. The sound effects in the game are not necessarilly subtle, however when playing they become absorbed into the gameplay, something which personally I applaud. All to often I find myself turning down the sound effect volume on a game for it being to loud, or doing the complete opposite as it's too quiet to hear an enemy right behind you. With Mass Effect, all of the sounds effects are well designed so that they fit perfectly into context, and are never out of place. The voice acting in this game is spot on, all the characters are capable of so much emotion, and make the game so much more believable than counterparts with lesser vocals. Even alien races have voices to match, and a variety within the races at that, rather than the same voice actor for every member of a species (Skyrim, guards, what?). Gameplay moves fluidly, whith characters interacting very well with the environment. I don't think I ever found a character floating in mid air, or stuck inside a boulder or staircase, or limbs from a character on one side of a door potruding through to the other side. Charecters take cover when commanded, are able to peer and shoot around objects, and team commands work excelently when directed, and still work well when on automatic. Customisation of you and your team's loadout was most definitely confusing at first, however once grasped really gave the combat situations an extra tactical element, allowing choices between weapons and ammunition types for each new enemy encountered. Added to the game is a hacking minigame which allows you to unlock doors, crates and safes, and this increases with difficulty as it increases with reward, however it would have been nice for the developers to add other methods of hacking - I doubt all locks in the galaxy use the exact same system. Effectively the game has 3 levels of gameplay, the most important being on foot, secondly missions involving driving the mako, and lastly small elements from being in orbit. When in orbit you are free to walk around and interact with your spaceship, and have access to the galaxy map. From this map you can explore the galaxy through nebulas, star systems and down to an individual planetary level. This allows you to scan planets for resources, and choose to land on some of the planets to perform a mission. When on minor missions on other planets, usually you will be assigned to drive the mako, an armoured six wheeled heavy hitting tank of sorts. Equiped with some form of machine gun, a slower firing cannon, and the ability to fly for a very brief period of time, it is fun to use. The controls are a bit strange at first, with the turning not behaving quite as you'd expect, however once you've gotten used to it, the driving becomes a lot more fun.Finally, the part most people want from an RPG to be perfect is the story, the character interactions, quite simply, the role playing. This game SATISFIES. In playing this game you can either simply blast through the main missions and skip the dialogue, missing out the majority of the context and background, or you can take the time to talk to minor characters, pick up side missions, and simply use dialogue options to ask questions. All of these actions add a hugely deep and mixed background for the in-game galaxy, with complex interactions and repercussions of past actions echoed in the game you get to play, although possibly misunderstood or simply missed if the player choses to ignore them. If the interactions themselves didn't satisfy, the game has a 'codex', which is basically an encyclopedia which fills as you play and interact, meaning that if at any point you forget something you've picked up or simply want to learn more about an aspect of the game (with a large scope, from biology and cuture of alien races, to the weapons and armour used on the Normandy) you can delve into the codex and gain a better understanding. The storyline is believable, and multiple storylines can be followed through the use of paragon (hero) or renegade (badass) options. This allows for much greater depth and character development, and continues with your choices in the first game bridging over into the sequels. The paragon/renegade choice also shapes the way you interact with individual characters, bringing different methods of conflict resolution, persuading your way through tough situations, or even romance with the choice being left to the player. Character interactions are usually emotionally charged without being unreal, and these emotions build as you become closer to your crew, leading to some very hard decisions in the late game. Overall, this is one of my most favourite games I've ever played since I started on a Windows 95 at the age of 2. I fell in love on my first playthrough, and it definitely brings an amazing sense of gravitas with it. The game is deep, moving, and most importantly believable. Grapics, audio, and gameplay elements tie the whole package together in a beautiful way, and pull the player in deeper. I'd easilly give this a 9/10, and would recomend this to anyone with even a slight love of RPG. Simply put, buy this game, play it, and cherish it.			"

												Belated review. If you are a sucker for any of the following: spaceships, aliens, storytelling, RPGs, shooters, or sci-fi in general, and haven't yet played Mass Effect... well, what are you waiting for?!? Even though it's a few years old now and has a few minor problems, Mass Effect is still well-worth playing, especially if you have any interest at all in the upcoming ME3. I thought overall it was a really fun game, especially the story aspects. The shooting mechanics are also perfectly fine. The only major gripe I had was the weapon/inventory system. Throughout your journey, you are constantly finding tons of weapons and upgrades, 99% of which are duplicates or unneccessary. The interface for managing weapons is also confusing and cumbersome. But that one thing aside, I pretty much loved everything else about ME1. If you haven't played it yet, get it now!			"

												Mass Effect is a sexual rollercoaster. One minute, your ♥♥♥♥ is starting to tremble from the adrenaline that you feel as you're slaughtering dozens of unarmed colonists, the next you're getting rammed by a Krogan warlord. And nothing quite prepares you for the initial feeling of going balls deep in an Asari scientist, as you pull on her ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little tentacles. And lemme tell ya, this octopus doesn't trim her garden (Geddit?! Pubic hair comments with Beatles references!) However, the most powerful experience this game gives the player is the possibility to take advantage of an Easter egg in which you can anally probe a Geth, which shows how hard the developers worked to hold true to their sci-fi roots. Remember when that movie ""AI. Artificial Intelligence"" with Jude Law came out back in 2001, and everyone wanted to bang the brains out of Haley Joel Osment's character? It's kinda like that, but without the pedo vibe. All in all, I give Mass Effect 11 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tentacles out of 5. Meaning it was ""meh.""			"

												BioWare are masters at world building, and in this case universe building. Mass Effect is a massive sci-fi experience, letting the player explore an entire galaxy while offering superb characters and storytelling. It's true that the action is somewhat simplistic, and experienced players will rarely be threatened, but the whole thing is so stunningly beautiful and epic that you won't care. Honestly, I really thought there was no chance that Bioshock would be challenged for game of 2007, but Mass Effect equals it for sheer cinematic awesomeness. Compulsory gaming!			"

												Let me say this. I loved the game, it's a wonderful story and action is top notch. From your own custom Shepeard to the crew you take on missions this game has tons to offer.Pros:1. You can date people through out the game2. A large number of weapons and ammor that are not just stat ups, they look difrent.3. Story telling to the max4. Unique races and rich story for all of them5. No one is perfect. Everyone has some intresting abilites making you have to pick the right people for the job.Cons:1. Considering what you pick as your job at the start one of your crew is kinda usless.2. Lot of the time is spent looking around one aera for the last sidequest3. A few glitches can ruin the game4. There isn't much interaction between crew when on missions besides the basic lines you will normally hear.5. NO GAY ALIEN!!!  This is kinda my pet peve for all three games. Female Shep you get the choice of three aliens ( 2 males and 1 female) If you pick male Shep the only gay romances are humans.			"

												This is my first review so please don't hate!Mass Effect 1 is the first of the ME trilogy, one of the best RPG trilogies of today.Despite lacking the better graphics of the later 2 games, the story is still extreemly well made, the characters are just amazing to play, talk and experiment with, lots of quest and places to explore (for those who love completing the games as much as possible and have the patience to do it)Unfortunately it still has some bugs in it, but most people have found ways around them if you look around for fixes, at least i managed to fix 2-3 more known bugs such as the sound crackle, starmap bug and quicksave bug.It is one of my favorite games of all time, Bioware has the most talented dev's from my point of view so bear with the graphics and play your way trough this trilogy, its well worth every single penny.

You meet all the characters, get your feet wet with all the action, and the Shepard. Commander Shepard. I reccommend this game to everyone I meet and will talk about it all the time!Sure, the game may be a little buggy sometimes, but comon!

												I really enjoyed this gamePros--The story is well crafted and you can tell alot of effort was put into it. It has lots of twists, turns, and reveals that are pretty good. Not mind blowing, but still, its one of the highlights of the game. Theres alot there if you want to dig giving players a choice in how far they want to go into the lore of the worle. -Interactions with your squad members are memorable and personal. Each has distinct personalities and underlying motives that are there if you spend the time to get to know them all-The branching diolauge paths are great. Give some depth and a player's touch into the game. Not super deep and many diolauges still lead to the exact same result but thats ok.-The settings were pretty good. It was really neat to go explore all these planets and choose in what order you were to do it in. The aliens and universe created here are also interesting and thought out.-Runs well on my crap PC and also has a widespread texture mod for those who seek higher fidelity. Cons-Elevators. There are alot of them. Most I assume are disgusing loading screens and it really gets old fast especially when in some situations you go through one elevator, get out, walk a bit, then go up another. -Combat. While it is good I wouldnt call it great. I played on the hardest difficulty with AI actions turned off for my squad mates and one of two things would happen in combat situations: my main character could just wipe out all the enemies without the help of my squadmates so I have no reason to even have them do anything, or when I do need them they are HORRIBLE at staying alive. Even when you direct them towards cover they very often come out for no reason and die. Somtimes you plan a combo of abilities on a enemy all at once but one squad member decides that its just not happening today. It got annoying. Also I didnt like that you had to pick your squadmates from the begining of the mission when you have no idea whats in store. They all have different abilities but only a few combos cover everything so it locks you out of doing certain combos of characters you may like. Overall it is an ok combat system, that with some tweaks could be really really good.-Driving sections - controls are kind of slippery and every driving section all game has the same 3 or 4 enemies making them really easy and really boring-Enemies. There are only about 10 enemys in the whole game if you dont count reskins. Kind of a a let down. -Final Boss- Ended up just being the main bad guy with the abilities of one of the enemy types you have fought all game with a stupid amount of health and rocket launchers added on. I get that the combat doesnt really lend itself to grandiose boss battles but still. Boss battles in general were usually just waves of common enemies. -Save points, This is the grandaddy of my annoyances with this game. Probably 5-10 times thoughout the main game you will have boss battles or very difficult encounters that have loooong cutscenes or elevators right before them. These cannot be skipped and its awful. Every time you die you have to walk through the same diolauge for 2 minutes before you fight. It gets old really fast espeicailly if you are having a real tough time with the boss. I get not skipping on the first time but there is no reason you shouldnt be able to skip on subsequent viewings.Overall I did really enjoy this game. This is a game that is greater than the sum of its parts. It keep me wanting to play to figure out what would happen next which cant be said for too many games I play. If you like a good space story and third person tactical shooters, I would grab this game. 7.5/10			"

												Rating 8/10OverviewThird Person Shooter Role Playing Game  - Impressive game with serious flawsThe Good:+ The game provides a variety of different classes that suit individual play styles. Each class comes with its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. Certain classes can only use certain types of weapons and abilities.  The game also gives you the option of solving missions by being good(paragon) or a bit more ruthless (renegade) Depending on your choice, leads to more dialogue options in the future. +Combat is a huge part of the game. Each gun type feels good, along with the different abilities. You can issue commands to your party members however for the most part they do fine if you leave them be.  Certain battles can be very engaging requiring you to make full use of the environments and equipment. +The overall plot is excellent and keeps the game interesting. Although it touches upon a lot of different sci fi tropes the game presents all of these ideas in a manner that makes the game interesting and fun to play+ The writing/dialogue and the voice acting are all fantastic making every interaction engaging to listen to.+In typical Bioware fashion, the companions and villains are interesting and for the most part, the best characters in the game. Talking to each companion and listening to their history adds a level of depth to the game. +Character design is excellent, each race has a unique look and feel to them adding to the believability. + The main missions are varied and fun to play, each mission involves driving a vehicle which helps break up the shooting segments and keeps things from getting stale. +The lead up to the final confrontation and ultimately the conclusion is epic. It really feels satisfying, and is a fitting end to the game. I would argue this game has a better build up to the end than the other games in the series. +The overall scope of this game is impressive for what its trying to accomplish. The game has a variety of different planets to explore in your vehicle, side missions, story missions, talking to your companions, learning the history of the different races, planets, technologies etc. If you are a gamer who loves being absorbed into a universe Bioware did a fantastic job of detailing every possible aspect of the game. +Graphically the game still holds up very well, though textures seem blurry. + Music and soundThe Bad:- The user interface is abysmal for what this game is trying to accomplish. Buying/Selling or even equipping items in your inventory seems much harder than it needs to be. The UI does not convey information in a presentable fashion. There are options missing that would makes things so much easier, i.e organizing  inventory lists based on damage/accuracy etc.-Side missions are incredibly repetitive for all the wrong reasons. The game recycles three or 4 level designs over and over again taking the fun out of playing these missions. In addition most side quest missions are completed the same way- Kill lots of enemies, reach the end of the level, talk to somebody and resolve it by being good or bad. If you played one of them, you pretty much played them all. -The idea of exploring different planets, discovering lost ruins, and missions certainly sounds awesome but something was lost in the execution. Going down to a planet is amazing the first time but quickly wears off its appeal the third, fourth or fifth time. Every planet although very different in look and feel, plays out all the same. Driving around in barren landscapes is only fun for so long. This is the only way to get and complete side quests. -Bugs, glitches are present. I got stuck in a wall more than a few occasions. -No official controller support. I know mods exists to correct this issue but it is not fully implemented. You can't properly use the controller in menus nor can you use it when issuing commands to your party members. ConclusionThere is plenty to love with this game and I certainly loved my time with it, however the glaring flaws holds it back from what should be a true classic.  "

Rank: 8.5/10Recommendation(s): Player is a Sci-Fi lover, enjoys RPG games, and is willing to continue gameplay series by porting results in to the later games. If using 3D Vision, use Helix Mod.Major Theme: How to define ""original"" Bioware games.Bought at Price: $35 (for Mass Effect 1 and Mass Effect 2 Deluxe)Only a few games fit into the ""must play"" listing I keep. If you have any dreams or hopes in playing the other Mass Effect games, start here. You will thank me later!Bioware is the company to know for RPG titles. The lead writer (and then co-lead writer for Mass Effect 2) ensures you have a story filled with action and content. If you ever played Knights of the Old Republic (KotOR) I or II you will feel right at home. While feeling like KotOR in some ways, Mass Effect is a more ""mature"" version of it. You should be willing to deal with (and enjoy) the extra sex, gore, and innuendo that this title brings. Stories really need to have sex, gore, and humour to make them balanced, and that's what Mass Effect's plot brings.Using the Unreal Engine from 2007, graphics are decent and shouldn't have issues running on most systems. If you have a control panel for your graphics card, you can try to force better options. That being said, there's a hidden frame rate smoothing option (60 fps), when disabled, can allow any high refresh rate monitor to shine. This can also help 3D vision players.Game is rated 3D vision ""excellent"", only real issue being that enemy icons seem 2D. This can be resolved, and overall stereoscopic 3D performance increased, by using Helix Mod. Really, Helix makes Mass Effect a treat to play with and will greatly improve immersion.It should be assumed that you do not stop with Mass Effect. There's 2 more games to explore and enjoy in the series (besides the comics, books and such). This really just sets up the plot for the rest of the series. The biggest thing that the series should be known for is it's save porting, where you are able to plug the results of a previous title into the next and change the plot.The ""romance mechanic"" is simple, as noted in my Mass Effect 2 review. This has lead to the Mass Effect romance system being called a ""getting laid simulator"". Don't be expecting to see the same mechanic from Dragon Age: Origins here. You can see my review on that title as well, if you wish for a better explanation.Reading other bonus content, the biggest thing you will feel in the game is that there's still hidden old school RPG mechanics in play. While you think you are shooting a target, your shots can in fact miss. Another will be the inventory system, where you can only hold so many items. If you do not manage your inventory, you will be forced to either ditch items, or modify the hidden limit value. Just be aware this title hasn't fully transitioned out of those older mechanics.While not in the special elite class of 90+ on the metascore, still worthwhile. I'm sick of seeing COD like games, reskined platform runners, and super simple games. I've played enough out of my Valve titles, so this game was a breath of fresh air and worked out well.			"

												This is a great game with a lot of effort gone into creating the universe in which it takes place. The gameplay is fine, pretty standard cover shooting but with the ability to use squad powers as well as your own. Overall I felt the story was pretty compelling and my second time through I had the patience and the interest to read through most of the codex and dialogue options. Missions become a little repetitive and the side quests are pretty much clones of each other even going as far as whole buildings having the same layout even if they were built lightyears apart. Overall though I was always having fun except when trying to manage the poor inventory system. If you're into your sci-fi and your shooters, this is a must.			"

												Soldiering through the repetitive, tiresome combat of the first 17 hours made the balls-tighteningly awesome finale all the more insanely epic. My struggle to be a competent player mirrored Shep's struggle to be a competent leader. We fought long and hard to make it to the climax, and oh boy was it a climax. One of the best stories in all of gaming, surpassed by its successor in usability, but not in mental anguish.			"

												What can be said about Mass Effect that hasn't already been said?Mechanically, it's a third-person shooter/RPG hybrid with interactive, choice-driven cinematics interspersed regularly.There are certainly problems with that. The conversations and cinematics wind up taking up, quite literally, most of your time--except of course the endless backtracking on the Normandy and Mako portions--and making the game feel more like a visual novel than a Western action-RPG at times. It feels more like a story and less like a game, some of the time. Most of the time, really.The RPG leveling is good, but nowhere near as good as, say, Skyrim's, or the original Deus Ex's. (I say the original because I have yet to play Human Revolution, not because I object to it in any way.) The levels you wind up focusing on are Charm and Intimidate, whose primary impact involves, you guessed it, the cinematic conversations. There's the electronics and decryption skill trees, sure (although they're more just lines than trees--for a game centered around choice-based narrative, there's not much choice-based gameplay) which allow you to access increasingly more advanced resources, but if you just bring one of your three tech-savvy squadmates and fully spec them to those trees, you can deal with any of those unlicks from about three hours in, which kind of renders the piont moot. That's good, though, because the alternative is yet more Mako scenes as you backtrack to planets you've already seen once you can access the resources on them.The shooter portion, which is the part you actually play, has fewer concrete issues. You point and shoot. It's just lackluster. The sniper rifles are unsteady in a rather blatant nod to Deus Ex--they get better as you level them. Pistols are pretty much slightly slower assault rifles. Shotguns are bizzarely effective over long ranges. Assault Rifles, which only Soldier-class characters can train, are actually quite viable for non-soldier characters, to the point where on higher difficulties the game is almost impossible if you  forget about them.The biggest issues I have are with certain enemies and level design. The Geth units which jump around the area are almost impossible to hit, especially if you haven't got a controller mod installed. There is the occasional open level where sniper rifles are viable, but a lot of the game is played at close-quarters to the enemy, which renders snipers useless. Annoying, since I like the Infiltrator class's tech abilities combines with combat proficiency, since biotics are very hard to use in this first game.But in spite of all that, Mass Effect works, mechanically speaking. Nothing is broken. I wouldn't come back to it for the gameplay, but it's not painful to play--unless you're in the Mako and trying to 100% every planet, in which case, you have my sympathies.Where Mass Effect--and Bioware in general--shine is in narrative. Mass Effect--the first game, not the trilogy--does a fantastic job of creating a setting and telling a story in it. It's a bit bland compared to its two sequels, I'll be honest. It doesn't have the thematic subtext those games do. Mass Effect 1 is nothing more than it claims to be: a story which provides you a template--Shepard--and lets you play with him or her how you choose. But that much it does incredibly well.There are few scenes in a video game that have aged as well as the first meeting with Sovereign on Virmire or the conversation with Vigil on Ilos. Despite the ridiculous texture glitch on Garrus' face, we start to get a real feel for one of the best characters in gaming in this game, and he is fun, especially when in an elevator with Tali or Wrex so they can yell at each other.The less said about elevators, the better, of course.The romances are a bit dull, I will admit. Your choices are Kaidan, Ashley, and Liara. Kaidan is bland, Ashley is xenophobic, and Liara never uses contractions because at this point Bioware still thought that was a cool way to make a character mysterious. I guess Liara's the best choice, but it's a bit like deciding which cheap shoe looks least cheap.Wow, I'm really bashing the game aren't I? Yeah, it's flawed. Really flawed. But it works. The first playthrough can be incredibly immersive. Saren is a great villain, most of the time, and a good one overall. Sovereign is truly chilling. You feel like something is at stake, by the end of the game, although it never quite reaches the emotional peaks at the last levels of Mass Effect 2 and 3.All in all, it's not a masterpiece, but it's a fun game, and one well worth a purchase, even when it's not on sale. When it is on sale, you'd be a fool not to get it.			"

												This game is the first of three games, albeit the third one isn't on Steam. It executed the plot very well, had interesting characters, and unique gameplay for both decision-making and combat. There are issues with the game, however. There's a common glitch that renders your controls useless at random (rare) times, making you have to relaunch the game. Still, I would rate this game a 7/10.Would I recommend playing it? Yes!			"

												My absolute all time favourite game. I recommend it to everyone! The Mass Effect universe is huge! You can explore different planets, save people, kill the bad guys, talk to everyone, have friends and lovers, shoot stuff, customize your weapons and armor, choose between different character classes and powers, play as Paragon (the goodie good guy) or Renegade (badass who shoots anything and everything). I love this game! I love the characters, choices I can make, missions, planets, voice acting, alien races, weapons, armor, soundtrack. I love it! I've heard that the majority of players hated Mako, but I really liked it. It was always fun to drive up steep cliffs, bounce around the planets, drive over geth. Mako always knows how to cheer me up. I was also happy about the alien buddies I got. And I will always pledge loyalty to Alliance. 11/10. Love it!			"

												Mass Effect Throwback Review	Mass Effect. What else can be said about a game that is already so highly thought of. A game where almost everything has been talked about and or said. Mass Effect is the first game in the Mass Effect series and the first game in the original Mass Effect series. You play as Commander Shepard, a human part of the Systems Alliance N7, what does that equate to? The galaxy special forces baby. At the start of the game you are given the choice to decide Commander Shepard's background. Where he or she grew up, military background, and prior service. You then get to choose what your Shepard looks like. Hair, face, eyes. All the basic RPG character design options are there, however the options are rather limited here, I felt like my male Shepard always looked almost the same no matter what I picked. After you've made your character you are thrown into your first mission on Eden Prime. 	Of course things go wrong on Eden Prime. Here we get our first taste of combat and the BioWare storytelling we've come to know. You get to chose your dialogue options and the way your character reacts to NPC statements. With each character fully voiced and modeled you get to see an interaction between your Shepard and whoever you are talking to. The options are limited to a wheel and I always felt like the option I wanted to pick was there, the option me as a person would've chosen. However, you don't always get to see a deep interaction. The conversations I had with NPCs and members of my party didn't go too deep. You get to learn about each person and a little bit of their history, how they feel about certain situations and such, but it never has a serious affect on how the character perceives you. You can say and do some nasty things, but if they are a permanent member of your ship or party they won't leave you or behave differently. You get your renegade or paragon points to align your Commander, much like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic's dark side/light side alignment, but it won't really change much. I played as a soldier class, the most basic character you can choose. You can choose to play as other classes, some skilled in electronics, biotics (magic) etc. as you go on you get to level your character with new abilities and skills, however it doesn't feel like you make an impact on how powerful you become. I found myself depending on new weapons I found, while pumping XP points into health and armor, while auto leveling up my party members. You can't make a right or wrong choice when it comes to leveling up your character.  	The combat in Mass Effect is functional at best. You get a few basic abilities from the start, depending on what class you chose when creating your character. When it comes to shooting weapons the enemies take a lot of bullets and weapons overheat quickly. Later on you can level up your character to be more proficient in certain weapon classes and upgrade weapons to reduce overheating and make them more accurate but it still feels sloppy. The sound during these encounters is rather nice, with biotic abilities going off futuristic weapons being shot around you, you get a sense that these battles mean something, the sound plays a part in making it feel tense. There is also a cover mechanic in the game, where you can walk toward a wall and just snap behind it, but it doesn't change anything about the combat. You can pop out and shoot, but cover is pretty much useless in this game.	The reason this game is great though isn't the combat. It's the story, and the world that BioWare creates. As Commander Shepard you are given the job of taking down Saren. A Turian Spectre gone rouge after Eden Prime. After coming in contact with an ancient beacon Shepard has a vision of the Reapers and Protheans. From then on your main quest is to take down Saren and along the way find out what your vision means. Who are the Protheans and what happened to the extinct race? 	After you are given Spectre status you are free to roam the galaxy and find Saren. Throughout your travels you will come across different alien species, planets, creatures, and technology which will have a codex entry you can listen to or read to tell you a bit of info about it. Each planet you reach will have flavor text and a different characteristic to it. It's size, temperature, etc. will be listed for you to see. It really makes the galaxy you are in feel alive and full of exploration. You are learning about everything and it makes you feel invested in the world they so carefully and passionately created. Every environment you come across feels new, the buildings and structures you enter feel relative to their size and have space to explore, however you won't find too many secrets or hidden areas. It's rather cut and dry where you can and cannot go. It is nice these areas are closed off because it keeps you on the path you need to be on in an already expansive world. Even looking at a map of the galaxy while the gentle music, with its twinkling notes and trance like beats, leaves you with a sense of wonder makes you feel like anything is possible.	Traversing these worlds though can be a pain. You are given a Mako on some worlds to drive around on. The Mako is a 6 wheeled vehicle with a machine gun, cannon and, thrusters to sort of jump on the planet surfaces. Driving this tank is a task. The camera is independent from the controls so going where you want to go is confusing and sometimes a chore, especially on bumpy surfaces. On the planet surfaces you will encounter enemies or different debris to collect. It's not much in variety, including the mini-game you play to collect or hack things. It's a sort of Frogger mini-game where you try to get to the center, while dodging red squares around a rotating circle. It's pretty much the same whether you are hacking or surveying minerals. It's on these planet surfaces where you can find side quests, which are either collectible missions or one-off side missions where you might rescue someone. They don't side track you too much which is very welcoming for side missions which, in other games, can sometimes take longer than you would like to complete.	Mass Effect is a well made game. This game still looks great 10 years after it came out. I played it on PC with Ultra-High graphics turned on. The frame rate held up for the most part with only a few drops either coming in or out of a cut scene. Even when there were multiple enemies on screen with particles and explosions going on the game never seemed to chug or slow down. The controls are pretty intuitive and are easy to get a grasp on. Controller support would've been a welcome sight in this game. I played this game on Steam with mouse and keyboard, which works but it was definitely built for controllers. On Steam the overlay and chat windows do not work. It is an EA game on Steam, which is also a rare sight to see. I played Mass Effect when it came out on Xbox 360 back in 2007. At first glimpse I didn't think much of it, but when I rented it for the first time, it was a game that literally made me rethink games. The storytelling, design, and world building BioWare put into this game made it one of my favorite games. It's not a game without it's faults, it definitely has those. But this is a game where you feel like your Shepard is important, without you, the entire galaxy could be flipped on it's head. It's a game where it makes the player feel like they have a purpose. Even though some of the interactions with NPCs fall flat and feel like no matter what you chose the outcome will be the same, they still make you feel like humanities last hope.	This game still holds a special place in my gaming history and in all video game history. Being the bookend of a trilogy and continuing story arc, Mass Effect does a great job as a launching point. It's a game that most people will appreciate and enjoy. I will always enjoy Mass Effect, I just hope that reporter I punch			"

												I Should Go......Are the words that I occasionally see on the faces of people whom I introduce Mass Effect to. Naturally, it's a given response, since this game is a far cry from what many are used to on both the RPG and Shooting front. I remember almost throwing this game into the recycling bin while I had the PS3 version, since I couldn't figure out how to zoom out on the galaxy map (my fault entirely for forgetting that the circle button exists).Sure, the game does present a few faults here and there, such as the awkward shooting/cover mechanics, absurdly long cooldown times for powers, optional yet completely barren side missions, limited auto-save points, [some] overpowered enemy biotics as well as a few other caveats that I won't go into detail here, which can completely cripple someone's interest in Mass Effect. A sad thing, since the feeling of carrying over your complete save to Mass Effect 2 is unparalleled on so many levels. Bioware has always been a dominant forefront for the story driven rpg market, and Mass Effect is no exception. Thus, enjoyment as a whole can be severely limited if the player refrains from making a personal investment in the overall lore, story and characters. And yes, Mass Effect goes above and beyond in providing all three, while also establishing an atmosphere of its own, which makes it stand out heavily among all the other space games on the market. Top-tier Canadian science fiction everybody!Many of the choices you make in this game will impact you later, especially when carrying over your saves to the next two games. Who you save, what you say, when you choose to do missions, which path you follow, undoubtedly adds a lot of ""Mass"" to the ""Effect"" of your decisions, and definitely adds weight to what happens later in the first game alone. Plus, the PC port is outstanding, enabling you to use most, if not all of your powers during combat in real time, rather than always opening the power wheel on the console versions. Equipment management and gun modding is also much more direct/less in your face due to the redesigned menu system. The new hacking minigames are also a nice touch as well. It's almost as if PC was Bioware's most prioritized platform from the get-go. Definitely better than the delayed PS3 version, which encountered many lip-sync errors, missing textures and frame rate issues. Also didn't help that it always took 12 seconds to save, where the PC port only requires half a second, with the addition of a very handy quick save button.You'll need to install a few mods and edit the .ini files though if you wish to remove some small hitches, but that can be accomplished easily through the many worthwhile guides for this game (I'd recommend uncapping the game's framerate and installing MEUITM, which allows you to run the game higher than 720p and upscales a lot of old textures). It's not necessary, but the experience is undoubtedly more rewarding with those fixes.I won't go into detail on any of the main story points and characters, since I wish for anyone reading this review who doesn't own the game yet to find out for themselves. Sure, Mass Effect isn't for everybody, and it might seem underwhelming at first for many Star Wars/Doctor Who enthusiasts out there, but the series as a whole quickly makes a name for itself if you give it time, especially if you make it to the third game, and the eventual fourth if you love the series that much : )			"

The Mako is a 6 wheeled vehicle with a machine gun, cannon and, thrusters to sort of jump on the planet surfaces. Driving this tank is a task. The camera is independent from the controls so going where you want to go is confusing and sometimes a chore, especially on bumpy surfaces. On the planet surfaces you will encounter enemies or different debris to collect. It's not much in variety, including the mini-game you play to collect or hack things. It's a sort of Frogger mini-game where you try to get to the center, while dodging red squares around a rotating circle. It's pretty much the same whether you are hacking or surveying minerals. It's on these planet surfaces where you can find side quests, which are either collectible missions or one-off side missions where you might rescue someone. They don't side track you too much which is very welcoming for side missions which, in other games, can sometimes take longer than you would like to complete.	Mass Effect is a well made game. This game still looks great 10 years after it came out. I played it on PC with Ultra-High graphics turned on. The frame rate held up for the most part with only a few drops either coming in or out of a cut scene. Even when there were multiple enemies on screen with particles and explosions going on the game never seemed to chug or slow down. The controls are pretty intuitive and are easy to get a grasp on. Controller support would've been a welcome sight in this game. I played this game on Steam with mouse and keyboard, which works but it was definitely built for controllers. On Steam the overlay and chat windows do not work. It is an EA game on Steam, which is also a rare sight to see. I played Mass Effect when it came out on Xbox 360 back in 2007. At first glimpse I didn't think much of it, but when I rented it for the first time, it was a game that literally made me rethink games. The storytelling, design, and world building BioWare put into this game made it one of my favorite games. It's not a game without it's faults, it definitely has those. But this is a game where you feel like your Shepard is important, without you, the entire galaxy could be flipped on it's head. It's a game where it makes the player feel like they have a purpose. Even though some of the interactions with NPCs fall flat and feel like no matter what you chose the outcome will be the same, they still make you feel like humanities last hope.	This game still holds a special place in my gaming history and in all video game history. Being the bookend of a trilogy and continuing story arc, Mass Effect does a great job as a launching point. It's a game that most people will appreciate and enjoy. I will always enjoy Mass Effect, I just hope that reporter I punch			"

												My absolute all time favourite game. I recommend it to everyone! The Mass Effect universe is huge! You can explore different planets, save people, kill the bad guys, talk to everyone, have friends and lovers, shoot stuff, customize your weapons and armor, choose between different character classes and powers, play as Paragon (the goodie good guy) or Renegade (badass who shoots anything and everything). I love this game! I love the characters, choices I can make, missions, planets, voice acting, alien races, weapons, armor, soundtrack. I love it! I've heard that the majority of players hated Mako, but I really liked it. It was always fun to drive up steep cliffs, bounce around the planets, drive over geth. Mako always knows how to cheer me up. I was also happy about the alien buddies I got. And I will always pledge loyalty to Alliance. 11/10. Love it!			"

												I Should Go......Are the words that I occasionally see on the faces of people whom I introduce Mass Effect to. Naturally, it's a given response, since this game is a far cry from what many are used to on both the RPG and Shooting front. I remember almost throwing this game into the recycling bin while I had the PS3 version, since I couldn't figure out how to zoom out on the galaxy map (my fault entirely for forgetting that the circle button exists).Sure, the game does present a few faults here and there, such as the awkward shooting/cover mechanics, absurdly long cooldown times for powers, optional yet completely barren side missions, limited auto-save points, [some] overpowered enemy biotics as well as a few other caveats that I won't go into detail here, which can completely cripple someone's interest in Mass Effect. A sad thing, since the feeling of carrying over your complete save to Mass Effect 2 is unparalleled on so many levels. Bioware has always been a dominant forefront for the story driven rpg market, and Mass Effect is no exception. Thus, enjoyment as a whole can be severely limited if the player refrains from making a personal investment in the overall lore, story and characters. And yes, Mass Effect goes above and beyond in providing all three, while also establishing an atmosphere of its own, which makes it stand out heavily among all the other space games on the market. Top-tier Canadian science fiction everybody!Many of the choices you make in this game will impact you later, especially when carrying over your saves to the next two games. Who you save, what you say, when you choose to do missions, which path you follow, undoubtedly adds a lot of ""Mass"" to the ""Effect"" of your decisions, and definitely adds weight to what happens later in the first game alone. Plus, the PC port is outstanding, enabling you to use most, if not all of your powers during combat in real time, rather than always opening the power wheel on the console versions. Equipment management and gun modding is also much more direct/less in your face due to the redesigned menu system. The new hacking minigames are also a nice touch as well. It's almost as if PC was Bioware's most prioritized platform from the get-go. Definitely better than the delayed PS3 version, which encountered many lip-sync errors, missing textures and frame rate issues. Also didn't help that it always took 12 seconds to save, where the PC port only requires half a second, with the addition of a very handy quick save button.You'll need to install a few mods and edit the .ini files though if you wish to remove some small hitches, but that can be accomplished easily through the many worthwhile guides for this game (I'd recommend uncapping the game's framerate and installing MEUITM, which allows you to run the game higher than 720p and upscales a lot of old textures). It's not necessary, but the experience is undoubtedly more rewarding with those fixes.I won't go into detail on any of the main story points and characters, since I wish for anyone reading this review who doesn't own the game yet to find out for themselves. Sure, Mass Effect isn't for everybody, and it might seem underwhelming at first for many Star Wars/Doctor Who enthusiasts out there, but the series as a whole quickly makes a name for itself if you give it time, especially if you make it to the third game, and the eventual fourth if you love the series that much : )			"

												You know it, you love it, it's Mass Effect!  Have you ever wanted to be immersed in a believable, complex, engrossing science fiction tale that brings humanity into a galactic forum of sentient species from across the galaxy as they attempt to tackle an unknown nefarious threat?Well? Have you? Of course you have!  What are you waiting for!   This game is...less polished than it could've been.  But if you get past the somewhat...lackluster FPS aspects, and focus more on the RPG-like progression of powerful abilities and the story driven aspects...there's nothing not to love.Also, Jennifer Hale's voice acting as Femme-Shep is exquisitely charged with passion and verve!  Strong female protagonist, if you choose for Shepherd to be female.   I, frankly, found the male voice actor to be neutral in his emotions too often.  I don't believe he threw himself into the role as much.Jennifer Hale sounds like she's the hero who held off a Batarian raid of a human colony single-handedly and against all odds.Anyway, I digress.  If you have the money to burn, and want a good story, this is one of the best in sci-fi. (Mass Effect 3's ending being the only highly-contested part of that statement.)The Normandy isn't going to command itself...			"

												The whole series is my favorite!!! I always recommend to play the first one because if you start on the 2nd or 3rd...you won't wanna come back to this one because of the quality. They did some major improvements to this series and the story is beautiful! Cannot wait for ME4!!! I will say one thing for the first Mass Effect thats annoying is the glitch in the snow biome quest when all the characters and enemies become pixilated black so its hard to try to kill them but I managed to get through it twice and it goes away once youre out of that mission. They never fixed that glitch though. -sigh- Oh well, still a great game!!! ^-^			"

												One of the great RPGs of our time. Mass Effect excells in storytelling and characterization in ways that no other game has. This particular title is most memorable (for me personally) because of the way it introduces and develops the characters in such a fashion that the player truly cares about their fate and building relationships with each and every one.Mass Effect also has solid shooter mechanics. I actually prefer the overheating weapons over the thermal clips from the later games. I also enjoy the combat storm and the way it is incorporated into the strengths and weaknesses of any particular character build. The abilites and leveling are also extremely well executed. I personally found it so rewarding and satisfying that I achieved level 60, but regardless the leveling system successfully helps to add reward during a playthrough.Again, however, what makes Mass Effect such an amazing game is its characters and story progression. To avoid spoilers, I will just say that by the time I was nearing the end of the main story for the first time, I was deeply invested in each individual character's story and that is something that I cannot say about almost any other game experience.Mass Effect exemplifies the great strengths of BioWare in its prime and will forever be a gold standard to which I will compare future titles to.

Really good story a good start to series and still stands up well as an older game.For me its not the most indepth game character wise from Bioware. I did really like the characters and story but it just didnt feel as indepth as Dragon Age.  Its still a really good game well worth playing and Mass Effect 2 is supposed to be amazing. It feels a little slower paced which I dont mind. The side missions some just seem dull and pointless but some of the rewards are pretty cool and do make it worth your while. The character missions I always like to do as I like to get to know the characters but all in all I just wanted to get on with the story which is a shame because theres a galaxy to explore.The characters were cool but it seemed most of it was set up to make you have a relationship with someone. I mean it didnt seem to matter what i said to one of the characters something was gonna happen lol.Still a cool game though.			"

												Not quite the full kilo MASS EFFECT is a mixed bag of a game: everything about it is good in some ways but not in others. The most notable achievement perhaps is the rich storyline and detailed universe created by the developers (there is plenty to read here -- I started by reading every word but confess to scanning some texts as the game progressed). The graphics are good in parts but not in others (I know this game came out in 2007 but then so did Crysis). The voice acting is overall pretty good and there are plenty of branches to the dialogue trees. And this is where MASS EFFECT’s strengths lie: in the role playing aspects of the game. You’re given the opportunity to be the good guy or the not so good guy, depending on how you wish to play. Less successful is the combat, which, for the most part, failed to engage. Also the side missions are very repetitive and dull. The vehicle you get to drive on numerous occasions bounces around like a drunken bouncy thing, and there are endless elevators that take too long to ascend or descend. Oh, and the UI for selecting skills, weapons etc. is needlessly complex. Overall MASS EFFECT is worth playing but the whole experience is oddly detached and vaguely unsatisfying. I have MASS EFFECT 2 also. I understand it’s much improved on the first.3/5			"

												Bioware once again creates an epic RPG! The strength of Mass Effect lies in its narrative that is supplemented by the in-game Codex which painstakingly lays out the future history of Earth, technology and the various alien races. The gameplay involves simple shoot ‘n cover tactics followed by lengthy sessions of exploration and character dialogue. Compared to its sequel and other RPGs, Mass Effect can become a bit tedious when you choose to explore the various planets and again so when it comes to upgrading and managing your equipment. However, these mishaps are easily overshadowed by the game’s plot that will leave sci-fi & RPG fans craving for more of the universe. There are two DLC packs available for Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky (FREE upon registering) and Pinnacle Station ($5, not worth it).			"

												The Mass Effect series is the greatest work of entertainment I have ever experienced. Sometimes memories of the game come flooding back to me in a way that can only be compared to the nostalgia of summer camp or late night bike rides with neighbood friends as a child. There is an uncomfortable poignance in knowing that none of it actually happened, the friends you made don't actually exsist, and perhaps the harshest truth: there are only a few real-life memories I wouldn't trade for Mass Effect.

												Bioware once again creates an epic RPG! The strength of Mass Effect lies in its narrative that is supplemented by the in-game Codex which painstakingly lays out the future history of Earth, technology and the various alien races. The gameplay involves simple shoot ‘n cover tactics followed by lengthy sessions of exploration and character dialogue. Compared to its sequel and other RPGs, Mass Effect can become a bit tedious when you choose to explore the various planets and again so when it comes to upgrading and managing your equipment. However, these mishaps are easily overshadowed by the game’s plot that will leave sci-fi & RPG fans craving for more of the universe. There are two DLC packs available for Mass Effect: Bring Down the Sky (FREE upon registering) and Pinnacle Station ($5, not worth it).			"

												Mass Effect begins one of the most customisable, action-oriented stories in the Sci-Fi genre. One of the best depictions of intergalactic civilisation, the worlds of Mass Effect will pull you in and keep you hooked. The PC gameplay is surprisingly smooth and intuitive, in my opinion much easier than the console version.A truly great game with a vibrant storyline and great characters. The combat system is intuitive with ammo replaced with cooldown mechanics on all weapons, set to varying levels and a squad command interface that works well.			"

												I'd heard a lot of good things in general about the Mass Effect series, but I had never played it until recently. The first chapter did not disappoint. I enjoyed the balance between Paragon and Renegade, or perhaps no balance at all if you chose only one sort of action. I thought the interplay between humans and the alien races was really well done and believable, despite this obviously being a sci-fi fantasy game. Bioware delivers a rich story with believable characters, a solid start to the franchise.			"

												The beginning of an epic space opera, Mass Effect manages to deliver a compelling setting as well as a very interesting narrative. With a strong lore beyond its years, few games can compare with such a fully realized title.

												While players looking for some fast-paced action may find themselves disappointed by the slow-paced combat and prolific weapon/armor customization, those who are willing to or enjoy slower paced combat reminiscient of TES IV with guns and biotics will find an excellent hybrid of storytelling and exploration, drawing on classical sci-fi elements in the gameplay and soundtrack and wandering through a future in which interspecies racism is subtly juxtaposed against modern-day race relations, as well as equally interesting themes on cooperative, as opposed to competitive, progress.

												The early parts of the game can be a bit slow (action-wise), and the learning curve for the non-soldier classes can be a little steep. However, the story is gripping (especially the first time through), and the voice acting is excellent.The combat is not as polished as other shooters, but is still fun, and only a component of the total experience. There is potential for replay value, too, with different classes to play, and different decisions to make.Overall, it is an excellent game. It is especially worth playing if you want to play the entire trilogy, because you can transfer your character from game to game.			"

												The Mass Effect trilogy is with out a doubt my favourite, as few games have captivated me in such a scale as these ones. This particular game is the first in the trilogy(obviously) and in many ways what got me into the rpg-genre of gaming. I wasn't a fan of this genre beforehand and for me to get my hands on this game was actually a happy mistake. I got to randomly try out the demo and have never looked back since. The greatest strengts of this game is its grand, epic and interesting story, both ingame and lorewise. Bioware(developer) is also known to craft some of the finest characters/companions around, which makes the whole experience that more awesome. You care about them and want to get to know them better for their great diversity, flaws or stengths. Some of the gameplay may be a bit rusty (It came out in 2007) but if you're in for the story and lore you will not get dissapointed. The sequels will greatly expand on the gameplay, as will your choices. Remember, the Mass Effect saga is currently over 3 games and choices made in the first game will haunt you in the second or third installment.			"

I keep revisiting Chora's Den to watch the women in latex.No, seriously.The game's amazing.If you play this right after playing Counter Strike, you might get a little frustrated, what with all the character's skill tree and all those decisions and side quests.But that's what makes the game a great RPG.I came here straight from Dragon Age: Origins, and while this game is nothing like that, it's definitely worth buying when not on sale.I mean, think.For a few bucks you could have had a game with stunning visuals(for it's time) hi-tech weapory, space exploration, plenty of decisions that actually affect the game and a spaceship of your own.Did I mention that you have your very own monster truck?The dialogue and storyline's amazing.And there are funny moments, like where a thug argues with an AI, and even goes as far as to threaten it.You obviously have multiple squad members, whom you can change if you wish.I keep Ashley cause she's hot. :PI'm 10 hours in, and I'm nowhere near the end of the game because I'm doing 100% of the side quests and exploration.I'd advise you to do the same.Oh, and Mass Effect 2 is free for a while on Origin, if you're interested!Cheers.

												This game is absolutely brilliant. I didn't realize how much better the first game is ME2 and ME3, until i started replaying ME1 the other day. Grand nostalgia started kicking in and the epicness of this game is on a scale unmatched by any other space game. The level-up system is fleshed out, the characters are fleshed out, decisions have big impacts and the combat is tactical, difficult and awesome. Also, the inventory I happen to like quite a bit, when most people hate it. But thanks to so many people hating it, BioWare completely got rid of it and stripped the game of it's other most important RPG elements for ME2 and ME3. Mass Effect 1 is to ME2 and ME3 what Dragon Age Origins is to Dragon Age 2. The first game of both series' were epic beyond the likes of any other game in it's genre and had so much content it kept you wide-eyed and fully entrapped by it's charm. While the sequels were just stripped down of the best features they once had. Though I have to say that ME2 is still a pretty entertaining and fun game, but didn't do justice to the original.To say the least, if you enjoy space games or RPGs, then this game is a must and you'll probably love it. Admittedly it does take a few hours to really get into the game and the tactical combat takes some getting used to, but it's great fun once you learn. That's all good in my opinion. I enjoy having to learn a  game rather than being thrown into it and it being the same as every other game in it's genre. This game will take you on one of the most memorable journeys you've ever been on in gaming and it will captivate you the entire way through, from the grand music, to the tactical combat, to the storytelling, etc.On a side not, a lot of people also didn't like exploring planets with the Mako, but I think that's one of the best parts. It's fun discovering materials/items and uncovering the secrets of some planets and completing quests on others. Again, if you like space, this game is definitely for you.			"

												Mass Effect 3 was my first Mass Effect game to play when it came out a while back; however, I decided to give the whole triolgy a new start after I bought the first two as a bundle during some Steam sale. I didn't quite remember all the details from ME3, which was good, but I knew enough about the Mass Effect world to where I wasn't completely lost. With that said, finally figuring out all the backstory and references made in ME3 was amazing. Story-wise, the Mass Effect universe is on par with Star Wars and Star Trek. The charaters are developed extremely well, with well thought out insight in each different species. The dialogue and choices are superb. At the end of the day, when you finally save and exit the game, you feel as if you were part of the action. Part of Commander Shepard's odyssey. Going back to reality was always a bummer. Combat-wise the controls were a little loose. Then again, this game is about 7 years old at this point. You get use to the controls, but do not expect very responsive actions and features that most games have today. Most of the side quests (assignments) felt like chores at the end, but I still wanted to get them all done to explore the awesome ME universe. Customization is also not as well-developed as the sequels are. Many times I get stuck with a Shepard wearing a ridiculous looking armour but the stats on it are amazing so I couldn't argue. The decision making (Paragon/Renegade) also provides unique story, meticulous and sometimes stressful choices, and good replayability, even if much of the story is progressively linear. In the end, I can understand why Mass Effect is so popular. The universe draws you in and the gripping story, dialogue, and action make you want to play this game until you have played it 3+ times, exhausting all the different dialogue choices, actions, and play styles you can make in the game. Worth the money. Worth the time. You will regret nothing besides some of the grueling choices you have to make along the way to save the galaxy. But that's what makes this game, this series, perfect.			"

												This game is just so fantastic. If you like star wars, its also a must buy. In Mass Effect, you decide how your character reacts to things, you decide on what orders to issue to your squad, but most of all, you decide the fate of the entire galaxy. Exploration and learning is good fun. Cover and heat sytems work well and smoothly. The Mako vehicle drives alright up until the last mission you use it, then its just a mess. Atmosphere is great. Finding that gun that has one more roman numeral than yours has a great feeling swapping them out realizing your Shepard made a noticable improvement. The few spread out boss battles are a nice challenge. Your going to need to quick save a lot as the actual saves are quite distant. Its an interesting take on the universe as humanity is just being introduced to an already well established galactic democracy. It's also been awhile since ive been so excited for such a great and fitting cinematic end.			"

												Wow! I was a bit late to the Mass Effect game, and I had allways heard about it, so cyber monday of 2016 I bought it. It was worth every cent I paid, and more. The storyline was incredible, with alot of suprises and plot twists, that I didn't see coming. I love the large amounts of chat dialogs you have for each converstation, and how each choice effects the game later down the road. The Combat system was great, my only con was that when facing bioitcs, you can sometimes get thrown into a wall or other place to get stuck, but thats an easy fix. I have never been so impressed with a game and the storyline. Looking forward to finish all of the side quests, and importing my game to Mass Effect 2, to continue the story!! I highly recommed this game to anyone who likes a good story game!!!!			"

												A fantastic space rpg with a very interesting universe and story. The game gives you a good deal of customization and has great character interaction. However, the combat is pretty mediocre third person shooter combat for the most part. The vehicle sections can also be quite awkward especially when you are playing the game for the first time. Despite these issues, the shooting is still somewhat satisfying and the game gives you a variety of abilities and weapon addons that make the combat much more interesting. You can get cryo ammo to freeze your enemy, or biotic power that allow you to through your enemies. You also have a good deal of control over you squad which adds a bit more depth to the combat.8/10			"

												It's pretty good. I like it. Pros: +Overall, characters are well-written, well-rounded characters you come to love and love to hate. +Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale both do an excellent job voicing Shepard. +High degree of character customization.+Can be anyone from Space Jesus to Genocidal Maniac.+Has a sense of humor without becoming a borderline parody of itself like certain later Bioware games.Cons:-Glitch makes PC textures permanently low res. Unless you mod the game, it looks like your monitor threw up.-Can't ♥♥♥♥ Tali or Garrus until ME2. -I hate the Asari and so should you. -Your human squadmates are a bit bland and kind of ♥♥♥♥. Garrus gives off more of a ""relatable everyman best friend"" vibe than they do and he's a birdman from space. -Ain't nobody gonna play any class but Soldier. Seriously. All the weapons, all the health, all the armor. IIRC, they ran the stats and over 80% of people picked Soldier. That's not what you call indicitive of good class balance.-Vehicle controls are ♥♥♥. -Explicitly labeling your choices ""Paragon"" and ""Renegade"" (ie: Goody-two shoes and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) robs game of moral nuance. -Planetary exploration handled in a fairly dull manner.Overall, I would say this game has mediocre gameplay, a pretty decent, albiet somewhat generic plot and very well written characters. In terms of mechanics, it is a C+ RPG and a C+ third person shooter bolted together. However, as a work of interactive fiction, it is well worth playing. I would recommend this game to anyone who would enjoy a good old fashioned space opera romp first and foremost. I would not recommend this game to people who were considering buying this game because they thought it would be either a good dedicated sci-fi shooter like Gears of War or Halo or an old-school Bioware RPG like Baldur's Gate or Dragon Age: Origins.

												This game was absolutely amazing. I've never cared so little about the combat and so much about the story than I did in this game. I would completley blow off missions just to talk to people and try to immerse myself into the world. This game is how an RPG should be and I will definitely be playing the other 2. 10/10			"

												And it begins! This game is incredible. I played this game close to 7 years after its release and it's still amazing. This game is perfect. The story is absolutely engrossing and something you can submerge yourself into, it's like a modern day Star Wars. The characters in this game are so well developed, the grow on you to the point you'll always consider them life long friends. This is an action RPG and the game lives up to that classification. The action is just as riveting as the decisions you'll need to make over the course of the game. Never before has a game put me on the edge of my seat, regarding the consequences of choices I've made. I love the freedom this game offers. The tension builds and builds as you reach the climax. The game play is intuitive and an enjoyable experience. As you build your characters skillsets, you experience such a natural incline of abilites and you can lots of options to build a character with combat skills suited to your preferences. This is game you'll remember. Interested in Mass Effect 2 or 3? Not sure if you'll enjoy Mass Effect because it's almost a decade old? Buy this game, you will not be dissapointed. Not only will it enrich your experience for Mass Effect 2 and 3, it's just downright a great game. You'll soon realize the more Mass Effect in your life, the better. Hell, I even suffered through playing Mass Effect 3 on origin....that's how great this game is!			"

												A fantastic space rpg with a very interesting universe and story. The game gives you a good deal of customization and has great character interaction. However, the combat is pretty mediocre third person shooter combat for the most part. The vehicle sections can also be quite awkward especially when you are playing the game for the first time. Despite these issues, the shooting is still somewhat satisfying and the game gives you a variety of abilities and weapon addons that make the combat much more interesting. You can get cryo ammo to freeze your enemy, or biotic power that allow you to through your enemies. You also have a good deal of control over you squad which adds a bit more depth to the combat.8/10			"

												While perhaps not worth the hype the series has generated over the years, this game is still very good. I really enjoyed the story, and the way it progressed really impressed me. The supporting cast aren't that great (something they improved in Mass Effect 2, sadly with the loss of the great story) but the fact that Shepard develops how you want him to while still remaining an interesting character is no mean feat.It is quite annoying that some conversations that give you options just ignore your choices and just go straight into what the game wants, and I guess it would be tough to make a game which allowed all that but then making games is tough. So I would've liked more freedom to do what I wanted rather than just what the game dictated. Nobody likes a game pretending you have a choice and then just ignoring it. That's just not cool.The combat is perfectly acceptable. I heartily recommend going with the combat-biotic fusion character as then you get the most fun out of your character while still remaining a heavy hitter with weapons. The squad-part of combat is really not at all important, as your squad is not all that effective and they can just about handle themselves. I'm quite glad that they did that though, as I prefer having a squad that does their own thing. They could have made them slightly more clever however. Overall, a very good game with a few drawbacks. Not a brilliant game, but a very good game nonetheless.			"

												I am a child of divorce. When this game came out, I was angry at the world. This game saved me from insanity. It was my safe place. I had never played anything so immersive, anything that made me forget all the ♥♥♥♥ in my world like this did. Mass Effect will always be my favorite game. A beautiful story filled with some of the best sci-fi, and most memorable characters ever to be played. My life was different after Mass Effect. I could nitpick over flaws in gameplay, and the occassional bugginess that comes with any bioware game, but it pales in comparison to all the amazing things this game has to offer. If the idea of it at all interests you, buy it. You won't regret it. Sincerely, fan boy			"

												Mass Effect is one of the first games I've played with multiple different branching storylines... which are actually followed up across future franchise editions. Many games with multiple endings, with a sequel, just assume a given ending. With Mass Effect, the choices you make... matter.Mass Effect 1 is good for a rich storyline. It has some flaws, as in the Mako missions where you have to drive up the side of a hill almost sideways, and gravity is very unrealistic. But, for the most part... it is a fun enough game to play. Most games average around 50-60 hours (as in Final Fantasy)... I spent a little over 120 hours on Mass Effect 1 playing the ""Paragon"" male version and ""Renegade"" female version.			"

												I actually spent 20 hours in this game in the last 4 days in Steam offline mode, so ignore Steam playtime.Mass Effect was a pleasant surprise for me, because of two reasons: I'm not a fan of space opera and sci-fi, and I couldn't get into one of Bioware's well known title - Dragon Age: Origins. But screw them, let's talk about Mass Effect. The game has messy inventory system, clunky animations, pretty straightforward weapon upgrades and doesn't allow progressing after finishing the main story, aaaaaaand... that's it, that's all my criticism for ME. What can I say more about it? Mass Effect is a well-crafted game from head to toe, with nearly all aspects perfected.First, I freaking love the narrative. In the first 30 minutes, I thought it was some typical pretentious sci-fi piece of ♥♥♥♥ that overcomplicates everything, but nope, the story really hooked me in, even it was just a standard good-vs-evil story filled with cliches. I can't tell exactly what I love about ME's story, but it gave me a sense of real progression, and pushed me forward through each events in the game. Sometime intense, sometime emotional and sometime even silly (especially in romance subplots), and of course it doesn't lack ""epicness"" for a sci-fi saga.Next, the dialogues. There's no such thing as illusive choices. In ME, every choice matters, and not all decisions lead to a good end.  I still feel bad because I accidentally shot Wrax on Virmire, had to replay that section. Tip: Spend your points in Charisma or Intimidate, they're very important, don't ignore them.Teammates. Uhuh, this is not your standard companions, your squad mates are TRUE human (or alien) beings with their own unique personality. You know what? I found it more interesting to wandering around the Normandy, talking to my squad mates, rather than exploring the galaxy. And I've never, ever, felt so much difficult in deciding between 2 squad mates' fates. There was no game that made me care so much about my team mates like Mass Effect. Why? Because ♥♥♥♥ you Bioware, you created some of the most memorable and well-developed side characters in any game I've ever played. If I don't see Garrus, Wrex, Liara or Tali in the sequels, many tables will be flipped.Gunplay hasn't aged well, but it's certainly enjoyable. Tons of weapons, upgrades and special biotic abilities. You don't need to be a strategist to play the game, but it certainly helps if you can order your squad mates to assist you on the battlefield.Aargh. why, why did I spend the last 7 years without giving a damn about Mass Effect? Why didn't I know about it sooner? Why did I pass on this masterpiece? And why does Garrus's face look low-textured? Anyway, Mass Effect, 10 ♥♥♥♥ing out of 10, heavily recommended. If you are a fan of RPG or sci-fi, play it already. If you don't give a crap about RPG or sci-fi, then still give it a try, because you might like it as much as I do.			"

												I had been pushing this game aside for years till Mass Effect 2 came along and I wanted to play this game to see what all the fuss was about. I am mainly a FPS gamer, I have steered clear of most RPG games since I knew that they were addictive and took a huge chunk of time to finish. What I didn’t realize back then was the man-hours and creativity that goes into making these games. So Mass Effect was my introduction to the world of RPGs. This was also the first BioWare game I’ve ever played and I’m glad I took the plunge. I played the Mass Effect Trilogy on my PS3 so this review is based on the PS3 version though I'm planning to play this trilogy again on PC now. Before that I wanted to write my first ever review for a game on Steam. I hope you'll like it.Who’ll love this game:Do you like feeling all powerful?Do you like to feel that your every decision will have overreaching and cascading effects through time and on other lives?Do you like to be a galactic hero who has a reputation for saving millions of lives?Do you like to fight an alien race that’s so old and powerful that they don’t even consider you worthy of attention like an insect?If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then you’ve picked the right game.The Story:The story is set in a Universe where we have a galactic government and humanity is among the newest species to be inducted into it. Spectres are among the elite who possess great power vested onto them by the government. They can take decisions independently and they even have a license to kill without fear of any repercussions. So as it happens one of these Spectres, Saren has just gone rogue and he is travelling the universe collecting Prothean artefacts which are extremely advanced for their time and these artifacts actually pave the way for the developed, modern technological era. Protheans are an ancient species that have long gone extinct centuries before our story even starts.The scope of this story is wide reaching and feels daunting at first and makes you realize how high the stakes are. The way the story twists and turns and reaches its shocking ending is brilliant. There’s always something interesting to do and your choices change the course of the story. As the game progresses you have to make harder choices with major consequences. Every decision feels personal and when you mess up it’s heartbreaking. That’s how strongly this story sucks you in.The Dialogue:The dialogues in this game are a little rigid and robotic. I think this is the only minor gripe I have in what is otherwise an excellent game. The conversations don’t sound natural. Probably this is the writer’s idea of how a space faring species speaks.The Characters:Captain Shepherd is the first human Spectre. You can either choose to play as the Male Shepherd or Fem Shepherd. You can even choose his backstory. He/She has a tragic backstroy but is a bonafide badass with a reputation that precedes him. Over the course of the game you meet your team members: Garrus Vakarian, Kaidan Alenko, Ashley Williams, Tali'Zorah nar Rayya, Liara T'Soni and Urdnot Wrex. They join your team for various reasons and each of them has a compelling reason to join your team. These are well rounded and memorable character. It’s fun to converse with them and get to know more about them between missions and you can also romance (have sex with) some of these team members. Incase you were wondering I did Liara T’Soni and Ashley on my two play-through sessions. I played a Fem Shepherd on both and Liara is a darling.Villains are aplenty in this game and there’s a lot of variety to the kind of villains that we get to face during the course of this game. Geth, Husks, Asari, Humans, Turians and Colossus Geth etc. Each one of these requires a different strategy to tackle if you want to get past them with minimal damage. After the final reveal we face an enemy that’s just phenomenal in scale.Weapons Inventory System:As a FPS gamer I am quite accustomed to “loadouts” but inventory management is something I seldom come across in FPS games and this was a steep learning curve for me as a starter on RPG. This game has a very deep inventory system where you get to choose which one of the weapons or abilities of the team members you’d like to improve. I think this was the most tedious part of the gameplay (besides Mako which I’ll get into later). I’d just say that I would prefer to spend much less time on inventory management and more time in actually playing the game. So sometimes it can be frustrating (they fixed it in Mass Effect 2). However, it should be remembered that this is a very important feature that helps in tackling stronger enemies as the game progresses.Vehicle Controls:Oh! Why? Why do I have to drive the Mako through so many terrains? Mako is a multi-terrain vehicle which is mostly helpful during some assignments on uncharted planets. Some of the levels with Mako are definitely worth playing over and over again however, my problem is with Mako itself. If you have played this game already you’d know that the controls for this thing are probably the biggest problem this game has. It seems like Mako has a mind of its own sometimes. Except for the Mako most of the controls are pretty solid in this game. Missions:You get to go on a boatload of assignments in this game. Apart from the story based missions you also get the secondary missions which may sometimes feel repetitive. However, playing these missions help in exploring some vital elements which are required to help you level up faster. In that way these are a necessary evil. I’d recommend playing all of these secondary missions.Soundtrack:Jack Wall delivers one of the most thoughtful soundtracks for a game. The soundtrack amplifies several scenes in this game and it feels like an integral part of these scenes. It sets the mood and atmsphere with the extensive synth use which feels futuristic even if it should like it belonged in the 80s. This is a great game and a game of this caliber deserved a great soundtrack and that’s just what it is. Conclusion:Mass Effect boasts of a great story that’s built around great characters and (for the most part) great gameplay. But by no means is this game easily conquered. You may have to spend atleast 40-50 hours in order to finish this game and that makes me think how hard it must have been for the game designers to create such an expansive world. The voice acting and visuals in this game deserve high praise and they actually account for the strongest visceral impact of this game. I’ve played this game twice in both Paragon and Renegade playstyles, so that’s about over 100 hours of game time and it was totally worth it. Even today there are few games out there that are this immersive. Every time I play this game, I feel like I’m really Captain Shepherd and that’s a testament to how strongly you get attached to this world and the characters. One thing is for certain, once you enter this world you'll never forget it.			"

Being able to move your game form one game to the other is an amazing concept. I was so excited to start mass effect 2 with my choices formthe first game. Also because I love choices based video games where your choices actually have a drastic impact on your game. By the end of the game (no spoilers, promise) there will choices which will change the rest of your experience which I hesitated a lot but this is what I love about it too.			"

												Very good game. it has story and a lot of plot. Somehow asari reminds me of polish women. I guess, because their round face. But somehow you're getting totally atracted to those women (or species, because they don't have gender, should I say they're mono-gender). First impression was like it will be just bunch of conversation and little action, but later in the game the amounts of action, interaction and exploration are getting equal parts. the little thing, that bothered me, is that after finishing main quest, game ends. That made me really sad, because it left a lot of unfinished side quests. Better to have multiple saves, to have a possibility to start somewhere, where you can do some side quests. All in all, that's  a good game.			"

 A milestone in RPG history. Simply put, Mass Effect is a masterpiece of storytelling. I cant tell you how many times I've replayed this game, and still find new things. Characters you wish were real are all about you as you take on the role as the titular Commander Shepard.Music and gameplay are great to. Shooting mechanics are a little bit ropey but I never any issues with it.If you've never played any of the Mass Effect games, get in on the ground floor and play the original first. I stand as one of the few who actually enjoys the first one just as much as the second, which some call the best RPG of all time. There is simply no reason for anyone to miss out on this game. 10/10!   "

												Outstanding Western Rpg from Bioware, Mass Effect has it all, a compelling story, great gameplay and likeable characters that grow on you more and more. Story wise, Mass Effect isn't the best from the Bioware catalogue as I would consider Knights of the Old Republic to be the King there, however that doesn't undermine the fact that Bioware has crafted an original plot without straying too close to Star Wars.  I preferred the gameplay in Mass Effect over KOTOR as the blend of the third person shooter mixed with the rpg elements was a nice touch and I feel Mass Effect is more replayable as a result. There are many ways to build a character in Mass Effect and this felt streamlined and it felt like a nod to classic Rpg's with the typical classes you would find but adding a modern, science fiction twist.  I would thoroughly reccomend Mass Effect to any rpg fan and it proves that Western Rpgs can be just as good if not better than the Japanese counterparts and Bioware truly leads in example of how to create a  masterpiece Rpg with a Western touch.

												Mass Effect is (in my own opinion) one of the best games I've ever played. Few games were able to rival its ability to captivate me. I've played through the entire trilogy on console so many times I lost count, and eventually decided to get the first two games here on steam. I love nearly everything about this game, including the shooting mechanics that so many people seem to have a problem with; It just never bothered me. This one is my favorite in the series, and I would recommend it to any RPG or Shooter fan alike.			"

												I finally played this game after years of raving reviews and friend suggestions... What can I say? It qualifies for the hype tremendously, it's a fantastic work of storytelling if I've ever seen one. The lore is great, the alen races are so cool (I exclusively used Wrex and Garrus for every single mission.), and the choices feel powerful.All in all, I'd say this is a solid 8/10, with two points deducted for the car being so awful to drive with keyboard controls and the slow-♥♥♥ elevators. Also, the maps feel a wee bit linear.... However, this is still a must-buy for any sci-fi fan or narrative fan.			"

												Mass Effect is quite simply my favourite game series. It all started with this first installment which introduces us to an immersive open galaxy where the decisions we make through gameplay and dialogue options shape our journey along throughout our time in the game. You play as a Commander of your own ship and are tasked with bringing a rogue Spectre to justice. Along the way you visit numerous planets and environments with a squad of team mates you recruit along the way. The character interactions between you and your squad truly shape your experience playing the game as you begin to learn about their backgrounds and understand their motivations for fighting alongside you.The plot is straightforward with an engaging villain (the rogue Spectre Saren) and develpos at a steady pace with many more options for side quests that help build and shape the world building, or galaxy building I should say.  Playing as Commander Shepard you have the option to play nicely (paragon) or rather roughly (renegade) while dealing with your dialogue wheel options, allowing to to shape your character's personality. I personally prefer the paragon route.Any downsides I would mention are the somewhat clunky mechanics during fire fights and the difficulty there can sometimes be when you try and fail to take cover. The graphics have aged compared to the more recent installments but  can still be considered decent. I highly reccommend giving the Mass Effect game series a go. It will change your perception of sci-fi RPGs for the better, and not to mention there are two jaw-dropping sequels to sink your teeth into after this one.			"

 There isn't enough positive words to describe my love for the game and it's counter-parts. TL;DR - Brilliant storyline, immersive galaxy and worlds to visit. The characters and chemistry between you and character you meet are one of the things that makes Mass Effect so great. A truly brilliant RPG for those who love Science Fiction and action games.As you can tell by the amount of time I've spent playing this game, I've done quite a few playthroughs (I've lost count of how many times I've played Mass Effect, but it's an abnormally large number). Bioware really has a knack of combining a great storyline and character development together with gameplay and customisation. Of course, this was before EA really got them by the balls and milked their franchise dry. First things first, here is what I LOVED about this game. - The story (as mentioned many times above) could not be any better;  immediately you're thrown into the story, as Commander Shepard, with the Alliance Navy, on your way to Eden Prime to check out some Prothean artifacts and screw up whatever plan the bad guys had going.  The different plot points blend together perfectly; the introduction of Saren Arterius, the Geth, the Citadel and your Spectre ranking, it all just comes and goes so well. The interaction with characters and potential romance options really puts the player in the game and the experiences really stick with you.- The lore/canon behind the different points of the game and the background to the game is brilliant; I've spent many hours external of the game reading up on the Mass Effect Wikia page about different planets, key events (like the discovery of the Mass Relay near Pluto) and the technology seen within the game. Players can learn everything and more about the Mass Effect universe without even leaving the game, the codex contains lots and lots of sub-sections pointing to various information about the universe, with the player being able to add more and more accessible canon stories to the codex by interacting with certain items or buildings in game.- Character customisation is really in-depth and customisable; right off the bat, you are given the choice to edit your character's name, appearance, classification and background story. The appearance customisation options are alright, it's pretty default across a lot of RPG games. The class system is great also, with different classes offering the player different weapon choices, in-game powers and abilities. By selecting a character's background story, it really allows you to set up your characters morals for whatever way you wish to play;  whether you want to be a badass Male/Female Shepard who doesn't ask questions and shoots first, or a negotiator, who can talk their way out of anything , you have those choices in Mass Effect.- In-game levelling up and point assignment to you and your squadmates works very well; you have lots of options to add points to specific abilites that will become more accurate, powerful or varied with you and your team in combat and in dialogue. You can also access all your squad's character profiles on the Normandy and customise each one individually, as well as assign different squadmates to you with different missions.- The variety of weapons and mods available is huge to say the least; you can modify any weapon to have different effects on enemies, have a fast fire rate or more accuracy to name a few, as well as purchase or loot newer, more powerful weapons and equip them to you and your squadmates. The same is said for armor and omni-tools, which too can be upgraded by newer items. Now, for the things I was not so much a fan of in Mass Effect. - Off the bat I'm going to appeal to any of you graphic predators; this game is not high-end, cutting edge in the graphics department, it's pretty meh for a game that came out in 2007, compare to the likes of Assassin's Creed or Crysis that came out the same year. But available mods can greatly improve in-game textures and such if it really bothers you.- In-game, the mechanics of combat and everything combat-related is not really that great; the whole cover system, FOV and freeze screen selection is alright, but the newer Mass Effect 2 and 3 definitely improve on this game's mechanics.- The exploration options in the game are pretty linear, but definitely better than Mass Effect 2 and 3. Every world just kind of looks the same but in different colours or with a few different bases re-arranged. The mako is also a pain in the ♥♥♥ to command around when exploring, getting stuck on mountain sides or in ditches and causing a lot of awkward situations. To conclude my review of Mass Effect;  this game and it's counter-parts are my pride and joy of video games. The game overall is so well made and the elements of it just work together fantastically, and for   £7.99, I think it's worth every penny   (or wait until the Steam sales, where I've seen it sell for £1.99 many times).I highly recommend you invest in this game if you like RPGs, Science Fiction or want to play a game you'll get lost in over and over again, for hours on end.

												This game made me abandon my love for Star Wars. I no longer enjoy Star Wars even though my friend is keen to remind me this is made by the same people that made KOTOR and that they only made this after they lost the license.Regardless, this game is fantastic. I don't really think you need another positve review why this game is good but there you go.Well balanced RPG skills and levelling. Along with action, combat. Dialogue.Honestly this game is near perfect.The only real issues are that the side missions are terrible, they all take place in the same warehouse.There are a fair few bugs that seem to have you randomnly float and get stuck in things.Graphical glitches as well. It's not all that polished but if you can get past that, then it's an experience you need to have.			"

												Well the big-♥♥♥ Space Opera RPG is pretty decent. It has got downsides, like having unremarkable gameplay resemblance to past Bioware games (most notably KotOR 1+2), elevator sim mini-games, half of the weapon and armor upgrades being completely useless, level scaling (why.jpg), copy-paste dungeon layouts (dungeon meaning the exact same buildings on every side-quest planet), and character building + skill trees that are so easy and limiting that it makes character/party builds in Final Fantasy VII look complex (which is not so surprising seeing the dichotomy between the KotOR games and their earlier games, Baldur's Gate for example). Also semi spoiler warning, the background lore and characters are very reminiscent of KotOR games. It is not direct copypaste but it is noticeable, but the quests and characters have their own unique flavors to them.But what's great about it? The story, music, characters, and the element of choice in the game. I clocked 62 hours into the game because the characters in my party entertained me (mostly Wrex) and the feeling of traveling to distant galaxies to explore them (and there are MANY of them, you'll be playing for hours) as a captain of my own ship and alien crew was too much fun. I would recommend a playthrough.			"

												One of the greatest gaming experiences of all time.In mass effect you play as commander shephard, shephard's gender, personality and class is completely up to you to decide.Each class is unique and adds to the already massive replayability of the game, the combat is pretty fun and the skills you can use keep it interesting.The story and characters are probably the best part of this amazing game, all of the characters are memorable and have their own personalities. The main quest is around 5-10 hours long, even longer if you do all the side quests. There are many planets to explore and things to do and see so you won't get bored for a while.I give it a 9/10 and plan on replaying this many more times.			"

												Fantastic. Absolutely incredible. A space-faring action RPG!I love the crap out of this game. The combat, the weapons, the skill tree, the story, everything. Fabulous. Well done, Bioware.The story is enthralling, and you really feel like you're fighting to save the galaxy. The twists and turns are delicious and surprising. The combat system is fantastic. Finally a run-and-gun style of game that doesn't require you to hunt around for tons of freaking ammo. Instead guns have limitless ammo, but you can't fire too much or they'll overheat and be useless for a short time. Really a great mechanic, I love it. Scrounging and searching for ammo while playing was always annoying and immersion breaking for me in other games. The skill tree is great, very in-depth. You have a lot of choices to make and can make a unique character. I could play this game twenty times twenty different ways and STILL have different paths to take and different characters to create. Well done.The voice acting is fantastic. Love it.Overall a wonderful game. 10/10			"

												Mass Effect is pretty cool, I guess.You play as Shepard, who can be either male or female, but I played him as a man, so I will be addressing him as a he.Sorry Anita. The game takes place in the future where I somehow haven't conquered the world. Humanity, in its efforts to into space, exluding Poland, find a ancient alien relic called the Mass Relay at the edge of the solar system. They activate it, which is apparently a big no-no, and starts a interstellar war with a alien race called the Turians, it's okay though because you can bang one later. All greviances lost. Depending on the backstory you picked for Shepard, there is a chance he can compete with Batman on the world's deadest parents competition. As part of the Earth military, Shepard is sent off to a planet called Eden Prime where he must find out what happened to the country bumpkins and their space farms. He finds corpses, oh no! After the death of a Spectre, this games version of the hall monitors, Shepard is brought to the forefront of the galactic community as the first human hall monitor. Gonna monitor those halls so good. Through his Star Wars journey, Shepard discovers new friends, bitter enemies, and discovers his infatuation for blue buttcheeks, you go Shepard, get that blue berry. The combat is a mix between RPG elements and cover based shooting. You hide behind chest-high walls while popping out occasionally to shoot some fool or hit them with your Jedi mind powers. Like all older Bioware games, Mass Effect likes to tell you what's going on. There is a codex that covers aliens, places, alien places, weapons, alien weapons, goblin darts, and historical events, and alien historical events... Did I mention the aliens? They're kind of important.  I appreciate the time they took into making the game feel like it has it's own world instead of just being a series of events. The story isn't the greatest thing ever, but it does enough to get you lost in it and forgetting that you live on a raft going down the Mississippi because you won one too many hobo fights without throwing the match. Let's see you catch me now, Booker. Should you play Mass Effect? The characters are fun to be around and the story and gameplay is engaging enough to keep you interested. Your journey for blue butt cheeks should last you a few hours and it will probably keep you interested enough to play the sequel. Not the second sequel though, don't do that to yourself, you're beautiful and don't deserve that. I give Mass Effect two butt cheeks out of ten.  President Kennedy was the fastest random speaker in the world with upwards of 350 words per minute. Also, I have a curator now, you should probably check that out if you like reading the stupid crap I type out on here.

												Even if I give the game a thumbs up, this one is not for me. There are a few things that really put me off from playing through this game. The combat system is horrible. Fallout 3 struggled to not become a FPS and somehow it worked for the most part, but in this game it just doesn't work either way. It's not a FPS and not an action RPG either. The loot system has been 'simplified' to a point where you keep getting the same items over and over again. You can modify weapons and ammo though.The story is okay, but it didn't really catch me. Maybe the quite obvious build up for the main character to become the saviour of the universe was a bit too much. The voice acting for the main character does its part by simply being not good.You can travel to other systems than the ones covered by the main story, but they are boring and at best filled with some generic structures without any deeper meaning. You explore those planets using a vehicle that has one of the worst controls and physics I've ever encountered in a computer game.The visuals are good for a game from 2008, but the music doesn't really work for the title. It's very bland electronic music that would rather fit in an elevator.I won't finish the game even if I invested over 16 hours into it so far as I don't see it becoming really interesting and the overall gameplay is just not satisfying. Why I still give it a thumbs up? I still think it's worth a try even if I personally don't like it.			"

The main storyline is engaging and fun, and the side quests are meaningful and often change the dialogue you can exchange with other characters. The romantic subplots are also very interesting and allow insight into the background of your characters. The option to play as a Paragon or a Renegade based on the qualities of your actions is also a nice dynamic allowing moral feedback for your character.

												If you're looking to play this game then buckle up, kiddo, you're in for a ride.Experience the beginning of the epic journey with your custom or default Commander Shepard with a gender of your choice.Get sucked into a huge universe so full of lore, that three games wasn't enough to fit it all in, no, there's books (three worth mentioning and one worth forgetting) and comics and even a movie. AND there's another game coming next year, how great is that?Explore a vast galaxy with numerous planets to land on in a huge number of clusters.Freeze your lovely behind off on Noveria, jump the Mako over pits of Lava on Therum or stomp Geth with them (the Mako rocks, I don't care what anybody says), enjoy the scenery on Virmire (because that's the only thing you'll be enjoying there) and get lost on Ilos (every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time).Find loyal companions to fight by your side and befriend them. Maybe even smooch them if you feel that way. You can even smooch non-humans. Or not. Have it your way, really, this game is all about your choices and how they affect all the living beings in the galaxy.Make choices that affect everyone. Make choices that seem minute to you but grow monstrously in size and come back to bite you in your lovely behind later. Make choices that might kill people you know.Prepare for the biggest fight of your life.Be brave, be badass, be bad at dancing, be Commander Shepard.And after you're done? Well there's still two more games for you to question your choices, cry a lot (this is not optional) and start a new playthrough because you didn't need your heart intact anyway.			"

												The main storyline and dialogs are very interesting, although, most of the secondary quests are repetitive and boring. The graphics still look decent, especially when you consider that it was released back in 2007. The gameplay is average – nothing super spectacular, but not terrible. The only real problem for me was autosave system. It saves very rarely, so if you don't want to replay half an hour of the game, you will have to press quick save button. A lot.			"

The main storyline is engaging and fun, and the side quests are meaningful and often change the dialogue you can exchange with other characters. The romantic subplots are also very interesting and allow insight into the background of your characters. The option to play as a Paragon or a Renegade based on the qualities of your actions is also a nice dynamic allowing moral feedback for your character.

												Very good Sci-fi RPG.You choose a class and level your characters like any other RPG game, but the combat is a real-time 3rd person shooter. Building and strengthing your character is just as important as your ability to dodge enemy fire, use cover, and score headshots for critical damage. The game also has different difficulties settings to choose from in case you need to lower it. You also have 2 teammates with you at any given time.Aside from combat; you can literally spend hours at a time just going around exploring, talking to people, and reading codexes you come across (bits of information about certain guns or whatever). Some people love this stuff, others hate it, so its purely preference if you'll like it or not. The main highlight of this game though is the option to choose your own path/dialogue. You can pretty much apologize to someone, agree to disagree, or sometimes just straight up punch them in their face. Then the next time you meet this person down the road, IF you meet them again, they'll remember how the previous conversation went and it affects the feel of the game. It might even open or close off certain things. The overall core storyline of the game is the same though, you can't change that. It's also a trilogy. Certain decisions you make can span from game 1 game into the next if you transfer save files.It's a well-made game for its genre (and an even better trilogy). So if you're not into these type of games (Sci-fi / shooter / Action RPG / deep storytelling with alot of decisions and information/lore) then you simply won't like it.Cons: A few times playing this game I had to load an older save file due to some weird glitches happening. Maybe 3 times in 50+ hours of playing. (only lost a total of 10 minutes of playtime or so). Other than that the game ran fine for me.			"

												The game that started the Mass Effect madness. The entire mechanics of the game are a little rough around the edges, when compared to Mass Effect 2 (but only in retrospect); it makes replaying a little unpleasant, but I still give this game a SOLID 10/10. Great story, great music, great feeling. You're definitely there when you're playing, in a truly original universe. If they did an HD remaster (even though the game certainly doesn't need it), I'd definitely shell out 60 euros for it. One of the games I replay every now and again, and take my time completing. Probably finished it around 10 times by now, and I always enjoy it like it's my first time.(Yes, I know it says 0.1h played, I had it on Origin before moving over to Steam).			"

												I bought Mass Effect recently for my run through of the entire series, and I have to say, I am impressed. I expected a really bad game that I would play ""for the story."" I was wrong. This was an absolutely great experience. There are a few things that were frustrating, such as the repetative land rover missions, and the way the Citidel was laid out. The Citidel is your center hub of trade and activity, for people that don't know much about the Mass Effect universe. The story was fantastic, the characters so belivable, however the combat was a bit rough due to the sheer age of the game. It doesn't take long to get used to the outdated combat and graphics, and once that is aside, everything is so much fun. One of the best RPGs of it's kind.			"

												Great story, great characters. You may think that it is an impossible task to create a good and completely new universe in the space opera gender. Bioware does the job with Mass Effect. Part shooter part RPG, it tells the story of Commander Shepard and crew trying to defeat an ancient alien species that threatens the universe. There is a lot to uncover in the game, but the mixing of RPG and shooter makes you feel the story, wanting to be involved. Plus it has very cool characters with cool weapons and powers. Hell, it even has a sex scene… "

In depth story, great character choices for gear/weaponry, index with voiced over history of whatever you find in the game, etc. I've played this game over multiple times and I hihgly suggest having it part of your collection.

												I picked this up during the X-mas sale and only recently installed it. I generally don't play shooters, but Mass Effect has a healthy dose of searching and exploring and story. I've always played ""lurkers"" in games, rather kill from the shadows. }:>I chose the Infiltrator class (I know, my friends are totally shocked) even though I read from several sources that the sniper rifle was a pain to master. It is a pain, but I can live with that. Took me more than a few occasions to unlearn that the spacebar does not make you jump... probable the only thing that bothers me so far. Because when I explore I like to jump and climb on things. I'm enjoying it very much so far at least I would hope so considering that I logged 6.6 hours on my first night of playing. :)So yeah, I'd recommend it.PS: sinewav put up a nice beginner's guide that explains the classes pretty well and what he considers their strengths and weaknesses, recommendations on how difficult newbs might find each class, on the crew you should pair up with them to fill in the holes. And I think he did a good job of it without filling it with spoilers. You can find it here:

EDIT:  Since I have a relatively new machine, ME wouldn't even launch on first attempt, a quick search will reveal 2 things that can solve this: Set the .exe to run in Admin mode and to download a legacy Nvidia driver. The first one worked for me.			"

												A masterpiece of a series; Mass Effect is a three part space opera with rich lore and great action. While definitely showing its age the original Mass Effect is still a great game that opens the door for writers to take the story in any direction, it is the best possible introduction to an incredibly large universe and I recommend playing it before starting Mass Effect 2.

												I bought Mass Effect recently for my run through of the entire series, and I have to say, I am impressed. I expected a really bad game that I would play ""for the story."" I was wrong. This was an absolutely great experience. There are a few things that were frustrating, such as the repetative land rover missions, and the way the Citidel was laid out. The Citidel is your center hub of trade and activity, for people that don't know much about the Mass Effect universe. The story was fantastic, the characters so belivable, however the combat was a bit rough due to the sheer age of the game. It doesn't take long to get used to the outdated combat and graphics, and once that is aside, everything is so much fun. One of the best RPGs of it's kind.			"

												This one had the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Probably going to get lynched for saying that but it's true. This is the only Mass Effect that is actually an RPG. They managed to make a super awesome shooter RPG with 6 different classes and an adequately complex levelling system and inventory management. And for Mass Effect 2 they threw all of that out the window, removed the whole inventory thing completely and made the levelling system the simplest any RPG has ever had, which is why I hesitate to call Mass Effect 2 or 3 an RPG.This one also has the best story, and so it's pretty much better than Mass Effect 2 and 3 in every way, except for graphics. 10/10 best Mass Effect game to date, fingers crossed for Andromeda.

												Wow. What a fantastic experience this game was.I've heard so much about this game before actually getting myself to finally play it. Mainly because I'm not a fan of SCI-FI or shooter. Well I wasn't, before I started Mass Effect. This game is incredible. It will drag you in with it's fantastic gameplay, brilliantly written story with massive lore, amazing character development, beautiful music, beautiful landscapes, unique atmosphere, masterfully done voice acting and some of what are probably one of the most memorable characters in the game history. This is one of the rare games I actually finished. I have the tendency to play too many things at once to focus on a single game alone. This game, however, was an exception and getting it was probably one of the best decisions I've made in my life. I got it on sales for an € or so, but it is not only worth it's original price, but double that. I recommend this game to everyone everywhere that cherishes brilliant dialogues, deep character development, huge lore behind the main story, for people that don't want to just walk straight forward and shoot stuff, but for people that enjoy exploring the world they are in, for people that enjoy making decisions and think logically. Truly a masterpiece.			"

												I just got this for a couple of bucks, and after not playing it for several years, I got to say that this game has aged quite well in my opinion. For today's standards (regarding graphics and whatnot), it still holds up, and has some pretty good visuals. They do look a bit dated, of course, but for a game originally released in 2007, it looks great. Several people have complained about the Mako (driving) sections, and while the controls are a bit wonky, it still is a good idea, and it's not as bad as most people make it sound. And now,  let's talk about the heart of this game, and what makes it so special; the expanding, interesting, epic and completely immersive story filled with fully fleshed characters that you care about, amazing plot-twists, and an open ended narrative. This is what makes the ME series so special, along with it's bigger-than life space opera setting. Finally, I have to say that this game is a bargain. It offers at least 30 hours of gameplay, and if you explore every little corner and do every single side quests, those 30 hours could easily stretch to 50. Get this thing ASAP.			"

												Such a good game oh my God. Well written and developing characters, epic story and massive amounts of lore, this is definetly my kind of game. The combat was, at times, frustrating with my team mates getting in the way from time to time but the option to can organise the tactics of battle is available, if a little messy. In the end the combat was fun and it felt great to blast enemies away with the shotgun thanks to the level ssystemm that allowed me to upgrade any aspect of my Shepard that I wanted. The strongest aspect of the game for me however, was the extensive dialogue and heavy story line. That's just me but if you don't enjoy cutscenes and/or plenty of talking then this is not for you. I do, so I created my FemShep and together we set off on an epic journey to distant planets with our alien team members. My FemShep also took a shine to a member of a certain mono-gendered species but who your Shepard takes an interest in is up to you~The shere amount of side quests work well to expand the length of gameplay and without completeling them all, it took me 29 hours to fully finish the game. I heavily recommend it and I'm now drooling over the sequel, I can't wait to get my hands on it.			"

												2007 was a golden year for gaming.  With titles like Bioshock and Super Mario Galaxy, it was undoubtedly a great year.  Mass Effect is one of those rare few games that truely capture what an RPG is all about.  Combining fantastic writing, visuals that still hold up to this day, a combat system that was so different yet worked so well, and a giant open world, you have one hell of a game.  RPG elements include skill leveling, tons of different kinds of weapons, abilities that all serve a purpose in the battlefield, and tons of side quests (some goofy, some awesome) that all seem to work so well.  The characters are colorful and the voice acting superb, especially Jennifer Hale's femshep voice.  But remember, humans are not the only species in the galaxy, and aliens play a big part in your adventure, some will help you and some will try to kill you, so its up to you to decide who should pal around at your side.Of course, with all great things, there are downsides.  The world, as vast as it is, can seem a bit empty at times, and the squad memeber AI can prove to be difficult.  There are a few glitches, but nothing gamebreaking and nothing severely awful.All in all I reccomend this game to everyone, as it is one hell of a ride from beginning to end.  The truely unfortunate thing is that Mass Effect might have been BioWare's magnum opus, as the 2 sequels fell under the care of EA.  We can only hope BioWare has woken up to try and fix what they destroyed in Mass Effect 4.I give Mass Effect a 10/10			"

												Length: About 20 hours minimumRating: 10/10Cost: 19.99$I played through the main storyline, only doing sidequests when they were close to where the story took me, And had a blast from that minimal exposure alone. I especially enjoyed playing through Virmire, with all it's little extra things you can do during your assault on the enemy fortress there.Even if you don't want to spend time on the dozens of sidequests that are available, this game is still a great experience.And if you want to keep following Commander Shepard on his/her journey, I'd reccomend trying out the rest of the trilogy.I should go.

I can't belive about more heartwarming experience, that i've experienced during playing other games.The graphics are very good for 2008.The music is AMAZING too.The first Mass Effect is very big step for video games, you can't say no...

												I bought Mass Effect recently for my run through of the entire series, and I have to say, I am impressed. I expected a really bad game that I would play ""for the story."" I was wrong. This was an absolutely great experience. There are a few things that were frustrating, such as the repetative land rover missions, and the way the Citidel was laid out. The Citidel is your center hub of trade and activity, for people that don't know much about the Mass Effect universe. The story was fantastic, the characters so belivable, however the combat was a bit rough due to the sheer age of the game. It doesn't take long to get used to the outdated combat and graphics, and once that is aside, everything is so much fun. One of the best RPGs of it's kind.			"

												Mass Effect: The one game series that has always had a special place in my game library, I bought Mass Effect 1 as a totally random game that looked cool in my local store, and then I went home and played it through once, twice, and a few times more until I managed to grind the right choices, and then I went forward to ME2 and ME3, one by one, replaying each many times, I've played many story-based games, but I am still to find a game series with more capturing RPG Storyline.Mass Effect 1: Best story overall.Mass Effect 2: Most epic gameplay.Mass Effect 3: Most enjoyable gameplay and story.I personally give them all 10/10 -""The games are really epic even though the ending is a minor dissapointment, still waiting anxiously for Mass Effect: Andromeda!""

												If you haven't played Mass Effect by this point, then you gotta trust me; it holds up incredibley well. Honestly, this is still my favourite 'space opera' game ever.

												This one had the best gameplay in the series in my opinion. Probably going to get lynched for saying that but it's true. This is the only Mass Effect that is actually an RPG. They managed to make a super awesome shooter RPG with 6 different classes and an adequately complex levelling system and inventory management. And for Mass Effect 2 they threw all of that out the window, removed the whole inventory thing completely and made the levelling system the simplest any RPG has ever had, which is why I hesitate to call Mass Effect 2 or 3 an RPG.This one also has the best story, and so it's pretty much better than Mass Effect 2 and 3 in every way, except for graphics. 10/10 best Mass Effect game to date, fingers crossed for Andromeda.

												Great story, great characters. You may think that it is an impossible task to create a good and completely new universe in the space opera gender. Bioware does the job with Mass Effect. Part shooter part RPG, it tells the story of Commander Shepard and crew trying to defeat an ancient alien species that threatens the universe. There is a lot to uncover in the game, but the mixing of RPG and shooter makes you feel the story, wanting to be involved. Plus it has very cool characters with cool weapons and powers. Hell, it even has a sex scene… "

												If you're looking to play this game then buckle up, kiddo, you're in for a ride.Experience the beginning of the epic journey with your custom or default Commander Shepard with a gender of your choice.Get sucked into a huge universe so full of lore, that three games wasn't enough to fit it all in, no, there's books (three worth mentioning and one worth forgetting) and comics and even a movie. AND there's another game coming next year, how great is that?Explore a vast galaxy with numerous planets to land on in a huge number of clusters.Freeze your lovely behind off on Noveria, jump the Mako over pits of Lava on Therum or stomp Geth with them (the Mako rocks, I don't care what anybody says), enjoy the scenery on Virmire (because that's the only thing you'll be enjoying there) and get lost on Ilos (every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time).Find loyal companions to fight by your side and befriend them. Maybe even smooch them if you feel that way. You can even smooch non-humans. Or not. Have it your way, really, this game is all about your choices and how they affect all the living beings in the galaxy.Make choices that affect everyone. Make choices that seem minute to you but grow monstrously in size and come back to bite you in your lovely behind later. Make choices that might kill people you know.Prepare for the biggest fight of your life.Be brave, be badass, be bad at dancing, be Commander Shepard.And after you're done? Well there's still two more games for you to question your choices, cry a lot (this is not optional) and start a new playthrough because you didn't need your heart intact anyway.			"

												I picked this up during the X-mas sale and only recently installed it. I generally don't play shooters, but Mass Effect has a healthy dose of searching and exploring and story. I've always played ""lurkers"" in games, rather kill from the shadows. }:>I chose the Infiltrator class (I know, my friends are totally shocked) even though I read from several sources that the sniper rifle was a pain to master. It is a pain, but I can live with that. Took me more than a few occasions to unlearn that the spacebar does not make you jump... probable the only thing that bothers me so far. Because when I explore I like to jump and climb on things. I'm enjoying it very much so far at least I would hope so considering that I logged 6.6 hours on my first night of playing. :)So yeah, I'd recommend it.PS: sinewav put up a nice beginner's guide that explains the classes pretty well and what he considers their strengths and weaknesses, recommendations on how difficult newbs might find each class, on the crew you should pair up with them to fill in the holes. And I think he did a good job of it without filling it with spoilers. You can find it here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123753085EDIT:  Since I have a relatively new machine, ME wouldn't even launch on first attempt, a quick search will reveal 2 things that can solve this: Set the .exe to run in Admin mode and to download a legacy Nvidia driver.

One of the best modern story-driven RPG's I've ever played. I have no complaints about ME1. I loved every minute of my 2 playthroughs. On my 5yr old PC there were no graphic glitches, no lag or issues of any kind. Just smooth sailing graphics & a wonderful story. The characters are well-written, even the ones you don't like (looking at you Ashley). As in KOTOR, you can go Light or Dark, good or bad, making Dialog choices to reflect your own personality or how you want Commander Shepard to be perceived. In this game at least, your choices don't really affect the endgame outcome. Your choices DO open up different dialog options and some side quests. It adds fun flavor to the game.I loved finding all the armor & weps scattered around everywhere you go. I liked the hacking puzzle mini-game to open caches. It reminded me of the similar hydraulic puzzle game in Bioshock, which I also loved - both the main game & the mini puzzle game.The DLC is FreeAnother plus for ME1 is the 2 DLC's are free & easily found to download. Some nice people have already linked them in other helpful reviews, or just Google.Common ComplaintsThe MakoSome people complain about the Mako, which if you haven't played the game yet, is a tank-like vehicle you drive when you explore planets. I personally loved driving the crazy thing. Yes, it can be hard to control. Things can get a little wild, but it's really not that hard & once you get the hang of it, driving it literally anywhere is good fun. Mostly though, combat in the thing with its cannon & gun are a literal blast.ExplorationSome people complained about exploring Planets. I personally enjoyed this aspect as well. You only explore at most, 1 planet per system, & exploring each planet only takes a few minutes. Of course, I did really like driving the Mako so any excuse to get in the thing & go nuts was welcome.Game Won't Start, or get a Black or White Screen then game won't startThis did actually happen to me once, but is VERY simple to fix. Find the game's .exe, right click it and select ""Open as Administrator"". If that doesn't work for you, exit Steam, then Right-click Steam to ""Open As"", THEN rt click ME1's .exe to ""Open As"". You should only ever have to do this once, then done. It happened to me at about 5hours in. I was frustrated for about 10 minutes before I found this simple solution. After that I just started the game normally for the rest of my playtime.Other Similar Games I recommend you play:Dragon Age SeriesMass Effect SeriesKOTOR SeriesBioshock Series - Especially 1, 2 & Minerva's Den DLC (Excellent standalone story there)All of those game titles are equal in my esteem. They all provide good value for the price & all have a great story. These games all really draw you in. IMO you just can't go wrong with any of them.Comments About ME2 & 3(*Included here because many people are buying 1&2 here together)While ME1 had only 2 DLC, both of which are now free, ME2 & ME3 both have numerous expensive DLC that never goes on sale. In fact, you can't just ""buy"" & DL DLC for those 2 games. Nope. Even though you can purchase ME2 on Steam, you have to go to Origin to get the DLC for it.Of course some people needlessly complain about Origin, but truthfully, Origin is awesome. It's a very solid Game Management / Store Interface, just as good as Steam for it's own purposes.Anyway, say you buy the ME1/2 pack here on Steam & you want to then buy DLC for the game, which must be done on Origin (or also on social.bioware.com). ME2/Deluxe does come with a tiny bit of DLC, which you can also activate on Origin along with the base game, should you wish to. Simple steps are needed: Install the game in Steam Right-click ME2 in your Steam library and ""View CD Key"" (The game must be installed to have this option) Open Origin. If you didn't already, create an account & log in. At the top left, click on Origin, then click ""Redeem Product Code"" There are 3 codes for ME2. Copy each from the little Steam window, one at a time, then paste to Activate in the Origin app. Find the game in your Origin Library, hover the mouse over it then click the little italicized ""i"", which opens a more detailed Information page.On the Info page you can see a list of all the DLC, much of which is free. However, the good stuff, namely the Content packs which give you more missions & not just fluff cosmetics, cost money.Actually, they cost ""Bioware Points"". Yes, it's lame, but there's no way around it. BC although Bioware makes insanely awesome games, the guy in charge of setting up the sale of DLC is obviously a crackhead. There's simply no other explanation for why they think this is a good idea, as opposed to just being able to put all the desired DLC in your cart then buying it all straight up.Nope. You put what you want in the cart, then when you Checkout......it takes you to buy Bioware Points. 1600 Points sells for $20, 1200/$15 & 800/$10. It's very simple math to figure out which DLC you really want then convert the dollar value to how many Bioware Points you need. It's really very annoying, but it's not that complicated.You're going to need ~$40 for all the ME2 DLC. More for ME3. So, even though you probably only paid $20 for all 3 games (on sale of course), you're going to probably be forking out $80+ more dollars for any content & cosmetics you may want for ME2 & ME3.One last note. I hear that DLC you buy for ME2 (in Origin of course) can also be activated in your Steam copy of the game, though I don't see the need to do it, so I've never tried. I honeslty don't know why you wouldn't just play it in Origin. But it's said to be possible should you wish to try it.Hope this info was helpful. Enjoy! "

The story is really good and the replay value is high due to the fact that you can create different characters focusing on different abilities. Want to be a soldier with all the toys of destruction or a full biotic with limited weapons, or a technician. You can play a character as these types and some in between.One of the greatest things about the Mass Effect trilogy is that you can import a completed game character into the next installment of the franchise and get bonuses for completing the last installment and pick your character up where you left off. You of course can always just start a new character as well, but it is the carryover of the character that makes the series really unique.The only strikes against it is some of the tedium related to exploring planets and inventory wrangling.Definitely a must buy.

												I've always been a fan of the old-school manu based combat RPGs; such that were developed for consoles, the old jRPG.

												An excellent game that has a story heavily influenced by Star Trek and Star Wars. The gameplay and story are compelling, although I do think that the oft-binary choices between good and evil hurt the game. Trust me here, it's much more entertaining to watch Shepard be a total jerk (and, occasionally, commit genocide) than it is to make him a goody-two shoes. I'll go ahead and say that I enjoyed this game the most out of the series (though I have not yet played 3), as I thought that the overall story was focused and quite exciting-- well worth playing to the finish.

												My second greatest game series of all time. An epic space saga with no equal.Edit:So I thought with the recent release of Mass effect Andromeda, I wanted to add a few things.....I'm a complete ME fanboy, ME1-3 and now Andromeda. You know that guy/girl at the party who's had way too much to drink and says ""I love you man!, No!...you, I love you, you're such a great person and I love you!...."" Well that's me with my Mass effect fetish. It can do NO wrong!Every game in the series has it's flaws, heck, I didn't even think the so called best game in the series, Mass effect 2, was even my favorite but I was still that drunk dude at the party "" I love you man..."" Mass effect 3 original ending? It wasn't that bad, i think gamers have this herd mentality where if a few people hate something about a game, everyone jumps on the bandwagon, especially so with the ending of ME3, I mean sure, Im glad they patched the ending but I didn't need it as such. Andromeda, it's utterly brilliant aside from the current state of models, textures, animations and the convoluted dialogue but again...drunk dude at the party "" I love you man!...""I think if I had a fave ME game though, the original. Why? Because that's where it all started for me, for all of us who like freqenting parties whilst drunk!			"

												I played this game a few times over and I had Mass Effect 2 plus all the content.Both were great in their own ways.I kind of like Mass Effect 1 here the best.  There's something about all of it that is just way more fun and more interesting.  The 2nd one was more focused on intense combat and it was great and the DLC to it was great... but there's a certain charm to this game.  I wish it were longer quite frankly.That would be the only Con to Mass Effect 1.  It's still a long game but I wish there was more to it.  My cousin likes this one better as well.Played this game multiple times over... never knew you could mantel onto crates.  lol  Made game harder.So ya, you can climb things.Great story and side quests.Really great side quests I thought.I think this game was way ahead of it's time for 2007 or whenever it came out.I guess one more Con would be that chick... Ashely.  Totally ugly and annoying and a terrible character.They could've probably done with some more diverse and interesting characters.  Some party members seem a little cliche and boring.  Especially the girls.  They aren't too interesting, especially when they yammer about god knows what.  I wasn't listening anymore after a while...Awesome game.  Probably timeless.  Worth playing through once.If you're a Sci Fi fan and Exploration junky it's super fun.  Great combat too. "

												I honestly wasn't expecting that this game was going to be as good as it really is. I believe I spent more time going through the codex and every single dialogue option other than the actual combat itself. The story in Mass Effect might feel to some the usual ""bad aliens killing everyone in the galaxy"" story but, in my opinion there's alot more to it. For me it was like reading a book, the soundtrack along with the cinematics really imerse you into the game. Of course that if you played Mass Effect before the second one and the third one came out, right after getting the ending you knew there will be a sequel. Now, about the combat, it might look and feel like a normal third person run 'n cover shooter but once you get a few hours into the game you'll find a very well polished and easy to use combat system along with squad commands. Some games fail to introduce ""psychic"" abilities in a way that it doesn't feel ""paranormal"", that's another thing I really liked about Mass Effect, the way they introduced biotics into the storyline feels ""kinda authentic"". The roleplaying aspect is really good, from the loot drops (which I believe these aren't random), to the skill ""tree"" that affects your abilities along the abilities of your fellow ones. The last roleplaying aspect that I really liked was that I think they really managed to pull off some really good ""side effects"" or more like consequences on the storyline depending on the dialogue options you choose, but my favourite one was with no doubt the one in which you had to decide to save Kaidan or Ashley on Virmire but there's also of course the one about going to bed either with Ashley or Liara. Also, I have to mention that there's TONS of side quests you might come across either when travelling in space or when wandering around the Citadel. The space exploration is kinda 'meh', it basicly is you going from star system to star system and just clicking on planets and scanning them for resources ocasionally finding some asteroids on the background. On the other hand I really liked the planet exploration when you drop on your Mako, going around the mountains and going to key locations, it's something out of the extraordinary but it was fun for me. There's also a ""hack"" mini-game that happens when you wish to unlock some crates or even recover some artifacts which is kinda appealing, it reminded me of Super Hexagon. I really regret not playing this earlier but I'm really glad I did buy it and finished it, an amazing mix of RPG with third person shooting that excels in pretty much any way if you ask me, I can safely say it is amongst the most engaging game worlds I've ever experienced, give it a try.

												Mass Effect, their is so much to said about this game. Maybe its just the fact that I'm a nerd when it comes to space adventures but this game was wonderful. This is a game where it's really all about the story. The term epic has lost its impact in todays world, but its a word the sits rightly next to this game. Every choice you make has an effect on the universe your trying to protect and its never a dull moment. You'll make friends and enemies, you'll gain allies and betray friends. Its a game that is designed solely to reflect a character who is fighting against the universe for what he believes in, and that philospohical statement is totally up to the player to influence. If you a fan of RPG's then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by missing the beginning sequence of one of the best trilogies on any medium to grace this Earth. I recommend playing this one first,because it may be hard to play if you play 2 or 3 first  with the slight change in gameplay designs.			"

												 For those of you who don't know, this is the first game of a trilogy.  It is set in the future, humanity has discovered on mars a great technology that came from well before our time.. by studying the find our scientist discover a great many new things and it accelorates humanity into the rest of the galaxy.. where we quickly do not make friends.  The game picks up with you as Commander Sheppard (character you create, male or female) being trained as part of an eliete group of operatives that polices (for lack of a better description) the galaxy. Combat for the game is fairly simple,  you have multiple weapons.  Unlimited ammo.. but all weapons over heat if they are fired too frequently keeping you from just spam firing all the time.  Each of the games classes also get unique abilities you can use.  There isn't a cover based system or anything, either your enemies can see and hit you or they can't. The graphics are dated, the item management is terrible,  there is a cutscene in an elevator to cover a loading screen, the combat is simplistic....  but the story, the characters and the game itself is compelling and a lot of fun. I already owned, and beat this game on the Xbox 360, but decided I wanted to import a save from Mass Effect 1 into Mass Effect 2 (and later 3) so I went back and repurchased the first game and played it all the way through prior to the release of ME2.

This was my first ever dive into the Mass Effect universe and I am mind-blown. The game's excellent mix between RPG and shooter elements makes it a damn worthy one to play. The voice-acting is really good (I played FemShep) and the gameplay/mechanics are very intuitive, I got used to the skills/weapon switching/leveling stuff etc very quickly. Exploring the sidequest planets may have been a tad repetitive after a while, but the main story and background story depth of your squadmates more than make up for this.

Great galaxy to explore with a lot of planets to land on, stations to visit and side quests to do. Has a lot of choice and consequence so think carefully what you say, as the response will shape your character to be good or evil. Game has great visuals, voice acting and animations.

												The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Mass Effect is the thoroughness in how well thought out the universe is. The science - what's explained anyway - sounds interesting and plausible (not that I would really know). The concept of labeling any species as ""goodguys"" or ""badguys"" is hard to do since there are handfulls of both good and bad for each one (can't quite call any Hannar ""bad"" but no point nitpicking).The second thing I noticed was the story was really compelling in a way that felt more involving than other games. Think of Mass Effect as a videogame version of a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book. The choices you make can affect huge storylines that span the entire series. Sadly giving examples would spoil them. You can even unlock special actions/comments by raising meters gauging your Paragon and Renegade levels. That said almost every single active side quest was pretty repetitive. Go to planet. Drive on planet. Go in only building on planet. Kill a group of people. Collect loot.The combat is fun. How hard it is almost entirely depends on how well you are equipped. If you and your squad aren't equipped then you'll die sometimes. If they're well equipped most missions will typically be manageable on your first attempts. It might have been easier for me being I was an Engineer on my playthrough though - I destroyed shields and overheated weapons and hacked synthetic enemies to control the crowd a bit. I'm eager to try the game again as another class to see how different it would be.The driving parts with the Mako tank sometimes felt out of place. There were a few times it was major fun to drive. The missions involved obviously intended for the tank - like when driving it in the roofs of the ruins of skyscrapers - were awesome. However almost every planet you go to involves dropping onto the surface with the Mako tank before you drive around to check all the marked spots on a map (technically you could ignore them, but this is the most major way to run acrossed large money and some side-mission peices - which also possibly affect things later in the series). A lot of these worlds were mountainous and would make the Mako tank feel pretty mind numbingly slow on the incline.The inventory system was a mess. You could only hold so many items at a time and these items fill up fast on missions - between times you manage to run into a shop to unload them. This means you end up having to mess with it constantly. It's barely sorted in any way and it randomizes the entire list when you equip anything - making it a pain to find what you look for. It at least only shows items that fit in whatever slot you were trying to equip.The graphics were better than I expected them to be for a 10 year old game. Felt like what I usually have them set at for today's games.This game honestly feels like it should be added to some list of ""Games Every Gamer Ought to Play."" It feels like I'm playing a legend. Might have been because I've heard it's good for about 10 years.			"

												Shouldn't be missed if you enjoy Star Wars or sci fi blaster wars.  If you have the rig, make sure to pick up the high res texture pack from somewhere on the nets.  Not really like any other game out there.  I love Star Wars but could never get into Knights of the Old Republic (also made by Bioware I believe).  Perhaps if it had been a squaddie third person shooter I might have...*I cannot comment on other games of the series having not quite completed ME2 and not played ME3 at all, but ME2 while enjoyable, didn't have the charm of the first where you get to know the universe of Mass Effect.  Also ME2 loses some of that RPG feel.			"

												It's been a long time since I've playing this game(Without steam before). A lot of fun and one of the best ones in the sequel! There yet to be an adventure as big as this one. The dialogues, the amazing worlds and almost unlimited options throughout the games(As well as decisions you'd have to make).Of course, not everything is perfect, but this trilogy by Bioware is yet to be even compared by ANY game you've ever played before!

												Mass Effect absolutely stunned me with its universe. The presentation is fantastic, the story is absolutely amazing, and the player-choice gameplay is great. While the Mass Effect doesn't shine too much in the realm of gameplay mechanics, I reccommend getting this game for the story and experience. I can say without a doubt that Mass Effect is the best series RPG I have gotten into.			"

												So I found Mass Effect on a Steam Sale back in 2013, and purchased it for hardly anything. I'd not read any reviews on the game, so had no idea what to expect once I bought it. I guess, truth be told, I only bought it because it was so cheap and I hoped it could fill a few hours one boring evening after work. Oh, sweet Mass Effect, you didn't disappoint! There aren't many games that I genuinely wish I could remove from my memory, in order to replay again with a fresh set of eyes, but the exceptional story of Mass Effect, combined with the excellent character acting, life and death decisions that you'll face, and Shepherd's development and rise from traumatised soldier to first human Spectre, is a real work of genius. Despite this game being made in 2008 (I think), I only started playing it in March 2014. In total, I've spent around 43 blissfully happy hours running through the main story and side quests (excluding those pesky 'collect so many of this type of tag' quests). I know many games don't age well, but Mass Effect doesn't look old, nor dated, and if I didn't know the age of this game, I'd quite truthfully believe it was new and current.I'll close by saying that anyone not already familiar with Mass Effect should buy it immediately - well, if you like story driven games, of course. If not, just wait for a Steam Sale and buy it when it's virtually free!Now, enough singing the praises of Mass Effect - I was also fortunate enough to buy Mass Effect 2 in the same sale. I just hope it lives up to my lofty expectations and doesn't lose the excitement built from this true classic!			"

One of the best modern story-driven RPG's I've ever played. I have no complaints about ME1. I loved every minute of my 2 playthroughs. On my 5yr old PC there were no graphic glitches, no lag or issues of any kind. Just smooth sailing graphics & a wonderful story. The characters are well-written, even the ones you don't like (looking at you Ashley). As in KOTOR, you can go Light or Dark, good or bad, making Dialog choices to reflect your own personality or how you want Commander Shepard to be perceived. In this game at least, your choices don't really affect the endgame outcome. Your choices DO open up different dialog options and some side quests. It adds fun flavor to the game.I loved finding all the armor & weps scattered around everywhere you go. I liked the hacking puzzle mini-game to open caches. It reminded me of the similar hydraulic puzzle game in Bioshock, which I also loved - both the main game & the mini puzzle game.The DLC is FreeAnother plus for ME1 is the 2 DLC's are free & easily found to download. Some nice people have already linked them in other helpful reviews, or just Google.Common ComplaintsThe MakoSome people complain about the Mako, which if you haven't played the game yet, is a tank-like vehicle you drive when you explore planets. I personally loved driving the crazy thing. Yes, it can be hard to control. Things can get a little wild, but it's really not that hard & once you get the hang of it, driving it literally anywhere is good fun. Mostly though, combat in the thing with its cannon & gun are a literal blast.ExplorationSome people complained about exploring Planets. I personally enjoyed this aspect as well. You only explore at most, 1 planet per system, & exploring each planet only takes a few minutes. Of course, I did really like driving the Mako so any excuse to get in the thing & go nuts was welcome.Game Won't Start, or get a Black or White Screen then game won't startThis did actually happen to me once, but is VERY simple to fix. Find the game's .exe, right click it and select ""Open as Administrator"". If that doesn't work for you, exit Steam, then Right-click Steam to ""Open As"", THEN rt click ME1's .exe to ""Open As"". You should only ever have to do this once, then done. It happened to me at about 5hours in. I was frustrated for about 10 minutes before I found this simple solution. After that I just started the game normally for the rest of my playtime.Other Similar Games I recommend you play:Dragon Age SeriesMass Effect SeriesKOTOR SeriesBioshock Series - Especially 1, 2 & Minerva's Den DLC (Excellent standalone story there)All of those game titles are equal in my esteem. They all provide good value for the price & all have a great story. These games all really draw you in. IMO you just can't go wrong with any of them.Comments About ME2 & 3(*Included here because many people are buying 1&2 here together)While ME1 had only 2 DLC, both of which are now free, ME2 & ME3 both have numerous expensive DLC that never goes on sale. In fact, you can't just ""buy"" & DL DLC for those 2 games. Nope. Even though you can purchase ME2 on Steam, you have to go to Origin to get the DLC for it.Of course some people needlessly complain about Origin, but truthfully, Origin is awesome. It's a very solid Game Management / Store Interface, just as good as Steam for it's own purposes.Anyway, say you buy the ME1/2 pack here on Steam & you want to then buy DLC for the game, which must be done on Origin (or also on social.bioware.com). ME2/Deluxe does come with a tiny bit of DLC, which you can also activate on Origin along with the base game, should you wish to. Simple steps are needed: Install the game in Steam Right-click ME2 in your Steam library and ""View CD Key"" (The game must be installed to have this option) Open Origin. If you didn't already, create an account & log in. At the top left, click on Origin, then click ""Redeem Product Code"" There are 3 codes for ME2. Copy each from the little Steam window, one at a time, then paste to Activate in the Origin app. Find the game in your Origin Library, hover the mouse over it then click the little italicized ""i"", which opens a more detailed Information page.On the Info page you can see a list of all the DLC, much of which is free. However, the good stuff, namely the Content packs which give you more missions & not just fluff cosmetics, cost money.Actually, they cost ""Bioware Points"". Yes, it's lame, but there's no way around it. BC although Bioware makes insanely awesome games, the guy in charge of setting up the sale of DLC is obviously a crackhead. There's simply no other explanation for why they think this is a good idea, as opposed to just being able to put all the desired DLC in your cart then buying it all straight up.Nope. You put what you want in the cart, then when you Checkout......it takes you to buy Bioware Points. 1600 Points sells for $20, 1200/$15 & 800/$10. It's very simple math to figure out which DLC you really want then convert the dollar value to how many Bioware Points you need. It's really very annoying, but it's not that complicated.You're going to need ~$40 for all the ME2 DLC. More for ME3. So, even though you probably only paid $20 for all 3 games (on sale of course), you're going to probably be forking out $80+ more dollars for any content & cosmetics you may want for ME2 & ME3.One last note. I hear that DLC you buy for ME2 (in Origin of course) can also be activated in your Steam copy of the game, though I don't see the need to do it, so I've never tried. I honeslty don't know why you wouldn't just play it in Origin. But it's said to be possible should you wish to try it.Hope this info was helpful. Enjoy! "

												Initial impression:10/10I've held this one aside for too long... ""breathtaking, magnificent and absolutely magnetic in game-play""Time:39h odd for all the secondary content and some serious running in circles. (I found the 'minimum' minerals needed for one assignment, finding more doesn't matter and is never spoken of. otherwise 100%)bad points:Optimisation is very poor, I've turned a lot of the settings down to fix: After an hour or so the game GRINDS TO A HALT and the sounds get chewed up. I'm really not happy with this. (I can run the sequel without problems)This game feels like an ""Elevator Simulator"" ... (please tag product)-I mean SERIOUSLY want to know what it's like to stand in an elevator for 8 or 10 seconds EVERY 2 mins??? ... I've added a user interface command to selectively fast-forward its THAT BAD!The off-roader (MAKO) is pretty twitchy, and uncontrollable like it only wants to point N, NE, E... rather than steer in smooth circles plus it gets thrown about a lot with the exploration (off-world).Exploring other worlds with the Mako is a slow slow frustrating process, again thank goodness for the fast forward.Trying to walk on mountainous terrain: slow, the characters get stuck or simply can't climb anything that looks like a hill, failing that falling through the floor is a serious risk... This has happened rather a lot!There are a few long 'driving' sections which are a complete waste of time/game-play, I think the maps (both off-world and the driving sections) need an overhaul.I think the game moved a little too fast... Shepard seems to overnight gain the keys to the GALAXY... Makes me wonder exactly what did happen on Eden Prime????After 22h.... I'm sadden to say I feel almost ready for the story to wrap up. While the cites are just amazing the exploration off-world has too much obvious ""recycling"" ... It feels like fan-art or a mod!and it just doesn't bloody stop, pointless 'side-mission' after pointless 'side-mission'I few more story missions recouped my enthusiasm for the game, but not a replay yet... but I do have the sequel lined up.Overall I give this game 8.5/10 (recall my non-linear scoring system)			"

												If you haven't already purchased this game, you should go and purchase it right now.  Why? Well there's plenty of reasons. Mass Effect is the beginning to the phenomenal trilogy that revolutionized what it means to give a player choice.  In this game you are Shepard, a Commander in the Alliance Navy. Essentially you learn that the rogue Spectre, the galaxy's highest ranking police essentially, Saren is attempting to bring back the ancient machine race known as the Reapers. While tracking Saren down, Shepard meets many valuable teammates, and loses them, based on how you play.The dialogue in this game is centered mostly around a wheel with several parts, each having different types of dialogue choices. Want to attempt to save all the survivors of an attack? Sure. Want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥y news-reporter in her face? Feel free, it's your choice. Choices, which do carry on the sequels, mind you. While the story and dialogue in the first game entice you to finish it, I do have to admit that the combat is not the best. It's pretty bad, but not too bad that it makes it unbearable to play. But don't worry, the problem is solved in the next game so don't lose hope. There are also a few bugs in the game that annoy you sometimes and also a few graphical errors, but nothing that will keep you from enjoying the masterpiece that is Mass Effect.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would gives Mass Effect a 9.2.

												Mass Effect or ""♥♥♥ Effect"" (or whatever you want to call it) is an amazing 3rd person shooter with lots of action and some tense moments. It also has a really good and deep storyline which gives you different choices each affecting your game, which is my favourite part of the game. It also has an amazing soundtrack with very good 3rd person shooting and movement. All in all, it is an amazing game with a very good storyline and extremely fun gameplay. If you like to blast the ♥♥♥♥ out of aliens while commanding a space ship, you will love this game! it is in my top ten.*tip* Oh, and if you play this game and have amazing speakers, you need to put your volume and bass to the max while going through a mass relay... it will definitely ♥♥♥♥ off your neighbours!

												I was told many years ago to play the Mass Effect series. I picked up the first on a Steam sale and it sat and sat, like these things tend to do. Earlier this year I moved to China and somehow magically that gave me more time to play games, so I started playing through my backlog. Well, Mass Effect was the first one I picked up, and I was not disapointed. I really dig the combination of RPG and third-person shooter. The story was decent, the cast of chracters strong, the voice acting suitable, graphics good enough for an old game. The side quests were a bit of a drag, reusing a lot of the same building layouts and enemy types, but I think that's pretty typical of sidequests, isn't it? I just bought ME2 on the Fall Sale, I'll get around to that right after I finish Dragon Age: Origins, Assassin's Creed, etc.			"

												Mass Effect is an action RPG with some of the most engaging lore I've ever seen in a video game. The combat is a bit bare-bones and almost seems to serve as a vehicle to progress the story at times, but it's worth it to meet new characters and explore exotic locales in your travels. The game is fairly lengthy, but you won't be bored any of the way. A definite buy if you are a sci-fi buff.Don't let the infamy of Mass Effect's sequels mislead you, this game is great.			"

												OK! Seriously, you should get this phenomonal game, it's WELL worth the price tag of $20! It's a 3rd person shooter which features fleshed out characters and long cinematic cutscenes, superbly intertwined to form a vast universe of which no other game has come closer to creating. Its an RPG which means levelling-up, but there's no need to level grind in any area of the game, as levels get you added bonuses which may give you a slight edge. There is also a customisable weapons feature, where you can modify rounds and parts of your guns.Absolutely perfect, except for the driving sequences (which are few and far between), in which you control a car that handles 'like a fat kid on a unicycle'.9.9/10			"

												It is hard to say just how much I love this game (and ME2) This game has everything you could want in an RPG, great story, great people that you come to care about in a small way. The only downside I can think of, is that in order to complete every possible thing you can, you do A LOT of ""Moon Patrol"" type play. Driving a vehicle on alien planets that are pretty much just bare and offer only small changes from the last naked alien planet you were driving on. You can however complete the game without doing EVERY part, and thus can avoid much of this.The best part of this game is how you can import your character into ME2 and the choices you made have an effect on what happens.My suggestion, if you can, is to start up ME2, and make your toon there first (face) get a code and THEN make it in ME1. Otherwise you import your toon and do not get a code, forcing you to start over making a face. Bad if you get attached to your Shepard, which happens easily.I suggest playing as a female Shepard, no, not (just) because of eye candy, but because I honestly feel that the female voice acting is better, and somehow the Shepard character makes more sense as a woman. Plus when you choose the renegade (badass) options, rather than the goodygoody options, it just makes them sound 100% cooler comming from a woman ^_^.			"

												This is one of those games that people seem to either love or just like.  I have never found anyone who hated it.  I am firmly in the ""love"" category.  One of those singleplayer experiences that you will remember forever.  Also, another one of the rare games that I find myself coming back to over and over again.  Like Deus Ex, it is basically a shooter with RPG elements (a TPS instead of an FPS).  Also like Deus Ex, you will find that there are often choices that you face in campaign that will change the gameplay and direction of the rest of the game.  Mass Effect has a perfect balance of choice, action, customizing, freedom, and intrigue to keep you coming back over and over again.			"

												Mass Effect is an amazing game.I first played it years ago when I was a young teenager,  when it was the only ME game out there and it shaped what I expected of gaming from then on. Everything from the atmosphere of the game (the music in particular is something to behold) to the narrative and how it plays out all feels well thought-out and engaging. Some of the plot and side-missions feel like they're plucked from generic sci-fi plotlines and remuddled a bit, but in ME's own way, it owns those factors and you no longer think ""That whole alien queen speaking telepathically to someone has been done before"" and rather think ""Mass Effect did it and did it well."" Your rampage across the galaxy to find this villain who's become a harbinger for the end of life as we know it is fun, and you care about it. Is it the same as every other game where you chase a world-ending villain and his/her catastrophes? Yep. Still fun.While, at this point, the graphics are a little outdated, you occasionally see something jaw dropping in Mass Effect. Smoke drifting diagonally away from lava-coated vistas (that you're DRIVING THROUGH) or a blinding, lilac sun on an alien horizon can, once-in-a-while, take your breath away.The dialogue is meticulously thought-out and well acted (while sometimes sounding a LITTLE dry) and it makes for a great dialogue-system where you know what you choose to say can and will have an effect on the outcome of a mission. It's one of the first games I played that implemented this. Although, while you have choices in ME, all those anastamosing plotlines end you up in the same place. That's not a downside (insert a philosophical quote about inevitability and fate here.) You still feel in control of your character and your future though and that's as much as you can ask for in a game.Gameplay-wise, it's fun, if a little simple. There aren't any puzzling moments (unless you count getting temporarily lost in one of the many hubs.) The game repeats a little when you have to play the same fight a few times to win. That's not a criticism. I'm all for old-school, 'git good' gaming.There are really only three or four main things you'll be doing in this game; shooting at and ducking from a wide variety of clever(ish) enemies, wandering around hub areas looking for answers to life's questions (and convincing people to do things), driving around in the MAKO (amazingly fun for something so simple) to explore planets, and zipping around the galaxy map to go do one of the three aforementioned activities.The combat is FUN and simple, but your two AI counterparts are fairly stupid and don't like to use cover like you do, so will get shot ALOT. Ordering them about feels like you're having to baby two other people whilst not dying in a firefight yourself, but you're Commander Shepherd. You can do it.Wandering back and forth in hub worlds like the Citadel is fun for about five minutes as it's all rather pretty, but eventually, talking to one character then running back to talk to another can get a bit boring and you wind up wanting to leap into some action again, which you can't without finishing your conversational wanderings. And prepare for ALOT of elevators. It's M.E.'s way of loading parts of maps while you're travelling but it takes you out of things a bit and they make you use elevators a whole lot. Boring, sadly.Planet exploring is fun and scenic (did I mention this game is beautiful?) especially in the MAKO. The vehicle is fun to drive around, even if it does have some crazy oversteer, but what do you expect when you're on the surface of some low-G moon driving over dunes and dustscapes? The guns feel powerful but don't bother trying to shoot anything near you as the thing can't aim down and the MAKO is quite tall. Just run over the enemies, dammit.They've put so much effort into fleshing out the characters and histories in this game; of you, your squad mates and beyond and it's all well voice acted. You can feel sparks fly not only between you and your teammates, but you notice which squadmates like each other and where rivalries lie in all the tiny ways. And everybody has their flaws. I love Ashley. No denying it there. I love her go-gettem attitude and her out of nowhere attraction to poetry. But she's also super racist against aliens, although she denies it. These aren't character tropes that come out of nowhere. Ashley's lived a life before you knew her and she's willing to tell you about it if you get to know her, from her gung-ho attitude she cultivated with her sister, to her father's love of poetry handed down to her, to her stoic patriotism towards Earth and Humanity leading to her distrust of alien races. Like her or not, she's human (irony intended); so much more than just a 3D rendered cardboard cutout. Now apply that detail to the dozens of characters, locations and races in Mass Effect. (All except Saren, the main villain of the game, who seems to just be a laughing, evil face with no deep backstory other than a foreboding 'he used to be what you are now.') They've sat down and thought this universe out. We NEED more people to do this when making games. It's probably the biggest selling point of Mass Effect. The galaxy has existed long before you arrived and will go on long after you leave (until ME3 maybe). You can ignore all of it; skip past the expositional dialogue or ignore informative text boxes altogether. But if you want the lore, it's all there and it's beautiful. Plus, they make a GOOD attempt at sciencing everything well. It's what makes for 'science-fiction' rather than 'space-fantasy.'So, to sum up:+This game is STILL beautiful after all these years.+The people and locations are so detailed in lore and history that you can't help but love them all. +You feel in control of yourself in a vast universe where everything seems to be going wrong.+The gameplay is fun and simple, and there's a lot of it.+ Hit the jets on the MAKO while driving up a mountain and try to do a backflip!!!- The gameplay can get a little repetitive.- Slightly generic (but forgivable) plotlines, particularly in some side missions.- Ultimately, you're choices don't change the ultimate outcome of the game, but it shows how small you are in this huge story anyway, and serves to drive home that point. (So, secretly a positive?)The negatives are small and are hugely outweighed by the positives.9/10.*Cue opening thematic music***Doooooo dooo doooooooooo doooooo**			"

Cons: the action is cover based heavy. Pretty good!  Rating: tentacles are not for that!

												Admittedly, when I started playing this game, I didn't have high hopes for it. In a wide galaxy, you play as a human named Shepard, who saves the galaxy and either makes everyone feel bad about how awful they are, or punches everyone in the face. Either way, it's a win/win situation.It's region based open world, which means a lot of the time you will be running around the map trying to find a fast travel spot, but that's the fun part. You get to see a LOT of planets, drive a Mako (probably flip it and be unable to get up a mountain with it), and have aliens join your entourage. As the first game in the franchise, the graphics leave a little to be desired, but it makes up for that with it's combat, storyline, and heartbreaking decisions.All in all, Mass Effect is one of my favorite games, and it's always nice to return to the foundation of the series and make a new Shepard, new choices, and find a new love interest.10/10			"

												The Mass Effect series is not for everyone. But for those of us who enjoy immersive stories that develop relationships and fuel rivalries it may well be to your liking. The first installment is a bit dated now but very (re)playable if the content is enjoyed. Though many decisions may not have incredible impacts on the overall story, their importance will have much to do with how your team perceives you. Your role is to bring together a team of companions on a hunt for a rogue leader of an army seeking to welcome the coming of a powerful force. This series is up there for me with the Elder Scrolls. It's a sci-fi analog for magical fantasy. I've played every one of the three games at least three times through, and I expect I will be starting a fourth before long. For those with RPG inclinations that enjoy the action of a shooter, strategy of a tactical game, the building of relationships and character development, and the roaming of celestial bodies for treasures and trouble I would highly recommend giving this a try.There are some scenes in this game that have stuck with me since!As an aside, should the games side quests be too burdensome but the main story keeps your interest I would recommend focusing on the main quest for its pleasure and enjoy the sequel's polished gameplay!

												Mass Effect is not a sandbox/open-world RPG.  This game is not about shooting things because you can.  This game, is above that.  This game plays a psychological role in your life, depending on whether you allow it to or not.  If it is to be held as an open-world RPG, let the world be the minds of each person you meet, whether for the first time or the last.  Personally, I believe this is more of an RPG than TES or Fallout, as the role you play shows an impact on the world around you, and the decisions you make can decide whether or not you live as a role-model of humanity or a menace that holds importance.

												Great game. Great universe. Above all, I applaud the dialogue wheel options. Questions I was asking myself were listed which made conversations feel natural, and and the game didn't use Charm or Intimidate skill to resolve most of its story. I'm usually set on what choices my character would make in an RPG, but I actually took a step back a few times to think of the consequences of my actions. Really makes me want to play the game a few more times to see how other choices will affect the game.I'm not a huge fan of dynamic leveling in games especially RPGs where progression matters, but I wish they had added it to this game. When they offer you a universe to quest through it's very easy to make mistakes. One of your first quest options when you get your ship is to find Liara between several planets in a system. The first planet I searched ended up being for level 30's while I was only level 8. I kept dying and I thought I was playing the game wrong because I was new and it took almost two hours to finish it before I found out it was a separate optional quest. Romances felt forced. It seemed as if BioWare tried to use romance as a selling point of the game or something. Although it's kinda acceptable with the way your character interacts with everyone but it was still too blunt. I talked to Ashley once about her history and suddenly she's fighting with Liara over who I love more. It only happened because Ashley herself told me to talk to Liara after her mother dies and Liara suddenly falls in love with me. It seemed unnecessary.Other than those small grievances, the game was great and I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd and 3rd games. Amazed it took me this long to play it.			"

												Mass Effect, their is so much to said about this game. Maybe its just the fact that I'm a nerd when it comes to space adventures but this game was wonderful. This is a game where it's really all about the story. The term epic has lost its impact in todays world, but its a word the sits rightly next to this game. Every choice you make has an effect on the universe your trying to protect and its never a dull moment. You'll make friends and enemies, you'll gain allies and betray friends. Its a game that is designed solely to reflect a character who is fighting against the universe for what he believes in, and that philospohical statement is totally up to the player to influence. If you a fan of RPG's then you are doing yourself a grave disservice by missing the beginning sequence of one of the best trilogies on any medium to grace this Earth. I recommend playing this one first,because it may be hard to play if you play 2 or 3 first  with the slight change in gameplay designs.			"

												After playing Mass Effect 2 and 3 I decided to go back and play the first since I never really had the chance to play it. All I have to say is a fantastic game and I wish I had played them in order so I could get the full story instead of being slightly confused during the other two games. The voice acting is well done as well as the story in general. All the side quests kept me busy for hours and while there is some minor bugs and glitch it is a well rounded and solid game. The only complaint I can think of is some interface issue's like the inventory system and the the equipment layouts being time consuming having to delete lots of items when you get full. One other thing is the fact of no auto saving so several times I had to redue entire missions. But, overall this was a solid experience and I loved it.			"

												Mass Effect is a role-playing shooter in a beautifully realized sci-fi world. It was the second-to-last game made by the – legendary – game studio Bioware, before the inevitable quality decline set in, that occurs when a studio is incorporated into the EA roster.Even though Mass Effect was originally an Xbox 360 exclusive, Bioware did not let the limited hardware hinder the game's potential. The game was a visual masterpiece, and the tight movement and combat naturally inherited from the Unreal Engine played wonderfully into the game's core shooting mechanics. The intense firefights with lasers, explosions, and kinetic powers, kept you at the edge of your seat – but it was the expansive universe, and heavy story elements, that kept you from leaving it.If I were to make a parallel between another much beloved piece of media, I'd say that Mass Effect followed the Matrix formula to a T. Much akin to the Matrix trilogy, the first part of the Mass Effect trilogy is an independent piece that stands on its own, it builds up a mysterious and interesting world, and let's you take it in however much you like – but just like the Matrix trilogy, the second and third parts thoroughly disappoint.Why The Matrix trilogy went the way it did is a mystery only the Wachowskis can answer for, but as for Mass Effect, we can clearly point our fingers at EA and say: “They did it!”. Mass Effect, along with Dragon Age: Origins, were Bioware's final games that showed the brilliance of the studio. The games that followed are little more than fan-service on top of bad writing. Let's not even start with The Old Republic.As for Mass Effect, it's one of the most fleshed out worlds ever created. The game hooks you from the start, and won't let go – even when the credits roll. You're gonna wanna go back, and it's recommended, as the game has twists and turns that will only reveal themselves on second or third playthroughs. I recommend this game to anyone and everyone.

I only played ME3 before I played any other Mass Effect games, and this one has proved why its a must have in only 8 hours of play. Pros:-Runs well on my system (i5 3570k GTX 770) its a 6 year old game so I think I'd be right to assume that it should rune fine on most systems -has extensive dialogue options -Interesting plot-Good graphics for the time-Characters are interesting-The ambiance of locations really make the game feel alive! For example, the Citadel. -The gameplay is fun, and not very conky-I find that the cover system is a lot more advanced than the ones that are offered in other AAA games released today, its pretty adaptive. Cons: -The inventory system isn't all that great-Sometimes there's a bit of screen tearing -If you don't like RPGs and don't really care much about lore and are looking for an fps, then this game won't really stand out for you. Overall, its a great game, and it never hurts to pick it up on a sale and try it. You will most probably enjoy it! 9.5/10			"

												When I first heard about Mass Effect, I was quite skeptical on how good it could really be. It is with great honor that I deem my previous thoughts unworthy. Mass Effect is the first of a trilogy, and it holds the rank as being one of the greats. However, tedious inventory management, dated graphics, and planet exploration on a space car that handles badly, are some of the downsides, but put those aside, and there is a great story with great characters awaiting. The story begins with Commander Shepard going on a mission to be tested to be a Spectre, but things go awry, as repected Spectre Saren goes rogue, and things don't go according to plan. Now Shepard must save the galaxy from Saren and his synthetic partners from an ancient evil altogether. Characters are varied, with humans mixed along with some aliens in Commander Shepard's squad. Weapons and armor are numerous, with also mods to put on the armor and weapons. All in all, a great sci-fi RPG that has to be played.			"

												This game is one of the best games, that has ever been created. Drew Karpyshyn wrote a legendary story around the Mass Effect title. The music is amazing and intense, gets you every time. The planets are fascinating, the side missions are fun, and the story once again... I had to play this game twice. First time i didn't complete any side missions, because the story grabbed me, and didn't let go. I wanted to kill that turian so bad, and everytime i got close, something happened, or some major information turned up why the Protheans died. It took me about 11 hours for the first run, but i realised, that this game has so many planets, and many more assignments, and I started all over again. It took more than 20 hours to get to the end this time, but it was totally worth it. Every minute of this is game is a gem. Oh, and if you decide to play this game, then consider every decision you make. They may have severe outcome in ME2 and 3.If you liked this game, and it's story, you will probably like Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic as well, and if you like reading, I would suggest, that the Darth Bane trilogy is the one to read, from Drew Karpyshyn.

												This is the start of something special. Three games and 100 hours later I sat back and thought ""wow - that was a hell of a ride"". A superior game in terms of story telling and character development, combat is a second consideration in my opinion, far outpaced by getting to known the Mass Effect galaxy. If you want an RPG adventure that takes you to some amazing locations with a detailed and intriguing story full of consequences for your actions and a good dosage of humour and sorrow, start your journey here and I don't hink you'll regret it. Be warned that this is not a heavily action packed game - there are long periods of dialogue and some people won't want to be burdened with that. This game *might* not be for the action hungry.			"

												The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Mass Effect is the thoroughness in how well thought out the universe is. The science - what's explained anyway - sounds interesting and plausible (not that I would really know). The concept of labeling any species as ""goodguys"" or ""badguys"" is hard to do since there are handfulls of both good and bad for each one (can't quite call any Hannar ""bad"" but no point nitpicking).The second thing I noticed was the story was really compelling in a way that felt more involving than other games. Think of Mass Effect as a videogame version of a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book. The choices you make can affect huge storylines that span the entire series. Sadly giving examples would spoil them. You can even unlock special actions/comments by raising meters gauging your Paragon and Renegade levels. That said almost every single active side quest was pretty repetitive. Go to planet. Drive on planet. Go in only building on planet. Kill a group of people. Collect loot.The combat is fun. How hard it is almost entirely depends on how well you are equipped. If you and your squad aren't equipped then you'll die sometimes. If they're well equipped most missions will typically be manageable on your first attempts. It might have been easier for me being I was an Engineer on my playthrough though - I destroyed shields and overheated weapons and hacked synthetic enemies to control the crowd a bit. I'm eager to try the game again as another class to see how different it would be.The driving parts with the Mako tank sometimes felt out of place. There were a few times it was major fun to drive. The missions involved obviously intended for the tank - like when driving it in the roofs of the ruins of skyscrapers - were awesome. However almost every planet you go to involves dropping onto the surface with the Mako tank before you drive around to check all the marked spots on a map (technically you could ignore them, but this is the most major way to run acrossed large money and some side-mission peices - which also possibly affect things later in the series). A lot of these worlds were mountainous and would make the Mako tank feel pretty mind numbingly slow on the incline.The inventory system was a mess. You could only hold so many items at a time and these items fill up fast on missions - between times you manage to run into a shop to unload them. This means you end up having to mess with it constantly. It's barely sorted in any way and it randomizes the entire list when you equip anything - making it a pain to find what you look for. It at least only shows items that fit in whatever slot you were trying to equip.The graphics were better than I expected them to be for a 10 year old game. Felt like what I usually have them set at for today's games.This game honestly feels like it should be added to some list of ""Games Every Gamer Ought to Play."" It feels like I'm playing a legend. Might have been because I've heard it's good for about 10 years.			"

												Mass Effect offers a great sci-fi story, but can seem to take a long time to get the story moving (more or less like a good book).  If you favor games that are dialogue/story-heavy and you like sci-fi, Mass Effect shouldn't disapoint. On the other hand, if you're just looking for a straight-up action game where you run from room to room repetitively killing bad guys - with minimal dialogue/story - look elsewhere.			"

Not really like any other game out there.  I love Star Wars but could never get into Knights of the Old Republic (also made by Bioware I believe).  Perhaps if it had been a squaddie third person shooter I might have...*I cannot comment on other games of the series having not quite completed ME2 and not played ME3 at all, but ME2 while enjoyable, didn't have the charm of the first where you get to know the universe of Mass Effect.

												The first two times I played this game, it was on the lowly XBox 360.  The game was already very dated five years ago, or so it seemed.  My third playthrough, and my first on the PC, and I'm seeing stunning visuals and textures that were simply not present on the console version.  The game looks worlds better than I remember.  Controls are better (except for the vehicle), and it helps to have a deep understanding of game mechanics from playing all three multiple times through.  My first playthrough of this game was frustratingly difficult because I didn't understand what type of character I had picked or how to properly use the powers.  I suggest a revisit to this game for anyone who liked this series.  Tip:  If anyone's having trouble running this game, or using Steam overlay while playing, close Steam, and reopen it as Administrator.  The games will inherit the permissions, and everything will work fine. Tip 2:  For anyone having trouble with resolution settings, dig into the Steam game folder for Mass Effect.  There's a launcher in there that lets you change settings, including increasing resolution (for me, 2560 x 1600, but anything 16:10 will need to be set via this launcher to look correct, because the game will only show 16:9 resolutions while looking at in-game settings.)

												So I found Mass Effect on a Steam Sale back in 2013, and purchased it for hardly anything. I'd not read any reviews on the game, so had no idea what to expect once I bought it. I guess, truth be told, I only bought it because it was so cheap and I hoped it could fill a few hours one boring evening after work. Oh, sweet Mass Effect, you didn't disappoint! There aren't many games that I genuinely wish I could remove from my memory, in order to replay again with a fresh set of eyes, but the exceptional story of Mass Effect, combined with the excellent character acting, life and death decisions that you'll face, and Shepherd's development and rise from traumatised soldier to first human Spectre, is a real work of genius. Despite this game being made in 2008 (I think), I only started playing it in March 2014. In total, I've spent around 43 blissfully happy hours running through the main story and side quests (excluding those pesky 'collect so many of this type of tag' quests). I know many games don't age well, but Mass Effect doesn't look old, nor dated, and if I didn't know the age of this game, I'd quite truthfully believe it was new and current.I'll close by saying that anyone not already familiar with Mass Effect should buy it immediately - well, if you like story driven games, of course. If not, just wait for a Steam Sale and buy it when it's virtually free!Now, enough singing the praises of Mass Effect - I was also fortunate enough to buy Mass Effect 2 in the same sale. I just hope it lives up to my lofty expectations and doesn't lose the excitement built from this true classic!			"

												So after all these years of hearing the hype I couldn't curb my curiosity any longer and finally bought Mass Effect and its sequel during the last christmas sales. As of now I've played about three quarters of Mass Effect and though I initially liked it I have to say I'm getting bored with it. Though that may sound negative I still give it a 3 out of 5 because it's a competent game but in my oppinion it doesn't deserve the praise it's getting.If you're familiar with Biowares previous products like Jade Empire and especially Knights Of The Old Republic (KOTOR)  you pretty much know what to expect from Mass Effect. Personally I think Mass Effect was probably meant to be another KOTOR installment, because its entire world could have been replaced with the one from KOTOR without much change, the Jedi order is now Spectre, the Jedi counsil is now The Counsil, the Force powers are now Biotic powers, the Twileks are now Asari, the Mandalorians are now Krogans and the list goes on. Maybe they couldn't secure the Star Wars license, not that it matters (unless you still care about Star Wars) because Bioware did a desent job in creating this new backdrop.Still I think this game shows why Bioware is becoming lazy as it's yet another save the universe story, which is way to similar to KOTOR. Like in Biowares earlier mentioned games, new partymembers join with no effort and are immediately willing to die for the cause. This is not only a missed opportunity for having better sidequests, it also makes their motives in joining meaningless. Mass Effect has some of the worst sidequests I've witnessed, the game has you looking for minerals with your APC by searching entire maps, to laughable moral decissions like wether a (completely bystanding) pregnant woman should have her baby inspected, which really made me question myself what I'm doing with my life by playing Mass Effect. For god's sake, Bioware please don't try to forcefeed me with morally responsible gameplay because you are terrible at it!As for the combat, the enemies are ridiculous bulletsponges which makes your weapons feel completely ineffective, I know this is in a lot of games but when I shoot something I expect it to hurt! As for me I was a bulletsponge too, so I didn't bother to make use of the coversystem much and I played on hard level. The shotgun and the assault rifle were the only usable weapons. I didn't see why I needed the pistol as drawing to a different weapon took as long as your gun to cool down and using the sniperrifle was like a drunk man playing darts. Another extremely annoying thing is that you have to have a high techlevel to be able to open all the containers, which in the end made me play only with Tali and Garrus as teammembers. I also thought that Mass Effect had rather poor graphics even for 2008, the characters have latexfaces, the leveldesign is rather bland and textures are very lowres, on the other hand I did like the music.So if you haven't played KOTOR or Jade Empire you might like Mass Effect more than me, if you have already played those you'll probably gonna need something to keep you awake while playing this game.

The desire to hear new and intriguing dialogue is what kept me immersed is this experience. The combat is medicore and I found the inventory system horrendous, but I just kept wondering what would happen next. The story is just something you have to experience and the choices you get to make are very interesting.

												I've finally got around to beginning the Mass Effect series, and numero uno was a blast. An incredibly immersive, well crafted and believable universe, I found myself happily getting lost in the cultural depth and history created here, of the Geth, Krogan, Turian, Rachni and more. Mass Effect features a wide range of well written, memorable characters (Liara, Wrex, Garrus, Saren, Anderson, Sovereign, could go on), some great clever dialogue and many funny moments, as well as more painful ones as the consequences of your actions play out through the story. One of the best aspects of the game as you progress is simply getting to know your crewmates that you're choosing to work with mission by mission. The music is fantastic, and acts beautifully to create atmosphere and in binding all the various parts of the game together (Vigil, Galaxy Map theme i'm looking at you). For a title released in 2007/2008 the graphics seem to have endured really well, and again fit perfectly with the overall feel of the game. While you're exploring planets be sure to stop and take a few seconds at the summit of a mountain and look out at the vista before you, it's pretty damn gorgeous. Gameplay wise, combat is fun and pretty well balanced, if a little on the easy side. I found biotic abilities particularly enjoyable, there's also a lot of room to customise gear and weapons as you see fit, especially later in the game. Movement is kept varied in space or on land, between exploring new worlds/buildings on foot or by roaming and driving up sheer cliffs in the Mako, hopping around the interior of the Normandy and navigating the Galaxy Map, there is a real and epic sense of scale here (Moon landing included), and the freedom to seek it out.The only slight cons I can think of are somewhat repetitive sidequests; with a bouncy tin tank that has some infamous clunky manoeuvring, and slowpoke elevators (which excellent dialogue and hilarious music almost make up for). The inventory can become a bit tricky to manage. Worlds explored outside of main quests could also be more detailed and fleshed out in terms of content beyond markers on the map. Summary: A brilliant and deeply satisfying narrative experience overall, and I will be coming back for more playthroughs after visiting the next installments of Mass Effect. Just play it.			"

												Let me start off by saying this game is not worth getting if you are not willing to buy the whole trilogy, and sit through a generally clunkey combat system in the first game. By itself I would not recomend this game enless you are willing  to buy the trilogy. Despite the annoyances EA Origin might bring. It is probably a better idea to buy the trilogy from there or other retailers.			"

												Mass Effect is not a sandbox/open-world RPG.  This game is not about shooting things because you can.  This game, is above that.  This game plays a psychological role in your life, depending on whether you allow it to or not.  If it is to be held as an open-world RPG, let the world be the minds of each person you meet, whether for the first time or the last.  Personally, I believe this is more of an RPG than TES or Fallout, as the role you play shows an impact on the world around you, and the decisions you make can decide whether or not you live as a role-model of humanity or a menace that holds importance.

												Great action RPG classic, compelling storyline with many little details to discover and interesting characters. Love the 3rd person perspective and pick-up-and-play controls. The main storyline is a bit short to my liking but the sidequests more than make up for that. Bit glitchy this PC version but installing the HD texture mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/?) makes up for that.At this low price, it's a must-by and a real classic.			"

												Admittedly, when I started playing this game, I didn't have high hopes for it. In a wide galaxy, you play as a human named Shepard, who saves the galaxy and either makes everyone feel bad about how awful they are, or punches everyone in the face. Either way, it's a win/win situation.It's region based open world, which means a lot of the time you will be running around the map trying to find a fast travel spot, but that's the fun part. You get to see a LOT of planets, drive a Mako (probably flip it and be unable to get up a mountain with it), and have aliens join your entourage. As the first game in the franchise, the graphics leave a little to be desired, but it makes up for that with it's combat, storyline, and heartbreaking decisions.All in all, Mass Effect is one of my favorite games, and it's always nice to return to the foundation of the series and make a new Shepard, new choices, and find a new love interest.10/10			"

												Great game. Great universe. Above all, I applaud the dialogue wheel options. Questions I was asking myself were listed which made conversations feel natural, and and the game didn't use Charm or Intimidate skill to resolve most of its story. I'm usually set on what choices my character would make in an RPG, but I actually took a step back a few times to think of the consequences of my actions. Really makes me want to play the game a few more times to see how other choices will affect the game.I'm not a huge fan of dynamic leveling in games especially RPGs where progression matters, but I wish they had added it to this game. When they offer you a universe to quest through it's very easy to make mistakes. One of your first quest options when you get your ship is to find Liara between several planets in a system. The first planet I searched ended up being for level 30's while I was only level 8. I kept dying and I thought I was playing the game wrong because I was new and it took almost two hours to finish it before I found out it was a separate optional quest. Romances felt forced. It seemed as if BioWare tried to use romance as a selling point of the game or something. Although it's kinda acceptable with the way your character interacts with everyone but it was still too blunt. I talked to Ashley once about her history and suddenly she's fighting with Liara over who I love more. It only happened because Ashley herself told me to talk to Liara after her mother dies and Liara suddenly falls in love with me. It seemed unnecessary.Other than those small grievances, the game was great and I'm looking forward to playing the 2nd and 3rd games. Amazed it took me this long to play it.			"

												Mass Effect is a story-rich FPS where you play as Shepard, in a time where the universe is starting to realise the potential of the human species in taking up bigger responsibilities alongside others. Initially under Captain Anderson's command, you are tasked to investigate a distress signal on a planet and during which, you discover that a trusted ally is setting something shady into motion. Throughout the game. you hunt him down and discover the secrets that would have implications on everyone in the known universe.The game focuses strongly on the story, during which you would have to make a number of decisions that although may not change the story itself, they translate to your character stats, and also the (remaining) crew that you fight with. (And also your sex life lmao.) The combat system is pretty good in that you fight in a section of 3, where your crew could provide interesting powers or just be meat shields as you recharge your own powerups. However, some hostiles such as snipers or rocket turrets could possibly one-shot Shepard and you would have to restart from where the game last saved. Hence, I do recommend that you consistently manual save or you might have to replay a large part of the mission.I find the game very well-rounded and enjoyable, back by an interesting story. However, one major set back to the action for me would be the extremely long elevator rides. Seems silly but you would have to play it to understand the agony :)9.5/10			"

												590 hours.  Thats 24 unblinking, unsleeping days with the crew of the Normandy.According to the combined statistics of Steam, and Origin. Over a hundred fourty hours went into the original Mass Effect (four playthroughs), 289 hours into Mass Effect 2 (six playthroughs), and 219 hours into Mass Effect 3 (two compleate playthroughs, many incompleate) and 8 hours into ME4 Andromeda.Commander Shepard and her crew(no one should play as male Shep imho), have done plenty of galaxy saving, and stirring up,  under my control. They fought, robots, clones, politicians, and reporters. They made love to aliens, hate to aliens, and even saved a race from going compleatly extinct!  We laughed, cried, got wasted, and most importantly fought beside one another through thick and thin.They're my friends.OK, they're not really my friends; claiming to be buddies with imaginary characters is a little too geeky even for me. The Mass Effect series is not without its flaws, and some are truly Reaper-sized. But it has gripped me like nothing else in the history of video games, and video games and I go back a pretty long way (but I'll never betoo old for video games)!The Mass Effect universe is that rare thing—a fully-realized science fiction game setting that stands up to the likes of Star Trek or Star Wars. The universe in which the games take place has a rich and complex backstory, and even better, it's not a rich and complex back story that the player has to have info-dumped into his head. This isn't The Old Republic, where you have to read thousands of awful Kevin J. Anderson ""Extended Universe"" novels and have a working knowledge of the seven prime forms of lightsaber combat to get the most out of the game.There's depth in the backstory, but it's not the kind of depth that ever compelled me to memorize the game's codex entries. (Do you really need to know that the ""First Contact War"" between humans and Turians started because humans activated a mass relay in violation of council law and that the war culminated in the siege of Shanxi? No. It's wonderful flavor, but it's not mandatory knowledge.) The world is alive and compellingly real just through dialogue and character actions, without needing endless narration. The first game's opening title crawl essentially says, ""This is the future and aliens are real and you are a space soldier. Go."" That's enough.Instead of a galactic civics lesson, Mass Effect focuses on a human, the forever-first-nameless Commander Shepard, and her fight against the ancient Reapers, an enemy that aims to rid the galaxy of advanced sentient life for a whole bunch of really complicated reasons. That fight is the central focus of all three games, though Shepard's path from soldier to savior twists and turns and doubles back on itself like a demented snake.			"

												Mass Effect stands the test of time.  As you approach the climax of this story, it is like any good book, you simply cannot put it down.  You want to get to the end, whether you have read it before or not, you must finish.  This is a great thing for Mass Effect, its story helps keep it relevant as things like game graphics in more modern games become far superior. With little knowledge about the second game beyond knowing one exists the story of Mass Effect holds up and it resembles that book you can't put down  The gameplay remains as great as the story which intertwined with a more fast paced RPG (when compared to other BioWare RPG releases of similar period). Upon a current play through, the graphics appear aged but that is expected.  If you consider yourself at least moderately okay at understanding how to install items I highly recommend installing the Mass Effect 1 New Texture Updates mod. This updates a gargantuan amount of textures within Mass Effect.  Its not that the graphics weren't good at release, its that with time that is one thing that almost always changes for the better.  This mod allows a facelift, bringing many of the textures in line with the other great material in the game that has stood the test of time.Whether you have played it once (or more) already or you have yet to experience Mass Effect, this game is worthy tof residing on anyone's playlist.

												After bunches of strangers posted to me about Mass Effect, I finally gave it a go. Space-themed game with focus on story? Sounds right up my alley.Right away, I need to criticize the main city of the game, the Citadel. Who in the world designed this mess? I'm not saying it's fugly. In fact, it looks quite nice. It's just that it's poorly laid out and needlessly labyrinthine... especially for a main hub of the game.The shooter aspect was okay. I'm not really a first or third person shooter type, but it worked, and it was playable, so I'll leave it at that.I'm still not exactly sure what the point of scanning planets for resources was. It was hardly crucial to the plot or gameplay. Just a pure homage to Star Control?Replay value is... there. I admit I would have liked to go back and earn some achievements that provide rewards, but the gameplay just wasn't enticing enough to me to warrant a second playthrough. I need to note that playing as a Paragon is boring as hell. I recommend trying out a Renegade to bring out the more interesting conversations.The game has excellent atmosphere, and some pretty interesting alien backstory. I don't quite understand the trend of cramming in bucketloads of irrelevant information in the in-game encyclopedia, but I guess there's an audience for it. The strength of the game I feel is in the character conversations, but those weren't as frequent as I would have liked.Overall I'd have to say I wasn't disappointed. I wasn't blown away by the plot, though that's my fault for setting a high expectation. The main story isn't the kind of story that makes you a better person for having experienced it, but it was interesting nonetheless, especially towards the end.

												Everyone told me that I wouldn't love all of BioWare's games, but there would be one series that resonates with me indefinitely, and that was Mass Effect.ME brought to me a host of things I have never seen in a game before: an active, beautiful storyline full of wonderful lore (via the codex) that not only made me very intimate with what was going on, but also impacted how I played the game. A story where your decisions actually impact how the story progresses.The graphics certainly weren't anything to shake a stick at. They were solid for the time period, but definitely not anything mind blowing. The music was wonderful, with plenty of jams that I enjoyed along the way.The gameplay is what truly stood out to me. I'm not a big fan of shooters, but this game allowed me to appreciate them. Tie in some RPG elements to anything and I'll be willing to give it a go. The vast planets that you can explore and the isolation of some of them really made you feel like you were a part of a universe that was very real.I don't have enough good words to say about ME. If you've never played it at all, I urge you to pick it up and give it a go, no matter what kind of a gamer you classify yourself as.			"

												Bioware really came into their own for me with this one; gone is the tedium of half-rate D&D-style grindfests. Instead, you find yourself at the helm of a shooter action RPG, roaming the galaxy to recruit crew members and fight for survival. While most of the planet sequences were a bit tedious (especially if you feel the need for completion), the game flows smoothly and you'll be hard-pressed to find anything else like it. This game set the bar for a whole new style of cinematic gameplay.			"

The main storyline is a bit short to my liking but the sidequests more than make up for that. Bit glitchy this PC version but installing the HD texture mod (http://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/?) makes up for that.At this low price, it's a must-by and a real classic.			"

												Mass Effect is a story-rich FPS where you play as Shepard, in a time where the universe is starting to realise the potential of the human species in taking up bigger responsibilities alongside others. Initially under Captain Anderson's command, you are tasked to investigate a distress signal on a planet and during which, you discover that a trusted ally is setting something shady into motion. Throughout the game. you hunt him down and discover the secrets that would have implications on everyone in the known universe.The game focuses strongly on the story, during which you would have to make a number of decisions that although may not change the story itself, they translate to your character stats, and also the (remaining) crew that you fight with. (And also your sex life lmao.) The combat system is pretty good in that you fight in a section of 3, where your crew could provide interesting powers or just be meat shields as you recharge your own powerups. However, some hostiles such as snipers or rocket turrets could possibly one-shot Shepard and you would have to restart from where the game last saved. Hence, I do recommend that you consistently manual save or you might have to replay a large part of the mission.I find the game very well-rounded and enjoyable, back by an interesting story. However, one major set back to the action for me would be the extremely long elevator rides. Seems silly but you would have to play it to understand the agony :)9.5/10			"

												When I first heard about Mass Effect, I was quite skeptical on how good it could really be. It is with great honor that I deem my previous thoughts unworthy. Mass Effect is the first of a trilogy, and it holds the rank as being one of the greats. However, tedious inventory management, dated graphics, and planet exploration on a space car that handles badly, are some of the downsides, but put those aside, and there is a great story with great characters awaiting. The story begins with Commander Shepard going on a mission to be tested to be a Spectre, but things go awry, as repected Spectre Saren goes rogue, and things don't go according to plan. Now Shepard must save the galaxy from Saren and his synthetic partners from an ancient evil altogether. Characters are varied, with humans mixed along with some aliens in Commander Shepard's squad. Weapons and armor are numerous, with also mods to put on the armor and weapons. All in all, a great sci-fi RPG that has to be played.			"

												Finally acceding to the recommendations of countless friends I decided to try out Mass Effect. What I found was one of the best games I have played in a long time (perhaps among the best I have ever played). It is a great RPG set in a beautifully crafted universe. Although it can certainly be accused of being quite linear, Mass Effect boasts a gripping story full of truly meaningful choices with lasting consequences. Your words and actions have real meaning and in a universe full of such likeable characters it really provides the player with a depth of immersion rarely attained in a video game and BioWare deserves full credit for attaining this feat of artistic skill.I truly recommend checking out this title if you are a fan of RPGs or interactive choice-based games (i.e. Telltale).

												Mass Effect has a rich and engaging story line with some of the best writing I've seen in a video game. It really feels like you are actively participating in a movie and the actions you take (or don't take) leave an a ""flavorful"" impact on the game's story. The game is worth the purchase of just experiencing the rich story.However, from a gameplay perspective there are some issues. First off all but 1 or 2 squadmates are completely useless, they don't seem to understand how shot blockers work and will just fire in a linear path to the target of choice. The game also relies heavily on quick saves and I suggest you use them because there are a lot of enemies and wepaons that will just flat-out 1 shot you with no warning. The areas you explore and visit, particularly for side quests become very repativie and re-used. You generally are performing the same type of mission but with different enemies or a different story behind why you are shooting things in the face, and a lot of the level designs are copy pasted from previous sides quests.Additionally the ""hacking"" you do is fun for roughly the first 8 seconds, afterwards just spend omni-gel to unlock stuff.  If I were to compare this first game of a AAA series to another I would compare it to how I felt playing Assasins Creed. Both ME1 and AC1 suffer from similar issues, re-used level design, repetative mission (particularly side quests) and clunky controls. That being said both were fun to play and offered about 20-30 hours of solid, fun gameplay. If you have not played the Mass Effect series ME1 will not dissapoint you. Definitely an easy pickup during a sale and well worth your money.8/10+Strong Story+Great voice acting and characters-Repetative side-quests-Poor squad AI-Clunky Controls			"

												I just got this for a couple of bucks, and after not playing it for several years, I got to say that this game has aged quite well in my opinion. For today's standards (regarding graphics and whatnot), it still holds up, and has some pretty good visuals. They do look a bit dated, of course, but for a game originally released in 2007, it looks great. Several people have complained about the Mako (driving) sections, and while the controls are a bit wonky, it still is a good idea, and it's not as bad as most people make it sound. And now,  let's talk about the heart of this game, and what makes it so special; the expanding, interesting, epic and completely immersive story filled with fully fleshed characters that you care about, amazing plot-twists, and an open ended narrative. This is what makes the ME series so special, along with it's bigger-than life space opera setting. Finally, I have to say that this game is a bargain. It offers at least 30 hours of gameplay, and if you explore every little corner and do every single side quests, those 30 hours could easily stretch to 50. Get this thing ASAP.			"

												Mass Effect is one of the greatest RPGs in modern gaming. It definitely makes it in my top 10 games of all time. Even though its combat does seem stale and a bit boring the overall epicness and fun of the story definitely makes up for it. The writing definitely makes you feel like a grand space hero and an important figure. All choices do matter and you regret some of them due to the outcome. The character Customization does fall a little short with very little options to chose from. The game sometimes feels unbalanced and can sometimes be extremely difficult. There are some moments with bad dialogue like during combat with enemy and some NPCs. The overall experience is very grand and very fun but it does have some flaws that are a bit annoying.

Great galaxy to explore with a lot of planets to land on, stations to visit and side quests to do.

This was my first ever dive into the Mass Effect universe and I am mind-blown. The game's excellent mix between RPG and shooter elements makes it a damn worthy one to play. The voice-acting is really good (I played FemShep) and the gameplay/mechanics are very intuitive, I got used to the skills/weapon switching/leveling stuff etc very quickly. Exploring the sidequest planets may have been a tad repetitive after a while, but the main story and background story depth of your squadmates more than make up for this.

(I found the 'minimum' minerals needed for one assignment, finding more doesn't matter and is never spoken of. otherwise 100%)bad points:Optimisation is very poor, I've turned a lot of the settings down to fix: After an hour or so the game GRINDS TO A HALT and the sounds get chewed up. I'm really not happy with this. (I can run the sequel without problems)This game feels like an ""Elevator Simulator"" ... (please tag product)-I mean SERIOUSLY want to know what it's like to stand in an elevator for 8 or 10 seconds EVERY 2 mins??? ... I've added a user interface command to selectively fast-forward its THAT BAD!The off-roader (MAKO) is pretty twitchy, and uncontrollable like it only wants to point N, NE, E... rather than steer in smooth circles plus it gets thrown about a lot with the exploration (off-world).Exploring other worlds with the Mako is a slow slow frustrating process, again thank goodness for the fast forward.Trying to walk on mountainous terrain: slow, the characters get stuck or simply can't climb anything that looks like a hill, failing that falling through the floor is a serious risk... This has happened rather a lot!There are a few long 'driving' sections which are a complete waste of time/game-play, I think the maps (both off-world and the driving sections) need an overhaul.I think the game moved a little too fast... Shepard seems to overnight gain the keys to the GALAXY... Makes me wonder exactly what did happen on Eden Prime????After 22h.... I'm sadden to say I feel almost ready for the story to wrap up. While the cites are just amazing the exploration off-world has too much obvious ""recycling"" ... It feels like fan-art or a mod!and it just doesn't bloody stop, pointless 'side-mission' after pointless 'side-mission'I few more story missions recouped my enthusiasm for the game, but not a replay yet... but I do have the sequel lined up.Overall I give this game 8.5/10 (recall my non-linear scoring system)			"

												I just completed this game for the first time and I must say, this game was cheesy as ♥♥♥♥ but so worth it. I was skeptical at first and found it a little boring, but after the first 10% of the game or so and learning the game's mechanics, it left me wanting more and really enjoying playing as Commander Sheppard, as hilarious as his voice acting actually is. The game leaves so many options available for when you get round to replaying, and I don't know whether to replay the story with different choices, or play the two sequels first.			"

												I just got this for a couple of bucks, and after not playing it for several years, I got to say that this game has aged quite well in my opinion. For today's standards (regarding graphics and whatnot), it still holds up, and has some pretty good visuals. They do look a bit dated, of course, but for a game originally released in 2007, it looks great. Several people have complained about the Mako (driving) sections, and while the controls are a bit wonky, it still is a good idea, and it's not as bad as most people make it sound. And now,  let's talk about the heart of this game, and what makes it so special; the expanding, interesting, epic and completely immersive story filled with fully fleshed characters that you care about, amazing plot-twists, and an open ended narrative. This is what makes the ME series so special, along with it's bigger-than life space opera setting. Finally, I have to say that this game is a bargain. It offers at least 30 hours of gameplay, and if you explore every little corner and do every single side quests, those 30 hours could easily stretch to 50. Get this thing ASAP.			"

												Mass Effect is one of the greatest RPGs in modern gaming. It definitely makes it in my top 10 games of all time. Even though its combat does seem stale and a bit boring the overall epicness and fun of the story definitely makes up for it. The writing definitely makes you feel like a grand space hero and an important figure. All choices do matter and you regret some of them due to the outcome. The character Customization does fall a little short with very little options to chose from. The game sometimes feels unbalanced and can sometimes be extremely difficult. There are some moments with bad dialogue like during combat with enemy and some NPCs. The overall experience is very grand and very fun but it does have some flaws that are a bit annoying. P.S dont even get me started on the elevator rides on the citadel. I give it a 8.2\10 An Amazing and must own game.			"

												It did a great job of introducing me to a whole bunch of new philosophical questions at a very basic level when I was 15-16. A great alternative to pamphlets when you need to talk to your 15 year old kid about ending the life support of some crazy lady's husband.One of the available side-quests (colonist background) was one of my favorite moments in any game I've ever played, and was more touching to me than even something like Undertale was.This game played a small role in shaping the person I am, but it did so by presenting me with options and making me choose from them - not by forcing me to play the galaxy's hero or villain. Highly recommended, although parts of the game do show their age these days.			"

												Mass Effect or ""♥♥♥ Effect"" (or whatever you want to call it) is an amazing 3rd person shooter with lots of action and some tense moments. It also has a really good and deep storyline which gives you different choices each affecting your game, which is my favourite part of the game. It also has an amazing soundtrack with very good 3rd person shooting and movement. All in all, it is an amazing game with a very good storyline and extremely fun gameplay.

												If you haven't already purchased this game, you should go and purchase it right now.  Why? Well there's plenty of reasons. Mass Effect is the beginning to the phenomenal trilogy that revolutionized what it means to give a player choice.  In this game you are Shepard, a Commander in the Alliance Navy. Essentially you learn that the rogue Spectre, the galaxy's highest ranking police essentially, Saren is attempting to bring back the ancient machine race known as the Reapers. While tracking Saren down, Shepard meets many valuable teammates, and loses them, based on how you play.The dialogue in this game is centered mostly around a wheel with several parts, each having different types of dialogue choices. Want to attempt to save all the survivors of an attack? Sure. Want to punch the ♥♥♥♥♥y news-reporter in her face? Feel free, it's your choice. Choices, which do carry on the sequels, mind you. While the story and dialogue in the first game entice you to finish it, I do have to admit that the combat is not the best. It's pretty bad, but not too bad that it makes it unbearable to play. But don't worry, the problem is solved in the next game so don't lose hope. There are also a few bugs in the game that annoy you sometimes and also a few graphical errors, but nothing that will keep you from enjoying the masterpiece that is Mass Effect.On a scale of 1 to 10, I would gives Mass Effect a 9.2.

												Sure, Mass Effect 1 doesn't have the combat system Mass Effect 2 does...But Mass Effect 1 takes the Mass Effect franchise back to its roots, with rich RPG aspects and choices, when you get a paragon or renegade choice in here, it actually matters.Also the story before Mass Effect 2 is worth watching/playing, you get to make key decisions that will change the world of Mass Effect 2 and Mass Effect 3. (Previous choices and actions from Mass Effect 1 may change Mass Effect 3, while it was not obvious if they did in Mass Effect 2).I do recommend buying and trying this fantastic RPG once more made by Bioware!

One of the best modern story-driven RPG's I've ever played. I have no complaints about ME1. I loved every minute of my 2 playthroughs. On my 5yr old PC there were no graphic glitches, no lag or issues of any kind. Just smooth sailing graphics & a wonderful story. The characters are well-written, even the ones you don't like (looking at you Ashley). As in KOTOR, you can go Light or Dark, good or bad, making Dialog choices to reflect your own personality or how you want Commander Shepard to be perceived. In this game at least, your choices don't really affect the endgame outcome. Your choices DO open up different dialog options and some side quests. It adds fun flavor to the game.I loved finding all the armor & weps scattered around everywhere you go. I liked the hacking puzzle mini-game to open caches. It reminded me of the similar hydraulic puzzle game in Bioshock, which I also loved - both the main game & the mini puzzle game.The DLC is FreeAnother plus for ME1 is the 2 DLC's are free & easily found to download. Some nice people have already linked them in other helpful reviews, or just Google.Common ComplaintsThe MakoSome people complain about the Mako, which if you haven't played the game yet, is a tank-like vehicle you drive when you explore planets. I personally loved driving the crazy thing. Yes, it can be hard to control. Things can get a little wild, but it's really not that hard & once you get the hang of it, driving it literally anywhere is good fun. Mostly though, combat in the thing with its cannon & gun are a literal blast.ExplorationSome people complained about exploring Planets. I personally enjoyed this aspect as well. You only explore at most, 1 planet per system, & exploring each planet only takes a few minutes. Of course, I did really like driving the Mako so any excuse to get in the thing & go nuts was welcome.Game Won't Start, or get a Black or White Screen then game won't startThis did actually happen to me once, but is VERY simple to fix. Find the game's .exe, right click it and select ""Open as Administrator"". If that doesn't work for you, exit Steam, then Right-click Steam to ""Open As"", THEN rt click ME1's .exe to ""Open As"". You should only ever have to do this once, then done. It happened to me at about 5hours in. I was frustrated for about 10 minutes before I found this simple solution. After that I just started the game normally for the rest of my playtime.Other Similar Games I recommend you play:Dragon Age SeriesMass Effect SeriesKOTOR SeriesBioshock Series - Especially 1, 2 & Minerva's Den DLC (Excellent standalone story there)All of those game titles are equal in my esteem. They all provide good value for the price & all have a great story. These games all really draw you in. IMO you just can't go wrong with any of them.Comments About ME2 & 3(*Included here because many people are buying 1&2 here together)While ME1 had only 2 DLC, both of which are now free, ME2 & ME3 both have numerous expensive DLC that never goes on sale. In fact, you can't just ""buy"" & DL DLC for those 2 games. Nope. Even though you can purchase ME2 on Steam, you have to go to Origin to get the DLC for it.Of course some people needlessly complain about Origin, but truthfully, Origin is awesome. It's a very solid Game Management / Store Interface, just as good as Steam for it's own purposes.Anyway, say you buy the ME1/2 pack here on Steam & you want to then buy DLC for the game, which must be done on Origin (or also on social.bioware.com). ME2/Deluxe does come with a tiny bit of DLC, which you can also activate on Origin along with the base game, should you wish to. Simple steps are needed: Install the game in Steam Right-click ME2 in your Steam library and ""View CD Key"" (The game must be installed to have this option) Open Origin. If you didn't already, create an account & log in. At the top left, click on Origin, then click ""Redeem Product Code"" There are 3 codes for ME2. Copy each from the little Steam window, one at a time, then paste to Activate in the Origin app. Find the game in your Origin Library, hover the mouse over it then click the little italicized ""i"", which opens a more detailed Information page.On the Info page you can see a list of all the DLC, much of which is free. However, the good stuff, namely the Content packs which give you more missions & not just fluff cosmetics, cost money.Actually, they cost ""Bioware Points"". Yes, it's lame, but there's no way around it. BC although Bioware makes insanely awesome games, the guy in charge of setting up the sale of DLC is obviously a crackhead. There's simply no other explanation for why they think this is a good idea, as opposed to just being able to put all the desired DLC in your cart then buying it all straight up.Nope. You put what you want in the cart, then when you Checkout......it takes you to buy Bioware Points. 1600 Points sells for $20, 1200/$15 & 800/$10. It's very simple math to figure out which DLC you really want then convert the dollar value to how many Bioware Points you need. It's really very annoying, but it's not that complicated.You're going to need ~$40 for all the ME2 DLC. More for ME3. So, even though you probably only paid $20 for all 3 games (on sale of course), you're going to probably be forking out $80+ more dollars for any content & cosmetics you may want for ME2 & ME3.One last note. I hear that DLC you buy for ME2 (in Origin of course) can also be activated in your Steam copy of the game, though I don't see the need to do it, so I've never tried. I honeslty don't know why you wouldn't just play it in Origin. But it's said to be possible should you wish to try it.Hope this info was helpful. Enjoy! "

												The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Mass Effect is the thoroughness in how well thought out the universe is. The science - what's explained anyway - sounds interesting and plausible (not that I would really know). The concept of labeling any species as ""goodguys"" or ""badguys"" is hard to do since there are handfulls of both good and bad for each one (can't quite call any Hannar ""bad"" but no point nitpicking).The second thing I noticed was the story was really compelling in a way that felt more involving than other games. Think of Mass Effect as a videogame version of a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" book. The choices you make can affect huge storylines that span the entire series. Sadly giving examples would spoil them. You can even unlock special actions/comments by raising meters gauging your Paragon and Renegade levels. That said almost every single active side quest was pretty repetitive. Go to planet. Drive on planet. Go in only building on planet. Kill a group of people. Collect loot.The combat is fun. How hard it is almost entirely depends on how well you are equipped. If you and your squad aren't equipped then you'll die sometimes. If they're well equipped most missions will typically be manageable on your first attempts. It might have been easier for me being I was an Engineer on my playthrough though - I destroyed shields and overheated weapons and hacked synthetic enemies to control the crowd a bit. I'm eager to try the game again as another class to see how different it would be.The driving parts with the Mako tank sometimes felt out of place. There were a few times it was major fun to drive. The missions involved obviously intended for the tank - like when driving it in the roofs of the ruins of skyscrapers - were awesome. However almost every planet you go to involves dropping onto the surface with the Mako tank before you drive around to check all the marked spots on a map (technically you could ignore them, but this is the most major way to run acrossed large money and some side-mission peices - which also possibly affect things later in the series). A lot of these worlds were mountainous and would make the Mako tank feel pretty mind numbingly slow on the incline.The inventory system was a mess. You could only hold so many items at a time and these items fill up fast on missions - between times you manage to run into a shop to unload them. This means you end up having to mess with it constantly. It's barely sorted in any way and it randomizes the entire list when you equip anything - making it a pain to find what you look for. It at least only shows items that fit in whatever slot you were trying to equip.The graphics were better than I expected them to be for a 10 year old game. Felt like what I usually have them set at for today's games.This game honestly feels like it should be added to some list of ""Games Every Gamer Ought to Play."" It feels like I'm playing a legend. Might have been because I've heard it's good for about 10 years.			"

												The first two times I played this game, it was on the lowly XBox 360.  The game was already very dated five years ago, or so it seemed.  My third playthrough, and my first on the PC, and I'm seeing stunning visuals and textures that were simply not present on the console version.  The game looks worlds better than I remember.  Controls are better (except for the vehicle), and it helps to have a deep understanding of game mechanics from playing all three multiple times through.  My first playthrough of this game was frustratingly difficult because I didn't understand what type of character I had picked or how to properly use the powers.  I suggest a revisit to this game for anyone who liked this series.  Tip:  If anyone's having trouble running this game, or using Steam overlay while playing, close Steam, and reopen it as Administrator.  The games will inherit the permissions, and everything will work fine. Tip 2:  For anyone having trouble with resolution settings, dig into the Steam game folder for Mass Effect.  There's a launcher in there that lets you change settings, including increasing resolution (for me, 2560 x 1600, but anything 16:10 will need to be set via this launcher to look correct, because the game will only show 16:9 resolutions while looking at in-game settings.)

												The first part of one of the most immersive and fascinating video game series' of all time. The music alone deserves a playthrough, not to mention the amazing and complex storyline and the many interesting details that can be found throughout the insanely well-crafted universe. I will never forget Chora's Den or Flux (Shepard-dance, anyone?), the heart-wrenching decisions I had to make, the friends I have found (Anderson! Garrus! Wrex!), or the romances I've had (Ashley! Liara!), and despite the evident weaknesses the game has, when it comes to game mechanics for example, it is still one of my all-time favorites, surpassing even the following games, ME2 and ME3, in some areas. Making different decisions does not only change the course of the story, so that you discover new witty and interesting dialogs every time you play through the game (Shepard: ""I'm p*ssed off. When I get p*ssed off, I shoot things."", discovered on my 3rd playthrough), they do also have an effect on the two successors. My suggestions is this: Get the game, make your OWN Shepard (not the standard one!) and just f*cking enjoy! Take your time, however: This game is not something for ADS kiddies who usually play CoD or Battlefield. It is like a good book, except for all the additional benefits the medium video game has to offer. A gem of a game for connoisseurs.			"

												Mass Effect offers a great sci-fi story, but can seem to take a long time to get the story moving (more or less like a good book).  If you favor games that are dialogue/story-heavy and you like sci-fi, Mass Effect shouldn't disapoint. On the other hand, if you're just looking for a straight-up action game where you run from room to room repetitively killing bad guys - with minimal dialogue/story - look elsewhere.			"

												""As Commander Shepard, you lead an elite squad on a heroic, action-packed adventure throughout the galaxy.""My very first experience with Mass Effect was when I saw the cover of the third game on a shelf when browsing around a shop. I have heard good things on the internet about the franchise and since I couldn't find any copies of the games, I brought this one. When I got home I started up my PS3 and played the game. Obviously I felt a bit lost at first and knew that some things were missing because I hadn't played the previous games, but the experience sure was fun. I then purchased the other two games and a bit of DLC as time went by from the PlayStation Store and played the entire franchise from start to finish. It quickly became one of my favorite gaming franchises. Recetly I bought Mass Effect 1 for PC since it was on sale. I managed to get the two DLCs for free and installed a mod that enchanced the game's overall quality and textures. The perfomance was vastly improved when compared to the console. Instead of the game being locked on 30FPS, I now get around 80 to 130 frames-per-second. So, is this game so good that it was worth a re-purchase? Yes, it is. It's been months since I touched the series and being back sure feels good. Unlike last time, I kind of rushed in order to get to the third game, but this time around I'm going slow. I've already spent forty hours in this and I'm still not finished. I'm taking my time to explore every corner and quest that the game provides. Pros:- You can create your own Shepard and modify his or hers facial features, background and even select a Class. Vanguard is my favorite, but it all depends on taste after all.- The story is great. One of the best out there. No wonder this game was a hit back on 2007. - You control your character at 100%; you make your own choices and the story is tailored by how you play. Most of your choices lead to consequences that will impact future games. - You will either love or hate your companions. They are great characters and will surely provide you aid in combat. Each one of them has a different role, so be sure to think before heading out.- It has one of the best voice-acting out there. Jennifer Hale is the best.- Being a 2007 most computers and laptops nowadays can handle this game with ease and it still looks amazing ten years later. BioWare sure knew what they were doing with their engine back then.- The Mako can be fun and there's some variety put into the side-quests in terms of looks and feel.- This game only came to be thanks to KOTOR, so obviously you will find some nice Star Wars references here and there. Besides those, there are also some other Easter Eggs and even references to older games and subjects. - The RPG and Shooter elements were combined rather nicely. You can select all sorts of gear for your character and companions.- Great soundtrack.- And many others...Cons:- For some people the game might feel outdated... for whatever reason. Most people prefer ME2 and ME3. I personally find all of them good at their own pace.- It's a bit hard to create a good-looking Shepard... but not as hard as some other BioWare games that's for sure.- If careless, you will be blocked from certain choices that will eventually ruin your experience.- The AI isn't amazing. Some enemies will sometimes stare at the walls and your companions will sometimes shoot at you rather than the enemies themselves.- Some people can find the Mako a bore due to its clunky physics and the familiar feeling of most side-quests. There is also a lack of variety in music choice when it comes to these quests.- Some backtracking during missions.- Sometimes the DLC can can be removed by itself. Be sure to save a copy of their installers and a copy of your save files somewhere. However, your computer might consider these save files as malware.- Little variety put into the DLCs. Pinnacle Station feels like it was done by a completely different team.- Even though you have several dialogue choices, some of them can lead to the exact same outcome.- And others.WARNING: The Steam version DOES NOT include any of the DLC. You can easily find it for free just by browsing it on Google with no issues.			"

												THE most comprehensive RPG which takes your actions and uses them to influence YOUR story. Still has impressive visuals too!			"

												Part of my all time favorite series (seriously why did everyone hate the ending of ME3 so much?) Mass Effect 1 is a great game with an awesome beginning to the grand story of, well, Mass Effect.Just be warned. Quicksave often, since the only autosaves are 4 hours apart, and the game might bore newcomers until they reach Sovereign in one of the later planets. If you aren't hooked after that then Gone Home might be the game for you.			"
